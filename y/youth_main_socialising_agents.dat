40|$|Traditionally {{the family}} {{was seen as the}} <b>main</b> <b>socialising</b> <b>agent.</b> The child learned rules and {{behaviour}} patterns within the family environment. Nowadays, despite developing {{an important role in the}} socialisation process, it is complemented by other institutions. At three years of age, or even less, a child enters upon a new social life in a different context-the kindergarten. The child interacts with other children of the same age, develops communicational skills and knowledge, and develops her/him self as an individual and social human being. It is in this period of socialisation that she/he develops a growing interest in television. Like family and kindergarten, television contributes and has an active intervention in the child socialisation process. It is an important learning source and a special form of contact with the world. As Dorr (1986) concluded, we believe that children are a special audience. They have cognitive and communicational skills. They should be conceived as having an active role in the construction and interpretation of messages that are received. But they can not prescind from mediation processes developed by their parents. Research has exceeded the model of the immediate media effects but it remains present in the mass media discourse. Television is frequently accused of all the evil matters of the world: the ruin of family dialogue and life, the suggestion of violent behaviour in younger generations, an obstacle to the occurrence of other activities seen as more important and fruitful, the development of passive attitudes and behaviour, etc. We agree that the media, especially television, has a strong influence in consumers. But we also believe that this influence can be understood within a larger and more complex framework of lifestyles and social relations of individuals and groups. Nowadays, research has as a starting point that which Schramm (1961) believed in: as important as questioning ourselves about television's influence on people, is questioning how they use it...|$|R

This makes language at least as important, and often more important than bodily practice in our understanding of the world. The notion of a disembodied <b>socialised</b> <b>agent</b> leads in the direction of interesting questions while the notion of an embodied but unsocialised human actor is unimaginable.

Indeed, some brands have fanatical followers whose {{commitment to the}} brand transcends common levels of loyalty often depicted in the literature. Although this intense form of loyalty has received little empirical attention in consumer research, it is a concept well established particularly within the sports sociology and social psychology contexts. This exploratory paper proposes that an understanding of consumer fanaticism will bring fresh insights {{to the concept of}} loyalty, including the drivers and transitions between stages leading to the ultimate loyalty state. We explore literature associated with fanaticism and fan cultures to reveal that fanaticism is closely related to strong, intense, extreme, and emotionally driven loyalty. Preliminary insights have shown that fanaticism can be developed via a socialisation process or encouraged by <b>socialising</b> <b>agents,</b> and that it is driven by identification, self-esteem maintenance, attachment, personal importance, a sacralisation process, and various forms of desir...|$|R

If there is a clear understanding of how financial socialisation takes place and what informs financial behaviours, government and business can focus their efforts to ensure that South Africans have an increased financial capability. This will improve financial literacy and lead to increased financial security which is a necessity for overall wellness. A hypothetical model (Figure 2) was created from concepts that emerged during the literature review. An online questionnaire was completed by 300 participants in the financial services sector, examining factors which influenced the financial literacy and financial security of individuals. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify the components while Chi-square tests and Spearman s Rho was used to analyse the data for associations. Different factors influence financial literacy and financial security. This study did not find parents to be a significant influencer of financial socialising. Peers, friends and work colleagues were also not found to be a significant influencer of financial literacy and had a negative influence on financial security. Certain components of multimedia such as reading books were found to influence an individual s level of financial literacy and education, including formal financial education influenced the level of financial security. Demographic factors such as race and income also influence financial literacy and security.

This dissertation investigated the consumer buying behaviour of young teenagers between the ages of 12 to 15 years old and identified to what degree different <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> such as peers, parents and the mass media have on influencing these young people's behaviours and attitudes. The research was undertaken in post primary schools in the region of Dundalk Co. Louth. A focus group and questionnaire were carried out with students from first and second year classes.

40|$|How might European higher {{education}} {{contribute to the}} promotion and development of European citizenship? In this article, the author addresses this question through a critical discussion of the notions of ‘active citizenship’ and ‘civic competence’, which {{play a central role}} in current policy and research on the role of education in the development of European citizenship. The author argues that there is a tendency within the idea of ‘active citizenship’ to depoliticise the very idea of citizenship because it is based upon a consensus notion of democracy and a functionalist understanding of citizenship and the formation of citizens. The author also argues that the idea of civic competence reduces civic learning and political education to a form of socialisation which undermines rather than supports political agency. For these reasons, the author argues that European {{higher education}} should not aim to become a <b>socialising</b> <b>agent</b> for the production of the competent active citizen but should seek to support modes of political action and civic learning that embody a commitment to a more critical and more political form of European citizenship than what is envisaged in the ideas of ‘active citizenship’ and ‘civic competence’...|$|R

Industry figures show that this trend strongly reflects high as well as low involvement household-purchase decisions. Reasons for the upswing are unclear. A cogent explanation is that increases in divorce, separation, and single households mean that more consumers seek companionship and/or a sense of family via pet ownership. Other explanations warrant additional investigation. Do absent parents substitute pets as <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> for their children? Are modern parents susceptible to the Paris-Hilton effect? What {{is the role of}} pets in the psychological and physical health of the elderly? Do consumers use pets to enact multiple identities and resolve identify conflicts? An important question looms large. Why do business researchers neglect the examination of animals as consumer products and co-producers of leisure activities?

40|$|This paper interprets Bernard Williams's {{claim that}} all {{practical}} reasons {{must meet the}} internal reasons constraint. It is argued that this constraint is independent of any substantive Humean claims about reasons and its rationale is a content scepticism about the capacity of pure reason to supply reasons for action. Conversely, the argument {{can be interpreted as}} about what we are entitled to assume, for free, about the very idea of a practically rational agent. Hooker's and Korsgaard's critiques of Williams are considered and rejected as not considering sufficiently the prior commitment to content scepticism. The dispute between Williams and McDowell is separately discussed and identified in terms of psychologism, which Williams was happy to adopt for practical reasons, McDowell not, and whether appeal to the content of the reasons of a phronimos gives any purchase on the contents of an agent's reasons. It is argued that it does not and that McDowell's account of external reasons involves illegitimate idealisation. The final sections attempt a positive reconciliation of the internal reasons account with the motivation for external reasons, namely, securing practical objecitivy {{in the form of a}} commitment to impartiality. Impartiality is given a contractualist interpretation in the limited sense that <b>socialised</b> <b>agents</b> have a central disposition to hold those reasons that are defensible to reasonable interlocutors, but this is not a substantive constraint on their content...|$|R

According to Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory different <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> at multiple levels can contribute to optimal child development. The aim of this explorative baseline research was therefore to provide the Ministry of Education with descriptive information about whether or not child rearing practices in the pedagogical climate at micro and meso level contribute to the macroeconomic goal. Because constructivist classrooms, authoritative child rearing approaches and a robust educative and pedagogical civil society are prerequisites for optimal child development, this mix-method study researched these aspects in five districts while making a distinction between advantaged and disadvantaged communities. Data was collected from a sample of headmasters (n = 5), teachers (n = 88), parents (n = 268) and children aged eight to ten (n = 155). Findings showed that the climate did not fully contribute to optimal child development because of a pedagogical mismatch between child rearing approaches at home and at school. This was especially the case amongst the disadvantaged communities, where the civil society was eve less robust than in advantaged communities. This indicated that change is required to provide children with a pedagogical climate in which they can optimally develop into critical citizens that can adapt to their changing society, because of the transition into a knowledge based economy...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} sport socialisation often focussed on {{the barriers}} for youngsters from lower socio-economic status (SES) families {{to participate in}} sport. In the present study, the socialisation into sports of young adolescents from lower SES families that do participate in organised sports was investigated. A total of 9 girls and 12 boys from lower SES families (18 Dutch; three foreign ethnic background) from one city in the Netherlands who participated in organised sport were interviewed. Although multiple agents may be of influence on the socialisation process, this {{study was limited to}} the family, school and peers as potential socialising contexts. Drawing on the theoretical work of Bourdieu and Bernstein, parents were found to be the main influencers of the sports habitus of these young adolescents. The school context appeared to have no influence on their sport socialisation. Peers were found to have an influence on the choice for a specific type of sport. This interplay between socialising contexts for young adolescents from lower SES families is similar to the sport socialisation of youngsters from higher SES families. Therefore, it is suggested that if sport socialisation takes place, then the role of SES is less pronounced than often assumed. Moreover, there seem to be differences in the relative importance of the socialising contexts with younger children with a lower SES. Therefore, it is hypothesised that the relative importance of <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> changes over time. Although the findings may be limited to the specific sample of this study, they provide hypotheses that challenge the often-presumed importance of SES if sport socialisation takes place...|$|R

To this end, {{the concept of}} normative sexual development {{was used as an}} organising framework. Background Sexual health {{can be seen as a}} developmental task for all children, adolescents and adults. Core autism features are related with skills central to sexual development and functioning. More insight in sexual development in people with autism is relevant for education, support and interventions by parents and professionals in somatic and mental health care. Methods A comprehensive search of scientific online databases and reference lists was conducted. Publications based on qualitative and quantitative research, including case studies, were selected. Results Fifty-five articles and reports were selected and discussed. Information was grouped according to three domains: sexual behaviour, sexual selfhood and sexual socialisation. Conclusion Sexual development is a part of life for people with autism of all developmental levels and is generally understudied in this population. Most information was available on behavioural aspects and experiences of <b>socialising</b> <b>agents,</b> such as parents and professionals. Developmental processes and the relation between sexual behaviour, selfhood and socialisation remained unclear. Relevance to clinical practice Nurses working in schools, institutions and general health care support children, adolescents and adults with autism and advice their families, teachers, other educators and caregivers on sexuality issues.

40|$|Children's social {{cognitive}} understanding {{has been}} found {{to play a major role}} in shaping their social engagement and behaviour. It has been assumed that this understanding of the mind and emotion of others shapes the ways in which children go on to understand their own moral identity: their proclivities, sensitivities and responses to moral acts, but there appears to be a gap between the ways in which children talk about other people and the ways in which they talk about themselves. It was hypothesised that it is social engagement that shapes moral identity in young children rather than their understanding of other people. A longitudinal study of 115 six to seven year olds was run over two years examining these three features, self concept, socialisation and social cognition and their interactions over time. The study utilised child self-report measures and the validity and usefulness of such tools was also examined. It was found that as children progress through the first years of primary school their knowledge of the social world and their <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> is indeed related to behaviour concurrently and predicts positive social engagement one year later. However, there was no relationship found between social cognitive understanding and a child's developing moral self concept. It was found, in opposition with the traditional models of moral self concept, that children's social engagement at six shaped their moral self concept at seven rather than vice versa. These findings suggest that while children's skills in the domain of social cognition shape their pro-social behaviours this social engagement is influencing and shaping the ways in which these children view themselves as moral agents which may have important implications for children’s ongoing wellbeing...|$|R
40|$|The visits {{people make}} to {{national}} parks are products of their various social characteristics, early and current experiences, motivations, perceptions, and attitudes. These visits, however, also occur within a broader social context, the identification of which is an important feature in terms of understanding national park use. This study examines contemporary social dimensions of national park use, and assesses {{the degree to which}} the relationship between preservation and use has altered since a study of the same location was undertaken by Simmons in 1980. Through the use of both quantitative and qualitative techniques, the research explores the characteristics, motivations, perceptions, attitudes and activities of summertime visitors to Arthur's Pass National Park in 1994. The results of the research show that a number of dimensions have remained stable over time. Consistent with the findings of Simmons (1980), visitors to Arthur's Pass National Park are young, predominantly male, well-educated, and from professional occupational backgrounds. Additionally, family and friends continue to act as strong <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> which direct and shape Park use. Notable among the studies' differences include: an increased proportion of overseas visitors; a reduction in the length of visit; and a diversification and intensification of recreational use. This thesis contends that, owing to a diverse set of technological and socio-political developments, the use of Arthur's Pass National Park is in a process of transition. Elements of this have important implications for the management paradox concerning preservation and use. New styles of recreation, and increasing numbers of overseas visitors can be seen as challenges to the traditional conceptions of national parks, and will require careful management in order to conserve the opportunities and experiences they offer...|$|R

Politics is defined broadly as {{the perception of}} patterns of human relationships, incorporating socio-economic concepts. Two elements of socialisation are identified which inform both theory and research design. First, political socialisation content is explored, operationalised in terms of political attitudes. Second, political socialisation process is explored, operationalised in terms of history of political exploration {{and the making of}} political commitments (derived from concepts of adolescent identity development described by Erikson and Marcia). The role of <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> is discussed, the study focussing of the role of school experience in political socialisation. An empirical study is reported which explored the role of school experience in political socialisation, operationalised in a comparison of girls attending private and state sector schools. Questionnaires were completed by 181 girls aged 15 - 18 in the two types of school. Individual interviews were conducted with 127 of this group (67 private, 60 state) from comparable social backgrounds. The aim was to compare girls matched for family background but experiencing different types of educational structure. The interviews explored attitudes to a range of political and socio-economic phenomena (the content of political socialisation), and history of political exploration and commitment (the process of political socialisation). The process dimension was based on the identity categories of achievement, foreclosure, moratorium and diffusion described by Marcia. Significant differences between the two school samples are reported for both the content and process of political socialisation. Factors in the school experience which might lead to these differences are described.

40|$|Purpose To meet stated waste {{reduction}} goals, the UK government via Defra (Department for environment, farming and rural affairs) {{is attempting to}} reduce household mainstream waste. One approach is to encourage children in environmentally-friendly behaviour. We take this {{as a starting point}} to document the environmental content of dedicated children’s channels, and to consider whether television could act as an ecological <b>socialising</b> <b>agent</b> for {{waste reduction}} behaviour. Approach Our content analysis of four children’s television channels over 168 hours recorded {{the extent to which the}} waste hierarchy (reduce, reuse and recycling behaviour) was included in all forms of broadcast output: programmes, advertisements, trailers, sponsorship and idents. Outcomes We found 6, 921 instances of waste activity, distributed across 666 broadcasts which included eleven identifiable materials, such as plastic and cardboard. Whilst reuse behaviour was well represented (5, 751), instances of reduction (406) and recycling were relatively infrequent (275) and there were 489 instances of materials being placed in refuse bins. Contribution By placing children’s television on the environmental agenda, we raise the possibility of channels examining their own broadcast material to assess its environmental content, and how that content is distributed across the waste hierarchy and in relation to broadcast output. Further research Our case study was based on four channels and within the specific context of waste. There are many more channels (e. g. available on cable/satellite) and more environmental behaviours that can be examined with a view to meeting other targets – for example those connected to climate change such as travel, domestic energy consumption, and food choices, all of which are included on children’s television. The response of the intended audience to the environmental content can be assessed. Nuffield Foundation (grant reference: SGS/ 38663...|$|R

40|$|Grounded in the {{qualitative}} tradition, {{the aim of}} this study was to explore how principals perceive the processes governing, tensions inherent in and consequences, of the secularisation of public schools in South Africa, against the backdrop of the old apartheid system. Principals are key informants who bridge the gap between the political arena and the individuals who are affected at the implementation level and therefore provide a valuable lens through which the process of secularisation can be explored. Eight principals, who had been in this position of leadership for at least eight years, participated in semi-structured interviews, which were then subjected to a thematic content analysis. Principals perceived the process as characterised by a lack of consultation and transparency, with no clear guidelines provided to them and no follow-through from the education ministry. They also perceived tensions in the manner in which principals continued to embrace Christian principles in the management of their schools. Tolerance and respect of different religions were identified as positive outcomes of secularisation but these were perceived to have been offset by the negative consequences of a moral collapse, an ungovernable school and a loss of identity among the students. Through exploring the nature of key <b>socialising</b> <b>agents,</b> in the educational arena, it became evident that the participants often conceptualised themselves as martyrs and perceived parents as morally neglectful. The changing role of the school, as an agent of religious education, was also explored. Overall, all the principals strongly agreed that despite the good intentions of the government in fostering a democratic society, the impact of secularisation had resulted in some unintended effects, including a negative impact on the moral development of the students. In sum they perceived that the negative consequences of secularisation outweighed the promises of the government’s overall secularisation vision...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{begins by}} arguing {{that there is a}} real absence of an {{empirical}} understanding of men in British 'gender based sociology'. This is established by exploring current debate within gender based sociology and by examining {{the extent to which the}} feminist critique of sociology has marginalised men in gender based research.;The thesis then explores how men's lives and work are linked by examining gender theory and feminism. It is argued and concluded that men's identification with work has become a function of a social sex-ordered division resulting from both capitalist and patriarchal relationships. Such relationships are established and supported by men (actively as well as passively) and <b>socialising</b> <b>agents</b> such as family, church, state, professions, guilds and unions develop to protect men's position in paid public work.;Men's recent experiences of the British labour market are then considered. It is concluded that two main trends are important in male employment. They are the general decline in male labour market participation and the overall decline in male full-time employment; and second, the growth in male non-standard employment forms such as part-time working.;Finally, an empirical account of men's employment is provided by offering a secondary analysis of the National Child Development Study (1991). The data suggest that men's lives are far more complex (and less homogeneous) than originally thought. For example, men do experience different working forms, they do experience differing levels of education and training, men do have varied attitudes towards work and home, and experience health differently when compared to other men.;The thesis concludes that men's experiences of work and employment need to be documented and brought back to the attention of the sociological researchers.
