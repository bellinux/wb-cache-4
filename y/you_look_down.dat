A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E

2500|$|I will {{be honest}} and not flatter you. [...] On the battlefield, when two armies were facing off with each other, I am {{not as good as}} you at yelling and {{screaming}} to cause the enemy to be fearful and submissive. [...] However, as far as gathering the capable men of the earth and letting them serve properly in their capacity, you are not as good as I. [...] Why do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on the knowledgeable people just based on your high rank? ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was another}} vast and unnatural silence, {{and this time}} it was the judge who spoke. [...] "So you really mean that when <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> that passage, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he agreed, smiling; [...] "you {{can walk}} about them--where you won't disturb the grouse--and they're grand enough; but if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{you can see}} the motor dust trails and the tourist coaches in the valleys." ...|$|E

6000|$|And if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> upon them, [...] And if they <b>looked</b> up to <b>you,</b> [...] All {{the light}} which has foregone them [...] Would be {{gathered}} back anew: [...] They would truly [...] Be as duly [...] Love-transformed to beauty's sheen, [...] "Sweetest eyes were ever seen." ...|$|R

60|$|No, it ain't. I've done it myself. It's {{like a high}} dive. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at {{the water}} it fairly takes your breath away, but after you've done it--it's not so bad as you think. You're going to be married, my boy.|$|E
60|$|When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> {{from the}} figure of the Science, to that of Cicero, beneath, you will at first think it entirely overthrows my {{conclusion}} that Rhetoric has no need of her hands. For Cicero, it appears, has three instead of two.|$|E

6000|$|... "No; if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> {{below the}} {{forecastle}} {{it was like}} a furnace, and though the pumps were at work, it was only to gain time while the boats were lowered. The first lieutenant told off the men, and they went down the side without one word, only shaking hands with those that were left." ...|$|R

She and Violet {{were out on the}} lawn of Low Wood—where <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the valley, you know—and Nettie was trying to convince the vicar those gates could be stormed. There was something I couldn’t quite understand about the marble knight in Northrop church.” ...|$|E

Straight across you see the black Chiricahua Mountains, and away down to the south the Guadalupe Mountains. That awful red gulf between is the desert, and far, far beyond the dim, blue peaks are the Sierra Madres in Mexico." ...|$|E

60|$|Have I never {{described}} my Viola? She was not tall, {{but she had}} a way {{of looking}} so, and she was not pretty, yet she always looked prettier than the prettiest person I ever saw. It was partly the way in which she held her head and long neck, just like a deer, especially when she was surprised, and looked out of those great dark eyes, whose colour was like that of the lakes of which each drop is clear and limpid, and yet, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> into the water, it is of a wonderful clear deep grey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you then}} {{take me for}} a liar?" [...] the woman answered, fixing her gloomy eyes upon Leonard's face. [...] "I told you the truth, Deliverer, when I said that my people would accept the Shepherdess and this black dog of yours as their gods. But did I not tell you also that {{the death of the}} rest of us lies in the matter? If not, I say so now. You have not been named a god, Deliverer, nor has yonder Bald-pate"--the natives called Francisco thus because of his tonsure--"and your black dog will betray you by his yapping. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> the jaws of the Snake, {{remember}} then that Soa told you the truth, Deliverer. Perchance you shall find the red stones you seek hidden in his belly, White Man." ...|$|E

60|$|The picnic {{was to be}} in {{a pretty}} glen three or four miles north of the village, where there was shade on a bit of level green, and a spring {{bubbling}} out of a fern-hung bluff: from which <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> the glen over a stretch of the river. Marcia had planned that they were to drive thither in a four-seated carryall, but the addition of Bartley's guests disarranged this.|$|R

60|$|I {{had heard}} and read {{much of the}} beauty of {{mountain}} scenery in the Tropics. What I had heard and read is not exaggerated. I saw, it is true, in this little island no Andes, with such a scenery among them and below them as Humboldt alone can describe--a type of the great and varied tropical world as utterly {{different from that of}} Trinidad as it is from that of Kent--or Siberia. I had not even the chance of such a view as that from the Silla of Caraccas described by Humboldt, from which <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> at a height of nearly six thousand feet, through layer after layer of floating cloud, which increases the seeming distance to an awful depth, upon the blazing shores of the Northern Sea.|$|E
60|$|Then fancy {{all those}} alive. Not {{as they are}} now, white stone: but covered in jelly; and out of every pore a little polype, like a flower, peeping out. Fancy them of every gaudy colour you choose. No bed of flowers, they say, can be more {{brilliant}} than the corals, as <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down</b> on them through the clear sea. Fancy, again, growing among them and crawling over them, strange sea-anemones, shells, star-fish, sea-slugs, and sea-cucumbers with feathery gills, crabs, and shrimps, {{and hundreds of other}} animals, all as strange in shape, and as brilliant in colour. You may let your fancy run wild. Nothing so odd, nothing so gay, even entered your dreams, or a poet's, as you may find alive {{at the bottom of the}} sea, in the live flower-gardens of the sea-fairies.|$|E
6000|$|... "The rivers there don't {{act like}} the rivers in other parts. Instead of working round {{the foot of}} the hills they just go through them. You ride along on {{what seems to be a}} plain, and you come {{suddenly}} to a crack that ain't perhaps twenty or thirty feet across, and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>down,</b> if you have got head enough to do it, and there, two thousand feet or more below you, you see a river foaming among rocks. It ain't one river or it ain't another river as does it; every little stream from the hills cuts itself its cañon and makes its way along till it meets two or three others, then they go on together, cutting deeper and deeper until they run into one of the arms of the Green River or the Colorado or the Grand.|$|E
