40|$|In this paper, {{we seek to}} find non{{rotating}} beams {{that are}} isospectral to a given tapered rotating beam. Isospectral structures have identical natural frequencies. We assume the mass and stiffness distributions of the tapered rotating beam to be polynomial functions of span. Such polynomial variations of mass and stiffness are typical of helicopter and wind turbine blades. We use the Barcilon-Gottlieb transformation to convert the fourth-order governing equations of the rotating and the nonrotating beams, from the (x, <b>Y)</b> <b>frame</b> of reference to a hypothetical (z, U) frame of reference. If the coefficients of both the equations in the (z, U) frame match with each other, then the nonrotating beam is isospectral to the given rotating beam. The conditions on matching the coefficients lead {{to a pair of}} coupled differential equations. Wesolve these coupled differential equations numerically using the fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme. We also verify that the frequencies (given in the literature) of standard tapered rotating beams are the frequencies (obtained using the finite-element analysis) of the isospectral nonrotating beams. Finally, we present an example of beams having a rectangular cross-section to show the application of our analysis. Since experimental determination of rotating beam frequencies is a difficult task, experiments can be easily conducted on these isospectral nonrotating beams to calculate the frequencies of the rotating beam...|$|E

The study aims to find out what this generation prefers in cause-related marketing efforts, focusing on causes and type of support. Furthermore, as a result of Generation Y’s presence on social media it will also examine their attitudes and preferences regarding cause-related marketing on these media platforms. With this thesis the main purpose is to contribute with insights and guidance for Swedish companies wanting to perform cause-related marketing initiatives towards Swedish Generation <b>Y.</b> <b>Frame</b> of references: The frame of references begins with a presentation of consumer behaviour and the power that consumers possess in today’s society. The second section presents corporate social responsibility before moving on to cause-related marketing, profoundly exploring the different aspects of this kind of marketing and presenting existing theories regarding Generation Y’s view on cause-related marketing. The chapter is concluded with a presentation of social media. Methodology: A deductive and quantitative approach has been used for the thesis as this was found appropriate for the purpose. An online questionnaire has been conducted in order to reach a large number of respondents. Empirical framework: The empirical framework presents the results of the online questionnaire. Conclusion: The survey concludes that Swedish Generation Y responds to causes related to humans, e. g., health and well-being, education and social matters, and that they want to see long-term commitment from companies. Moreover, when performing CRM-initiatives information is a key for companies in order to attract and appeal to Swedish Generation Y...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – We {{present the}} {{implementation}} of the lifting scheme- an integer wavelet transform- on a parallel TI TMS 320 C 40 -platform. While classically, the optimization is mostly driven by arithmetic optimizations, our selected methodology uses power, speed and memory size figures to explore the design space. Among several implementation approaches, the classical row-column approach is selected, based on the memory constraints imposed by the C 40 implementation platform. The use of an in-place wavelet organization eliminates the need for intermediate buffers. To minimize data transfer times, the DMA coprocessor is used to perform data transfers in parallel with the wavelet processing. The obtained implementation, fully written in parallel C-code, uses one processor to perform the wavelet decomposition/reconstruction of the luminance (<b>Y)</b> <b>frames</b> (256 by 256) and one for the horizontally subsampled chrominance (U and V) frames.

Assuming that the reference gene is read in frame + 0, an overlapping gene can be encoded in two reading frames in the sense strand, denoted by + 1 and + 2, and in three reading frames in the opposite strand, denoted by - 0, - 1 and - 2. This motivated numerous researchers to study the constraints induced by the genetic code on the various overlapping frames, mostly based on information theory. Our focus in this paper is on the constraints induced on two overlapping genes in terms of amino acids, as well as polypeptides. We show that simple linear constraints bind the amino acid composition of two proteins encoded by overlapping genes. Novel constraints are revealed when polypeptides are considered, and not just single amino acids. For example, in double-coding sequences with an overlapping reading frame - 2, each Tyrosine (denoted as Tyr or Y) in the overlapping frame overlaps a Tyrosine in the reference frame + 0 (and reciprocally), whereas specific words (e. g. YY) never occur. We thus distinguish between null constraints (YY = 0 in frame - 2) and non-null constraints (<b>Y</b> in <b>frame</b> + 0 <b>Y</b> in <b>frame</b> - 2).

We study the combinatorics of these constraints for overlapping polypeptides of length n, pointing out that, (i) except for frame - 2, non-null constraints are deduced from the amino-acid (length = 1) constraints and (ii) null constraints are deduced from the di-peptide (length = 2) constraints.

40|$|Any {{analysis}} of higher-order languages must {{grapple with the}} tri-facetted nature of lambda. In one construct, the fundamental control, environment and data structures of a language meet and intertwine. With the control facet tamed nearly two decades ago, this work brings the environment facet to heel, defining the environment problem and developing its solution: environment analysis. Environment analysis allows a compiler to reason about the equivalence of environments, i. e., name-to-value mappings, that arise during a program's execution. In this dissertation, two different techniques-abstract counting and abstract frame strings-make this possible. A third technique, abstract garbage collection, makes both of these techniques more precise and, counter to intuition, often faster as well. An array of optimizations and even deeper analyses which depend upon environment analysis provide motivation for this work. In an abstract interpretation, a single abstract entity represents a set of concrete entities. When the entities under scrutiny are bindings-single name-to-value mappings, the atoms of environment-then determining when the equality of two abstract bindings infers the equality of their concrete counterparts is the crux of environment analysis. Abstract counting does this by tracking the size of represented sets, looking for singletons, in order to apply the following principle: If {x} = {y}, then x = <b>y.</b> Abstract <b>frame</b> strings enable environmental reasoning by statically tracking the possible stack change between the births of two environments; when this change is effectively empty, the environments are equivalent.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the issue of}} one of the widespread types of vector control realization for the asynchronous motors with a short-circuited rotor. Of all more than 20 vector control types known presently, the following are applied most frequently: direct vector control with velocity pickup (VP), direct vector control without VP, indirect vector control with VP and indirect vector control without VP. Despite the fact that the asynchronous-motor indirect vector control without VP is the easiest and most spread, the absence of VP does not allow controlling the motor electromagnetic torque at zero velocity. This is the reason why for electric motor drives of such requirements they utilize the vector control with a velocity transducer. The systems of widest dissemination became the direct and indirect vector control systems with X-axis alignment of the synchronously rotating x – <b>y</b> -coordinate <b>frame</b> along the rotor flux-linkage vector inasmuch as this provides the simplest correlations for controlling variables. Although these two types of vector control are well presented in literature, a number of issues concerning their realization and practical application require further elaboration. These include: the block schemes adequate representation as consisted with the modern realization of vector control and clarification of the analytical expressions for evaluating the regulator parameters. The authors present a technique for evaluating the dynamics of an asynchronous electric motor drive with direct vector control and x -axis alignment along the vector of rotor flux linkage. The article offers a generalized structure of this vector control type with detailed description of its principal blocks: controlling system, frequency converter, and the asynchronous motor.

Analysis of secreted proteins from NGR 234 and T 3 SS mutants revealed that NopT is secreted via the T 3 SS. NopT possessed autoproteolytic activity when expressed in Escherichia coli or human HEK 293 T cells. The processed NopT exposed a glycine (G 50) to the N terminus, which is predicted to be myristoylated in eukaryotic cells. NopT with a point mutation at position C 93, H 205, or D 220 (catalytic triad) showed strongly reduced autoproteolytic activity, indicating that NopT is a functional protease of the YopT-AvrPphB effector family.

Expression of the polypeptide encoded by this open reading frame using a bacteriophage T 7 transient expression system resulted in the accumulation of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa that comigrated with bona fide factor Y during SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Soluble extracts made from cells overexpressing the product of the putative factor <b>Y</b> open reading <b>frame</b> showed a 2000 -fold increase in factor Y activity during bacteriophage phi X 174 complementary-strand DNA synthesis in vitro when compared to control extracts. The gene encoding factor Y, which maps to 88. 5 min on the E. coli chromosome, has been designated primosome A (priA) ...|$|R
