And just let me tell you, Wrenn, right here and now, that if you can't condescend to spare us some of your {{valuable}} time, now and then, we can good and plenty get along without you." ...|$|E
6000|$|And then {{a remark}} of his uncle's flashed into his memory: If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> clearly, {{put it all}} down on paper. [...] "Well, the old boy knew a thing or two," [...] said Morris. [...] "I will try; but I don't believe the paper was ever made that will clear my mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Barbison's {{smile was}} {{sympathetic}} now. [...] "I guess you're {{not going to}} haul your stuff down to her very much longer. She's played out, and run by little, struggling men who can't get credit for the patching up {{that ought to be}} done on her, and who'll have nothing to meet claims with if she breaks down and spoils your freight some day. That's a sure thing. From what I heard in Vancouver, the bottom's just ready {{to drop out of the}} concern. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that. Creditors have a lien on freight, too, when a boat's held up for debt." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Feel the Vibe (Til the Morning Comes)" [...] is {{an upbeat}} club-ready pop record. The lyrical theme explores letting go, {{releasing}} yourself {{and living in}} the moment; putting off what <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about until the morning.|$|R
6000|$|Manning tapped {{with his}} racket on the turf through some moments of silence. [...] "You {{are the most}} perfect, the most glorious of created things--tender, frank intellectual, brave, beautiful. I am your servitor. I am ready to wait for you, to wait your pleasure, to give all my life to winning it. Let me only wear your livery. Give me but leave to try. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for a time, to be free for a time. That is so like you, Diana--Pallas Athene! (Pallas Athene is better.) You are all the slender goddesses. I understand. Let me engage myself. That is all I ask." ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR OLD PALS! I'm here. J'y suis! {{bet your}} boots! While you're {{wondering}} {{what has become}} of the Bright Young Thing, the B. Y. T. is lookin' out of the winder of St. Barabbas' Hospital--just taking in all of dear, roaring, dirty London in one gulp! Such a place--Lordy! I've been waiting three hours to see the crowd go by, and they haven't gone yet! Such crowds, such busses,--all green and blue, only a penny fare, and you can ride on top if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to!</b> <b>Think</b> of that, you dear old Manx people! But there--"the bell goes a-ringing for Sarah!"--they're calling for Nurse! That's the worst of this job: they're always a-dyin' just as you're getting interested in something else! Ta-ta! ...|$|E
5000|$|At the Journal of the Lincoln Heights Literary Society, I-hsiu Lin {{concludes that}} Passion: Forbidden Lovers is [...] "a beautifully short novel ... that isnâ€™t overly {{dramatic}} but still tugs at your heart". Meanwhile, Jennifer LeBlanc at The Yaoi Review {{gave it a}} grade of B-, stating that [...] "the lack of sexual description and length of the overall novel may make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> twice". Rachel Bentham at Active Anime {{says that it is}} [...] "a great one-shot story".|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir! <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it. Guess {{your partner}} will be pretty safe with Hollin; but you're a plainsman and you'd sure {{get lost in}} a day or two and starve when your grub ran out." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Of course there's a concern. If I said it wasn't in {{the back}} of my head, I'd be lying. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{something}} bad could happen from just drinking water", said Dominic Covone, 37, a resident of about six years.|$|R
60|$|I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{see me as}} a woman. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of me as a}} woman. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> mad for me.|$|R
5000|$|... "Could this {{explain why}} {{defenders}} of [...] "Male/Female", the sculpture {{in front of}} Penn Station, get so irritable? That large piece of quadrupedal artwork is out there all on its own, unclothed of commemorative armor that might deflect public criticism - unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of it as a}} memorial to the war between the sexes, but that's an issue that people tend {{to have a lot of}} different and strongly held opinions about anyway. No, [...] "Male/Female" [...] gets a lot of attention strictly on its artistic merits, and much of it isn't very positive, especially concerning its setting in front of the Beaux-Arts railroad station. This drives its proponents up the wall." ...|$|E
50|$|God is {{a metaphor}} for a mystery that {{absolutely}} transcends all human categories of thought, even the categories of being and non-being. Those are categories of thought. I mean it's as simple as that. So it depends on how much <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it. Whether it's doing you any good. Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that's the ground of your own being. If it isn't, well, it's a lie. So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts. Those are what we call theists. The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts. And so, they're lies. Those are the atheists.|$|E
5000|$|Asked if {{the song}} was about drugs, Heartbreaker guitarist Mike Campbell said, [...] "In the verse {{there is still the}} thing about an Indiana girl on an Indiana night, just when it gets to the chorus he had the {{presence}} of mind to give it a deeper meaning. My take on it is it can be whatever you want it to be. A lot of people think it's a drug reference, and if that's what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> it very well could be, but it could also just be a goodbye love song." [...] In the rest of the interview, Campbell said that {{the song was}} originally titled [...] "Indiana Girl" [...] and the first chorus [...] "Hey, Indiana Girl, go out and find the world." [...] He went on to say that their producer, Rick Rubin 'just couldn't get behind singing about [...] "hey, Indiana Girl,"' so Rubin changed the chorus a week later.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon <b>you</b> <b>want</b> time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> it over, Amateur. Take a spin 'round town {{closing out}} your boot-blacking business, and flash up here this evening. Remember, there's {{to be no}} more running to fires except you get a {{straight}} invitation from some of Ninety-four's men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{stop that}} infernal racket," [...] {{answered}} Whopper. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the neighborhood <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{that there are}} more explosions taking place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'd better tell <b>you,</b> I don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{too badly}} of me, I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see that I can't help myself. Mildred's come back." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his book}} My Life in Orange, author Tim Guest recalls {{listening}} to Dire Straits {{version of the}} song and the line [...] "Water of love, deep in the ground, but there aint no water here to be found" [...] as a child hiding behind the sofa and wishing that the water of love would come to him some day. [...] The first person narrator of Caprice Cranes first novel Stupid and Contagious references [...] "Water of Love" [...] {{as an example of}} a clever song that she would like to hear quoted instead of the sound of flushing toilets, along with AC/DCs [...] "Big Balls," [...] ZZ Tops [...] "Tush," [...] Nirvanas [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] or Frank Sinatras [...] "My Way."On the Dire Straits live album Live at the BBC, as an introduction to the song they are about to perform, Mark Knopfler, with his signature dead-pan humour, is heard saying, [...] "Okay, well, uh, this is a song called Water of Love. It is a... a strange idea but its maybe one that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about, a lot..." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film two-and-a-half stars {{out of four}} and wrote, [...] "You want loud, dumb, skillful, escapist entertainment? Twister works. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think?</b> Think twice about seeing it". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote, [...] "Somehow Twister stays as uptempo and exuberant as a roller-coaster ride, neatly {{avoiding}} the idea of real danger". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "Yet the images that linger longest in my memory are those of windswept livestock. And that, in a teacup, sums up everything that's right, and wrong, about this appealingly noisy but ultimately flyaway first blockbuster of summer". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "But the ringmaster of this circus, the man without whom nothing would be possible, is director De Bont, who now must be considered Hollywood's top action specialist. An expert in making audiences squirm and twist, at making us feel the rush of experience right along with the actors, De Bont choreographs action and suspense so beautifully he makes it seem like a snap." [...] Time magazine's Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "when action is never shown to have deadly or pitiable consequences, it tends toward abstraction. Pretty soon you're not tornado watching, you're special-effects watching". In his review for the Washington Post Desson Howe wrote, [...] "it's a triumph of technology over storytelling and the actors' craft. Characters exist merely to tell a couple of jokes, cower in fear of downdrafts and otherwise kill time between tornadoes".|$|E
40|$|These {{approaches}} to crisis are a fundamental {{aspect of the}} systematic process of crisis management, but they are limited and {{must be accompanied by}} the existential side of the crisis. To live a major organizational crisis experience, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the possibility of such a situation, may sometimes cause another intense anxiety. This anxiety, although irrational in the rational sense of the term, is nevertheless as real as possible. In order to answer the deep existential questions that occur during a crisis, there were and are applied different defensive strategies...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may take}} the carrion, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> But I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can {{do no more than}} order it to be flung into a ditch and buried there." ...|$|R
60|$|You know Peter doesn't {{waste any}} {{time on his}} clothes. In fact, he doesn't seem to care a bit how he looks. He hasn't learned yet that it always pays to be as neat and clean as {{possible}} and that you must think well of yourself if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> others <b>to</b> <b>think</b> well of you.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> Dr. Seton <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{we are a}} pack of wild Indians?" [...] asked Felicity severely. [...] "A nice opinion he'd have of our manners!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Badly!" [...] she repeated. [...] "No; I {{shall never}} be able to thank you enough for telling me what you have done. It makes one feel almost wicked to be sitting here, and wearing jewelry, and feeling well off, {{spending}} money on whatever <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that there are people starving. How they must hate us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't blame me; don't {{grieve for}} me. Read the rest. I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of this with}} my thoughts--to feel about it as I feel at this moment.|$|R

5000|$|In {{his first}} full season {{following}} the trade, Neely's 36 goals led the club, and his 72 points more than doubled his previous year's performance. In the same season, he also spent 143 minutes in the penalty box [...] "Mike Milbury said, 'I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what you're doing by putting yourself into the penalty box. If you're going to fight, make sure it's on your terms {{and not just because}} someone is challenging you.' He was trying to make me understand who I was going in the box with. He'd say, 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take away from you dropping your gloves, but, I don't <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about not doing it. I just <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about how your reaction affects both their team and our team.' So it got me to thinking a little more about my role. Then, I began going with my instincts more and what felt right at that moment." ...|$|R

6000|$|Charmian gave a shout of laughter. [...] "I wish we were. Then I {{could be}} natural.
