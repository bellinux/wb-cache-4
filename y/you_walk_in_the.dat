2500|$|She {{fared better}} with the Sonny Bono-Jack Nitzsche song [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] and the self-penned [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Room" [...] later in 1963. [...] Both reached the lower rungs of the US pop charts, but were Top 40 hits in Canada, where [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] {{made it all the}} way to No. 1. [...] "Needles and Pins" [...] and [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Room" [...] later became US and UK hits for The Searchers.

"So, maid Miriam," [...] he said, still smiling, [...] "it {{would seem}} that I was no false prophet, and though <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Triumph and were sold <b>in</b> <b>the</b> slave-ring--for this much I have heard--still the Angel of the Lord went with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 2013, {{during the}} Rob Ford scandal over his {{behavior}} and drug use, city Councillors met to question Ford. Thompson questioned Ford about an alleged crack house. Ford replied “Have you visited <b>the</b> house? Have <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house?” Thompson replied “I {{have no interest}} in being in that house. I am not a crack user.” ...|$|R
50|$|His {{office was}} on the right hand side as <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entrance. I {{remember}} the shelves being packed with books, ledgers and files. He sat at <b>the</b> huge desk <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> window where he would write with a quill. Although I tried, I never managed to master it and was left with blobs of ink on the paper.|$|R
2500|$|A second single {{release from}} the album, [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Room", peaked at No.11 in Sweden and entered the UK Top 40 at No. 34 (which was still higher than any of her UK singles in the 1980s). [...] "Sometimes When I'm Dreaming", {{originally}} recorded by Art Garfunkel, failed to be released as the third single.|$|E
2500|$|Jackie DeShannon (born August 21, 1941/1944) is an American singer-songwriter with {{a string}} of hit song credits from the 1960s onwards, as both singer and {{composer}}. She {{was one of the first}} female singer-songwriters of the rock 'n' roll period. She is best known as the singer of [...] "What the World Needs Now Is Love" [...] and [...] "Put a Little Love in Your Heart", and as the composer of [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Room" [...] and [...] "Bette Davis Eyes", which were hits for The Searchers and Kim Carnes, respectively.

2500|$|In August 1977 Andrew Pendlebury left Myriad to join an R, rockabilly group, The Sports. The Sports {{had formed}} a year earlier with Stephen Cummings on lead vocals, Ed Bates on guitar, Paul Hitchins on drums, Robert Glover (ex-Myriad) on bass guitar and Jim Niven on piano. Upon joining Pendlebury also {{assisted}} Cummings with songwriting. The band released their first album, Reckless, in 1978 on Mushroom Records, which peaked at No.43 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart. It provided four charting singles, [...] "Boys! (What Did the Dective Say)" [...] (No.55), [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Room" [...] (No.42), [...] "Who Listens to the Radio?" [...] (No.35) and [...] "Reckless". [...] "Who Listens to the Radio?", co-written by Cummings and Pendlebury, was their only hit on the United States Billboard Pop Singles chart, peaking at No.45 in November 1979.|$|E

2500|$|DeShannon {{continued}} to record into the 21st century. She released You Know Me, {{an album of}} original songs, for Varèse Sarabande in 2000, and When <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Room, a new recording of her best-known songs, in 2011. She was portrayed by singer Liz Phair in an episode of American Dreams. On June 17, 2010, DeShannon {{was inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2012 she wrote and recorded [...] "For Africa, In Africa," [...] a song inspired by the urgent need for action to provide clean water for the African Continent.

'But come, the shower is over, and philosophers, or no philosophers, I invite <b>you</b> to <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take care,' {{said the}} old man with {{sparkling}} eyes, 'that she does not forget you when you would have her memory keenest. Take care that the day don't come when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> barefoot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> streets, and she rides by in a gay carriage of her own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But what's the use {{of talking}} of {{gorgeous}} rooms? By the way, the Little Trianon would suit us beautifully to live <b>in,</b> and <b>you</b> might <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gardens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moonlight and think you were in some English shrubbery; it is laid out in English fashion." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing {{has ever}} happened," [...] {{repeated}} Barker, with a morbid obstinacy. [...] "You don't {{know what a}} thing happening means? You sit in your office expecting customers, and customers come; <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street expecting friends, and friends meet you; you want a drink, and get it; you feel inclined for a bet, and make it. You expect either to win or lose, and you do either one or the other. But things happening!" [...] and he shuddered ungovernably.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Madam [I wrote], It {{has come}} to my {{knowledge}} that when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Gardens with the boy David you listen avidly for encomiums of him and of your fanciful dressing of him by passers-by, storing them in your heart the while you make vain pretence to regard them not: wherefore lest you be swollen by these very small things I, who now know David both by day and by night, am minded to compare him and Porthos {{the one with the}} other, both in this matter and in other matters of graver account. And touching this matter of outward show, they are both very lordly, and neither of them likes it to be referred to, but they endure in different ways. For David says 'Oh, bother!' and even at times hits out, but Porthos droops his tail and lets them have their say. Yet is he extolled as beautiful and a darling ten times for the once that David is extolled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg of <b>you</b> not to <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heat, Hugh," [...] {{his wife}} pleaded, giving him an angular parcel {{enclosing}} half a chicken and some raisins.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peace! or I will rend you limb by limb, as I {{rent the}} stones {{from the wall}} when I passed through it!' he whispered to her in fierce accents, as she {{struggled}} to escape him. 'You shall return with me to Rome! <b>You</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> track that I have made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rifted brick-work!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{has been}} {{quoted as saying}} that Hush is [...] "the kind of movie where <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in,</b> watch <b>the</b> first 10 minutes, know exactly where it's going, and hope devoutly that you're wrong. It's one of those Devouring Woman movies where the villainess never plays a scene without a drink and a cigarette, and the hero is inattentive to the victim to the point of dementia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 26. I {{was this}} morning with Mr. Secretary about some business, and {{he tells me that}} Colonel Fielding is now going to make Bernage his captain-lieutenant, that is, a captain by commission, and the {{perquisites}} of the company; but not captain's pay, only the first step to it. I suppose he will like it; and the recommendation to the Duke of Argyle goes on. And so trouble me no more about your Bernage; the jackanapes understands what fair solicitors he has got, I warrant you. Sir Andrew Fountaine and I dined, by invitation, with Mrs. Vanhomrigh. You say they are of no consequence: why, they keep as good female company as I do male; I see all the drabs of quality at this end of the town with them: I saw two Lady Bettys(2) there this afternoon; the beauty of one, the good-breeding and nature of t'other, and the wit of neither, would have made a fine woman. Rare walking in the Park now: why don't <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Green of St. Stephen? The walks there are finer gravelled than the Mall. What beasts the Irish women are, never to walk! ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the ground}} was not yet quite covered, and again {{near the end of}} winter, when the snow was melted on my south {{hillside}} and about my wood-pile, the partridges came out of the woods morning and evening to feed there. Whichever side <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woods the partridge bursts away on whirring wings, jarring the snow from the dry leaves and twigs on high, which comes sifting down in the sunbeams like golden dust, for this brave bird is not to be scared by winter. It is frequently covered up by drifts, and, it is said, [...] "sometimes plunges from on wing into the soft snow, where it remains concealed for a day or two." [...] I used to start them in the open land also, where they had come out of the woods at sunset to [...] "bud" [...] the wild apple trees. They will come regularly every evening to particular trees, where the cunning sportsman lies in wait for them, and the distant orchards next the woods suffer thus not a little. I am glad that the partridge gets fed, at any rate. It is Nature's own bird which lives on buds and diet drink.|$|E
6000|$|Akin {{to these}} is the false theory of progress, which {{maintains}} that we alter the test {{instead of trying to}} pass the test. We often hear it said, for instance, [...] "What is right in one age is wrong in another." [...] This is quite reasonable, if it means that there is a fixed aim, and that certain methods attain at certain times and not at other times. If women, say, desire to be elegant, it may be that they are improved at one time by growing fatter and at another time by growing thinner. But you cannot say that they are improved by ceasing to wish to be elegant and beginning to wish to be oblong. If the standard changes, how can there be improvement, which implies a standard? Nietzsche started a nonsensical idea that men had once sought as good what we now call evil; if it were so, we could not talk of surpassing or even falling short of them. How can you overtake Jones if <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other direction? You cannot discuss whether one people has succeeded more in being miserable than another succeeded in being happy. It would be like discussing whether Milton was more puritanical than a pig is fat.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the grove}} {{of the goddess}} Baaltis!" [...] broke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Levite with a {{kindling}} eye, and striking the ground with his staff to emphasise his words. [...] "You, a Prince of Israel, alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high place of abomination with the priestess of a fiend? Fie upon you, fie upon you! Would <b>you</b> also <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sin of your forefathers, Aziel, and so soon?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Hello!' said she, jumpin' {{in front}} of me an' shuttin' the gate. 'You can't go out here. If <b>you</b> want to <b>walk</b> <b>you</b> can <b>walk</b> about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grounds. There's lots of shady paths.' ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{have plenty}} of pines in our own country, and it is {{probable}} that most of <b>you</b> have <b>walked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pine woods, on many a summer's day, when the soft carpet of [...] "needles," [...] or [...] "pine-shatters," [...] as some people call them, was so pleasant to the feet, the aromatic perfume of the leaves and trees was so delicious, and everything was so quiet and solemn.|$|R
