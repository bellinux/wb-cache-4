25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when trying to remember where <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E
500|$|At other times, {{the camera}} was {{positioned}} {{very close to the}} actors to catch the emotion in their faces: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lens 6 inches from somebody's face, you get more emotion than if you're on a long lens 20 feet away," [...] Cohen said in an interview. Hooper sought a second subtlety while filming the first consultation room scene between the two men, having placed the camera 18inches from Colin Firth's face: [...] "I wanted the nervousness of the first day to percolate into his performances." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Murphy {{starred in}} Red Lights with Robert De Niro and Sigourney Weaver. He played Tom Buckley, the assistant to Weaver's character {{who is a}} paranormal investigator. [...] Murphy considered working with De Niro to {{have been one of}} the most intimidating moments in his career. He remarked: [...] "My first scene when I come to visit him my character is supposed to be terrified and intimidated. There was no acting involved. The man has presence. You can't act presence. I'll never have that. Watching him use it...when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> camera on it, it just becomes something else." ...|$|E

500|$|Modern {{scientific}} sources {{report that}} the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If {{you put it in}} cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you." [...] Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that [...] "If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out." ...|$|E
500|$|Ben Sisario of The New York Times {{described}} Stargate's {{music as}} [...] "sugary, lilting R in the Michael Jackson vein leavened {{with the kind}} of melody-rich European pop that paints everything in bright primary colors... Their work carries on a tradition of Scandinavian bubble-gum artistry that stretches from Abba to Max Martin". Sisario added that, unlike other's producers in the United States, [...] "Stargate signature is more difficult to detect, because to some degree the duo's style is an adaptable method, not a specific sound". Steve Lunt, an A executive at Atlantic Records, pointed out, however, that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> bunch of Stargate songs together you will see the thread running through them".|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then {{all of a sudden}} you put the money involved or the opportunity involved or <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E

500|$|Armitage {{performs}} his own stunts. When performing fight scenes, {{they would}} be choreographed carefully so Armitage could take part rather than a stunt double. For series eight, Armitage performed a fight scene in a swimming pool, which he thought was [...] "fun," [...] but also thought it was difficult as it was [...] "like acting and punching in slow motion." [...] In another sequence, he injured a stuntman with a hospital trolley. He was only given a short lesson {{on how to handle}} firearms, since he was already accustomed to using them whilst working on Ultimate Force. While discussing the shootout at the end of series seven, Armitage noted that he is [...] "not a violent person but when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> gun in somebody's hands [...] it's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
500|$|Spectre {{marked the}} return of many scriptwriters from the {{previous}} Bond films, such as Skyfall writer John Logan; Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who had done work in five previous Bond films; and British playwright Jez Butterworth, who had previously made uncredited contributions to Skyfall. Butterworth {{was brought in to}} polish the script, being helped by Mendes and Craig. Butterworth considered that his changes involved adding what {{he would like to see}} as a teenager, and limited the scenes with Bond talking to men, as [...] "Bond shoots other men—he doesn’t sit around chatting to them. So <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> line through that.” With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, Purvis and Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in Casino Royale and introduced in Quantum of Solace reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{sometime}} during Summer 2008. Miller wanted to style the filming {{as if the}} cameras are following the team like in a documentary. The first day was spent in the [...] "Ottawa Bravo" [...] safe house set, where Connie reveals the threat. Throughout the shoot, Gemma Jones had hip problems. Concerned, the producers set up a body double on hand. However, Jones insisted she could do everything herself, {{and in the end}} the double was not used. During the first shootout scene in the episode, Miller wanted to make the sequence as real as possible by having the camera film as if it was under attack. Richard Armitage recalled the shootout sequence; [...] "There was a shoot-out in the final episode where I surprised myself about the amount of rounds I could pull off and how quickly. It's a weird thing. I'm not a violent person but when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> gun in somebody's hands something strange happens. It's like a little animal comes out of you that wants to fire the gun again." ...|$|E
5000|$|Professor Edward Castillo, a Native American and {{director}} of Native American Studies at the Sonoma State University in California, said in a Firing Line episode with William F. Buckley, Jr. that, [...] "...you pointed out that in my work I haven't cited Serra as oppressor. <b>You</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>a</b> whip in his hand. <b>You</b> can't <b>put</b> <b>a</b> smoking gun in his hand. And that is true. The man was an administrator." ...|$|R

Anyhow, I am sure that you will find no difficulty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>an</b> {{advertisement}} in your paper," [...] {{continued the}} Bishop. [...] "I know a traveller {{who lost his}} keys at the Yard and got them back again by those same means. Go on advertising till you find him, and my prime minister and principal doggy here shall give you an order on the town council for your expenses." ...|$|R
500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his term, Scott was {{dogged by}} rumors of heavy {{drinking}} and {{frequent use of}} profanity. On one occasion, an unnamed individual believed his reputation had been injured by something Scott had said and challenged him to a duel. He ignored the challenge, after which the challenger threatened to expose him as a coward. Scott {{was supposed to have}} replied, [...] "Post and be damned; but if you do, you will only post yourself a damned liar, and everybody else will say so." [...] On another occasion, after reviewing a speech written for him by Bledsoe, the governor was said to have remarked, [...] "Well, Mr. Bledsoe, I know you think you are a damned sight smarter than I am, and so you are in many respects; but this message as it is now, won't do at all; I'll be damned if it will." [...] When Bledsoe asked what was wrong with the speech, he reportedly replied, [...] "Why, damn it to hell, why don't <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> good solemn prayer at the end of it, and talk about Providence, and the protection of Heaven, and all that?" [...] After the governor campaigned for Humphrey Marshall's opponent in the 1809 legislative elections, Marshall published an article in the Western World newspaper that accused him of appearing in front of the court house drunk on election day.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{explores the}} limits of [...] "English" [...] magic through the {{characters}} of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> fairy next {{to a person who}} is also outside English society...suddenly {{the fact that there is}} this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way." [...] The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a noble savage and enslaves him—like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both [...] "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record". Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves. Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps. Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoiem explains, [...] "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery." [...] In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the antagonist.|$|E

2500|$|Randy Bachman {{has stated}} that he heard the {{original}} masters of the recordings and could hear the 12-string guitar playing [...] "an F chord, but <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> G on top, and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> G on the bottom, and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> C next to that G", [...] "a D on the bass", and [...] "rhythm guitar was a D chord with a sus 4".|$|E
2500|$|Desmond Lim, {{assistant}} {{secretary-general of}} the SPP responded that the red ant represented the party's never-say-die spirit: [...] "Ants see no obstacles.

50|$|Oxygen {{is one of}} the fuels of {{the cell}} so the more oxygen there is, the more {{electricity}} is generated.

2500|$|On January 13, 2012, United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar {{ordered the}} {{quotation}} corrected.

[...] According to the project's lead architect, the correction of the quote was not a simple matter, as the current inscription is chiseled into the existing granite blocks. As the entire quotation will not fit on the monument, the replacement was still expected to be a paraphrase; however, project officials would not comment on proposed corrections until they were presented to Secretary Salazar.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013 Cohen, {{speaking}} to The Guardian, made {{an appeal to}} the famous street artist Banksy.

This {{was in the midst of}} Banksy's highly publicized month-long residency in New York City, during which he released a new piece each day somewhere in the city and posted clues to its whereabouts on his website.
