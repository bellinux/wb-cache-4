Among the 28 stories, other notable tales include {{one about the}} influence of Madonna (with discourse including [...] "Any American woman under 40 who says she's never dressed as Madonna is either lying or Amish."); one about dressing room anxiety (a story revolving around the concept that [...] "I'm an 8. I've always been an 8"); and one about your mother's tastes in clothes ("I don't understand, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> so good if you tried"). [...] Three of the characters sometimes work as a trio and all characters have monologues.|$|E
500|$|Olga {{tried to}} draw comfort from her faith and her {{proximity}} to her family. To her [...] "beloved mama", {{with whom she}} had sometimes had a difficult relationship, she wrote a poem in April 1917, while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo: [...] "You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others. And no one's grief has ever passed you by. You are relentless, only towards yourself, forever cold and pitiless. But if only <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> upon your own sadness from a distance, just once with a loving soul — Oh, how you would pity yourself, how sadly you would weep." [...] In another letter from Tobolsk, Olga wrote: [...] "Father asks to… remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful, and that it is not evil which conquers evil, but only love …" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{shook hands}} with her at once. I took a chair {{opposite}} her at the table. I summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter. The lady was philandering with an orange ice. I ordered a crème de menthe. Her hair was reddish bronze. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at it, because <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> away from her eyes. But you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said he, [...] "if you had {{committed}} a murder, and I had told you your crime was discovered, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>look</b> more aghast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's the foolishest thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do. <b>Look</b> at pap and my mother. Fight! Why, {{they used}} to fight all the time. I remember, mighty well." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hugh Jackman was {{the first}} actor Wessler cast. He met the star at a wedding and then called him some time later and pitched him the short. Jackman read the script and agreed {{to be a part}} of the film. [...] "He called me back I think 24 hours later and said, 'Yeah I wanna do this,' which I think is, quite frankly, {{incredibly}} ballsy. Because you could be made a fool of, or <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> silly, and there will be people who say, 'That's crazy; he should never have done it.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Aren't there really?' she said. 'Oh, I thought savages {{were all}} so dangerous, they'd have your life before <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> round.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No?" [...] she said, with {{a little}} scornful inflection. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> on while a cattle-driving boor made himself a laughing-stock at Carnaby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had thought," [...] said John, hesitatingly, [...] "of {{going into}} your office and {{becoming}} your {{partner in the}} business. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> always <b>look</b> after me, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Without {{discussing}} the word,' said Griff, 'I {{mean that the}} effect on his senses {{was the same as}} the actual sight. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at him without being certain.' ...|$|R
60|$|Silly man. I {{have known}} long that you loved me. You {{have told me}} so often and in so many ways. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at me without telling me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not papa!" [...] said Jenny, startled. [...] "No, nor Phil! Tell me, Rosamond. There is {{only one}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{at me like that}} for!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> a fool? Why you are ironical! Ca marche! In other words, {{you have come}} on. But it is a sweet dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, too. I looked inside. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{through the}} ports and I looked inside {{and they were}} dead." [...] He looked sick. [...] "They were dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no, {{that would}} not be modest,' said Elizabeth; 'you would be no longer a lady, so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> lady-like, which I {{maintain}} a lady always is, whether each morsel of her apparel is beautiful in itself or not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, what riches and treasures met Hans' {{astonished}} eyes! Gold {{and silver}} bars lay piled on the floor, and glittered so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> at them! Hans {{thought he would}} count them for fun, and had already reached the five hundred and seventieth when his host returned and cried, laughing: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the casino}} and other attractions down there I'm afraid of. If {{you had some}} older man <b>you</b> <b>could</b> trust to <b>look</b> after Jake, one would feel more satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, of course; oh yes, I see. Sure. I can see how----Say, Gertie, I {{never did}} know <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> so grown-up. I suppose now you'll never play with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Penelope, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into Prince Maiyo's heart {{you would}} not find him half an Englishman. I {{think that he is}} more than seven-eighths a Japanese." ...|$|E
60|$|Dear love, I would <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> upon me ever, {{for your}} eyes Are {{polished}} mirrors, and when I peer Into those mirrors I can see myself, And so I know my image lives in you.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not recall}} {{much more about}} this wood in detail. I only {{recollect}} that the sky was introduced into it. In places where there occurred an opening among the trees <b>you</b> <b>could</b> by <b>looking</b> up see the sky above you; very often there were clouds in this sky, and occasionally, if I remember rightly, the girl got wet.|$|R
60|$|There is a queer {{time coming}}, O Raja Vikram!--a queer time coming (said the Vampire), a queer time coming. Elderly {{people like you}} talk abundantly about {{the good old days}} that were, and about the {{degeneracy}} of the days that are. I wonder what you would say if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> but <b>look</b> forward a few hundred years.|$|R
6000|$|And down I went {{to fetch}} my bride: [...] But, Alice, you were ill at ease; [...] This dress {{and that by}} turns you tried, [...] Too fearful that you should not please. [...] I loved you better for your fears, [...] I knew <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>look</b> but well; [...] And dews, that would have fall'n in tears, [...] I kiss'd away before they fell. [20] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but {{you could}} see it from a {{perfectly}} new point of view. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at it as a sort of dispassionate witness, and treat it humorously--of course it is ridiculous--and do something entirely fresh." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} been twelve or fifteen hundred miles from any island where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> forward to {{anything}} like safety; {{and that is a}} distance one would rather not travel all alone on the high seas." ...|$|E
60|$|He put the {{revolver}} {{to his forehead}} and blew a tunnel straight through his head. The tunnel was {{about the size of}} your finger. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> right through it. The job was complete; there was nothing in it.|$|E
5000|$|Trump used crude language. O'Donnell {{described}} an instance where Trump {{said to him}} about girlfriend Marla Maples: [...] "God, I wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see her body! [...] [...] [...] If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> take one <b>look</b> at it, just one look, you wouldn't believe it. It's unbelievable. Better than a ten." ...|$|R
60|$|And she, the {{sparkling}} mistress of this scene; say, where is she? Not among the dancers, though a more graceful form <b>you</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>look</b> upon; not even among her guests, though a more accomplished hostess {{it would be}} hard to find. Gaiety pours forth its flood, and all are thinking of themselves, or of some one sweeter even than self-consciousness, or else perhaps one absent might be missed.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>looked</b> into Allardyce's back shop, {{you would}} have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling, and a gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously {{stabbing}} at it with this weapon. I was that energetic person, and I have satisfied myself that by no exertion of my strength can I transfix the pig with a single blow. Perhaps you would care to try?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are a lot}} {{of loose}} stones on that hill," [...] said Traffick, [...] "and she tripped on one and came down, all in a lump, before <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at her. I'm awfully sorry, but it might have {{happened}} to any one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> {{into my mind}} you'd {{find that}} it would. I'm full of fretful anger against him for half-a-dozen little {{frivolous}} things. Didn't he throw his cigar on the path? Didn't he lie in bed on Sunday {{instead of going to}} church?' ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{fireplace}} {{in the room}} with a window one side of it, through which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>look</b> into the street. It was not cold, but it had begun to rain hard, and so I made the dampness an excuse for a fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear madam," [...] said Burke, {{rising from}} his seat and walking the floor, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>looked</b> {{through the hole in}} the top of the mound and have seen under you cartloads and cartloads of pure gold, and had let your mind rest on what might have grown out of it, a house like this would have seemed like an acorn on an oak tree!" ...|$|R
60|$|BRASSBOUND. You've spoiled {{even that}} chance for me. Do <b>you</b> think I <b>could</b> <b>look</b> at any {{ordinary}} woman after you? You {{seem to be}} able to make me do pretty well what you like; but you can't make me marry anybody but yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend John, {{forgive me}} if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>looked</b> into my heart then when I want to laugh, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have done so when the laugh arrived, if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do so now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him, for he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time, maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all." ...|$|R
