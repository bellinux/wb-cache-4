500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do,</b> it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1979 movie 10, the {{character}} played by Bo Derek asks [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> it to Ravel's Bolero?", {{a reference to}} the idea that the work is a good accompaniment to lovemaking. A four-minute excerpt of Boléro is used during the subsequent sex scene. This significantly increased sales of recordings of the work, which is still under copyright in many countries.|$|E
2500|$|Charles {{made his}} debut for Wales {{in a game}} against Northern Ireland at Windsor Park on 20 April 1955; the Welsh won 3–2 thanks to a John Charles hat-trick. His second cap came against Austria on 23 November, in a game latter dubbed the 'Battle of Wrexham'. He was stretchered off with fifteen minutes to go after an Austrian boot went through the back of his leg; this was notable as the only time John ever lost his temper, as he reacted to the {{challenge}} by lifting the Austrian off the ground and screaming [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> that to my brother again I'll bloody kill you!" [...] Charles was then selected for the 1957 British Home Championship squad, and helped his country to record a 2–2 draw with Scotland at Ninian Park. He also battled against injury to play in the 3–1 defeat to England at Wembley Stadium, before the tournament ended with a goalless draw in Ireland.|$|E
6000|$|... "What good have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> to us?" [...] he {{continued}} in harsher and harsher accents, forcing the other {{back towards the}} flower-beds. [...] "What good have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> <b>you</b> race of German sausages? Yards of barbarian etiquette, to throttle the freedom of aristocracy! Gas of northern metaphysics to blow up Broad Church bishops like balloons. Bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the Albert Memorial. Go back to Hanover, you humbug? Go to----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{indeed it}} has, Miss Jane,' said his mother. 'There's nothing <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> {{for him that}} gave him the comfort that has been.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] he replied, a little bewildered. [...] "I {{am glad to}} be here. What have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> which needs apology?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Coincidentally at {{this same}} time a new {{panchromatic}} photographic emulsion was developed that allowed {{the full range of}} colors to be captured. Soon after it became available Stieglitz aimed his 8" [...] x 10" [...] view camera at the sky and began taking pictures. By the next year he had created a series of ten mounted photographs he called Music: A Sequence of Ten Cloud Photographs (also called Clouds in Ten Movements). He told his wife Georgia O'Keeffe [...] "I wanted a series that when seen by Ernest Bloch (the great composer) he would exclaim: Music! Music! Man, why that is music! How did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> that? And he would point to violins and flutes, and oboes, and brass…" [...] He first exhibited this series in 1923 in his one-man show at the Anderson Galleries in New York, and reported that when Bloch saw them there he had exactly the reaction Stieglitz had wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, Puck! Puck! I guessed {{you right}} from {{when you talked}} about the salt. How could <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> it?' Una cried, {{swinging}} along delighted.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! No! Don't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> that," [...] {{she said}} in haste, while her eyes glistened suddenly. [...] "You would hate me for it afterwards!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By God, I think you're right! Better a hobo than a {{beast of}} toil. Why, man, you'll live. And that's more than <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Wingfield, Mr. Holdaway's head groom, who {{has come}} over with another man and a boy, {{and three of the}} loveliest horses <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; we {{will have}} no more running away: I am sorry that <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> so. It was my fault, {{altogether}} my fault; but it was foolish." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He doesn't {{have any}} use for you," [...] replied Kel. [...] "He's always running {{you down to}} the other boys. What'd <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> to him, Ken?" ...|$|E
60|$|WALPOLE. Thats interesting. I {{believe you}} have no nuciform sac. If <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> feel at all queer, I should {{very much like to}} have a look.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing that <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do,</b> [...] Nothing good {{or nothing}} bad, But has effect on other folks-- [...] Gives them pain or makes them glad. [...] Peter Rabbit.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "if I did, I shouldn't be--alive. Mr. Bass, have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> {{anything}} {{the pleasure of}} doing which was pay enough, and to spare?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must {{excuse me}} if I am wrong, Trevelyan; but I don't think <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> tell your wife {{not to see}} this man, or not to write to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This'll {{make the}} {{adjutant}} sick with joy. Maybe we won't {{have it on}} the Governor! We'll show them about the ranger service. Duane! how'd <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{you grow}} older, if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do,</b> tell your {{children}} that {{once upon a}} time you put a hundred men to shame. It is no small thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{round the}} corner, you know, waiting! And if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> change, all you've {{got to do}} is just to come to me and say 'It's all right!'...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it is very}} good; very good, indeed," [...] she said, {{standing}} before the easel, {{and looking at the}} half-completed work. [...] "I do not know that <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> anything better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{into your}} shop {{and do the}} best job <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did</b> in your life, Gus,' said Marshall. 'The Liberals are in and you're going to barber a good Grit before the sun rises.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, then, my man," [...] said Mr. Tulliver, {{taking out}} five shillings. [...] "It's the best day's work <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>did.</b> I couldn't {{afford to lose}} the little wench. Here, lift her up before me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Majesty, it {{was good}} of you to come. I'm all broken up. How did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> it? But never mind that now. Tell me about that brother of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{notion is}} that it is one of your musicians--very dangerous, I am afraid; and I say, Cilla, did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> such a thing--you couldn't, I suppose--as lend her Shelley's poems?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Charlecote {{was more}} fortunate. She {{had met the}} Baronet in the passage, and was accosted by him with, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>do</b> {{such a thing as}} take a turn on that terrace?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Are you such a sweet {{innocent}} as to suppose nobody {{in this world}} ever does what they don't think is right? Don't you, or didn't <b>you</b> <b>ever,</b> <b>do</b> anything {{that you did not}} think quite right?" ...|$|E
