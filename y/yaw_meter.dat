40|$|This report {{describes}} the calibration of a nonnulling, conical, seven-hole pressure probe {{over a large}} range of flow onset angles. The calibration procedure {{is based on the}} use of differential pressures to determine the three components of velocity. The method allows determination of the flow angle and velocity magnitude to within an average error of 1. 0 deg and 1. 0 percent, respectively. Greater accuracy can be achieved by using high-quality pressure transducers. Also included is an examination of the factors which limit the use of the probe, a description of the measurement chain, an error analysis, and a typical experimental result. In addition, a new general analytical model of pressure probe behavior is described, and the validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing it with experimentally measured calibration data for a three-hole <b>yaw</b> <b>meter</b> and a seven-hole probe...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulent}} flowfield of turbulent jet issuing from rectangular nozzle (Aspect Ratio= 12. 5) with {{a rectangular}} notch at the midspan, {{has been investigated}} experimentally. Four aspect ratios of rectangular notch (NAR: Notch Aspect Ratio) used in this experiment were 2. 5, 7. 5, 12. 5 and 165. The Reynolds number based on the nozzle width d and the exit mean velocity Ue, was kept constant 30000 (NAR= 2. 5 and 7. 5), 15000 (NAR= 12. 5) and 13000 (NAR= 165), respectively. Longitudinal mean velocity and turbulent intensities were measured using an X-array Hot-Wire Probe (5 µm in diameter, 1 mm effective length) operated by the linearized constant temperature anemometers (DANTEC), and the spanwise and the lateral mean velocities were measured using a <b>yaw</b> <b>meter.</b> The signals from the anemometers were passed through the low-pass filters and sampled using A. D. converter. The processing of the signals was made by a personal computer. Acquisition time of the signals was usually 80 seconds. From this experiment, {{it was revealed that}} the attachment of a rectangular notch to the rectangular jet suppressed the development of the turbulent velocity scales near the jet centre in the upstream region for the cases of NAR≥ 7. 5...|$|E
40|$|The mean flowfield of {{a linear}} array of {{multiple}} rectangular jets run through transversely with a two-dimensional jet, has been investigated, experimentally. The object of this experiment is to operate both the velocity {{scale and the}} length scale of the multiple rectangular jets using a two-dimensional jet. The reason of the adoption of this nozzle exit shape {{was caused by the}} reports of authors in which the cruciform nozzle promoted the inward secondary flows strongly on both the two jet axes. Aspect ratio of the rectangular nozzle used in this experiment was 12. 5. Reynolds number based on the nozzle width d and the exit mean velocity Ue (≅ 39 m / s) was kept constant 25000. Longitudinal mean velocity was measured using an X-array Hot-Wire Probe (lh = 3. 1 μm in diameter, dh = 0. 6 mm effective length : dh / lh = 194) operated by the linearized constant temperature anemometers (DANTEC), and the spanwise and the lateral mean velocities were measured using a <b>yaw</b> <b>meter.</b> The signals from the anemometers were passed through the low-pass filters and sampled using A. D. converter. The processing of the signals was made by a personal computer. Acquisition time of the signals was usually 60 seconds. From this experiment, it was revealed that the magnitude of the inward secondary flows on both the y and z axes in the upstream region of the present jet was promoted by a two-dimensional jet which run through transversely perpendicular to the multiple rectangular jets, therefore the potential core length on the x axis of the present jet extended 2. 3 times longer than that of the multiple rectangular jets, and the half-velocity width on the rectangular jet axis of the present jet was suppressed 41 % shorter compared with that of the multiple rectangular jets...|$|E
40|$|The {{flexibility}} of behavior is so rich, and its components are so exquisitely interwoven, that {{one may be}} well advised to turn to an isolated behavioral module for study. Gill withdrawal in Aplysia, the proboscis extension reflex in the honeybee, and lid closure in mammals are such examples. We have chosen yawing, a single component of flight orientation in Drosophila melanogaster, for this approach. A specialty of this preparation is that the behavioral output can be reduced beyond the single module by one further step. It can be studied in tethered animals in which all turns are blocked while the differentially beating wings still provide the momentum. These intended yaw turns are measured by a torque meter to which the fly is hooked. The fly is held horizontally as if cruising at high speed. The head is glued to the thorax. It can bend its abdomen, extend its proboscis, and move its legs but cannot shift its direction of gaze or its orientation in space. Evidently, a fly hardly ever encounters this bizarre situation in the wild. We describe here the flexibility in this single behavioral variable. It provides insights into the relation between classical and operant conditioning, the processing of and interactions between the conditioned visual stimuli, early visual memory, visual pattern recognition, selective attention, and several other experience-dependent properties of visual orientation behavior. We start with a brief summary of visual flight control at the torque <b>meter.</b> <b>Yaw</b> Torque in Tethered Fligh...|$|R
