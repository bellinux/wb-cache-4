Coup, helped him get railroad cars to make his tour traveling easier. Given the lack of paved highways in America, {{this turned out to be}} a shrewd business move that vastly enlarged Barnum's geographical reach. In this new field, Barnum leaned more on the advice of Coup, Bailey and other business partners, most of whom were <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his sons.|$|E
25|$|Most {{likely he}} was born in Melun, but he lived most of his life in Paris. The {{earliest}} records of his life date from 1527, {{when he was in the}} service of the king. In 1530 he was charged with playing ball at Notre Dame Cathedral as well as refusing to go to a service, both dangerous irreverences that almost cost him prison timebut he was <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> forgiven. From this event a birthdate between 1510 and 1520 can be inferred. In 1536 he became a master of choristers at the Sainte-Chapelle (choir), and he remained at this post, with a few additional benefices, for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable {{and he was very}} disappointed when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E

25|$|Roly {{was cast}} {{less than a}} week before the filming of EastEnders began. From the {{beginning}} it was decided that the occupants of The Queen Victoria pub, Den, Angie and Sharon Watts, were to have a German Shepherd named Prince. However, finding an Alsatian that was light enough in colour not to merge into the background of the set proved to be difficult. Eventually, the co-creator/producer of the show, Julia Smith, was contacted by a company named Janimals, who specialised in providing and training animals for television and films. They had found a seven-month-old Poodle, called Roly, who might still be <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trained. Training was said to take three weeks, and as the Poodle was a similar size to an Alsatian, Roly got the part. Roly was made the property of the BBC, given an ID card, and taken to live with Julia Smith at her home in London. Roly and Willy the pug shared a dressing room at Elstree studios.|$|E
500|$|When {{ending the}} second season, the {{producers}} and crew {{thought it would}} be the last. However, to their surprise Millennium was renewed for a third season. Many of the cliffhanger plot threads from the season finale were written off as the hallucinations of Frank Black. When creating the third season, they {{wanted to go back to}} the stand alone storytelling format used in the first season; to do so they had Frank join the FBI and receive a new [...] "skeptical" [...] partner with whom he could work. Regarding Hollis, producer Michael Duggan said [...] "she's not a rookie ... but she's <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in awe of Frank Black's rep as a legendary crime solver".|$|E
500|$|Hollis was {{conceived}} as a [...] "skeptical" [...] partner for Black, to allow the third season {{to return to the}} stand-alone plot format of the series' first season. About Hollis, producer Michael Duggan said: [...] "She's not a rookie... but she's <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in awe of Frank Black's rep as a legendary crime solver". Reaction to the character was mixed; she was described as [...] "pass emotional baggage off as character development", and her introduction was said to be overly similar to the character dynamic in Millennium sister series The X-Files. Scott's acting in the role was praised, with critics calling her [...] "bracing" [...] and noting that she [...] "works hard to mine some sort of truth" [...] from Hollis' character.|$|E

He was a leading man in the 1930s and 40s but looked <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> still <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing the lead well into the 1960s. His superhero costume {{is made up of}} slacks, a heavy sweatshirt, a skull cap and goggles, looking more like someone getting ready for a mustard gas attack.|$|R
500|$|The {{impact of}} M. cerebralis in Europe is {{somewhat}} lessened because {{the species is}} endemic to this region, giving native fish stocks a degree of immunity. Rainbow trout, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing feral populations are rare, so few wild rainbow trout are <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to infection. [...] On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking sport-fishing waters and for aquaculture, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the [...] "ossification" [...] stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give {{particular attention to the}} quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges. Fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.|$|E

2500|$|In Bring Up the Bodies, Mantel's {{acclaimed}} {{sequel to}} Wolf Hall, the portrayal is {{of a young}} man coming of age with confidence - still naive, but with potential; he is played in the BBC television adaptation by Tom Holland. In the stage production of Wolf Hall Part Two, Gregory (played by Benedict Hastings) is an intelligent young man who understands why his father must be sometimes ruthless but is still <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> horrified by his father's actions, especially in the disposal of Anne Boleyn's [...] "lovers".|$|E

5000|$|It {{is clear}} that later novels take some liberties with Alleyn's age. In [...] "Black as He's Painted" [...] (1974), Alleyn is clearly not 80 years old, {{as he would have}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> if his birth was in 1893.

60|$|Politics {{leave me}} {{extraordinary}} cold. It seems {{that so much}} of my purpose has come off, and Cedarcrantz and Pilsach are sacked. The rest of it has all gone to water. The triple- headed ass at home, in his plenitude of ignorance, prefers to collect the taxes and scatter the Mataafas by force or the threat of force. It may succeed, and I suppose it will. It is none the less for that expensive, harsh, unpopular and unsettling.

Success in that field appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the organisation of failure enlivened with defamation of character; and, much as I love pickles and hot water (in your true phrase) I shall take my pickles in future from Crosse and Blackwell and my hot water with a dose of good Glenlivat.|$|R

None but a well-disciplined, humble, simple Christian could so have borne his sufferings: the habit of obedience and faith and patience; the childlike unhesitating trust in God's love and fatherly care, supported him now. He never for a moment lost his hold upon God. What a lesson it was! it calmed us all.

5000|$|After {{writing her}} third studio album Speak Now (2010) entirely solo, Swift opted to {{collaborate}} with different songwriters and producers for Red. Thus, she called Max Martin and Shellback, two songwriters and producers whose work she admired, to discuss a possible collaboration. She told Billboard magazine: [...] "For me, being 22 has been my favorite year of my life. I like all the possibilities of how you're still learning, but you know enough.

5000|$|Musically, {{the song}} marks {{a shift from}} the hard rock of 1969's Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere and bears more folk and country influences, which would {{continue}} onto 1972's Harvest. The only instruments are two acoustic guitars, played by Young and Nils Lofgren. He is, however, backed by the vocal harmonies of Crazy Horse during the choruses. 'Tell Me Why' has a simple lyrical structure, with 2 verses each followed by a bridge then chorus, and one final bridge and chorus before a short instrumental outro. The chorus line [...] "Tell me why, tell me why/Is it hard to make arrangements with yourself/When you're old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> repay/but <b>young</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sell?"

50|$|The sexes can {{generally}} be differentiated {{by the number}} of bands on the body. Males have a larger number of colored bands than females do. During mating, the fish intertwine as part of a courtship dance. The female transfers the eggs to the male's brooding pouch through her long ovipositor. The brooding pouch is located near the anus of the pipefish. The eggs stay in the male's brooding pouch until the <b>young</b> <b>are</b> developed <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> independent. At this point, the young exit the pouch with the help of muscular contractions of the male's body.
