5|$|I Want <b>You</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth studio album by American soul {{musician}} Marvin Gaye, released March 16, 1976, on Motown-subsidiary label Tamla Records. Recording {{sessions for}} the album took place throughout 1975 and 1976 at Motown Recording Studios, {{also known as}} Hitsville West, and Gaye's personal studio Marvin's Room in Los Angeles, California. The album has often been noted by critics for producer Leon Ware's exotic, low-key production and the erotic, sexual themes in his and Gaye's songwriting. The album's cover artwork adapts neo-mannerist artist Ernie Barnes's famous painting The Sugar Shack (1971).|$|E

5|$|Since I Left <b>You</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> debut studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used}} the working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 samplers. The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E

25|$|All for <b>You</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> seventh studio album by American {{recording}} artist Janet Jackson. Released on April 24, 2001 by Virgin Records America, its development and theme {{was rooted in}} Jackson's separation from husband René Elizondo, Jr, experiencing dating for the first time. Unlike The Velvet Rope, which saw Jackson tackling darker issues such as domestic violence and depression, All for You showcased an upbeat dance-pop sound, incorporating rock, disco, and funk, as well as soft rock and Oriental music. Its lyrics focus on passion, romance, and intercourse, also discussing themes of betrayal and deceit. The explicit language and sexual content of several songs drew media controversy, causing the album to be banned in several countries.|$|E

[...] As possibly you are aware, it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
500|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, {{and gives}} it to the disciples, saying, [...] "This is my body, which is given for you". He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, [...] "This cup that is poured out for <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> new {{covenant}} in my blood" [...] (...) [...] The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events. Although the Gospel of John does not include {{a description of the}} bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that [...] (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.|$|E

The album, which was {{recorded}} mainly at The Wade Studios in Ocala, Florida, from May to July 2010, {{was the first to}} feature guitarist Kevin Skaff.

500|$|Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fifth and}} final studio album by American singer Selena. Released posthumously on July 18, 1995 by EMI Latin and EMI Records, {{it was an}} {{immediate}} commercial and critical success, debuting atop the United States Billboard 200—the first predominately Spanish-language album to do so. It sold 175,000 copies on its first day of release in the U.S.—a then-record for a female vocalist. With first week sales of 331,000 units, it became the second-highest first-week sales for a female musician since Nielsen Soundscan began monitoring album sales in 1991. Billboard magazine declared it a [...] "historic" [...] event, while Time said the recording elevated Selena's music to a wider audience. It won Album of the Year at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards and Female Pop Album of the Year at the 2nd annual Billboard Latin Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Warhol clearly {{changed the}} concept of art appreciation. Instead of {{harmonious}} three-dimensional arrangements of objects, he chose mechanical derivatives of commercial illustration {{with an emphasis on}} the packaging. His variations of multiple soup cans, for example, made the process of repetition an appreciated technique: [...] "If you take a Campbell's Soup can and repeat it fifty times, you are not interested in the retinal image. According to Marcel Duchamp, what interests <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> concept that wants to put fifty Campbell's Soup cans on a canvas." [...] The regimented multiple can depictions almost become an abstraction whose details are less important than the panorama. In a sense, the representation was more important than that which was represented. Warhol's interest in machinelike creation during his early pop art days was misunderstood by those in the art world, whose value system was threatened by mechanization.|$|E
500|$|The Lake previewed in Washington, D.C., {{where there}} was a large advance sale. Harris's poor {{direction}} had eroded Hepburn's confidence, and she struggled with the performance. Despite this, Harris moved the play to New York without further rehearsal. It opened at the Martin Beck Theatre on December 26, 1933, and Hepburn was roundly panned by the critics. Dorothy Parker quipped, [...] "She runs the gamut of emotions all the way from A to B." [...] Already tied to a ten-week contract, she had to endure the embarrassment of rapidly declining box office sales. Harris decided to take the show to Chicago, saying to Hepburn, [...] "My dear, the only interest I have in <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> money I can make out of you." [...] Hepburn refused, and paid Harris $14,000 to close the production instead. She later referred to Harris as [...] "hands-down the most diabolical person I have ever met", and claimed this experience was important in teaching her to take responsibility for her career.|$|E

500|$|Tancharoen {{hinted that}} the series would {{continue}} Age of Ultrons theme of [...] "diving {{into the world}} of A.I. [...] things may not go as planned". On what makes Aida different from the villain Ultron, Whedon explained that [...] "Aida started as something that was supposed to mimic human behavior. Ultron came out almost a fully fleshed-out creature with his own agenda, where she’s been discovering hers along the way." [...] He added that instead of thousands of robots, the LMDs would be presented as android versions of the other characters in the series. Whedon said of themes that are raised in the second pod, [...] "there are issues of reality and identity. Trust is always an issue in a spy organization. It’s much worse when you don’t know if the person next to <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> person next to you ... When you get into trust, that’s when things get emotional." [...] The pod ends with the Melinda May LMD seemingly destroying herself and all the other known LMDs besides Aida, concluding her specific arc which explored the nature of humanity and identity. Asked if any of these LMDs survived this act, and could carry over to the third pod of the season, Whedon said [...] "We’ll see, but the idea was to put that chapter behind us." ...|$|E

[...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie {{to get away with}} it, especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in common}} – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E
