The rulings provide written {{assurance that}} companies’ tax-saving {{plans will be}} seen favorably by the Luxembourg authorities. The companies saved {{billions of dollars in}} taxes with these arrangements. Some firms paid less than one percent tax on the profits they shifted to Luxembourg. Employees or former employees of PwC provided documentation of the rulings to journalists. PwC UK’s head of tax was before the UK's public accounts committee and was questioned about lying regarding the marketing of these tax avoidance schemes. He told the committee the financing, investments and tax structure is legal and well-known to the British government. “If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the Lux tax regime, the politicians could change the Lux tax regime.” The disclosures attracted international attention and comment about tax avoidance schemes in Luxembourg and other tax havens. The revelations later led to a series of EU-wide measures aimed at regulating tax avoidance schemes and tax probes into several EU companies. PwC initiated charges against the two whistleblowers that revealed the LuxLeaks tax controversy. In March 2017 a Luxembourg appeals court upheld their convictions, but with reduced sentences.|$|E

This concept is expressed in the phrase [...] "you create your own reality", which may have originated with the Seth readings.

2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that when you speak about changing the oath, people think <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> all the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy {{on the death of}} Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E

[...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the things I wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black.
