40|$|The work {{presented}} here {{goes well beyond}} the words and pictures, and into the very intimate corners of my existence. This work only holds what can be represented, while the real value lies somewhere in {{between me and the}} people that surrounded me. I am grateful to Stéphane Ducasse and to Oscar Nierstrasz for giving me the opportunity to work at Software Composition Group based only on my engagement that I will be an “even better student. ” Stef, you were always energetic and supported me in so many ways. Oscar, you gave me the balance I needed at difficult times. Thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> more than my supervisors.

Acknowledgements There are many people who helped and supported me in the completion of the dissertation. First and foremost, I would like to thank everyone on my dissertation committee. Each of the five members of the committee made significant and unique contribution {{to the quality of the}} dissertation that it has achieved. My deepest thanks go to my supervisor, Dr. Pat Stout. I was lucky to have been her student and to have had her guidance on my research throughout my graduate program. She shared my tribulations as well as bliss at various moments in my academic life and never lost confidence in my ability to become a researcher. I thank her for numerous letters she wrote to make me a better candidate than I might have been. She is my ideal example of a good teacher and, more importantly, a decent human-being. She will always be my professional and personal role model...|$|R
40|$|I {{have many}} people to thank for helping through the Ph. D. process. My wife, Kelly: {{thank you for your}} love and {{patience}} with those countless nights and weekends of my “dissertating”. I would like to also thank my father, mother, and sister for their love and support. Thank you Dr. Shapiro for investing your time and energy in me these past four years. Our logic and ontology discussions have truly shaped how I now approach ontology research and also life–that’s the truly valuable part about rigourous, logical thinking. Clearly just a “thank you ” here is inadequate, but I hope to thank you furthermore by representing SNeRG, the Computer Science and Engineering Department, and the University at Buffalo well in all my future ventures. I would like to thank Dr. Rapaport for his time and energy also, and working through proofs with me, as I laid down the foundations for my work. Thank you also for the handful of stories from which so many important lessons have emerged. Thank you Dr. Smith for the valuable exchanges that helped reinforce important aspects of ontology research. Thank you to my committee as a whole for commenting on the many revisions that lead to this point of completion. I would like to thank all {{of the members of the}} SNeRG research lab, especially Jonathan Bona for the valuable user testing on the Wizard plugin application, Michael Prentice for hand-checking some of my early fitch-style proofs, and also thank <b>you</b> <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> good friends. Thank you to Andre Andrade for the valuable user testing also. iii i...|$|R
