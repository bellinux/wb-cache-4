500|$|Milk's {{reception}} by the gay {{political establishment}} in San Francisco was icy. Jim Foster, who had by then {{been active in}} gay politics for 10 years, resented the newcomer's asking for his endorsement for a position as prestigious as city supervisor. Foster told Milk, [...] "There's an old saying in the Democratic Party. You don't get to dance unless <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the chairs. I've never seen <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> the chairs." [...] Milk was furious at the patronizing snub, and the conversation {{marked the beginning of}} an antagonistic relationship between the [...] "Alice" [...] Club and Harvey Milk. Some gay bar owners, still battling police harassment and unhappy with what they saw as a timid approach by Alice to established authority in the city, decided to endorse him.|$|E
500|$|... "Deuces" [...] {{was written}} by Chris Brown, Michael [...] "Tyga" [...] Stevenson and Kevin McCall, who also {{produced}} the track.

In an interview with MTV News, Tyga elaborated on [...] "Deuces" [...] and its theme, stating: [...] "Basically it's about you getting rid of this girl, you {{tried to make it}} work, but you got to move on. So <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> one finger, put up another, and then 'Deuces. The song appeared as the opening track on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).|$|E

2500|$|Along the way, Zhang Fei {{attacked}} Jiangzhou (江州; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), {{which was}} defended by Yan Yan, a military officer serving under Liu Zhang. He defeated Yan Yan and captured him alive. Zhang Fei said to Yan Yan, [...] "When my army showed up, why did <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> resistance instead of surrendering?" [...] Yan Yan replied, [...] "You people launched an unwarranted attack on my home province. There may be generals in my province who {{will lose their}} heads, but there are none who will surrender." [...] Zhang Fei was enraged and he ordered Yan Yan's execution. Yan Yan was expressionless, and he said, [...] "If you want to chop off my head, then do it! What's with that outburst of anger?" [...] Zhang Fei {{was so impressed with}} Yan Yan's courage that he released him and treated him like an honoured guest.|$|E
2500|$|Around 212, {{conflict}} {{broke out}} between Liu Zhang and Liu Bei when the latter turned against his host {{and tried to}} seize control of Yi Province. In 214, Liu Bei summoned reinforcements from his base in Jing Province to enter Yi Province and assist him in attacking Liu Zhang. Zhang Fei, a general under Liu Bei, led troops to attack Jiangzhou (江州; around present-day Yuzhong District, Chongqing), which was defended by Yan Yan.

2500|$|Bu Zhi and Wei Jing {{settled in}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), where they {{encountered}} an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (焦征羌), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize {{the plot of}} land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, he was asleep {{so they had to}} wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, [...] "We came here because we feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him." [...] After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for them to sit outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was so unhappy that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>up</b> with this?" [...] Bu Zhi replied, [...] "We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status. What's there to be ashamed of?" ...|$|E
