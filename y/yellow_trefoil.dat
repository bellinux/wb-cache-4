50|$|Also spelled medic or meddick, {{the plant}} is known {{by a number of}} {{alternate}} names, including nonesuch, black nonesuch, black medic clover, hop clover, hop medic, black clover, black hay, blackweed, English trefoil, hop trefoil, and <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil.</b> Some of these names are also applied to wildflowers of the related genera Trifolium and Melilotus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{authority}} employed {{more than}} 12,000 people across five divisions in 1984/85. The {{aim of the}} authority was to integrate the provision of public transport in Melbourne. A green and gold livery was adopted for vehicles, with a <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil</b> logo and [...] "Metropolitan Transit" [...] tagline (later changed to [...] "The Met"). In April 1985 it purchased Melbourne-Brighton Bus Lines with 37 buses.|$|E
50|$|During the Cold War, many {{countries}} built fallout shelters for high-ranking {{government officials and}} crucial military facilities, such as Project Greek Island and Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in the United States and Canada's Emergency Government Headquarters. Plans were made, however, to use existing buildings with sturdy below-ground-level basements as makeshift fallout shelters. These buildings were usually placarded with the <b>yellow</b> and black <b>trefoil</b> sign.|$|R
50|$|A placard {{is placed}} on a {{building}} to indicate special information about that building. The most common placard which had been used is the fallout shelter black and <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil</b> indicating that a building was specifically prepared for use for emergency shelter {{in the event of}} a nuclear explosion in the area of the particular building. Temporary placards may be placed on buildings such as warning signs over tenting to indicate the building is being fumigated and that no one should enter.|$|E
40|$|Soil was a {{collected}} from 10 organic farms across the UK and evaluated {{for the presence}} of compatible rhizobia for red and white clover, lucerne and black medic (aka <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil).</b> The data details nodulation of plants grown in soil solutions from each farm, in triplicate, compared to control inoculum...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for controlling {{cabbage root fly}} was tested. Companion plants of either birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), red clover (Trifolium pratense) or <b>yellow</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Medicago lupulina) were sown into modules together with calabrese (Brassica oleracea var Italica). The presence of companion plants subsequently reduced cabbage root fly egg-laying by up to 48 % and reduced root damage considerably. Companion plant species did not affect egg-laying in this trial. Although, financially, this technique compares very favourably with an alternative strategy of applying fleece, further refinement is needed to improve the survival of companion plants on a commercial field scale as they were particularly vulnerable to damage by steerage hoes, which are used commonly in organic systems...|$|E
