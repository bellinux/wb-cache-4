(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, {{we have to say}} it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

The {{prosecution}} {{was led by}} Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: [...] "That is what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to establish." ...|$|E

You can’t approach them. It {{is one of those things}} where they want to see that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it’s a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Australian {{team lost}} the Ashes {{for the first}} time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 calling Australian rules {{football}} matches for local radio station 3AW and writing columns for The Argus newspaper. [...] Later that year, the Victorian Cricket Association appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria. [...] In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form. [...] Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, [...] "The problem is that you are not getting stuck in. [...] You're not trying." [...] When Johnson protested, Hassett continued [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> any brains, you will start taking this game seriously. [...] Because if you do you will end up captaining Australia next year." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{formed an}} {{effective}} partnership with fellow winger Ryan Fraser as Bournemouth enjoyed their best start to {{a season in}} the second tier in 2013–14. In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to use your brain {{a little bit more}} than in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E

500|$|On 8 June 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that Pratchett had an experience {{which he described}} as: [...] "It is just possible that once <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> past all the gods that we have created with big beards and many human traits, just beyond all that, {{on the other side}} of physics, there just may be the ordered structure from which everything flows" [...] and [...] "I don't actually believe in anyone who could have put that in my head". He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dixon first {{emerged into}} the public {{spotlight}} with Mis-Teeq, she was primarily the group's MC, whilst one of her band-mates Sabrina Washington usually sang lead vocals on the records. Washington encouraged her to rap from the band's inception, saying: [...] "When she started she was a bit shy, but I always said that it adds something, an element of difference. It {{was the first time}} I'd ever heard a woman MC and I was like, 'Alesha, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to do that,' and she was like 'No Bri, don't make me look stupid'". However, when she began her solo career her first UK album, The Alesha Show, saw Dixon undergo a genre-shift. The album featured no rapping and was primarily R and soul, unlike Mis-Teeq's music, which focused mainly on garage and hip hop. Dixon commented that the record consisted of [...] "a lot more guitar-written songs with pop produced around it". Dixons third album The Entertainer consists mainly of uptempo pop and dance-pop tracks.|$|E
500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I owe it to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E

500|$|Following the race, Démare {{expressed}} delight at his victory, saying: [...] "There {{are days}} {{like this one}} in which everything works despite the occasional hiccup, like crashing {{at the bottom of the}} Cipressa. I made it across at the bottom of the Poggio and the entire way I felt fantastic. [...] This is a big one and has been running for over a century. It's extraordinary. I'm extremely happy." [...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Preston North End {{asked for}} {{permission}} to speak to Westley with the view to employing him as their new manager. Though the Hertfordshire club described the approach as [...] "unwelcome", permission was granted. After personal terms and a compensation package were agreed, Westley was announced as Preston's new manager on 13 January. His first game {{in charge of the}} club was a 2–0 home defeat against Leyton Orient on 21 January. After the game, it was revealed that Westley had told players the starting line-up for the game courtesy of a 2am text message {{on the day of the}} match. He picked up his first win as Preston manager in his fourth game in charge, securing a 1–0 home victory over Hartlepool United on 14 February 2012. Following Preston's 2–0 televised defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in March 2012, Westley stated that a Sheffield Wednesday player had informed him that four Preston players had leaked the Preston team and tactics to opposition players ahead of the match. Westley stated [...] "It doesn't surprise me. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> people in your own camp working against you it is tough". Preston won just two games out of the next 17 during the remainder of the campaign, and finished the season in 15th place. At the end of the season, Westley criticised the club's [...] "mediocre" [...] mentality, stating the squad have [...] "not got a clue what it takes to get success".|$|E
500|$|Ray Kennedy {{was born}} on 28 July 1951 in Seaton Delaval, a former pit village in Northumberland, to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and {{housewife}} respectively. He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet. He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a scout at Port Vale, and began training at Vale Park after manager Stanley Matthews came to the Kennedy home {{to persuade him to}} sign schoolboy forms at the club. However at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was [...] "too slow to be a footballer". Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson claimed that he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster. Dawson also told how Kennedy was released by the club after he was told: [...] "You will never make a pro as long as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a hole in your arse!". Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts. The pair scored 142 goals between them, and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.|$|E

500|$|Childhood friends, Donnel Carty, 18, and Delano Brown, 17, {{had earlier}} that evening robbed chef Kurshid Ali, {{a middle-aged man}} in Kensal Green station, 20 minutes before Pryce arrived at the station {{on his way home}} from work. Pryce was walking from Kensal Green Tube station at about 2300 to 2330 GMT, when he was attacked. According to witness reports, Pryce was running along Bathurst Gardens from two black youths. According to {{testimony}} from Delano Brown, Donnel Carty stabbed Pryce after they had chased him from Kensal Green Tube station where police found a trail of blood and belongings, including a pair of gloves and papers regarding Pryce's wedding arrangements. As the youths chased Pryce, Carty [...] "fly-kicked" [...] him in the back and he dropped to the floor. As Pryce attempted to stand up, Carty kicked him in the face. Trying to get away, Pryce began to fight Carty, as Carty stopped him. Some time during this Pryce was stabbed twice in the chest and once in the hip, the wounds penetrating vital organs including his heart. He also suffered cuts to his head, hands and torso. As Pryce's belongings lay scattered around him, Carty and Brown took Pryce's mobile phone and Oyster card, the only possessions of value Pryce was carrying. Carty then shouted 'What else have you got?' to which Pryce responded 'Nothing. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> everything'. Carty and Brown then ran off towards Clifford Gardens, heading to Carty's home leaving Pryce dying on the ground. Pryce was later taken to Central Middlesex Hospital, where he was confirmed dead shortly after midnight.|$|E

2500|$|On anarchism, Orwell {{wrote in}} The Road to Wigan Pier: [...] "I worked out an anarchistic theory that all {{government}} is evil, that the punishment always does {{more harm than}} the crime and the people can be trusted to behave decently if you will only let them alone."
