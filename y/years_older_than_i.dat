2500|$|Bayer and I {{were in a}} lunchtime {{where we}} get to think [...] a name. [...] And ... B is, you know ... We were working for Boeing at the time, we couldn't use the name without talking to lawyers. [...] So, there is a B. [...] {{has to do with}} balance, another B. [...] Bayer was the senior author, who [...] several <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am and had many more {{publications}} than I did. So there is another B. [...] And so, at the lunch table we never did resolve whether there was one of those that made more sense than the rest. [...] What really lives to say is: the more you think about what the B in B-trees means, the better you understand B-trees." ...|$|E
60|$|Blanche is twenty--two <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. But Sara talks as if I were a mere infant.|$|E
60|$|JENNIFER. But surely--I did {{not mean}} to offend you, indeed--but you must be at least twenty <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think he}} will turn out a bad sort of fellow," [...] Ralph said. [...] "He is, as you say, rather an ass at present. I will do what I can {{to give him a}} hint; but as I should say he is at least a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, I do not suppose it will be of much use." ...|$|R
6000|$|My neighbor, Charles Sadler, the {{handsome}} young demonstrator of anatomy, came in this evening {{to return a}} volume of Virchow's [...] "Archives" [...] which I had lent him. I call him young, but, {{as a matter of}} fact, he is a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not much}} <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you are," [...] he said; [...] "a year, perhaps, but not more. I am a {{midshipman}} in the Agamemnon. My brother is a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, {{and he is}} gazetted to the Sixty-fourth; so you see, if the times were different, we should be just the right age to be your devoted servants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} that I killed him," [...] Philip replied. [...] "He seemed a brave gentleman, {{and was not}} very many <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{at school}} {{together}} in Paris. She was two <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> but she stayed there {{until she was}} twenty. Afterwards we met in Florence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please don't, mamma! I meant old for darling. You {{are hardly}} twenty-five <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. When you talk {{in that way}} my life shrivels up before me." ...|$|E
60|$|Lop-Ear was a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> but I {{was several}} times angrier than he, {{and in the}} end he took to his heels. I chased him across the open and down a run-way to the river. But he was better acquainted with the {{locality}} and ran {{along the edge of the}} water and up another run-way. He cut diagonally across the open space and dashed into a wide-mouthed cave.|$|R
6000|$|Minna was shocked. [...] "Oh, Mrs. Wagner! Mr. Engelman is more <b>than</b> twenty <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> mamma--and (<b>I</b> am sure I pity him, poor man)--and so fat!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lop-Ear, I figure, was a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> What {{his past}} history was {{he had no}} way of telling me, but as I never saw {{anything}} of his mother I believed him to be an orphan. After all, fathers did not count in our horde. Marriage was as yet in a rude state, and couples had a way of quarrelling and separating. Modern man, what of his divorce institution, does the same thing legally. But we had no laws. Custom was all we went by, and our custom in this particular matter was rather promiscuous.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She is no foolish {{young lady}} friend,' said Lilias, indignant in her turn; 'she is five <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, and papa wishes {{us to be}} {{intimate}} with her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens, I have {{forgotten}} her husband! They {{have been married}} rather more than a month. Did I tell you that she is just two <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lor', Miss Agnes, {{it is no}} account along of me. I am a {{young man}} {{by the side of}} master. He must be nigh fifteen <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Our past troubles!' {{answered}} she, 'and what do {{you call}} our lost beauty and the dreadful future before us? You are looking fifty <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> saw you last, and I know too well that fate has treated me no better!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't seem to {{be quite}} sure of what you mean," [...] he cried, [...] "or {{to be able to}} say it. Come, come, prince, if the Hebrew claims a right to remonstrate because he is twenty <b>years</b> or so <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, surely I may claim the same right, for I am full twenty <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you. <b>Is</b> it seemly to let your hot young blood boil over at every trifle? Here, let me {{replenish}} your platter, for it is ill hunting after man, woman, or beast without a stomach full of victuals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don’t {{you be a}} old fool," [...] said Mr. Boom heatedly. [...] "It’s done now, and what’s done can’t be undone. I {{never thought}} to have a {{son-in-law}} seven or eight <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> what <b>I</b> am, and what’s more, I don’t want it." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the middle}} of it all I fell asleep, to be wakened by the officious {{knocking}} at my door, and I find myself twelve <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had dreamed myself all night.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is really}} absurd, marshal. I shall feel downright ashamed {{to be called}} captain by men still lieutenants, though a dozen <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am. I fear I have gone over Lindsay's head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Easy," [...] {{said the}} startled captain. [...] "When {{you are in}} the early fifties, my lad, your ideas about age will be more accurate. Besides, Nugent is seven or eight <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am." ...|$|E
6000|$|My ghost! {{there was}} no doubt I was an {{exceedingly}} small human being. It may sound absurd, but I had never vividly realized it before. And how solemnly sitting there--like a spider in wait for flies. [...] "For goodness' sake, Miss M.," [...] I said to myself, [...] "cheer up. You are being deadly dull company--always half afraid. They daren't really do anything to you, you know. Face it out." [...] And even while I was muttering, I was reading the words cut into a worn tombstone at my feet: [...] "Jenetta Parker"--only two-and-twenty, a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> Yet she had lain here for two whole centuries and more. And beneath her name I spelled out her epitaph:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{you put it}} all on a year too far. I {{was never}} more <b>than</b> nine <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you. <b>I</b> {{remember}} it all as well {{as though it were}} yesterday when we first agreed to come away from New Zealand. When will you have to be deposited?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother, you see at {{the worst}} I can get a year's {{character}} from Dutton, so that if I can't get {{anything else to do}} I can get the same sort of place again, and as <b>I</b> am a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was when he took me, and can tie up parcels neatly now, I ought to get a little more anyhow. You see I shall be safe enough, and though I have never grumbled, you know, mother--have I?--I think I would rather do anything than be a grocer's boy. I would rather, when I grow up, be a bricklayer's laborer, or a plowman, or do any what I call man's work, than be pottering about behind a counter, with a white apron on, weighing out sugar and currants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{exactly why}} I did it--an {{audience}} of strangers. How were they to know? Come! come! don't be angry. You are eight <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am--you ought to set {{me an example}} of good-humor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was in 1801, when James Boyd was {{building}} ships for Kamehameha at Hilo," [...] Pool cast {{back through the}} calendar; [...] "which makes you seventy-nine, or eight <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> You are very old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{understand}} {{better when you}} get older," [...] said Jill. Sometimes Jill talks {{as if she were}} a hundred <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, instead of being a twin. And really, sometimes I think she is older.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, {{though perhaps}} not so tall. He is {{the brother of}} a man in the {{employment}} of Monsieur de Vevey. He has been through the last two campaigns. I find him very intelligent. He obeys my orders promptly, and as he is heart and soul in the cause of the duchess, I feel sure of his fidelity, especially as he has had a hard time of it up to now, and is, I think, grateful to me for taking him. He speaks French very well, and might certainly be of great use to me in any enterprise that your lordship might be good enough to entrust me with. Being about the same age, I think that we might perhaps go together unquestioned where a man would be unable to pass." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{father had}} left Mr. Hardinge the executor, {{and my mother}} an {{executrix}} of his will, with survivorship. He had also made the same provision as respected the guardians. Thus Grace and I became the wards of the clergyman alone {{on the death of}} our last remaining parent. This was grateful to us both, for we both truly loved this good man, and, what was more, we loved his children. Of these there were two of ages corresponding very nearly with our own; Rupert Hardinge being not quite a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was myself, and Lucy, his sister, about six months younger than Grace. We were all four strongly attached to each other, and had been so from infancy, Mr. Hardinge having had charge of my education as soon as I was taken from a woman's school.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{more than}} your {{friendship}} that I want, Miss Van Teyl," [...] he pleaded, his voice shaking a little. [...] "I am <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you, <b>I</b> know, and, by your standards, I fear unattractive. But you love power, and I have it. I will take you into my schemes. I will show you how those live who stand behind the clouds and wield the thunders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And, Gill,' added Val, 'I'm {{in second}} class too, and I took three places for knowing where Teheran was, and got above Kitty Varley {{and a girl}} there two <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am, and her name is Maura.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What nonsense! Don't {{pretend you}} are {{getting to be a}} blase man. I know that you are only about ten <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am--not more than nine, I think--and you dance very well, and no doubt you know it." ...|$|E
60|$|This lady cannot {{have been}} many <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> {{and one of those}} instantaneous, {{fleeting}} affections sprang up in me as I looked up at her for the first and only time, and seemed to see that small daughter smiling at me out of her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I {{remember}} him now. He was some {{fifteen or twenty}} <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> your father. <b>I</b> remember that I went over with your father and grandfather, and dined at his place. He is still alive and well, I hope?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a <b>year</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> saw her last," [...] {{returned}} Major Delavie, who {{had just}} dismounted from his trusty pony at his garden gate, and accepted Betty's arm; [...] "and what think you?" [...] he added, pausing that Corporal Palmer might hear his news. [...] "She has been at Bowstead, and brings fresh tidings of our Aura. The darling is as fair and sprightly as a May morning, and beloved by all who come near her--bless her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, why not?" [...] Lady Lescelles asked, smiling. [...] "I {{can only}} be a few <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> you, and <b>I</b> have been married four years. I can assure you, I wouldn't be single again for worlds. One gets {{a lot more fun}} married." ...|$|R
