When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not}} a real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and that she really got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E

[...] She also admitted she had [...] "no idea" [...] if her character would be killed off, but said in an interview with Digital Spy, [...] "at the end of the day, you just know what the show's about. You know there's a chance that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go,</b> but you have to embrace that." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to him and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward".|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to writing a weekly column for The Dallas Morning News for 15years, Marcus {{was the author}} of multiple retailing-oriented books, including Minding the Store: A Memoir (1974), the sequel Quest for the Best (1979), and His & Hers: The Fantasy World of the Neiman Marcus Catalogue (1982) He was a close friend of other writers, including Jane Trahey, an author and longtime advertising copywriter who at one time worked for Neiman Marcus, and historian David McCullough. A television presenter for the public broadcasting program American Experience, McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcus– [...] "one of the wisest men I know"– what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, [...] "I'd try to do something about television." [...] When asked why, he explained, [...] "Because", he said, [...] "If you could do something about television, think how far <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to solve all the other problems." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan first {{pitched the}} film to Warner Bros. in 2001, but then felt that he needed more {{experience}} making large-scale films, and embarked on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. He soon realized that a film like Inception needed a large budget because [...] "as soon as you're talking about dreams, {{the potential of the}} human mind is infinite. And so the scale of the film has to feel infinite. It has to feel like <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> anywhere {{by the end of the}} film. And it has to work on a massive scale." [...] After making The Dark Knight, Nolan decided to make Inception and spent six months completing the script. Nolan states that the key to completing the script was wondering what would happen if several people shared the same dream. [...] "Once you remove the privacy, you've created an infinite number of alternative universes in which people can meaningfully interact, with validity, with weight, with dramatic consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} the summer of 2012 in The Hamptons, New York, where Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z were living. She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them, including Sia, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and The-Dream. Beyoncé described the atmosphere as unconventional, saying, [...] "we had dinners with the producers every day, like a family... it was like a camp. Weekends off. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> and jump in the pool and ride bikes... the ocean and grass and sunshine... it was really a safe place." [...] She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter, taking some hours out to record music. The album's opening track [...] "Pretty Hurts", co-written by Sia, was completed during these sessions. The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded. In an interview for Vogue in January 2013, Jason Gay described Beyoncé's attention to detail as [...] "obsessive" [...] when observing her studio, noting the vision boards she created for inspiration, which contained potential song titles, old album covers and pictures of performances.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to be in New York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the war, the Allies {{had made}} use {{of a number of}} {{different}} varieties of amphibious vehicle. One of the more commonly used was the Ford GPA, {{a modified version of the}} Ford GPW Jeep (also known as a [...] "Seep"). In India towards the end of the war, Carlin had noticed a GPA in an army vehicle lot. To the mockery of his fellow engineers, he suggested that the vehicle could be used to take him around the world, supposedly remarking: [...] "with a bit of titivation, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> around the world in one of those things". This idea remained with Carlin after his marriage, and he proposed to his wife that the couple honeymoon by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a modified GPA. After a considerable amount of trouble, the Carlins finally managed to purchase a 1942 Ford GPA (serial number 1239) from a government auction in Washington, D.C., for US$901. The vehicle had originally been manufactured at Ford's plant in River Rouge, Michigan, one of 12,778 built during the war. He originally tried to convince Ford to sponsor his proposed trip, but the company refused, believing the craft would not make the journey. The vehicle required a number of modifications to make it seaworthy, including the addition of a more boat-like bow, a rudder, a larger cabin, and two extra fuel tanks – one at the bow and one under the [...] "belly" [...] of the craft, at the stern. Inside the cabin, a bunk was installed, and the dash was modified to include aircraft instruments, as well as a two-way radio (including a 19-set transmitter and receiver). In total, the vessel's length was extended by three feet to , and the fuel capacity to 200 gallons (760 L) from the original 12 gallons (45 L). The construction of the under-belly fuel tank allowed it to be jettisoned when empty, reducing further its full weight of three tons (6,720lb or 3,048kg). The vessel was christened Half-Safe, after the slogan of Arrid, a deodorant brand – [...] "Don't be half-safe – use Arrid to be sure".|$|E

2500|$|In October 2012, Ramsay opened The Fat Cow in Los Angeles, US at The Grove, a {{shopping}} {{area that is}} also popular with tourists. Ramsay explained his intention for the Fat Cow in a press release to signify {{the opening of the}} venue: [...] "The concept for The Fat Cow came from my desire to have a neighborhood restaurant that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> to all the time to just relax and enjoy a terrific meal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wessler {{first came}} up with the idea for an {{outrageous}} comedy made up of several short films in the early 2000s. [...] "It's like Funny or Die, only if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> crazy," [...] judged Farrelly, [...] "because with Funny or Die, there are certain limits. And we just wanted to do that kind of short and go much further than that." [...] Charlie Wessler affirmed that he [...] "wanted to make a Kentucky Fried Movie for the modern age".|$|E

2500|$|Harple also championed a new {{dimension}} of the social media phenomenon: individually customizable, highly mobile, location-based experiences. [...] "Rather than sitting indoors chatting to friends on an PC-based service - you can be out and about seeing who is nearby, {{what they are doing}} and where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> - all in real time", he commented. An early developer, investor, and advocate of mobile social networking technology, he saw it growing faster outside of the US, telling the New York Times in 2008, [...] "I moved to Europe because I thought the U.S. venture capital community -- which I was a part of -- was myopic," [...] he said.

[...] He continued: [...] "Your success being so complete, I should like you to consider the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered."

2500|$|Hughes was {{a skilled}} Australian rules footballer {{as a junior}} and was invited {{to play with the}} Claremont Football Club in the West Australian National Football League. He played two seasons at Claremont—1973 and 1974—alternating between the under-21 and the reserve teams, but did not manage to make the senior team. The Claremont coach, Verdun Howell, {{described}} Hughes as having [...] "Great ball skills, brilliant hand-eye coordination and a very, very reliable kickAnd he showed courage. He went full throttle at the ball and didn't look for a second option." [...] Howell told Hughes one evening at practice, [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> as far as you want in football." [...] Hughes played at full forward for the under-21 team and mainly in the centre in the reserves. His brief football career was interrupted by injury—he broke his neck falling off a desk at teachers college—and eventually he advised Howell that he was [...] "very much looking towards cricket" [...] in future.|$|E
2500|$|Marc Alexander Hunter {{was born}} in Taumarunui on 7 September 1953. In the late 1950s his family {{performed}} publicly where his father, Stuart, played saxophone, his mother, Voi, on piano and his older brother, Todd Hunter (born 1951), on guitar with Marc providing drums. He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, [...] "We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. He was {{two years older than}} me and always more interested in music. I only saw it as a way of wagging school." [...] He described his home town, [...] " [...] was a great place to grow up in, and a great place to run away from, because you always knew <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> back to it and nothing much would have changed. It was the place where our parents always told us to 'Do what you want to do, just try and be happy doing it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{interview}} in 2000, Rose mentioned {{that part of}} the delay of the album was him [...] "educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock", stating, [...] "It's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer." [...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process because you have to get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>go</b> on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E
