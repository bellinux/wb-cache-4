6000|$|What do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> {{the case}} of John O. Brown, convicted of mutinous conduct and sentenced to death? What do you desire about it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Royce, I {{want to ask}} you a few questions," [...] said Tom. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that {{diamond ring}} that {{disappeared}} at Hope while you were there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} does--now {{you speak}} of it," [...] came from Tom. [...] "And, by the way, don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that envelope {{picked up in the}} log cabin? It was postmarked Ithaca." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jonathan, <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> nothing <b>about</b> it. It has all {{passed away}} from you just as though {{you were talking to}} Captain Glomax about the fox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something that is rare {{enough with}} me, Barbara--an idea. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> {{speaking}} <b>about</b> that Asiki gold just now. Well, why shouldn't I {{go and get}} it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Gillian, I {{know you}} can be {{discreet}} when you are warned, and perhaps it is best that you should know how things stand. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> anything <b>about</b> it, Hal?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> her pet wolf. Well, it {{very soon}} {{discovered}} that {{she had come to}} the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE. Yes. Fifty pounds. Perhaps {{you don't}} {{know how it}} was. Mrs Latham, my tutor at Newnham, told my mother that I could {{distinguish}} myself in the mathematical tripos if I went in for it in earnest. The papers were full just then of Phillipa Summers beating the senior wrangler. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> it, of course.|$|E
60|$|This reminiscence of birds--entirely delightful--puts me on {{a thought}} of better {{work that you}} can do for me than even the Shakespeare notes. Each day, when you are in spirits,--never as an effort, sit down and tell me--as in this morning's note--whatever <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> birds--going back to very childhood--and just chatting on, about all you have seen of them and done for them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, no! Then {{you take}} the spring water and boil it over a {{charcoal}} fire, same as the Modoc Indians used to do. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> all <b>about</b> that, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's possible. It's a hard {{country and}} Jake took some chances {{when he brought}} you out across the snow. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> much <b>about</b> what {{happened}} when you were on the trail?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You don't know half of it,' Murdoch said; 'he told {{it all to}} her and me, boasting of the vengeance he had taken. You were a boy {{of eight}} when Mr. Hawtrey's wife died--do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> {{anything}} <b>about</b> it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{opened his}} young {{eyes and looked}} intently into her face, for there was an earnestness in her words that almost frightened him. [...] "You must think well of it all before you speak, Patrick; and {{remember}} this, you and I must be honest and honourable, whether we be poor or no. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> Owen Fitzgerald, how I gave way then because I could do so without dishonour. But now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hugh paused. [...] "It was the Bedford Mansions mystery. I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> it or {{read about}} it at the time. He'd killed a man.... It doesn't matter about the {{particulars}} anyhow, but what I mean is the effect. The effect of a comfortable well-lit orderly room and the sense of harmless people--and then the door opening and the policeman and the cold draught flowing in. Murder! A girl who seemed to know the people well explained to me in whispers what was happening. It was like the opening of a trap-door going down into some pit you have always known was there, but never really believed in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, dear," [...] she said, leaning {{down towards}} {{him as he}} walked, for now they were going on again, [...] "I told you why I wanted {{to run away from}} Bambatse, didn't I?--because I would rather risk my life than stay. Well, do you think that I wish to return there and live in that place alone with Jacob Meyer? Also, I will tell you another thing. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Seymour? Well, I can't get over that; I can't get over it at all, and therefore, {{although}} of course I am afraid, it is all one to me. No, we will escape together, or die together; the first if we can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{have been}} much, because Mary owns {{that they will}} be very poor. Here is her letter. I am so unhappy <b>about</b> it. Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> hearing <b>about</b> that Colonel Marrable who was in a horrible scrape about somebody's wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It {{would fit}} {{either of them}} equally well,” said Odo; “can <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> any details <b>about</b> the jockey’s colours? That might help us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But then {{young men}} are apt to be too sharp. I don't know whether <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> the case <b>about</b> that Orley Farm, Mr. Round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Dave Walsh was a bull for strength. And yet he {{was soft}} and easy-natured. Anybody could do him, the latest short-horn in camp could lie his last dollar out of him. ‘But it doesn’t worry me,’ he {{had a way of}} {{laughing}} off his softness; ‘it doesn’t keep me awake nights.’ Now don’t get the idea that he had no backbone. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> the bear he went after with the popgun. When it came to fighting Dave was the blamedest ever. He was the limit, if by that I may describe his unlimitedness when he got into action, he was easy and kind with the weak, but the strong had to give trail when he went by. And he was a man that men liked, which is the finest word of all, a man’s man.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{felt pretty}} cheap. But {{the thing to}} do, {{straight}} off, {{was to make a}} plan; and we done it. We would do up the paper again, just as it was, and slip in, very elaborate and soft, and lay it on the bunk again, and let on WE didn't know about any trick, and hadn't any idea he was a-laughing at us behind them bogus snores of his'n; and we would stick by him, and the first night we was ashore we would get him drunk and search him, and get the di'monds; and DO for him, too, if it warn't too risky. If we got the swag, we'd GOT to do for him, or he would hunt us down and do for us, sure. But I didn't have no real hope. I knowed we could get him drunk--he was always ready for that--but what's the good of it? You might search him a year and never find--Well, right there I catched my breath and broke off my thought! For an idea went ripping through my head that tore my brains to rags--and land, but I felt gay and good! You see, I had had my boots off, to unswell my feet, and just then I took up one of them to put it on, and I catched a glimpse of the heel-bottom, and it just took my breath away. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that puzzlesome little screwdriver?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The game {{begins with}} a surreal sequence, wherein an unknown party asks the player; “What do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that day?” The player is given several {{dialogue}} choices that build a cohesive description of [...] "that day", though at this time, the player is {{not aware of the}} event's importance. Before the game actually begins, the player is asked to draw an image depicting this mysterious scene, introducing them to the game's core drawing mechanics.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{drew the}} wood blank {{last time we}} were there," [...] said Larry. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> Mr. Runciman, <b>about</b> {{the end of last}} March?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{only some}} of Haskett's nonsense," [...] {{answered}} Caleb, ere the boy could speak. [...] "Tell us, lad, do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> dreaming anything <b>about</b> Si's gold piece?" ...|$|R
6000|$|No real whales: but the Manati, {{which is}} very nearly a whale, has long bristly hair left. Don't <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> M.'s letter <b>about</b> the one he saw at Rio Janeiro? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{day after}} his death, Kostenko's friend Yuriy Muryn {{recalled}} his last communications with Kostenko. [...] "He just called me yesterday and I didn't hear it ring. I called him back today and he didn't answer. I just can't comprehend it," [...] Muryn said. [...] "And during the first riots on Hrushevskoho he sent me his girlfriend's phone number, saying: 'Tell her that I love her, if something happens.' I thought he was joking, but when riots broke out again, he asked: 'Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> my request?'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} first {{performed}} at the Glastonbury Festival in 1995, where Cocker explained his inspiration. [...] "'Sorted for E's and wizz' is a phrase a girl that I met in Sheffield once told me... {{and she went to}} see The Stone Roses at Spike Island and I said [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> it?". And she said [...] "Well there were all these blokes walking around saying 'Is everybody sorted for E's and wizz?'" [...] And that's all she remembered about it and I {{thought it was a good}} phrase." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{featured}} a dramatic solo organ intro played by Garth Hudson. Writing in the 3rd edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Paul Evans stated that [...] "The organ mastery of 'Chest Fever' unleashed the Band's secret weapon, Garth Hudson." [...] The introduction {{is based on}} Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. In live performances, this solo evolved into an improvisation drawing from numerous musical styles and lasting several minutes. [...] "When Levon Helm has complained about the share out of royalties at this period, this is the song he quotes," [...] states Viney. [...] "His theme is that Garth's contribution was always grossly under-estimated and under-credited. As he says, 'what do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> 'Chest Fever' - the lyrics or the organ part?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, sir, that Sergeant Edwards, who, if <b>you</b> <b>remember,</b> {{advised me}} <b>about</b> warning the {{officers}} of the mutiny, should be transferred {{to one of the}} regiments coming on board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should call}} it jolly," [...] said Lily, [...] "if I {{could get up}} and go out. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> lecturing me <b>about</b> talking slang the day that he first came?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope they}} are not going to make another twenty years' war of it," [...] Lindsay said. [...] "If you go on in the way that you are doing, Drummond, you will be a field marshal in a third of that time; but <b>you</b> must <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> the proverb of the pitcher and the well." ...|$|R
5000|$|What do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb?"I don’t {{know if it}} {{was caused}} by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the ground. I couldn’t tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was more a case of my head hitting the ground. I like to think it was accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn’t know where I was. I didn’t regain all my faculties {{immediately}} so, from a safety point of view, I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical game and sometimes things like that happen." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “There isn’t a lemon jacket or cap in the race,” said Bertie, {{referring}} {{to a list of}} starters and jockeys; “can’t <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> anything <b>about</b> the appearance of the horse?
