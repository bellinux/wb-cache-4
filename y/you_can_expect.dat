In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, [...] "As I know my heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> or desire from me which I shall not be ready {{to do for the}} happiness and prosperity of England." ...|$|E
500|$|Bush {{opined that}} this record wasn't very {{different}} from their previous releases. [...] "It's still an Anthrax album with many different parts that can appeal to a wide audience. Our sound is recognizable each time you listen {{to one of our}} songs and that's something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, you have everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E

500|$|During the {{campaign}} that preceded the 1960 U.S. Presidential election, both candidates—Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy—made campaign stops in Alaska. Both men gave their support to the Rampart Dam project, with Kennedy saying, [...] "I see the greatest dam {{in the free world}} at Rampart Canyon, producing twice the power of the Tennessee Valley Authority to light homes and mills and cities and farms all over Alaska." [...] Nixon, arriving three months after Kennedy, said, [...] "As far as Rampart Canyon Dam is concerned, certainly <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> progress, more progress, I believe, in our administration than his".|$|E
500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell you that you have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every so often, the show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E

2500|$|On September 26, 1995, Wilson {{signed a}} bill authorizing the {{possible}} use {{of the death penalty}} toward any individual who committed a murder amid a carjacking or killed a juror. Wilson said the law was the result of four years worth of attempts on his part to toughen the laws against carjacking: [...] "This bill sends an unmistakable message to gang bangers: If you take someone's life while committing a cowardly carjacking, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> to pay for your crime with your own life." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt justifies his own {{contrary}} attitude at length: [...] "When one {{is found}} fault with for nothing, or for doing one's best, one {{is apt to}} give the world their revenge. All the former {{part of my life}} I was treated as a cipher; and since I have got into notice, I have been set upon as a wild beast. When this is the case, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> as little justice as candour, you naturally in self-defence take refuge in a sort of misanthropy and cynical contempt for mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unappreciated {{features}} mainly hip hop and R tracks. During {{an interview}} about the album, {{when asked about}} its composition, the group said: [...] "You can expect a lot of realness, [...] we're trying to bring real R back to the world. Right now, R is not a genre anymore. It's pop, it's hip-hop, it's other things. I wanna bring back rhythm and blues." [...] During a different interview, the girls talked about how different this album was from their shelved debut: [...] "Well it's very different coming out now because with this album we have more creative control. When we came out in 2003, we were young and we didn't {{have much of a}} say in what went down. But this time around, we were able to write every song on the album, which makes this album very personal for all of us." [...] They later added on, [...] "From this album <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> realness. Expect to hear all of our individual voices. A lot of crunk tracks like our first single 'Do It to It'. Also expect a lot of a cappella singing." ...|$|E

She sings {{about how}} [...] "chasing fast money takes {{precedence}} over self-improvement" [...] atop a mid-2000s pop music production, built around layers of hand drums and horn stabs. It was produced by Pharrell Williams and opens with Rowland saying [...] "Ooh ‘dere go my baby daddy!". The lyrics then continue on {{to speak about the}} current problems society is facing, [...] "the recession ate me alive / Tryin’ to get where the breeze is nice / So I can breath." [...] She then goes on to speak about social issues and the breakdown of society on lyrics like [...] "coming from the street life we know it's letting go / We like to go to school for education / But the street life we know don't write no notes / It's like parole with the time we’re facing." [...] Pusha T appears in the song's middle 8 where he raps about honor and US president Barack Obama, [...] "this is for my niggas with them four baby mamas...this Presidential Rollie don’t make me Obama / so don’t judge me by my jewelry, please your honor". The Huffington Post described [...] "Street Life" [...] as a departure from Rowland's previous [...] "softer sound". The standard edition of the album finishes with [...] "Stand in Front of Me", a 50's doo-wop inspired [...] "ode to love". The simple production and lyrics include the lines [...] "You just do it / Mean it / Prove it"; Hampp of Billboard said <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>expect</b> to hear the song at weddings.|$|E
