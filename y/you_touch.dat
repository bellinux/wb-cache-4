5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings in the chorus ('when <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E

25|$|Then almost, but {{not quite}} {{simultaneously}} (to ensure separate neural recognition), <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the undersurface of the hand (wrist) so gently that it barely suggests an upward push. This {{is followed by a}} similar utterly slight downward touch, and then I sever contact so gently that the subject does not know exactly when - and the subject's hand is left going neither up nor down, but cataleptic.|$|E

They worked on the opera for a week, then Verdi and his wife Giuseppina Strepponi went to Genoa. No more work was done for some time.|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics are, for {{the most}} part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their {{accompanying}} English tour, as hinted at by the opening couplet: [...] "Eight miles high and when <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> down, you'll find that it's stranger than known." [...] Although commercial airliners fly {{at an altitude of}} six to seven miles, it was felt that [...] "eight miles high" [...] sounded more poetic than six and also recalled the title of the Beatles' song [...] "Eight Days a Week".|$|E
500|$|The crew built a , [...] {{replica of}} Hasselhoff. The $100,000 replica was kept at Hasselhoff's home; he has said, [...] "It freaked me {{out because it}} was so lifelike, with teeth, when <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> it [...] feels like real skin. It's soft, like your skin." [...] At the {{completion}} of filming, Hasselhoff said, [...] "That's ridiculously awesome. What are you gonna do with it?" [...] Asked by the crew if he wanted to keep it, he answered, [...] "Uh, yeah. Okay." [...] Hasselhoff filmed in cold water, where he was pulled by a sled nine yards across the sea; he described the experience as [...] "cold but [...] lot of fun." ...|$|E

500|$|Romantic friendships {{were also}} {{popular in the}} U.S. Enigmatic poet Emily Dickinson wrote over 300 letters and poems to Susan Gilbert, who later became her sister-in-law, and engaged in another romantic {{correspondence}} with Kate Scott Anthon. Anthon broke off their relationship the same month Dickinson entered self-imposed lifelong seclusion. Nearby in Hartford, Connecticut, African American freeborn women Addie Brown and Rebecca Primus left evidence of their passion in letters: [...] "No kisses is like youres". In Georgia, Alice Baldy wrote to Josie Varner in 1870, [...] "Do {{you know that if}} <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me, or speak to me there is not a nerve of fibre in my body that does not respond with a thrill of delight?" ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 104 beats per minute. It {{is set in the}} key of E major with Madonna's voice spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3. The song has a basic sequence of E–A–B–A as its chord progression. Unlike her previous singles, the chord sequence does not repeat itself and the chorus slowly unravels to the climax of the song. Lyrically, the song talks about extreme love for one another. It contains innuendos similar to The Crystals' 1963 song [...] "Then He Kissed Me". According to scholar Dave Marsh, the lyrics talk about frank sexual desire among two teenagers. He believed that the line [...] "I'm crazy for <b>you,</b> <b>Touch</b> me once and you'll know it's true" [...] was not ambiguous and it helped Madonna to capitalize on such disambiguation.|$|E
500|$|... "Venus" [...] is a synthpop and dance-pop song {{consisting}} of four hooks. The structure and Gaga's vocal delivery {{are similar to}} that of singer David Bowie in his persona Ziggy Stardust, as well as Bananarama's 1986 single of the same name. Along with the Bowie-esque verses, there's one hook where the beat drops, then another hook where it starts building up, and finally the chorus is reached. When Bradley Stern from MuuMuse reviewed the single, he described the chorus as [...] "total pop euphoria" [...] with Gaga belting the lyrics, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me I die just a little inside / I wonder if this could be love!" [...] The song is written in the key of F minor and composed in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals range from F3 to E5, and the track follows a basic sequence of Em–D–Em–D in the first verse, G–D–Em–D in the second hook, Em–A–Em–A in the third verse, and finally Em–G–D–C in the chorus.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the video}} for [...] "Single Ladies" [...] was the {{cheapest}} and quickest {{of all her}} videos to produce, Beyoncé felt that it ended up being [...] "the most iconic... something special". It spawned a dance craze and inspired thousands of imitations all over the world, {{many of which were}} posted on YouTube. In an interview with MTV, Beyoncé expressed her appreciation of the public's response to the video, and stated that she had spent much time watching several of these parodies: [...] "It's beautiful to feel <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> people and bring a song to life with a video." [...] Nava also expressed his surprise at the positive reception of the video, and attributed its success to the video's understated, less-is-more approach. In an interview with Chandler Levack for Eye Weekly, Toronto director Scott Cudmore stated that the Internet age has impacted the way music videos are made, as well as perceived by an audience. Although Cudmore believes that the music video as a medium is [...] "disappearing ... from the mainstream public eye", he accredited [...] "Single Ladies" [...] with its resurgence, and stated that after the video appeared on the Internet, people began to [...] "consciously look for music videos because of its art".|$|E
500|$|At Electric Lady, Badu {{applied a}} {{multifaceted}} approach to recording her vocals and opted against editing them in post-production. Using her voice impressionistically, her vocals {{were characterized by}} high scales, varied frequencies, wide intervals, and time-stretched harmonies. Chavarria, who engineered the vocals with Badu, remarked on her singing, [...] "Her voice has so many frequencies, from a subharmonic of her tonic to a thin raspiness, {{and she wants to}} hear all of that." [...] Badu used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone, finding it to have enough bottom for her voice type, and cut vocal takes while situated between two speakers in the studio's control room with the monitor mix playing. She explained this setting to be more comfortable, noting the ability to hear herself sing and hold the microphone when moving around. Badu preferred to sing in one take rather than edit different takes together: [...] "When I do vocals, I am singing with a certain volume in my voice. I am singing the double and triple harmonies at different volumes. You don't have to adjust it; I have already done it. We mix as we go, so by the time we put the vocals to ½-inch tape, I know it. If <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> a damn thing, I will know it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "In the Dark" [...] is a dance-pop {{song that}} {{features}} a house rhythm and a prominent saxophone riff {{that serves as the}} song's instrumentation. Critics compared the riff to [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011) by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan. [...] "In the Dark" [...] opens with Dev's sing-talk vocal style as she sings [...] "On my waist, through my hair / Think about it when <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me there / Close my eyes, here you are dance-dance-dancing in the dark." [...] According to Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio, the line borrows the melody from Reel 2 Real's [...] "I Like to Move It" [...] (1994). [...] "In the Dark" [...] sees Dev using her singing voice more than her distinctive sing-talk style. Lyrically, the song speaks of sex drives and letting sensation of touch fully taking over from sight, as Dev repeats the line, [...] "I got a sex drive that's push to start". According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Hal Leonard Corporation, [...] "In the Dark" [...] is written in the time signature of common time and set in a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of C minor and Dev's vocals span from the note of A4 to the note of B5. It has a basic sequence of Cm–E6–A5–G5 as its chord progression.|$|E

When Pee Wee reached out to Jackie, {{all of us in the}} Negro Leaguesmiled and said it was the first time that a white guy had {{accepted}} us. When I finally got up to Brooklyn, I went to Pee Wee and said, [...] "Black people love <b>you.</b> When <b>you</b> <b>touched</b> Jackie, <b>you</b> <b>touched</b> all of us." [...] With Pee Wee, it was No. 1 on his uniform and No. 1 in our hearts. Joe Black, another major league baseball black pioneer, at Reese's funeral.|$|R

2500|$|Fourth track [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Touch</b> Me," [...] a ballad, {{revolves}} around the planning of a rendezvous. On [...] "All in Me," [...] a [...] "futuristically funked-out" [...] record according to MTV News, Brandy pleads with her lover to have faith in her, promising him that she'll provide whatever he needs. Producer Rodney Jerkins decided on {{the inclusion of a}} 2-step groove section {{during the middle of the}} song, following a gig in London, England months before where he was inspired by artists like Craig David and Artful Dodger.|$|E
2500|$|By {{at least}} 1975 Genie clearly {{understood}} and incorporated {{the concept of}} temporality into her speech, and unusually for people acquiring a first language she understood the words before and after before learning past or future tense markers. She could also use sentences to indicate causation, albeit without saying the words if and then. Despite this, by 1975 Genie remained largely unable to respond to sentences where the nouns {{were not in the}} same sequence as the events, such as [...] "Touch your ear after <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> your nose", although she improved more with sentences asking her to do something after instead of doing something before. In a 1981 paper Curtiss interpreted Genie's temporal utterances as an expansion of Genie's vocabulary, but an outside analysis of Curtiss' writings concluded that Genie had to have acquired some degree of grammar to have formed these sentences.|$|E
2500|$|In 1863, Saulsbury was a vehement {{critic of}} President Abraham Lincoln's administration. [...] Opposing {{the war in}} general and the {{suspension}} of habeas corpus specifically, Saulsbury attempted to prevent a vote sustaining that controversial executive order. [...] Apparently intoxicated, Saulsbury verbally attacked the President on the Senate floor in what John Hay described as [...] "language fit only for a drunken fishwife". [...] Senator Saulsbury called Lincoln [...] "an imbecile" [...] and stated that the President was [...] "the weakest man ever placed in a high office". [...] When Vice President Hannibal Hamlin called Saulsbury to order, the Senator refused to take his seat. [...] Finally, the Senate's sergeant-at-arms approached to remove Saulsbury from the Senate floor when the Senator suddenly brandished a revolver, placed it against the sergeant's head and said, [...] "Damn you, if <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me I'll shoot you dead!" [...] Eventually, Saulsbury was calmed and removed from the Senate floor.|$|E

2500|$|Norwood’s initial {{sound was}} {{contemporary}} R, heavily rooted in gospel and hip hop soul. Her lyrics spoke {{of various types}} of love, from casual and friendly love to romantic and spiritual affairs. Influenced by Houston and Carey, she incorporated a ballad-heavy style and an adult contemporary feel into her urban-pop sound for her second studio album Never Say Never. Her third studio album Full Moon saw Norwood abandon her teenage appeal for a more adult and sensual edginess. Along with her image, her voice had gone through a major change, trading her girlish rasp for a now deeper and warmer voice that had acquired a somewhat throatier, smoky edge. The music also reflected the change, as songs like [...] "When <b>You</b> <b>Touch</b> Me" [...] and [...] "Like This" [...] explored more adult, sexual topics, and a sound that blended her previous urban-pop sound with heavy influences of UK garage, glitch, and electro-funk.|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{addressed}} {{the subject of}} Mother Teresa on several occasions before publishing The Missionary Position. In 1992 he devoted one of his regular columns in The Nation to her. In 1993 he discussed her during an interview on C-SPAN's Booknotes, noting public reaction: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the idea of sainthood, especially in this country, people feel you've taken something from them personally. I'm fascinated because we like to look down on other religious beliefs as being tribal and superstitious but never dare criticize our own." [...] In 1994 he contributed to a 25-minute essay broadcast on British television. A New York Times critic thought the show should provoke other journalists to visit Calcutta and conduct their own investigations. He recounted {{his work on the}} television production in Vanity Fair in early 1995. In the foreword to The Missionary Position, he described these activities as [...] "early polemics", part of [...] "a battle" [...] and estimated that The Missionary Position represented an expansion of the television script [...] "by about a third".|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the land}} of Mordor where it was forged, the Ring's power {{increased}} so significantly that even without wearing it the bearer could draw upon it, and could acquire an aura of terrible power. When Sam encountered an orc in the Tower of Cirith Ungol while holding the Ring, he appeared to the orc as a powerful warrior cloaked in shadow [...] " [...] some nameless menace of power and doom." [...] The orc was so terrified that it fled. Similarly at Mount Doom, when Frodo and Sam were attacked by Gollum, Frodo grabbed the Ring and appeared as [...] "a figure robed in white... held a wheel of fire." [...] Frodo told Gollum [...] "in a commanding voice" [...] that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom," [...] a statement fulfilled when Gollum fell into Mount Doom with the Ring. Although the Ring was certainly invoked with this statement, {{it is unclear whether}} Frodo was prophesying (Frodo had previously seen less sinister visions while in possession of the Ring), or if Frodo was actively laying a curse upon Gollum.|$|E
