25|$|During Halloween Haunt, {{a similar}} system named 'Fright Lane' is sold. Essentially {{the same purpose}} as Fast Lane, it {{significantly}} reduces wait time of select haunted attractions. 'Fright Lane+' includes a 'Skeleton Key', a key that grants you special access to secret, intense rooms in six of the eight haunted houses. In addition, <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> special seating for Ed Alonzo's Psycho Circus of Magic and Mayhem. 'Fright Lane Max' is a VIP system that allows you special seating at Overlord's Awakening, a meal, limited edition Haunt T-shirts, plus all perks listed above.|$|E
25|$|When {{different}} {{materials are}} brought {{together and then}} separated, an accumulation of electric charge can occur which leaves one material positively charged while the other becomes negatively charged. The mild shock that <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> when touching a grounded object after walking on carpet {{is an example of}} excess electrical charge accumulating in your body from frictional charging between your shoes and the carpet. The resulting charge build-up upon your body can generate a strong electrical discharge. Although experimenting with static electricity may be fun, similar sparks create severe hazards in those industries dealing with flammable substances, where a small electrical spark may ignite explosive mixtures with devastating consequences.|$|E

25|$|Taxi fares in Dallas {{compared}} to other large U.S. cities is very reasonable. The meter rate is $2.25 plus 20¢ every 1/9 mile. Additional passengers or pets (excluding service animals) are $2 extra, each. Also, fares {{to and from the}} two principal airports (DFW International Airport and Dallas Love Field) to Downtown Dallas and the Dallas Market Center area are set at a flat rate. Those rates are: $41 for DFW to or from Downtown Dallas, $18 to or from Dallas Love Field to Downtown, and $32 to or from DFW International to Dallas Market Center. Be advised: a fuel surcharge may also be added to fares if gas prices reach $2.50 per gallon or more for three consecutive weeks. In an April 2011 study conducted by the Chicago Dispatcher, Dallas taxis charge an estimated $12.75 for a distance of five miles with five minutes wait time. Tipping is not required, but is a good gesture if <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> good service from the driver.|$|E
25|$|As in {{all other}} Trading Card Games, booster packs are the primary avenue of card {{distribution}}. In Konami's distribution areas, five or nine random cards are found in each booster pack depending on the set and each set contains around one hundred different cards. However, in Upper Deck's areas, early booster packs contained a random assortment of nine cards (rarity and value varies), with the whole set ranging around one hundred and thirty cards. To {{catch up with the}} Japanese meta game, two or more original sets were combined into one. Now, more recent Upper Deck sets have simply duplicated the original set. Some booster sets are reprinted/reissued (e.g. Dark Beginnings Volume 1 and 2). This type of set usually contains a larger number of cards (around 200 to 250), and they contain twelve cards along with one tip card rather than the normal five or nine. Since the release of Tactical Evolution, all booster packs that have a Holographic/Ghost Rare card, will also contain a rare, meaning if <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> a Holofoil card in a pack you will still receive 1 Rare card and 7 Common cards. Current sets have 100 different cards per set. There are also special booster packs that are given to those who attend a tournament. These sets change each time there is a different tournament and have fewer cards than a typical booster pack. There are eight Tournament Packs, eight Champion Packs, and 10 Turbo Packs.|$|E

The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E

According to The Guardians Paul MacInnes, The Ecstatic featured his characteristically [...] "fragmented lyrical style, which looped words within phrases and played on sound {{as much as}} meaning". [...] "Auditorium" [...] showcased his [...] "complex and convoluted" [...] lyricism delivered closely in rhythm with the beat, Patrin said, citing the lines [...] "soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren / I swing 'round, wring out and bring down the tyrant / chop a small axe and knock a giant lopsided". He explored Afrocentric themes on [...] "Revelations" [...] and compared love to a gunfight on [...] "Pistola". On [...] "Roses", Muldrow sang nature-friendly lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. [...] "Roses is about creativity and human capacity", she explained. [...] "A lot of times Western society makes [...] base our sense of worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how you prove your love to somebody... but <b>you</b> <b>receive</b> so many gifts and still feel empty.
