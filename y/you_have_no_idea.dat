In the book, Williams discusses her childhood, rise to fame, and personal struggles (including life with type 1 diabetes), {{including the fact that}} she was sexually molested by a woman when she was 10 years old. She also spoke candidly about having an abortion while she was in high school.|$|E

After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you {{with all my heart}} and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|The {{set list}} {{consisted}} of songs from her debut album mainly, but some new songs like [...] "Fashion" [...] from the Confessions of a Shopaholic soundtrack were also considered. In May, {{during an interview}} with Edmonton Sun Gaga announced that the tour would continue through European festivals in summer. She also declared plans for a bigger North American tour including Canada. Gaga explained that the show {{is supposed to be}} much bigger than the previous version. She said, [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea,</b> [...] The tour that we're about to announce is such a dream that I have to pinch myself almost every day to remind myself that it's happening." ...|$|E

500|$|The 808 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} inventions in popular music. According to Sound on Sound, the machine [...] "spawned an industry of clones and sample libraries"; samples of its sounds are common in modern music software. Flavorwire wrote that [...] "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own — you know the sounds even if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts." [...] The New Yorker wrote in 2015 that the 808 is the bedrock of the modern [...] "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that [...] "embraces and fetishizes... street music from the past." [...] According to Slate, it was instrumental in pop music's shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to [...] "thinking in terms of sequences, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum." ...|$|E

2500|$|In many regards, The Getaway was a {{frustrating}} repeat {{of his earlier}} experience with Kubrick. Thompson wrote a script, but Steve McQueen (who was cast in the movie's lead role of Doc McCoy) rejected it as too reliant on dialogue, with not enough action. Though Walter Hill was given the sole script credit, Thompson insisted that much of his script {{ended up in the}} film. Thompson sought Writers Guild arbitration but the Guild ultimately ruled against him. In the end, the film was heavily bowdlerized from Thompson's original vision and as King writes, [...] "if you have seen only the film version of The Getaway, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where Sam Peckinpah ended the story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richardson was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. [...] Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: [...] "I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. [...] <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how hot it makes me to think of the way some of these players have acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|During her {{reign as}} Miss America Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that [...] "there {{were a lot}} of people that did not want me to be {{representative}} of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There {{were a lot of}} people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was." [...] She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>No</b> <b>Idea).</b> Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she [...] "wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got {{a story that is}} possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. I am truly blessed.

2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> {{what is going to happen}} to you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E
