The New York Daily News thought the film was [...] "dated" [...] and that [...] "relying on obvious clichés doesn't seem ironic anymore, just easy." [...] The Toronto Sun gave the film a mixed review, writing that [...] "this installment is nowhere near the hip, serrated-edge blast of newness the original was in 1996.

Meissner has cited her personal experience as a second-generation immigrant in a family speaking a foreign language as critical to helping her better empathize with the migrant perspective as she took on key roles in managing the United States immigration enforcement apparatus. Recalling an incident where her father, who had arrived in 1927, lost his naturalization papers in a fire, and was anxious if he could get a copy, she said: [...] "When <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> immigrants, you grow up understanding immigration in a way that you never could from a textbook: how precious and difficult it is." ...|$|E

It remains on his mind the whole day and he resolves to remain awake the next night, and confirm it was not merely a dream. This time, however, Pundalik is very curious. He approaches the beautiful women and asks details. They reply, they are the Ganga (Ganges), Yamuna and other holy rivers of India—revered for their holiness. Pilgrims wish to take a dip in their holy waters to wash away their sins, which in fact are soiling their clothes. Then, the women say: [...] "But O Pundalik, you, with your ill-treatment of <b>your</b> <b>parents,</b> <b>are</b> the greatest sinner of them all!" [...] Pundalik is utterly shocked and his consciousness transforms. He realizes his misdeeds, becomes entirely devoted to his parents and ensures their comfort, even risking his own.|$|E

He visits his old neighbors, the Beumers, and then the {{monument}} erected to honor in his parents and 29 others who died the same night in reprisal for Ploeg's assassination. A few years later, he chances upon an old schoolmate, Fake Ploeg's son who bears his father's name. This Fake compares their outcomes, Anton an orphan and he the son of collaborators whose mother became a cleaning woman to support her children: [...] "'We're in the same class, <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>are</b> shot, but you're doing medical studies all the same, whereas my father was shot and I repair water heaters.'" [...] Fake defends his father as an anti-Communist and blames the death of the Steenwijks on the Communist resistance fighters who knew that reprisals would follow their assassination of his father. Anton rejects his logic: [...] "'Your father was killed by the Communists with premeditation because they decided that it was essential, but my family was senselessly slaughtered by Fascists, of whom your father was one.'" [...] Fake counters: [...] "'As your house went up in flames, we got the news that our father was dead.... I've thought of what you went through; did you ever do the same for me?'" ...|$|E
