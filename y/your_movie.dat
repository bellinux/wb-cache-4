It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The great thing about the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters." [...] He added that, for directors to [...] "fit" [...] in at Marvel, they must understand how to [...] "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.|$|E

2500|$|Former pairing Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez incited {{unprecedented}} {{media attention}} for an American modern-day supercouple during their 2002-2004 courtship. The two {{were referred to}} as the first superstar couple of the Internet age, [...] and the pairing's popularity resulted in their being known by the portmanteau [...] "Bennifer" [...] (for Ben and Jennifer) to the media, as well as to fans using the name combination. The term Bennifer itself became popular, and started the trend of other celebrity couples being referred to by the combination of each other's first names. The pairing eventually succumbed to overexposure, which caused public interest in their romance to result in less admiration and negatively affected their careers. In 2007, Affleck stated: [...] was probably bad for my career. What happens is this sort of bleed-over from the tabloids across <b>your</b> <b>movie</b> work. You go to a movie, you only go once. But the tabloids and Internet are everywhere. You can really subsume the public image of somebody.
