40|$|Market {{research}} for would-be exporters Cue: Have you ever woken {{up in the}} morning with a fantastic idea for a new business ? or perhaps lain awake thinking about a new idea that is sure to be a success? If you want to follow up your idea, what?s the next step? We may rush straight in, determined to make our idea a reality as quickly as possible. We sometimes even avoid thinking about the possible problems, just praying the idea will work. Occasionally we might be lucky, but without proper preparation, failure is a strong possibility. A better approach may be to start with some market research. We need to find out whether our new venture is really going to meet a market need ? that people are really going to buy what we are planning to produce. But what kind of things do we need to find out, and how do we go about it? Bruce Mtingwe advises on market research strategies, and he offered some useful advice to Busani Bafana. IN:	?It is very important first of all? OUT:	?exporting their produce. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Bruce Mtingwe, with some useful experience of selling to foreign markets. He was speaking to Busani Bafana and the interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mtingwe	It is very important first of all to not {{spend a lot of money}} before you know where to spend most of your effort. And so the first step that is really important is to undertake an extensive desk research that will enable you to know exactly where to go and look for what information. That is very important. Bafana	What then are the advantages of doing market research? Mtingwe	Well market research is a very advantageous process. Trying to market without market research is trying to shoot in the dark. You may or you may not get your target but when you do market research you increase the prospect of getting your target. You get more precise information that you require to undertake a successful marketing activity. Bafana	Such as what? What sort of precise information are we looking at here? Mtingwe	You are looking at things like consumption habits. How does my market consume my product? Where do they buy this product? How often is the purchase cycle? Which shops do they want to buy from? Why do they not buy from those? What is their perception in terms of foreign products? Do they think foreign products are better products than local products? How do they view foreigners? Those are some of the things that you are able to isolate through your market research and without having done market research you will not really know, except through mistakes that you will then be making in the market, but by that time it may be too late. Bafana	<b>You</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> issue of expense. What expenses can I as a farmer incur when I am doing market research? Mtingwe	There are expenses of travelling to your market. There are expenses of information acquisition. There are expenses of accommodation. There are expenses of talking to people because sometimes you find that you need to organise focus groups with individuals and you need to pay those individuals for that time that they are according you and indeed the information that they are giving you. It can become quite a costly exercise. But let me add also that this cost should in fact be viewed as an investment because at the end of the day it pays back to invest in a market research exercise because the alternative is worse. Bafana	Would you then just relate to us an example of an organisation that has used this approach and with what results? Mtingwe	We have a group of farmers in the Plumtree area, Matabeleland, south of the country. They have decided that there is a lot of potential in marula. They have marula in abundance and then have decided that they want to start a project that is based on marula and indeed export marula by-products. At the moment they decided that they were going to start with marula oil processing. And so the challenge then that they faced was that in Zimbabwe there was no market for marula oil. At least not a market that appreciates the value of the marula oil. Bafana	So what did they do? Mtingwe	And so what they did, they decided that they are going to export this marula oil. But the problem that they faced was that they did not have any export market knowledge and so they then decided that they are going to seek help. And a particular organisation, a local NGO came and assisted them in terms of identifying a potential market outlet for their product. And this market outlet happened to be an organisation in South Africa that deals with marula oil and so they basically decided that they are going to export to that organisation. However the organisation then further exported the same product to France. And so at the end of the day the local farmers were exporting to France via another organisation in South Africa. Bafana	What challenges did they have to overcome, in fact, to realise that success? Mtingwe	The first challenge that they faced was that they did not have the significant volumes that were required to do the business on a reasonable scale. And so what the South African importer did, they offered to take orders from this organisation until they had satisfied a certain minimum quantity and then at that point then the export would be done. So they would be exporting to South Africa let?s say for example two hundred litres per month of oil until say a quantity of twenty thousand litres was achieved at which point the South African organisation would then export to France. That was the first challenge that they had in terms of quantity. The second challenge that they had was in terms of payment. Now unlike the local market, that when you sell something you immediately get your proceeds or do so within a short period time. In the case of an export market you need to wait quite a long time, from anything between thirty to one hundred and eighty days and that made things a bit difficult in the sense that they now needed and go and seek loans to finance their working capital. Bafana	There you are listeners, it is an important step to actually undertake the market research particularly for organisations or for farmers who are thinking of exporting their produce.

40|$|Commercial {{pollination}} services Cue: Like {{people and}} animals, plants generally need contact with another, similar plant {{in order to}} produce offspring. In the case of flowering plants, the offspring are of course the seeds, sometimes contained within larger fruit. Plants fertilise each other through their pollen, which forms in the flower. Insects, such as bees, are attracted to the sugars in flower nectar, but as they move from flower to flower, they pick up tiny grains of pollen, stuck to their legs or bodies. These pollen grains drop into other flowers they visit, fertilising them. Pollen can also be spread on the wind, but when large numbers of insects are present, rates of pollination will also be much higher, and so will be the harvest. For this reason some commercial farmers are ready to pay to have bees kept in their fields. This is a completely different way for beekeepers to earn an income. In this situation, the bees may not produce much honey, but the bee-keeper will be paid by the farmer for the pollination services that the bees provide. In Zimbabwe, for example, beekeeper Judy Ross is paid 50 US cents per hive per day, and may rent over 100 hives to a single farmer for as much as 9 months of the year. Busani Bafana spoke to Judy about her pollination business, and began by asking just how much of a difference bees can make to a farmer?s crop yields. IN:		?On a commercial site ? OUT:		?been purely for pollination. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 54 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Judy Ross, a Zimbabwean bee-keeper who rents her bee hives to farmers, to improve crop pollination and thereby increase their yields. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Ross	On a commercial site you can expect up to 40 % increase in the yield of your crop, but for everything you will get an increased crop. Bafana	I take it then that a different crop will need a different number of hives? Ross	That is correct yes. Depending on the crop, like say for instance runner beans, runner beans need two hives per hectare, but something like your lucerne, alfalfa, would need up to 4 to 5 hives per hectare. Bafana	In a rural setting where farmers are growing maize and maybe leaf vegetables is it then important that they should have a specific number of hives per certain hectarage of land? Ross	Maize would probably be about two hives per hectare, but most of the communal people do under-sow to things like pumpkins and the bees would still pollinate those as well. But I would say for a normal person in the communal areas that two hives for their working area would probably be adequate. Bafana	Say a farmer wanted to actually move the hives to a new farm, what is a good practice for doing so? Ross	First of all he would have to go and look at the area that he was moving it to. He would need to clear a small area around where he was siting his hives, so that the incidence of ants and trees and grasses would not interfere with the flight path of the bees going in and out. Then he would have to check on the access to a water source, whether it be a natural water source or a dripping tap and also check on the direction of the sunrise and set. Bees normally like to face the rising sun and also where the prevailing wind is so that when they come in laden they are actually carried into the hive. Bafana	<b>You</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> whole issue of the siting. What about the presence of an open space or where there are trees, does that matter? Ross	Not particularly providing the bees are actually facing into the crop {{that they are going to}} pollinate or they are in the middle of the crop that they are going to pollinate. It would be better that they were in the centre or on the edge rather than have a bunch of trees hindering them before they get to the crop to pollinate. Bafana	What about if the hives are located near the homestead, could that interfere? Ross	Not really providing that the owners of the homesteads and their children know not to disturb the bees; because normally bees will not hurt anyone unless they are bothered or upset. Bafana	Say now the farmer has actually found a good site and they have gone ahead to actually prepare to move the bees, when should the bees then be introduced and how long will the bees need for them to stay with the crop to achieve effective pollination? Ross	Pollination for a communal person is actually very much more difficult. My advice would be rather to have the owner of the property who requires pollination to have the bees on site throughout the whole year, rather than take your bees there, pick them up and bring them back. Bees do not like being moved short distances. So it is better to actually leave the bees within the area that they are going to be pollinating and if possible make the owner of the property responsible for looking after your bees. Bafana	Say there is a need for the farmer to move the bees, are there any precautions that they should take? Ross	Most definitely. Bee-keeping and most of the bee removals should be done at night for a very sound reason. During the day if anyone upsets the bees there are humans and animals which could be attacked by bees who might have got very upset when you have actually picked up and moved the hive. But at night all the bees are in the hives and if you went along and sealed up the entrance with a rag or something and then picked up the box and moved it to wherever it was needed and then removed the rag, there would be less problems and less incidence of upset bees. Bafana	I want to move into marketing, what kinds of farmers are interested in using bees for pollination, as you offer that service? Ross	It is people who do export, it is people who are in a marginal area and for some reason feel that they are not getting the full potential from their crops. Bees will then definitely push up the production. Bafana	For a farmer interested in the transition, say, moving from a communal scale into commercial scale, what type of investment are we looking at? Ross	It would depend entirely as to who he has approached for pollination and what their hectarage was, because that would then tell you how many hives you would need to start off with. If you were doing a rotation of a crop that basically went on for most of the year, bar three months, and the crop size was maybe 30 hectares total, you would probably need 120 hives. Bafana	Does the beekeeper normally keep or even sell their honey when the bees are used for pollination? Ross	If there is any honey from pollination the honey belongs to the beekeeper, but most of the crops that I have pollinated have had no honey at all. It has been purely for pollination.
