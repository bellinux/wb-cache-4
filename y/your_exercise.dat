This qualitative study explores the perceptions of patients regarding the effects of exercise on joint health. Methods. A purposive sample of 12 female and 6 male RA outpatients [age: 23 – 76 years; disease duration: 2. 5 months to 33 years; HAQ score: 0 – 2. 13] participated in four moderated focus groups. The main questions addressed were: (i) How do you feel exercise affects your joints?; and (ii) What affects <b>your</b> <b>exercise</b> behaviour? Transcriptions were independently analysed with 455 meaning units identified. An inductive, thematic analysis was conducted using established techniques. Discussion with a third analyst contributed to consensus validation. Results. Sixteen constructs emerged, clustering into five themes, reflecting the issues relating to exercise and joint health in RA patients. Emergent themes were: ‘health professionals showing a lack of exercise knowledge’, ‘not knowing what exercise should be done’, ‘worry about causing harm to joints’, ‘not wanting to exercise as joints hurt ’ and ‘having to exercise because it is helpful’. Conclusions. RA patients demonstrated awareness {{of the advantages of}} exercise for their joints, both experientially and through education. However, they perceived that health professionals lacked certainty and clarity regarding specific exercise recommendations and the occurrence of joint damage.

For the construction of a pedagogical-musical approach centered on listening the teaching strategies to expand the listening proposed by Schafer (2011) were mapped as well as four musical pieces by the composer Luciano Berio were analyzed. Our hypothesis was that the use of the teaching strategies proposed by Schafer for the active appreciation of Berio repertoire could enhance the development of a renewed musical listening, which would require from the students and the teacher an extension or a expansion of concepts of what they understand by «music». The results showed that the young participants expressed interest in the contemporary repertoire as they were being instrumentalized by the developed mediation activities. Mediation was carried out through active listening proposals through creative action on the sounds around us and on the selected repertoire.

Background: Exercise {{is considered}} an important component {{in the management of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and has been found to improve aerobic capacity, muscle strength, functional ability and psychological well-being. However, RA patients are less active than the general population. Current perceptions of RA patients on the effects of exercise, specifically regarding joint health, have not been fully explored. This information would enhance the patient-centred approach to exercise prescription. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the current perceptions of the effects of exercise on joint health in RA patients. Methods: Following ethical approval, a purposive sample of 12 female and 6 male RA outpatients (mean age: 59. 1 13. 6 years; disease duration: 2. 5 months? 33 years; HAQ score: 1. 0 0. 7) were recruited.

This study was research and development (R&D). It was done through the following steps i. e. analyzing the students’ needs, writing the course grid, designing the website, evaluating the first draft, revising the first draft, trying-out the website, evaluating the second draft, and revising the second draft. It used three techniques of the data collection namely administering questionnaires, interviewing the students, and observing the class. The data from the questionnaires were analyzed quantitatively and {{the data from the}} interview and observation were analyzed qualitatively. The collected data were analyzed to know the appropriateness of the website designs and characteristics. The findings show that the appropriate design of the web-based listening learning material has the following components namely homepage, listening room, chit chat, discussions room, and contact us.

40|$|Obesity {{and climate}} change {{are two of the}} biggest public health crises that the world {{currently}} faces and will face for many years to come, unless action is taken to halt the causes. The link between diet, physical activity and obesity has been firmly established. The causes of obesity are however, a multi-faceted problem, as are the causes of climate change. Current food production has been linked to increasing levels of CO 2, and current eating habits can be responsible for a large carbon footprint. Growing your own food has been suggested as a method of reducing one’s carbon footprint, increasing physical activity levels and improving diet, little evidence exists to support this theory. This study looks at the fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels {{and climate change}} awareness of allotment holders in two wards of Stockport. Qualitative and quantitative data was collected via face to face questionnaires (n= 28) at both allotments sites. Fruit and vegetable intakes of allotment holders were above those of the U. K. general public and intake increased after allotment ownership. Physical activity levels were on average, higher than the recommendation of thirty minutes a day for at least five days per week and generally increased after uptake of the allotment. Allotment owners rent their plots for a combination of reasons, the majority wanting to grow their own food, and get exercise and most also cite some form of environmental issue. All participants were aware of climate change and although not all thought it would affect allotments; most had ideas of what they would do to adapt to changes. There are synergies between solving climate change issues, such as Green House Gas emissions and improving our health, both physically and nutritionally.

For example {{the strength of the}} muscle varies dependent on the position of the muscles. To get the best results of the exercise the load has to reduce and increase at specific positions. This study was made in cooperation with Caretaker Scandinavia AB, a company for sales, marketing and development in health care. They are general agent for Nordic Gym who works with manufacturing of equipment and machines for gym and fitness. The aim {{of this study was to}} generate a method of measurement to evaluate and control the biomechanics of Nordic Gym´s workout equipment. A protocol for an ergonomic analysis on the equipment has also been elaborated. One of the methods to measure the biomechanics was to measure the torque through the whole movement. The other method was electromyography (EMG). The EMGequipment registers electric signals that are generated in a working muscle, and makes it possible to see when the maximum muscle activity achieves. The results of those measurements will be compared to the muscles strengthprofile which describes how the muscle generates power in different positions throughout the movement. To measure the ergonomics an ergonomic protocol where produced, which was based on ergonomics aspect, adapted to gym machines. The method of measurement where tested on Nordic Gym´s training machine 101 SE leg extension and Free Motion´s machine Leg Extension GZF 18013 and this machines where controlled and evaluated. Two test persons tried out the machines and the machines where analysed in an ergonomic and a biomechanical perspective. The result shows that the biomechanics of Nordic Gym´s machine where a bit better than the biomechanics of FreeMotion´s machine. But in the both case the difference between the values of torque is marginal, to improve the biomechanics insistence a bigger different should be necessary to use. The ergonomic analyse of the machines showed that the ergonomics where good and well planed. Both machines had some small ergonomic lacks, which can be improved...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo desta pesquisa foi {{investigar}} se os alunos da graduação em psicologia articulam as suas crenças religiosas com os conhecimentos que estão adquirindo no curso, e como isso é feito. A psicologia é uma ciência múltipla, abarca uma variedade de abordagens teóricas e técnicas e presta-se a trabalhar com uma temática diversificada. O tempo de duração de um curso de graduação é insuficiente para ensinar ao aluno tudo o que seria desejável, conseqüentemente o curso deixa lacunas a serem preenchidas ao longo de uma formação continuada. Uma dessas lacunas diz respeito ao modo de o psicólogo compreender e manejar na clínica, questões referentes à religião e à espiritualidade. O psicólogo depara-se com a distância entre o que aprendeu na graduação e as demandas de seu exercício na prática clínica e é cada vez mais frequente a referência a questões espirituais e religiosas nos consultórios de psicologia, o que exige que o psicólogo dirija o seu olhar para estes temas. Tratou-se de uma pesquisa qualitativa, tendo como instrumento de investigação a entrevista não diretiva, na busca de explorar e compreender a experiência do aluno no decorrer do curso, na articulação de suas crenças religiosas, adquiridas ao longo de sua vida, e os conhecimentos sobre o homem e seu comportamento, ofertados no curso de psicologia. Participaram da pesquisa cinco alunas dos últimos semestres da graduação em psicologia de uma universidade localizada na cidade de São Paulo. A análise das entrevistas mostrou que existem diversas formas de manejar os efeitos do encontro entre as crenças religiosas e os conhecimentos adquiridos com a psicologia, e que este encontro pode produzir intensos conflitos ou ampliar os conhecimentos e as experiênciasThe {{objective of}} this research was to investigate if the graduate students in psychology articulate their religious beliefs with the knowledge that they are getting in the course and how this is done. Psychology is a multiple science, covers a variety of theorical approaches, techniques and works with diverse themes. The duration of a graduate course is insufficient to teach the student everything that would be desirable, therefore the course leaves gaps to be filled over the course of an ongoing education. One of these gaps refers to the method of the psychologist to understand and handle in the clinic, questions related with religion and spirituality. The psychologist faced with the distance between what he learned in graduate and the demands of <b>your</b> <b>exercise</b> in the practical clinic and each time is most frequent the reference with questions spiritual and religious in the offices of psychology, which requires that the psychologist look at these themes. Through a qualitative research, with a tool of investigation that is the nondirective interview, aiming to explore and understand the students experience during the course, the articulation of their religious beliefs, acquired throughout his life, and the knowledge about the man and his conduct, offered in the psychology course. Five students of the last semester of graduate psychology participated of the research at a university in the city of Sao Paulo. The analysis of the interviews showed that {{there are several ways to}} handle the effects of the encounter between religious beliefs and knowledge gained from psychology, and with this meeting can produce intense conflicts or increase their knowledge and experience...|$|E
