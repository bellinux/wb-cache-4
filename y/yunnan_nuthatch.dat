The <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch</b> can cope with some tree loss, since it prefers open pine woodland, but although still locally common, it has disappeared from {{several of the}} areas in which it was recorded in the early 20th century. The threat to yellow-billed is particularly acute on Hainan, where more than 70% of the woodland has been lost in the past 50 years due to shifting cultivation and the use of wood for fuel during Chinese government re-settlement programmes.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{nuthatch}} {{can occur}} in the same habitat as the <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch,</b> but lacks a white eyebrow.

25|$|The diet of the <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is not well-known, but it {{is known}} to consume insects it catches on pine branches.

25|$|The <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is {{a fairly}} noisy bird, and {{typically}} makes many individual sounds: nit, kni, tit, pit, or a low and nasal toik. Its cry, nit, is repeated in sets lasting four to ten seconds of five to six repetitions per second, produsing a kni-kni-kni, kit-kit-kit, pi-pi-pi, or a nasal niew-niew-niew sound. It also produces a harsh schri-schri-schri or szi-szi-szi cry, a trait shared by other small nuthatches. It sometimes produces a ziew-ziew-ziew cry in calm sets of three notes per second, and can also emit nasal cries quit-quit-quit, schu-schu-schu, or tui-tui-tui.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Zheng Zuoxin {{described}} the <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch</b> as rare, {{but it is}} locally common {{in areas such as}} Lijiang's pine forests. It has a small range of around , and the bird disappeared from several locations in the early twentieth century. It is threatened by habitat destruction and is dependent on old pine forests, but also appears to live in degraded habitats. A 2009 study attempted to predict the impact of climate change on nuthatches in Asia, and shows the Yunnan nuthatch's distribution decreasing by between 43.6% and 47.7% by 2040–2069. It is categorised as a near-threatened species on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5000|$|Within {{the genus}} the Corsican {{nuthatch}} {{belongs to the}} canadensis group which also includes the red-breasted nuthatch (S. canadensis), the Chinese nuthatch (S. villosa), Krüper's nuthatch (S. krueperi) and the Algerian nuthatch (S. ledanti). [...] These six species usually excavate their own nests and all except the Algerian nuthatch specialize in extracting seeds from pine cones. All {{members of the group}} also exhibit sexually dimorphism in the colour of their head feathers. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the Corsican nuthatch is most closely related to the Chinese nuthatch and that they diverged from a common ancestor around 0.96 million years ago. [...] The large distance separating the ranges of the two sister species is very unusual for Palaearctic passerines. The <b>Yunnan</b> <b>nuthatch</b> is a sister species to the canadensis group and has many common features.|$|E
