500|$|The {{music for}} [...] "Miles Away" [...] {{was the first}} song of Hard Candy to be composed. After hearing it, Madonna began singing and writing the lyrics for the song. In an {{interview}} with MTV, Madonna said that the song was inspired by her then husband, Guy Ritchie. [...] "So many people {{have to deal with}} long-distance relationships. It's not easy. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard to make it work." [...] When asked if the song was autobiographical, she said: ...|$|E
500|$|Duff {{explained}} of the album's title, [...] "I'm {{older and}} more mature now than I was when I made my last record, but I don't think I know it all. Having dignity is something you work on your whole life, in how you treat people and how you treat yourself. I hope I always strive to have it." [...] She continued, [...] "It's not {{something that you can}} be given or that you can just get or that you're born with. It's something that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian McKnight's manager {{stated that}} his client had already {{recorded}} tracks with the singer, while rapper Nelly explained to the reporters that both him and Timberlake had discussed a collaboration effort. Early in 2002, Angie Stone revealed that Timberlake [...] "loves the Mahogany Soul album" [...] with him further saying to her [...] "your CD's in my car right now, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on my solo project". These assertions were later partially denied by a Jive spokesperson who announced that the material produced from the collaboration would not appear on the finalized record.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{left the}} office," [...] said Katharine, {{in a tone}} which gave the {{impression}} that {{she was thinking of}} something else, as was, indeed, the case.|$|R
5000|$|..."Q: <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with David Harbour, {{your new}} bass player, {{how did it}} go? A: Very, very good, he works very fast, had a good sound and he’s also a very talented piano player." ...|$|R
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E
500|$|The celebratory mood {{continued}} into the next preseason, when Adams sent the team for two weeks of training camp in Hawaii. Rymkus was upset by the distractions caused by the decision. [...] "We {{found it hard to}} think football around the palm trees", he said. [...] "A preseason camp has to be hard, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> hard. You can't do it in a place like Hawaii." [...] The team got off to a 1–3–1 start in 1961, and Adams fired him on October 14. Adams said the decision was [...] "based on the conclusion the material on hand has not been used to its fullest potential". Wally Lemm was given the head coaching job, but the shake-up prompted Speedie to resign. Under Lemm, the Oilers regrouped to win their second consecutive title.|$|E
500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if you have it all the time—the passion is only for something that you don't have. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E

500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, {{it has nothing to}} do with money or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{ironic that}} Outliers {{provided}} {{suggestions on how}} to resolve cultural biases, the Sunday Times review by Kevin Jackson agreed that the book itself suffered from an unbalanced focus on American subjects, predicting that this would lead to better sales in the United States than in the United Kingdom. Jackson was disappointed in the book's lack of new ideas, noting that it merely expands on the concept that [...] "you have to be born at the right moment; at the right place; to the right family (posh usually helps); and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> really, really hard. That's about it." [...] He was also skeptical towards Gladwell's arguments for the 10,000-Hour Rule by countering that The Beatles' success {{had more to do with}} [...] "the youthful spirit of the age, the vogue for guitar bands and a spark of collaborative chemistry". Regarding the book, Paul McCartney, former member of The Beatles, said in an interview on August 6, 2010: ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jason Matthews of Legacy Effects, {{successor}} to Stan Winston Studios, {{was hired to}} turn production designer Tom Meyer's robot designs into practical animatronic props. He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're not walking or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were seeing something real, and gave the visual effects team {{an idea of what}} it would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> harder to get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E

5000|$|The {{controversy}} led to {{the introduction}} of a 'quality threshold' which allowed that, in exceptional circumstances, a bid could be rejected if it were deemed excessive, or that an incumbent could be chosen against a higher-bidding applicant if it were felt that incumbent's programming was 'exceptional'. As described by LWT's managing director Greg Dyke, the franchise round, [...] "became a crapshoot. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> out the franchise round who was bidding against you. Of those, would they pass the quality threshold and would they pass the financial test". Scottish Television and Central Television both discovered that nobody was bidding against them—and both bid only a token amount.|$|R
