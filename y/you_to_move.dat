500|$|On {{the drive}} to Athlead, Darryl opens up to Pam that he is worried about the {{interview}}. At Jim's new company, Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room, and then is chatted up by an employee who says [...] "Jim speaks about you all the time" [...] and we [...] "can't wait for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> here." [...] The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her. Meanwhile, Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy, but everyone else helps calm him down, and he makes a strong reversal. Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room's sports decorations, but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank, electrocuting all the fish. Pam commiserates with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep. Jim returns to inform Darryl that although {{he will have to}} pay for the fish, he has the job. During the drive home, Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Rating {{it three}} out of four stars, Steve Jones of USA Today commented. [...] "the singer is in a sexy, fun-loving mood [...] While she overdoes the between-song interludes here, she never fails to get <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> When it comes to burning up a dance floor, she is still Ms. Jackson." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated, [...] "Ms. Jackson luxuriates in textures as dizzying as a new infatuation," [...] commended the album as {{containing}} [...] "songs so baroquely sumptuous that they're virtually experimental." [...] Pareles added, [...] "Boudoir ballads undulate in torrid slow motion while Ms. Jackson moans like a phone-sex operator, and uptempo tunes hark back to disco, splice mock-operetta to hard rock or, in Better Days, conjure an easy-listening 1960's-pop apotheosis." [...] Her vocals were also praised, saying [...] "Countless overdubs of Ms. Jackson's voice turn her into an airborne choir; computer rhythms thump and sizzle." [...] He concluded saying the album [...] "isn't as immediately melodic as Ms. Jackson's previous albums, but it compensates for lost catchiness with unabashed strangeness." ...|$|E
