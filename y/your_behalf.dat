Nothing was advanced on <b>your</b> <b>behalf</b> to reflect that there is even the faintest glimmer of hope for you. Even if there were, any considerations of rehabilitation must, in this case, be subordinated to the gravity of your offending, {{the need for the}} imposition of a just punishment, and the principle of general deterrence.
