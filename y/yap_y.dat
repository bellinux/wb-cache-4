40|$|Effect {{of oxygen}} on {{breathing}} irregularities during haemodialysis {{in patients with}} chronic uraemia J. C. H. <b>Yap,</b> <b>Y.</b> T. Wang, S. C. Poh aa A decrease in arterial oxygen tension has been noted in patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis. This dialysis-related hypoxaemia has been attributed mainly to alveolar hypoventilation and a ventilation-perfusion imbalance [1 – 12]. During dialysis the arterial oxygen tension (Pa,O 2) decreases by 1. 3 – 2 kPa and returns to baseline after the procedure [4]. This fall in Pa,O 2 may not be tolerated by patients with chronic renal failure who may also have car-diopulmonary disease [13]. Supplemental oxygen therapy {{may be required to}} correct the hypoxaemia [1, 14 – 15]. In a study by DE BACKER et al. [16], an irregular breathin...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Frozen embryo {{transfer}} {{is an important}} supplementary procedure {{in the treatment of}} infertility. While general information concerning the outcome of frozen {{embryo transfer}} has been documented, few studies have addressed the potential of embryo implantation in particular clinical situations. Importantly, the risk of multiple conception following frozen embryo transfer has been poorly documented compared with the information available for fresh embryo transfer. METHODS: This is a retrospective study analysing 3570 frozen embryo transfer cycles (1438 couples) with a view to increasing our understanding of the clinical circumstances that influence the potential for embryo implantation. RESULTS: The overall implantation rate was 9. 1 %. The characteristics associated with a more favourable implantation rate were the success of the previous fresh embryo transfer cycle, age < 40 years and non-tubal factor aetiology of infertility. Such women had an increased risk of multiple conception. CONCLUSION: Female age, the aetiology of infertility and the outcome of fresh embryo transfer are the most important factors influencing the implantation rate following frozen embryo transfer. A prognostic table has been constructed that may assist with the determination of the optimal number of embryos to be replaced in frozen embryo transfer to provide better individualized counselling and to secure an optimal chance of pregnancy while reducing the risk of multiple conception.

40|$|Genetic {{variants}} of Y chromosome predispose to hypertension in rodents, whereas in humans {{the evidence is}} conflicting. Our purpose was to study the distribution of a panel of Y chromosome markers in a cohort from a {{cross-sectional population-based study on}} the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in Poland (WOBASZ study). The HindIII, <b>YAP</b> <b>Y</b> chromosome variants, previously shown to influence blood pressure, lipid traits or height, as well as SNPs defining main Y chromosome haplogroups, were typed in 3026, 2783 and 2652 samples, respectively. In addition, 4 subgroups (N, 100 each) representing extremes of LDL concentration or blood pressure (BP) were typed for a panel of 17 STRs. The HindIII and YAP polymorphism were not associated with any of the studied traits. Analysis of the haplogroup distribution showed an association between higher HDL level and hg I-M 170 (P = 0. 02), higher LDL level and hg F*(xI-M 170, J 2 -M 172, K-M 9) (P = 0. 03) and lower BMI and hg N 3 -Tat (P = 0. 04). Analysis of STRs did not show statistically significant differences. Since all these associations lost statistical significance after Bonferroni correction, we conclude that a major role of Y chromosome genetic variation (defined by HindIII, YAP or main Y chromosome haplogroups) in determining cardiovascular risk in Poles is unlikely...|$|E

Seventeen patients with advanced metastatic melanoma received midostaurin 75 mg p. o. t. i. d., unless toxicity or disease progression supervened. Patient safety was assessed weekly, and tumour response was assessed clinically or by CT. Tumour biopsies and plasma samples obtained at entry and after 4 weeks were analysed for midostaurin concentration, PKC activity and multidrug resistance. No tumour responses were seen. Two (12 %) patients had stable disease for 50 and 85 days, with minor response in one. The median overall survival was 43 days. Seven (41 %) discontinued treatment with potential toxicity, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and/or fatigue. One patient had > 50 % reduction in PKC activity. Tumour biopsies showed two PKC isoforms relatively insensitive to midostaurin, out of three patients tested. No modulation of multidrug resistance was demonstrated. At this dose schedule, midostaurin did not show clinical or biologic activity against metastatic melanoma. This negative trial reinforces the importance of correlating biologic and clinical responses in early clinical trials of targeted therapies.

40|$|The {{structural}} {{study of}} the garnet system Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG) prepared by different sample preparations (solid-state sintering and sol-gel) is reported. Different sample preparations were investigated to find a suitable method for obtaining pure YAG. 27 Al and 89 Y MAS NMR were used to investigate the short range structure and results are compared to long-range order information from x-ray diffraction (XRD). These two techniques are comlementary in detecting phase composition and disorder in samples. There is a challenge in preparing pure Y 3 Al 5 O 12 since intermediate phases easily grow when sintered at high temperature, i. e. YAlO 3 (<b>YAP),</b> <b>Y</b> 4 Al 2 O 9 (YAM), Y 2 O 3 (Yttria) and Al 2 O 3 (Corundum). Therefore structural information on these impurity phases was obtained to compare with samples under study. Different sample preparations were also {{used to try to}} obtain pure YAP and YAM. Since it is difficult to obtain pure YAG by high temperature solid-state sintering, the sol-gel technique was used to produce pure YAG at low temperature. In this work, pure YAG has been obtained at temperatures as low as 800 oC using a sol-gel citrate-nitrate with combustion process (SGCNCT). Other sol-gel syntheses used are: sol-gel glycolate (SGG), citrate-nitrate (SGCN) and modification of the citrate-nitrate ratio with combustion process (SGCNCT). The modification of the citrate to nitrate ratio and controlling the mixing temperature as low as 50 - 60 oC is a novel route to produce pure YAG at low as 800 oC. This technique was then used to prepare different garnet systems, i. e. Y 3 Ga 5 O 12 (YGG) and also garnet solid solution system, Y 3 Al 5 -xGaxO 12. Again, information from NMR was compared with results from XRD to determine different phase distribution and disorder. The 27 Al chemical shift range for different structural units (e. g. AlO 4, AlO 5 and AlO 6) in YAG allowed the aluminium distribution in these materials to be refined. This is important when dealing with low temperature amorphous phases. For example, the AlO 5 site cannot be traced using XRD. The work was extended to study different nuclei, i. e. 89 Y and 71 Ga NMR. 27 Al and 71 Ga is a quadrupolar nuclei with spin, I= 5 / 2 and 3 / 2, respectively. Extensive broadening of the NMR signal was observed at some sites due to the quadrupolar interaction and the effect of this on the quantitation of 27 Al and 71 Ga NMR is discussed. The substitution of Al and Ga in the garnet system was investigated. The different distribution of next nearest neighbour atom (nnn) produces a peak shift in 27 Al, 71 Ga NMR and also XRD...|$|E
40|$|In this work, the {{technique}} of electrospinning has been employed to fabricate uniform one-dimensional (1 -D) Yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) nanofibers. YAG precursor was prepared by sol–gel method using ethanol as solvent. Alcoholic solutions containing polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) {{have been used as}} a gel. The sol-gel was then introduced to the electrospinning apparatus to form nanofibers. Upon firing and sintering under carefully pre-selected time–temperature profiles, ceramic nanofibers retaining the original morphological features observed in the as-spun composition are obtained. Calcination has been done at different temperatures (800, 900, and 1000 C). Analytical tools, such as TGA and SEM have been employed to elucidate the pathway of ceramic phase formation and the systematic evolution of morphological features in the spun and the processed fibers.

We show that the luminescence of F+ and F centers in the mentioned crystals can be excited via the corresponding intrinsic 1 A? 2 A, 2 B and 3 P (F+) and 1 S? 3 P, 1 P (F) transitions of these centers, as well as via the radiative relaxation of excitons localized around F+ and F centers. In YAG crystal fast (2. 3 ns) emission in the 400 nm band, excited at 3. 33, 5. 37 and 6. 56 eV, arises from the F+-type centers, localized around YAl antisite defects (ADs). In Al 2 O 3 and YAP crystals, the luminescence of excitons localized around F+ centers (LE(F+) centers) is revealed and the energies of formation of such excitons are determined as well.

40|$|High-quality Ce 3 +-doped Y 3 Al 5 O 12 (YAG:Ce 3 +) {{phosphors}} were synthesized by a facile sol-gel combustion method. In this sol-gel combustion process, {{citric acid}} {{acts as a}} fuel for combustion, traps the constituent cations and reduces the diffusion length of the precursors. The XRD and FT-IR results show that YAG phase can form through sintering at 900 degrees C for 2 h.

There were no intermediate phases such as YAlO 3 (<b>YAP)</b> and <b>Y</b> 4 Al 2 O 9 (YAM) observed in the sintering process. The average grain size of the phosphors sintered at 900 - 1100 degrees C is about 40 nm. With the increasing of sintering temperature, the emission intensity increases due to the improved crystalline and homogeneous distribution of Ce 3 + ions. A blue shift has been observed in the Ce 3 + emission spectrum of YAG:Ce 3 + phosphors with increasing sintering temperatures from 900 to 1200 degrees C. It can be explained that the decrease of lattice constant affects the crystal field around Ce 3 + ions. The emission intensity of 0. 06 Ce-doped YAG phosphors {{is much higher than}} that of the 0. 04 Ce and 0. 02 Ce ones. The red-shift at higher Ce 3 + concentrations may be Ce-Ce interactions or variations in the unit cell parameters between YAG:Ce 3 + and YAG. It can be concluded that the sol-gel combustion synthesis method provides a good distribution of Ce 3 + activators at the molecular level in YAG matrix. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

The essential metabolic enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) is a potential target {{for the development of}} new antibiotics required to combat drug-resistant pathogens. Staphylococcus aureus BPL (SaBPL) is a bifunctional protein, possessing both biotin ligase and transcription repressor activities. This positions BPL as a key regulator of several important metabolic pathways. Here, we report the structural analysis of both holo- and apo-forms of SaBPL using X-ray crystallography. We also present small-angle X-ray scattering data of SaBPL in complex with its biotin-carboxyl carrier protein substrate as well as the SaBPL:DNA complex that underlies repression. This has revealed the molecular basis of ligand (biotinyl- 5 '-AMP) binding and conformational changes associated with catalysis and repressor function. These data provide new information to better understand the bifunctional activities of SaBPL and to inform future strategies for antibiotic discovery. Nicole R.

40|$|Biotin protein ligase (BPL) {{represents}} a promising {{target for the}} discovery of new antibacterial chemotherapeutics. Here we review {{the central role of}} BPL for the survival and virulence of clinically important Staphylococcus aureus in support of this claim. X-ray crystallography structures of BPLs in complex with ligands and small molecule inhibitors provide new insights into the mechanism of protein biotinylation, and a template for structure guided approaches to the design of inhibitors for antibacterial discovery. Most BPLs employ an ordered ligand binding mechanism for the synthesis of the reaction intermediate biotinyl- 5 ´-AMP from substrates biotin and ATP. Recent studies reporting chemical analogs of biotin and biotinyl- 5 ´-AMP as BPL inhibitors that represent new classes of anti-S. aureus agents are reviewed. We highlight strategies to selectively inhibit bacterial BPL over the mammalian equivalent using a 1, 2, 3 -triazole isostere to replace the labile phosphoanhydride naturally present in biotinyl- 5 ´-AMP. A novel in situ approach to improve the detection of triazole-based inhibitors is also presented that could potentially be widely applied to other protein targets. Ashleigh S. Paparella, Tatiana P.

40|$|Protein {{biotinylation}} is catalysed by biotin protein ligase (BPL). The most characterized BPL is from Escherichia coli {{where it}} functions {{as both a}} biotin ligase and a homodimeric transcriptional repressor. Here we investigated another bifunctional BPL from the clinically important Staphylococcus aureus (SaBPL). Unliganded SaBPL (apo) exists in a dimer-monomer equilibrium at low micromolar concentrations – {{a stark contrast to}} E. [*]coli BPL (EcBPL) that is monomeric under the same conditions. EMSA and SAXS analysis demonstrated that dimeric apo SaBPL adopted a conformation that was competent to bind DNA and necessary for it to function as a transcription factor. The SaBPL dimer-monomer dissociation constant was 5. 8 -fold tighter when binding the inhibitor biotin acetylene, but unchanged with biotin. F 123, located in the dimer interface, was critical for homodimerization. Inhibition studies together with surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed a strong correlation between inhibitor potency and slow dissociation kinetics. A 24 -fold difference in Ki values for these two enzymes was explained by differences in enzyme:inhibitor dissociation rates. Substitution of F 123 in SaBPL and its equivalent in EcBPL altered both inhibitor potency and dissociation. Hence, F 123 in SaBPL has novel roles in both protein dimerization and ligand-binding that have not been reported in EcBPL. Tatiana P. Soares da Costa, Min <b>Y.</b> <b>Yap,</b> Matthew A.

40|$|There {{is a well}} {{documented}} need to replenish the antibiotic pipeline with new agents to combat the rise of drug resistant bacteria. One strategy to combat resistance is to discover new chemical classes immune to current resistance mechanisms that inhibit essential metabolic enzymes. Many of the obvious drug targets that have no homologous isozyme in the human host have now been investigated. Bacterial drug targets that have a closely related human homologue represent a new frontier in antibiotic discovery. However, to avoid potential toxicity to the host, these inhibitors must have very high selectivity for the bacterial enzyme over the human homolog. We have demonstrated that the essential enzyme biotin protein ligase (BPL) from the clinically important pathogen Staphylococcus aureus could be selectively inhibited. Linking biotin to adenosine via a 1, 2, 3 triazole yielded the first BPL inhibitor selective for S. aureus BPL over the human equivalent. The synthesis of new biotin 1, 2, 3 -triazole analogues using click chemistry yielded our most potent structure (Ki 90 nM) with a > 1100 -fold selectivity for the S. aureus BPL over the human homologue. X-ray crystallography confirmed the mechanism of inhibitor binding. Importantly, the inhibitor showed cytotoxicity against S. aureus but not cultured mammalian cells. The biotin 1, 2, 3 -triazole provides a novel pharmacophore for future medicinal chemistry programs to develop this new antibiotic class. Tatiana P.

The unit got its name “17IB” when it was formerly activated on 16 October 1972 pursuant to General Orders Number 173, GHQ, AFP and placed under the direct control of HPA. All personnel and equipment of 6IB (Provisional) remained intact with the newly activated 17IB. The burden of organization, orientation, equipage and deployment fell on the leadership of then LTC EDON <b>Y</b> <b>YAP.</b> He took pain in completing the battalion equipment and uplifted capabilities when it was fielded in Central Luzon. It was almost one (1) year gaining substantial and impressive success in its pacification campaign in Central Luzon when it was ordered to be shifted to Southern Philippines specifically in Lanao where Charlie Company was airlifted ahead of the battalion as advance group but was recalled back after two (2) months due to a sudden change of tactical events and consideration. When the command of 17IB was passed to LTC MATEO V BAWAGAN, the unit’s administrative, operational and related activities were accelerated to its highest peak which earned COL BAWAGAN the honor of having been adjudged as “The Most Outstanding Battalion Commander of Calendar Year 1974”. On 8 July 1975, LTC NOLAN C LAPUT assumed leadership of 17IB to LTC JUANITO P ALLAS. After four (4) years and twenty (20) days of productive pacification campaign {{in the province of}} Isabela and Cagayan, 17IB was pulled-out of the area on 16 March 1977 to undergo much needed respite and rest and recreation, orientation and retraining regarding new tactics and trends in the field of counter-insurgency warfare. After almost two (2) months of retraining and reorientation, LTC ADELINO V MAGDAY took the command of the unit on 7 June 1977. Its new AOR covers the tri-boundaries of Pampanga, Zambales and the Peninsula of Bataan. The Battalion Command Post was initially established at Sta Lucia, Capaz, Tarlac but was later transferred to St Roosevelt at Dinalupihan, Bataan on 12 October 1977. MAJ EXPEDITO S SOSA took command on 17th IB MIB following the untimely demise of LTC ADELINO MAGDAY in a vehicular ambush. The new Battalion Commander was recognized for its outstanding accomplishment and the Certificate of Merit from the Commanding General, then NORESCOM dated 1 October 1981 was awarded to the unit. The stewardship of 17IB was passed to LTC JOHN R BAUTISTA on 1 October 1982 and after a year of fruitful administration; the command of 17IB was passed to LTC RAUL L MARQUEZ. With the assumption of its new Commander, a balanced administrative, operation and CMO plans and programs were formulated and simultaneously implemented based on Security Campaign Plan of RUC2 and in conformity with OPLAN “KATATAGAN”. The steadfast spirit and enthusiasm lives in every member of the unit thereby contributing to the gains in the counter-insurgency campaign. Foremost is the dismantling of well-fortified based camp of Regular na Puwersang Makilos (RPM) influenced barangays of Marag, Kakandungan and Kalabigan, all of Luna, Kalinga-Apayao. The prevailing situation of the populace paved way to the introduction of Army Literacy Patrol System (ALPS) in Villa Cielo, Buguey, Cagayan, one of the remote sitios of the unit’s AOR, benefiting two hundred (200) students from the poor and under-privileged members of our society. As a result, the unit was bestowed the award as Best Unit in Administrative for CY-84 and from its ranks emerged the Most Outstanding EP of the Year. The unit AOR was aggressively occupied starting 1 May 1986 when a new commander of the unit was designated in the person of MAJ PETER H ESPADERO. The redeployment of its forces was characterized by a series of major, minor and small unit strike operations of search and destroys. Come late June 1986, the maneuver companies established its bases in tactical locations supporting each other. During the third quarter of 1987, new AOR re-sectoring took place and so, the unit took responsibility over the towns of Claveria, Sanchez Mira, Pamplona and a portion of Abulog, Luna, Pudtol and Flora from the 54IB. Afterwards, the unit took responsibility over the municipalities of Lasam, Sto Nino, Piat, Tuao and Rizal, all of Cagayan from 21IB. Thus, the unit again maneuvered its line companies in identified strategic locations which later resulted to the dissolution of Delta Company, and its personnel were absorbed by Alpha Company and HHSVCo. During the fourth quarter, minor changes were undertaken pertaining to the location of Battalion Headquarters. In view of its necessity, the Battalion Headquarters was transferred to Allacapan, Cagayan. The year 1987 proved to be fruitful to 17IB. The unit inspired by its successful outcome, SOT operation was pursued at Southwestern Allacapan and extended in Abulog resulting to the voluntary surrender of more than one thousand six hundred (1,600) Subversive Mass Activists (SMA). Importantly, in this undertaking where the destruction of enemy political infrastructure took cognizance in said areas and saw the decline of the CT propaganda operation, thus constricting the enemy and further leaving no room of influence for the CTs. In view of this, come May 1988, the AOR of the unit expanded to Eastern Cagayan pursuant to the 5ID Campaign Plan. As a result, Charlie Company was redeployed to Gonzaga, Cagayan as its new AOR. The unit was adjudged by the NOLCOM as the “Best Battalion for CY 88-89” which was added to the shining laurels of glory and fame reaped by the unit. LTC FRANCISCO V FUENTES assumed the command on 4 July 1989. Commitment of the unit was continued, headed by the incumbent Commanding Officer. MAJ ROGELIO G ROSETE took command on 20 December 1989, when the political problems spreading in the entire province of Cagayan, and even hostile activities of Ultra Rightist Group and the AGUINALDO FIASCO in Tuguegarao, Cagayan was left {{in the hands of the}} newly assigned Commander. Despite of this political turmoil, the unit effectively performed its assigned task/mission and ably rebounded back. The unit completed its movements from Cagayan Province on 8 April 1990, to relieve-in-place the 65th IB in Ilocos Sur and Cagayan Province. It covered seventeen (17) municipalities of Ilocos Sur and two (2) towns of Ilocos Norte. From 1 April 1990 to December 1990, four (4) identified CT camps and temporary bases of the enemy were discovered, attacked and neutralized by the unit during the period.|$|R
