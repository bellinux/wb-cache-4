40|$|Traditional {{sampling}} methods are unsuitable {{for determining the}} levels of human immunodeficiency virus type I infection and related behavioral risk factors among <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men. Most surveys of this hard-to-reach population have used nonprobability samples of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> in clinical or public settings. While these studies have revealed high rates of HIV infection and risk behaviors, their findings are not generalizable to broader populations of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men. To better understand the epidemiology of HIV within this population, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with state and local health departments, has developed a venue-based probability survey of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men. Conducted in seven metropolitan areas in the United States, the Young Men's Survey combines outreach techniques with standard methods of sample surveys to enumerate, sample, and estimate prevalence outcomes of a population of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> frequent public venues and {{who have sex with}} other <b>men.</b> Venues where <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men are sampled include dance clubs, bars, and street locations. At sampled venues, <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are enumerated, consecutively approached, and offered enrollment if they are determined eligible. <b>Young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> agree to participate in the Young Men's Survey are interviewed, counseled, and tested for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and syphilis in vans parked near sampled venues. The Young Men's Survey provides data on the locations and times at which demographic and behavioral subgroups of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men may be targeted for prevention activities. Behaviors and psychosocial factors associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection can be used to design culturally relevant and age-specific prevention activities for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> have sex with men...|$|R

5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady.

Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States.
