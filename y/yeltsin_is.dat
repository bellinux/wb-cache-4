The track [...] "No Sympathy" [...] was originally written {{for a film}} entitled Plop, which followed three unsympathetic characters who lived for a week {{as though it were}} their last. Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary. [...] "Presidential Suite", about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris <b>Yeltsin,</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a reflective look back at the decadent nineties" [...] during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if [...] "we need to know if he really came inside her mouth?". [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] addresses social injustice and is about [...] "house prices going up, and people being left behind by the super rich" [...] and has been described by Rhys as [...] "grotesque in its upness and lift". [...] "Sidewalk Serfer Girl" [...] was initially written about Patti White Bull, a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years, awaking in 1999, but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs, including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports. [...] "Receptacle for the Respectable" [...] is about simultaneously being in awe of, and being hurt by, a [...] "girl around town" [...] while [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] is [...] "a romantic song about growing old". [...] "Run! Christian, Run!" [...] was influenced by guitarist Huw Bunford's interest in [...] "doomsday cult websites". Bunford printed out several essays from these websites and gave them to Rhys who used them as inspiration for his lyrics along with his own recollections of watching Christian television shows during the band's American tours. The album's title track, [...] "(Drawing) Rings Around the World", is based on an idea put forward by Rhy's girlfriend's father and is about [...] "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around". [...] "Shoot Doris Day" [...] refers to shooting American singer and actress Doris Day with film—"a very cinematic reference" [...] for a song which Rhys claims is [...] "over-the-top lyrically". The track is about [...] "how people change" [...] and also references Labour Party 'spin doctor' Peter Mandelson, in the guise of 'Victor Panache'.|$|E

40|$|Law, Rights and Ideology in Russia: Landmarks in the Destiny of a Great Power {{brings into}} sharp focus several key episodes in Russia’s vividly ideological {{engagement}} with law and rights. Drawing on 30 {{years of experience}} of consultancy and teaching in many regions of Russia, and on library research in Russian language texts, Bill Bowring provides unique insights into people, events and ideas. A constant theme is the centuries long hegemonic struggle between Westernisers and Slavophiles, {{against the backdrop of}} the Messianism which proclaimed Russia to be the Third Rome, was revived in the mission of Soviet Russia to change the world, and which has echoes in contemporary Eurasianism and the ideology of Sovereignty. The book starts with the surprising role of the Scottish Enlightenment in the origins of law as an academic discipline in Russia in the 18 th century, with the first professor of law to teach in Russian, Adam Smith’s pupil Semeon Desnitskiy. The Great Reforms of Tsar Aleksandr II, abolishing serfdom in 1861 and introducing Jury Trial in 1864, are examined in detail against the debate as to whether these were genuine reforms or the response to a revolutionary situation. A new interpretation of the life and work of the Soviet legal theorist Yevgeniy Pashukanis leads to an analysis of the conflicted attitude of the USSR to international law and human rights, especially the right of peoples to self-determination. The collapse of the USSR in 1991 was part of the "parade of sovereignties" in which Russia’s very existence was at threat, and a chapter considers the complex history of autonomy in Tsarist and Soviet Russia. An examination of Russia’s plunge into the European human rights system under <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>is</b> followed by the history of the death penalty in Russia. Finally, the secrets of the ideology of "sovereignty" in the Putin era and their impact on law and rights are revealed...|$|E
