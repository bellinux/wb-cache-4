5|$|When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story was {{received}} positively by some American Christian authors. In Freshman: The College Student's Guide to Developing Wisdom, Mark Matlock, an ordained minister and youth pastor recommends When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story to college students. He describes the Ludys' book as funny, honest, and candid. Jason Evert, a Catholic author and chastity speaker, wrote positively of When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story {{in his book}} If You Really Loved Me: 100 Questions on Dating, Relationships, and Sexual Purity. Evert commends Leslie Ludy writing {{about the importance of}} listening intently and regularly to God's voice in seeking discernment about romantic relationships. Also in If You Really Loved Me, Evert praises a passage from When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story in which Leslie Ludy recalls having spoken with a group of young men who all agreed that the most desirable women were those who were slow to establish strong emotional attachments to potential romantic partners, and that the least desirable women were those who were emotionally promiscuous. According to Evert, these men are right; he uses the passage to support his argument that lack of sexual experience is attractive.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Clear Choices Pregnancy Resources Center, an American pro-life crisis {{pregnancy}} center {{operated by}} Christians in Grayson County, Kentucky, offered {{a course on}} the topic of sexual integrity that employed When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story and two other Christian books as its basis, the other two being Gary Chapman's The Five Love Languages and Bill and Pam Farrel's Single Men Are Like Waffles â€” Single Women Are Like Spaghetti.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, the Yardbirds began {{recording}} a successful string of forward-looking singles with Beck's pioneering hard rock and psychedelic guitar work. Their first American album, For <b>Your</b> <b>Love,</b> which included Beck's earliest recordings {{with the group}} and earlier singles and demos with Clapton, was rush-released in June 1965 as they were preparing for their first American tour. In November 1965, Having a Rave Up was released {{less than a month}} before the beginning of the Yardbirds' second tour of the US and also combined songs recorded with both Clapton and Beck.|$|E
40|$|Imagine {{you have}} a loved one who is a patient in a hospital. You have been sitting by their bedside for hours. You notice that the day nurse who has been caring for <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one is now telling a night nurse what care has been done so far and what care will {{probably}} need to be done. You decide {{to go home and}} come back tomorrow. You tell you loved one good night and go home for the evening. The next day you are not able to get to the hospital until almost noon. When you arrive, you notice that the night nurse from last evening is still there. The night nurse looks really tired. You wonder how she keeps functioning after working almost a day and a half. You greet <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one as you enter their room, but something is not right. <b>Your</b> <b>loved</b> one is acting abnormally lethargic. You ask for the nurse to come check on <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one. When she does, she notices that <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one was given the wrong dose of a certain medication. She acts quickly to counteract the medical error and stabilize <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one. <b>Your</b> <b>loved</b> one is ok, but that gave you quite a scare. You asked what happened. The nurse reviews the medical record and realizes that she had made a mathematical mistake when calculating the dose. You question whether this nurse should be caring for <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one. The nurse seems genuinely concerned for <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one but looks so worn out! You want a nurse who is not sleep deprived to care for <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one. What if another medical error is made and <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one is not so lucky? This is of course just a scenario, but how woul...|$|R

5|$|The song {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who commended Houston's vocal effort. It charted in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number twenty-six. It also reached a peak position of number twenty-two in the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number six on the Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the song reached {{a peak of}} number forty-five on the RPM Singles chart. Although there is no official music video for the song, a performance of the song at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards was taped and {{is used as a}} promotional clip. The song was later included as a medley, in her My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour (1999), along with a few other songs.|$|E
5|$|Eric and Leslie Ludy {{met when}} Eric was 21 and Leslie was 16. They pursued a {{friendship}} {{for several months}} before starting to court, and married in December 1994, the same month that Eric turned 24. In When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story, the Ludys advise single people not to be physically or emotionally intimate with others, but {{to wait for the}} life partner that God has planned for them; the Ludys suggest that one should marry this person rather than independently choosing a mate. Also focusing on premarital physical and emotional purity, the authors do not discuss the physical processes of sexual activity. Like many other Christian books about premarital romantic relationships, the Ludys' book explicitly does not present a set of rules to follow or a strategy for romantic success, but rather gives readers a framework for pursuing Christian romantic relationships; the book is intended to be a tool {{in the creation of the}} reader's unique romantic relationship rather than as a blueprint explaining what all Christian romantic relationships are supposed to look like.|$|E
5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of Your Life, and Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E

It was Houston's first studio album in eight years, following I'm Your Baby Tonight, although she had released several movie soundtracks in that time. My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> is composed of mid-tempo R, hip hop, ballads, urban-dance, reggae, and torch songs, produced by musicians such as Rodney Jerkins, Soulshock & Karlin, Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, David Foster, and Babyface. It is notable for introducing elements of hip hop into Houston's work, only sparingly used in her previous material.|$|E

25|$|Across Europe, it {{was more}} {{successful}} than in United States. In early times of its release, the commercial response for the album was short of expectations. But its sales rose sharply during the European leg of the My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour, which was the highest grossing arena concert tour of 1999 on the continent, and consequently My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> became the second best-selling album of 1999 in Europe, behind Cher's Believe, spending {{more than one year}} on the charts in many countries. In the United Kingdom, it reached number four on the albums chart and was certified 3Ã— Platinum for shipments of 900,000 copies of the album by the British Phonographic Industry(BPI). In France, the album peaked at number two on the albums chart, and was certified 2Ã— platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Ã‰dition Phonographique (SNEP), selling 700,000 copies. In Germany, it climbed to the number two on the albums chart on its 35th week and has sold more than 670,000 copies. The album reached number one on the albums charts in Austria, Switzerland and Netherlands, and the top five in Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Finland. My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> was certified 4Ã— platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for shipments of four million copies of the album in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The band's sound {{usually has}} {{elements}} of punk rock, pop and alternative rock. I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me <b>Your</b> <b>Love,</b> the band's debut album, features a raw sound that has guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and sometimes screaming. The album {{is considered an}} emo album with strong influences from punk rock and hardcore punk. I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> also has some influences from heavy metal. The second album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge {{was one of the}} albums that launched the emo genre into the mainstream. The band's album The Black Parade lacks the post-hardcore elements featured on the first two My Chemical Romance albums and features elements of pop punk, emo and punk rock. The fourth My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continues the band's alternative rock and pop punk sound with some new elements of power pop, pop rock and electronic rock.|$|E

Additionally, the song was performed on select dates of her The Bodyguard World Tour (1993â€“94) and My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love</b> World Tour (1999).

Although Dai Nagao was not as active as he was in the beginning (he did not participate in promotional events anymore, such as video clips or photo shoots) he was still the main composer and the brain behind the band. He did, though, appear in concerts from time to time.|$|E

25|$|After {{spending}} {{much of the}} early and mid-1990s working on motion pictures and their soundtrack albums, Houston's first studio album in eight years, the critically acclaimed My Love Is <b>Your</b> <b>Love,</b> was released in November 1998. Though originally slated to be a greatest hits album {{with a handful of}} new songs, recording sessions were so fruitful that a new full-length studio album was released. Recorded and mixed in only six weeks, it featured production from Rodney Jerkins, Wyclef Jean and Missy Elliott. The album debuted at number thirteen, its peak position, on the Billboard 200 chart. It had a funkier and edgier sound than past releases and saw Houston handling urban dance, hip hop, mid-tempo R, reggae, torch songs, and ballads all with great dexterity.|$|E
