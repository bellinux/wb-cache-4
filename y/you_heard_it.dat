When <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> {{you just had to}} say 'Ouch!'" [...] Hutchins played the sound effects for series creator Hillenburg for review. [...] Hillenburg rejected it, saying [...] "it was too far over the edge." [...] Hutchins said, [...] "a lot of effort for something that lasts only 15 seconds on screen. In this case, the whole thing never made it on the air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blas Galindo and I went to Alvarado, one of {{the places}} where folkloric music is {{preserved}} in its most pure form; we were collecting melodies, rhythms and instrumentations during several days. The transcription of it was very difficult because the huapangueros (musicians) never sang the same melody twice in the same way. When I came back to Mexico, I showed the collected material to Candelario Huízar; Huízar gave me a piece of advice that I will always be grateful for: [...] "Expose the material first in the same way <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> and develop it later according to your own thought." [...] And I did it, and the result is almost satisfactory for me.|$|E
2500|$|Fox hired Terry Erdmann (Blue Blaze {{code name}} [...] "Silver Fox") {{and a team}} of publicists {{including}} Blake Mitchell and Jim Ferguson to promote the film at Star Trek conventions with a few film clips and free Banzai headbands, which have since become highly sought-after collector's items by fans of the film. The studio made no attempts to sell the film to a mainstream audience with traditional promotion, although there was some magazine advertising (primarily in Marvel Comics) and related licensing which served as viral advertising in limited venues. Studio publicist Rosemary LaSalmandra said, [...] "Nobody knew what to do with Buckaroo Banzai. There was no simple way to tell anyone what it was about—I'm not sure anybody knew". Lithgow said, [...] "I've tried to explain the story line to people and it takes about an hour. I mean it; it's that complicated. But it's terrific. Every time I tell people about it, I get so excited that I end it by saying, Buckaroo Banzai, remember where <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> first!" ...|$|E
