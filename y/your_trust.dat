500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] is what a person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting <b>your</b> <b>trust</b> in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his rapidly deteriorating health, Gatewood {{refused to}} quit and Parker guided him to Captain Henry Lawton, who was leading {{a mission to}} find and kill Geronimo with the Fourth Cavalry. It took two weeks through 150 miles of desert {{mountain}} ranges to locate Lawton {{on the banks of}} the Aros River on August 3, 1886. [...] Lawton reluctantly allowed Gatewood and his scouts to join his command. [...] Gatewood's health continued to deteriorate. [...] On August 8 he asked Lawron's Surgeon, Leonard Wood, to medically discharge him, but Wood refused. [...] On August 23, 1886, Gatewood led 25 men and two Apache scouts into the Sierra Madre and found Geronimo's camp: his band reduced to 20 men and 14 women and children. [...] On August 24 Gatewood approached Geronimo's camp with only 2 soldiers: George Medhurst Wratten, who was fluent in all Apache dialects and one other; 2 interpreters: Tom Horn and Jesús María Yestes; and two [...] Chiricahua scouts: Kayitah, a Chokonen, and Martine, a Nedni, so as not to alarm the Apaches. [...] Kayitah and Martine made the initial contact, being invited into the camp by the Bavispe River. [...] Kayitah remained in the camp as a hostage while Martine left and returned with Gatewood and 15 pounds of tobacco. [...] After Gatewood made gifts of tobacco, [...] Geronimo teased Gatewood about his thinness and sickly look, Gatewood was then told by Geronimo, [...] "you are always welcome in my camp, and it was always safe for you to come". [...] Gatewood encouraged Geronimo to abandon his fight against the US Army. [...] When asked by Geronimo what Gatewood would do in his situation and to [...] "think like an Apache", Gatewood advised him to [...] "put <b>your</b> <b>trust</b> in Miles".|$|E

2500|$|In this work, one of {{his most}} {{emphatic}} statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: [...] "Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong, but let <b>your</b> <b>trust</b> in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Christian theology, {{the resurrection}} of Jesus is a {{foundation}} of the Christian faith. [...] Christians, through faith in the working of God are spiritually resurrected with Jesus, and are redeemed {{so that they may}} walk in a new way of life. As Paul the Apostle stated: [...] "If Christ was not raised, then all our preaching is useless, and <b>your</b> <b>trust</b> in God is useless". The death and resurrection of Jesus are the most important events in Christian Theology. They form the point in scripture where Jesus gives his ultimate demonstration that he has power over life and death, thus {{he has the ability to}} give people eternal life. Terry Miethe, a Christian philosopher at Oxford University, stated, [...] "'Did Jesus rise from the dead?' is the most important question regarding the claims of the Christian faith.'" [...] According to the Bible, [...] "God raised him from the dead", he ascended to heaven, to the [...] "right hand of God", and will return again to fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead, the Last Judgment and establishment of the Kingdom of God; see also Messianism and Messianic Age.|$|E
