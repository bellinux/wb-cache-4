2500|$|David's praise in [...] for Jonathan's 'love' (for him) {{over the}} 'love' {{of women is}} {{considered}} evidence for same-sex attraction, along with Saul's exclamation to his son at the dinner table, [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> the son of Jesse - which is a disgrace to yourself and the nakedness of your mother!" [...] The [...] "choosing" [...] (bahar) may indicate a permanent choice and firm relationship, and the mention of [...] "nakedness" [...] (erwa) could be interpreted to convey a negative sexual nuance, giving the impression that Saul saw something indecent in Jonathan and David's relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Easwaran's Mantram Handbook {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the practice of repeating mantrams and/or holy names, terms the author uses interchangeably. The book offers the author's practical guidance for choosing a mantram and using it for personal centering and spiritual growth. In the opening chapters, the author recommends selecting a single mantram (such as those in the table at right), and suggests that the reader [...] "take your time choosing a mantram..... then, once <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>chosen</b> a mantram, do not change it." [...] Most of the remainder of the book discusses how to integrate the mantram into daily living to improve skills and solve various types of problems. Late in the book, Easwaran describes how the mantram can be combined with other spiritual practices, such as meditation. Easwaran's approach is distinctive, in that he recommends a method of sitting meditation that does not focus on the mantram. Accordingly, the entire concern of the Mantram Handbook is in how to use a mantram throughout the day, at times apart from sitting meditation.|$|E
