500|$|John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at St. Mary, Whitechapel, {{the second}} son of Francis Cooke, an Admiralty clerk, {{and his wife}} Margaret. John Cooke first went to sea {{at the age of}} eleven aboard the cutter [...] under Lieutenant John Bazely, before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at Greenwich. He was entered onto the books of one of the royal yachts by Sir Alexander Hood, who would become an {{enduring}} patron of Cooke's. In 1776 he obtained a position as a midshipman on the ship of the line , aged thirteen. Cooke served aboard Eagle, the flagship of the North American Station, during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778, when Eagle was closely engaged with American units ashore. He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral Lord Howe to remark [...] "Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> sufficient age." [...] On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to lieutenant and joined [...] in the East Indies under Sir Edward Hughes, but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] is a draw {{in a few}} {{number of}} moves, usually without much battle, usually between high-ranked players. [...] British expert P. H. Clarke talked about the {{positive}} aspects of a short draw: Unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> the calibre of Botvinnik – and who is – you cannot hope to play at full power day after day. [...] The technical draws are a necessary means of conserving energy. As such, they contribute to raising the standard of play rather than lowering it [...]|$|E

[...] "You are male and I am female. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> the sky and I am of the earth. You are {{constant}} in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, [...] enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us. If there is to be harmony, my request must matter to you. There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: [...] "Millions of {{you have}} blood {{relatively}} unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord calls you 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, {{for many of the}} grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... You came from Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen". Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: [...] "With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea". Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: [...] "Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands".|$|E
