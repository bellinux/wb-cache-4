5|$|In Halifax he {{was sent}} to Wellington Barracks, the city's peacetime barracks, where he {{wrestled}} freight onto large army vehicles and dug ditches. Tired of the work, Babcock took the opportunity to volunteer for the Royal Canadian Regiment when fifty recruits were called on, claiming that his age was 18. Officials quickly discovered that he was only 16, however, and they placed him in a reserve battalion known as the Boys (or <b>Young</b> <b>Soldiers)</b> Battalion in August 1917. Babcock then undertook an ocean voyage to England and, in Liverpool, he was stationed with the 26th Reserve and sent to Bexhill-on-Sea where he trained with about 1,300 others, about a third of whom were veterans from battles in France.|$|E
5|$|When the Allies {{received}} {{the news that}} Xerxes was clearing paths around Mount Olympus, and thus intending to march towards Thermopylae, it was both the period of truce that accompanied the Olympic games, and the Spartan festival of Carneia, during both of which warfare was considered sacrilegious. Nevertheless, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they despatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men (in this case, the elite <b>young</b> <b>soldiers</b> in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had sons). Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Peloponnesian cities allied to Sparta, and other forces that were picked up en route to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Halbe was desperate for the Germans. Orders {{were still being}} issued to recognisable formations, but these were by now all mixed up. There was considerable tension between the Waffen-SS and Wehrmacht troops, with both accusing the other of helping their own while ignoring {{the plight of the}} other. In Halbe itself, some of the civilians took pity on very <b>young</b> <b>soldiers</b> ("Kindersoldaten") and allowed them to change out of their uniforms into civilian clothes. In one documented case, an SS man appeared at the door of a cellar intending to shoot a Panzerfaust into a cellar with about 40 civilians and young Wehrmacht soldiers in it, only to be shot dead by one of the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Randolph {{was best}} known for {{sponsoring}} eleven times {{an amendment to the}} Constitution that would grant citizens aged between 18 and 21 the right to vote. He first introduced the amendment in 1942, arguing that <b>young</b> <b>soldiers</b> fighting in World War II should be able to vote. In 1970 amendments to the Voting Rights Act lowered the voting age to 18 in both local and national elections. After the Supreme Court found in Oregon v. Mitchell that Congress only had the power to lower the voting age to 18 for national elections, and no power to lower it for state elections, Randolph was among the Senators who reintroduced the amendment. It was ratified by three-fourths of the states in 1971 as the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, 107 days after it was approved by Congress.|$|E
25|$|At Tibur and Falerii their sacerdos was a male, called pontifex sacrarius, {{fact that}} {{has been seen as}} a proof of the {{relevance}} of the goddess to the whole society. In both towns she was known as Curitis, the spearholder, an armed protectress. The martial aspect of these Junos is conspicuous, quite as that of fecundity and regality: the first two look strictly interconnected: fertility guaranteed the survival of the community, peaceful and armed. Iuno Curitis is also the tutelary goddess of the curiae and of the new brides, whose hair was combed with the spear called caelibataris hasta as in Rome. In her annual rites at Falerii youths and maiden clad in white bore in procession gifts to the goddess whose image was escorted by her priestesses. The idea of purity and virginity is stressed in Ovid's description. A she goat is sacrificed to her after a ritual hunting. She is then the patroness of the <b>young</b> <b>soldiers</b> and of brides.|$|E

25|$|Various {{aspects of}} the war were also common in {{contemporary}} children's fiction. Categorised as Boys' Own adventure stories, they offer few insights into the conflict, being generally based on news articles and sharing unreflectingly in the contemporary culture of imperialism. Among these, Herbert Strang was responsible for two novels: Kobo: A Story of the Russo–Japanese War (1905), told from the Japanese side, and Brown of Moukden (1906), viewed from the Russian side. Three more were written by the prolific American author, Edward Stratemeyer: Under the Mikado's Flag, or <b>Young</b> <b>Soldiers</b> of Fortune (1904); At the Fall of Port Arthur, or a young American in the Japanese navy (1905); and Under Togo for Japan, or Three Young Americans on Land and Sea (1906). Two other English-language stories begin with the action at Port Arthur and follow the events thereafter: A Soldier of Japan: a tale of the Russo–Japanese War by Captain Frederick Sadleir Brereton, and The North Pacific (1905) by Willis Boyd Allen (1855–1938). Two more also involve young men fighting in the Japanese navy: Americans in For the Mikado, a Japanese Middy in Action (1905) by Kirk Munroe, and a temporarily disgraced English officer in Under the Ensign of the Rising Sun (1916) by Harry Collingwood, the pen-name of William Joseph Cosens Lancaster (1851–1922), whose speciality was naval fiction.|$|E
25|$|During the interwar period Flavell {{remained}} on the active list of the East Surrey Regiment, but {{became involved in the}} shipping industry with a business partner from the United States. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, Flavell was recalled to the British Army and subsequently given command of the 2/7th Middlesex Regiment. He saw service during the Battle of France in 1940, and was then given the task of raising the 70th (<b>Young</b> <b>Soldiers)</b> Battalion. On 22 June 1940, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, created the British airborne establishment when he directed the War Office in a memorandum to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. In 1941 the 1st Parachute Brigade was formed, with Brigadier Richard N. Gale, Flavell's former commanding officer, as its commander. Gale selected Flavell, now a colonel, to raise and then command the 2nd Parachute Battalion which would form part of the brigade. His adjutant was Captain John D. Frost, who would later become famous for commanding the battalion during the Battle of Arnhem; both men qualified as parachutists in October 1941. In January 1942 Flavell gave Frost command over Operation Biting, a raid on a radar station on the French coast near Bruneval; the raid, which took place in February, was successful and brought back vital technology.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, {{was sent}} to Singapore for jungle {{training}} {{in response to the}} threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia-Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, 'B' Company's base on the hilltop village of Plamam Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of <b>young</b> <b>soldiers,</b> was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams' machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.|$|E

Babcock first attempted to join the army at the age of fifteen, but was turned down and sent to work in Halifax until he was placed in the <b>Young</b> <b>Soldiers</b> Battalion in August 1917.

Babcock asserts that he would have fought in the conflict, given the chance, but the war ended before he could be brought to the front lines.
