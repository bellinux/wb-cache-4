In 2002 she became the proponent of an Initiative under BC Recall and Initiative Act to hold a referendum on whether or not to adopt MMP in BC. Called the Free <b>Your</b> <b>Vote</b> campaign, it brought together a broad coalition of British Columbians and even included the official support of trade unions such as the BC Nurses' in a petition drive under the province's citizen initiative legislation. Despite having condemned this legislation as unworkable after an anti-grizzly bear hunting initiative by her husband, proponent Paul George failed to gather and submit sufficient signatures, Carr threw the energies into this campaign which, although it too failed to gather sufficient signatures in all but four ridings, The nearly 100,000 signatures gathered created the largest voting reform organization in the province and increased awareness and support amongst Greens and non-Greens alike for electoral reform. Many credit it with spurring the Liberals to establish a Citizens Assembly on Electoral Reform a few months later.|$|E
