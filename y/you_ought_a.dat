40|$|Some irrational {{states can}} be avoided {{in more than one}} way. For example, if you believe that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> to <b>A</b> <b>you</b> can avoid akrasia by {{intending}} to A or by dropping the belief that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> to <b>A.</b> This supports the claim that some rational requirements are wide-scope. For instance, the requirement against akrasia is a requirement to intend to A or not believe that <b>you</b> <b>ought</b> to <b>A.</b> But some writers object that this Wide-Scope view ignores asymmetries between the different ways of avoiding irrationality. In this paper I defend the Wide-Scope view against recent objections of this sort from Mark Schroeder and Niko Kolodny. I argue that once we are clear about what the Wide-Scope view is committed to—and, importantly, what it is not—we can see that Schroeder and Kolodny’s objections fail. <br/...|$|R
