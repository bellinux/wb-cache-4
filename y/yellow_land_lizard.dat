Specimens with seven stripes instead of only five were considered a variety of Geoplana marginata and named Geoplana marginata var. abundans because of the [...] "abundant" [...] number of stripes.|$|R

But Hugh had tenfold more sea-cunning than I. Witta gave him charge of the rowers of the left side. Thorkild of Borkum, a man with a broken nose, that wore a Norman steel cap, had the rowers of the right, and each side rowed and sang against the other. They saw that no man was idle.
