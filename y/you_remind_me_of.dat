2500|$|Hugh was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln on 21 September 1186 at Westminster. Almost {{immediately}} {{he established}} his {{independence of the}} King, excommunicating a royal forester and refusing to seat one of Henry's courtly nominees as a prebendary of Lincoln; he softened the king's anger by his diplomatic address and tactful charm. After the excommunications, he came upon the king hunting and was greeted with dour silence. He waited several minutes and the king called for a needle to sew up a leather bandage on his finger. Eventually Hugh said, with gentle mockery, [...] "How much <b>you</b> <b>remind</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> your cousins of Falaise" [...] (where William I's mother Herleva, a tanner's daughter, had come from). At this Henry just burst out laughing and was reconciled. As a bishop, he was exemplary, constantly in residence or travelling within his diocese, generous with his charity, scrupulous in the appointments he made. He raised {{the quality of education}} at the cathedral school. [...] Hugh was also prominent in trying to protect the Jews, great numbers of whom lived in Lincoln, in the persecution they suffered at the beginning of Richard I's reign, and he put down popular violence against themas later occurred following the death of Little Saint Hugh of Lincolnin several places.|$|E
