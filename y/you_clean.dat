500|$|The {{focal point}} of {{criticism}} was Storm of Zehirs story. [...] Critics considered its focus on trade and economics shallow compared to the epic adventures presented in Neverwinter Nights 2 and Mask of the Betrayer. [...] GameSpy referred to the storyline as a [...] "boringly generic adventure", and GameSpot said [...] "The quests reflect this mundane storyline. You run a lot of lame errands to kill specific monsters and recover lost or stolen merchandise, and <b>you</b> <b>clean</b> out a bunch of formulaic dungeons, caves, graveyards, and the like". Other complaints included the presence of random encounters on the overland map, which were considered excessive, as well as long load times.|$|E

2500|$|René in 1986 infused eco-political {{ideology}} to his [...] "found objects" [...] in Venezuela. Water quality at the country's Lake Maracaibo {{was suffering}} greatly {{due to the}} proliferation of oil drilling and the dumping of raw sewage. Upon hearing of this, René presided over a congregation to publicize the dismaying conditions. As part of his group's efforts, a blank canvas {{was placed in the}} lake until it had absorbed a coating of the oil and sewage present in the water. Unfurled at the entrance to Venezuela's National Art Gallery in Caracas, the heat drew unpleasant odors from the canvas, adding to the episode. In response to orders from authorities to [...] "Clean it up", René countered [...] "No, <b>you</b> <b>clean</b> it up." [...] René became a celebrity of the cause during that time, attracting media attention while also embarrassing the Venezuelan government. He went on to refer to his handiwork sarcastically as both an [...] "oil painting" [...] and a [...] "still life". René also created sculptures of waste accumulated along Venezuelan beaches.|$|E
2500|$|Mayfield's {{first solo}} album, Curtis, was {{released}} in 1970, and hit the top 20, {{as well as being}} a critical success. It pre-dated Marvin Gaye's album, What's Going On, which it has been compared to. The commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with Super Fly, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation Super Fly film. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes' score for Shaft), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield's lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in Rolling Stone magazine in 1972 that while the film's message [...] "was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes" [...] because it [...] "glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [...] is far stronger and more definite than in the film." [...] Because of the tendency of these blaxploitation films to glorify the criminal life of dealers and pimps in order to target a mostly black lower class audience, Mayfield's album set this movie apart. With songs like [...] "Freddie's Dead", a song that focuses on the demise of Freddie, a junkie that was forced into [...] "pushin' dope for the man" [...] because of a debt that he owed to his dealer, and [...] "Pusherman", a song that reveals how many people in the ghetto fell victim to drug abuse, and therefore became dependent upon their dealers, Mayfield illuminated a darker side of life in the ghetto that these blaxploitation films often failed to criticize. However, although Mayfield's soundtrack criticized the glorification of dealers and pimps, he in no way denied that this glorification was occurring. When asked about the subject matter of these films he was quoted stating [...] "I don’t see why people are complaining about the subject of these films”, and “The way <b>you</b> <b>clean</b> up the films is by cleaning up the streets.” ...|$|E
