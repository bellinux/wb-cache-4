5|$|As elsewhere, {{sabotage}} {{was employed}} against enemy {{military and economic}} assets, with railway lines and bridges being common targets. The activities of Groupe G, a small student resistance cell based in Brussels, alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million man-hours of labour to repair damages done. Direct attacks on German troops and military installations were rarer, <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> estimate puts the number of German soldiers killed by the Belgian resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of France.|$|E
5|$|Draper {{shot the}} film {{in the style of}} a mockumentary—a parody in {{documentary}} format—that depicts the daily activities of the characters. Nat composed and performed the music, <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> song had been written by Alex. Principal photography took place in mid-2004 on location in New York City, and the interior scenes were vastly filmed in the family's Manhattan apartment. Draper's brother, Tim, a venture capitalist, provided financial incentives for the shoot.|$|E

5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that actually have to be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures who oversaw the introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> month after the metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and {{the high level of}} illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

25|$|The first {{members of}} the Issei did not emigrate {{directly}} to the mainland United States, but to Hawaii (when it was American-controlled but not <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> of the United States). These emigrants—the first of whom arrived on board the steamship City of Tokio in February 1885—were common laborers escaping hard times in Japan to work in Hawai'i. Their immigration was subsidized by the Hawaiian government, as cheap labor was needed for important commodity crops, especially its sugar plantations. Numerous Japanese eventually settled in Hawaii.|$|E

This would be useful because butanol has a higher energy density than ethanol, and because waste fibre left over from sugar crops used to make ethanol could be made into butanol, raising the alcohol yield of fuel crops without there being {{a need for more}} crops to be planted.|$|E

In response to this criticism, House of Representatives staff members wrote that the electricity generated by nuclear power requires the purchase of far fewer allowances than other forms of electricity generation; that the bill provides various types of financial support to build clean energy generating sources, including nuclear; and that an EPA study indicated that twice as many nuclear plants would be built if the law is passed versus the status quo.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Bernard Drachman, a key Frankel {{student and}} {{one of the founders of}} the American JTS, was himself Orthodox, and claims that the Breslau seminary was {{completely}} Orthodox. Others disagree, citing the published viewpoint of Frankel. In his magnum opus Darkhei HaMishnah (Ways of the Mishnah), Frankel amassed scholarly support which showed that Jewish law was not static, but rather had always developed in response to changing conditions. He called his approach towards Judaism 'Positive-Historical', which meant that one should accept Jewish law and tradition as normative, <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> must be open to changing and developing the law in the same historical fashion that Judaism has always historically developed.|$|E
25|$|The Prose Edda relates {{that when}} Thor cooks the goats, their flesh {{provides}} sustenance for the god, and, after Thor resurrects {{them with his}} hammer, Mjölnir, they are brought back to life the next day. According to the same source, Thor once stayed {{a night at the}} home of peasant farmers and shared with them his goat meal, <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> of their children, Þjálfi, broke one of the bones to suck out the marrow, resulting in the lameness of one of the goats upon resurrection. As a result, Thor maintains Þjálfi and his sister Röskva as his servants. Scholars have linked the ever-replenishing goats to the nightly-consumed beast Sæhrímnir in Norse mythology and Scandinavian folk beliefs involving herring bones and witchcraft.|$|E

25|$|A {{major problem}} in {{determining}} whether the Cimbri were speaking a Celtic or a Germanic language is {{that at this time}} the Greeks and Romans tended to refer to all groups to the north of their sphere of influence as Gauls, Celts, or Germani rather indiscriminately. Caesar seems {{to be one of the}} first authors to distinguish the two groups, and he had a political motive for doing so (it was an argument in favour of the Rhine border). <b>Yet,</b> <b>one</b> cannot always trust Caesar and Tacitus when they ascribe individuals and tribes to one or the other category, although Caesar made clear distinctions between the two cultures. Most ancient sources categorize the Cimbri as a Germanic tribe, but some ancient authors include the Cimbri among the Celts.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} marvellous and fanciful reports of this history, the most {{probable}} interpretation {{is that the}} Mugharrarin reached the Sargasso Sea, {{a part of the}} ocean covered by seaweed, which is very close to Bermuda <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> thousand miles away from the American mainland. Then while coming back, they may have landed either on the Azores, or on Madeira or even on the westernmost Canary Island, El Hierro (because of the sheep). Last, the story with the inhabited island might have occurred either on Tenerife or on Gran Canaria, where the Mugharrarin presumably met some Guanche tribe. This would explain why some of them could speak Arabic (some sporadic contacts had been maintained between the Canary Islands and Morocco) and why they were quickly deported to Morocco where they were welcomed by Berbers. Yet, the story reported by Idrisi is an indisputable account of a certain knowledge of the Atlantic Ocean by Andalusians and Moroccans.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the entry}} into service of the 113 and 114 Series {{throughout}} 2014, a former 20-unit set of the three-car 111 Series trains had run on the line. These trains started operating between 1983 and 1987, and were the line's first modern electrical multiple units. From January 2014 on, a 19-unit set of the four-car 113 Series trains progressively started operating on the Sabadell, Terrassa and Reina Elisenda branches together with the 112 Series. In December of the same year, a 5-unit set of the three-car 114 Series trains started operating on the Avinguda Tibidabo branch, whose station platforms are too short to hold four-car trains such as the 112 and 113 Series. The 113 and 114 Series are identical in both their technical features and design, though they differ {{in the number of}} cars and present some modifications on the seat layout. After the arrival of the 113 and 114 Series, 111 Series trains were removed from circulation and dismantled. <b>Yet,</b> <b>one</b> unit has been preserved as part of FGC's historical rolling stock.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>one</b> {{could claim}} {{in support of}} the PAD that really was there was a small 'anti-monarchy' {{movement}} which supported Thaksin. This disturbed many monarchists. Sondhi Limthongkul, forefront leader of PAD, had claimed this since 2005, when he started criticizing Thaksin Shinawatra for his 'inappropriate' act defaming the monarchy when Thaksin held a religious ceremony at the royal temple of Wat Phra Kaeo. From then on, PAD has accused Thaksin's followers as being 'anti-monarchy'. The UDD's and Thaksin's harsh attack on Prem Tinsulanonda, head of royal Privy Council and close advisor of the king, has been seen as a contradiction of Thai tradition and a hidden attempt to make a regime change. Moreover, a leader of UDD, such Jakrapob Penkair has engaged in public criticism {{of the role of the}} monarchy, mostly, seen 'negatively'. Several UDD leaders were also charged and arrested and accused of insulting the monarchy, a crime under Thai criminal law. The PAD, therefore, has always claimed that it was defending the most revered institution according to the Constitutions, blasting UDD and Thaksin Shinawatra as anti-monarchist. The controversial issue of the monarchy has been then one of the fierce causes among these factions' supporters.|$|E
25|$|Tennis {{had always}} been a popular and well-followed sport in the country. Still, due to lack of {{financial}} means for tennis infrastructure and support of individual athletes, the participation rates among the Yugoslav youngsters for tennis were always low compared to other sports. All this meant that talented players determined to make it to pro level mostly had to rely on their own families rather than the country's tennis federation. Yugoslav players still managed to produce some notable results, mostly in the women's game. In 1977, the country got its first Grand Slam champion when clay court specialist Mima Jaušovec won at Roland Garros, beating Florența Mihai; Jaušovec reached two more French Open finals (in 1978 and 1983), but lost both of them. It was with the rise of teenage phenom Monica Seles (an ethnic Hungarian born in Novy Sad) during early 1990s that the country became a powerhouse in female tennis: she won five Grand slam events under the flag of SFR Yugoslavia – two French Opens, two Australian Opens, and one US Open. She went on to win three more Grand Slam titles under the flag of FR Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) as well as <b>yet</b> <b>one</b> more Grand Slam after immigration to the United States.|$|E

Preparations to install Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba were undertaken in response.|$|E
