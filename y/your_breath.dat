And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film {{directed}} by Ricky Lau in his directorial debut, and also produced by Sammo Hung. The film's {{box office success}} {{led to the creation}} of a Mr. Vampire franchise, with the release of four sequels {{directed by}} Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1991. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore. The film was released under the Chinese title 暫時停止呼吸 (literally: Hold <b>Your</b> <b>Breath</b> for a Moment) in Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.|$|E

500|$|Despite the song's {{commercial}} performance, critical {{reactions to}} the song were mixed to positive. Jon O'Brien of Allmusic, {{in a review of}} Megalomania, viewed [...] "Playmate to Jesus" [...] as one of the highlight songs of the album saying, [...] "The sweeping strings, inspired sound effects, and driving country-pop melodies of the lushly produced opener 'Playmate to Jesus', [...] shows the reunion hasn't been completely without merit." [...] Time said the song [...] "has the dubious distinction of sounding vaguely like a Lady Gaga track that didn’t pass quality control," [...] but was [...] "relatively catchy, boasting the kind of musical infectiousness that causes you to hum it under <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> on the subway." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I wanted {{to sit in the}} front row and let the images wash out to the edges of my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the pilot}} were {{generally}} positive. David Hinckley of the New York Daily News called it [...] "bold, different and exciting, with a central character and performance that take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away". Hinckley praised Hall's dynamic Emmy-worthy performance, and the [...] "indispensable and haunting" [...] narration. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune claimed [...] "to deny yourself the engrossing Dexter based on its subject matter would be {{to miss out on}} one of television's most fiendishly intelligent new dramas". Ryan enjoyed the series' black comedy aspects, which she thought were [...] "infused with the most pitch-dark irony on television". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe was impressed by Hall's grand performance, especially in his ability to make Dexter likable. Gilbert praised the set designers, comparing the crime scenes to a Vanity Fair photo spread.|$|E

[...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan found [...] "so much is {{happening}} {{you feel the}} immediate need of a sequel just {{as a reward for}} absorbing it all. While X-Men doesn't take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away wire-to-wire the way The Matrix did, it's an accomplished piece of work with considerable pulp watchability to it." [...] ReelReviews.net's James Berardinelli, an X-Men comic book fan, believed, [...] "the film is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure". Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented, [...] "he movie's enjoyable on the surface, but I suspect many people, even die-hards, will be less enthusiastic about what lies, or doesn't, underneath".|$|E

Chris Martins of Spin compared the video to the TV series Nova, stating that the video [...] "might be the weirdest NOVA pilot ever created", later adding that Björk [...] "reinvents herself as the freakiest geology teacher the world's ever seen", an expression used also by io9 blogger George Dvorsky, who commented that [...] "this stunning new video for [...] "Mutual Core" [...] makes us wish we had Björk for a geology teacher". Brett Warner of Ology praised the director's work stating that [...] "director Andrew Thomas Huang's gorgeous visuals will adeptly manage to both confuse {{the hell out of}} you and absolutely take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away". Abdullah Saeed of The Atlantic compared the video to her previous works and commented: ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to hold <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E

500|$|... "No Better" [...] is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has {{a similar}} {{sonority}} {{to that of other}} songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's [...] "feathery" [...] vocals and minimal production. It incorporates [...] "woozy" [...] basslines, and [...] "pulsing" [...] synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody [...] "dreamy", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde [...] " [...] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change". At the first verse, she sings [...] "We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers / And <b>your</b> <b>breath's</b> hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings [...] "Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all".|$|R

500|$|Several critics {{commented on}} the {{controversy}} over lines in the film talking about the mentally disabled. Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "...is just sophomoric enough to offend. And while it is also funny, it is without the empathy or compassion to cause us to wonder why we are laughing." [...] Christian Toto of The Washington Times argued against the opposition, [...] "Tropic Thunder is drawing fire from special interest groups for ...its frequent {{use of the word}} 'retard', but discerning audiences will know where the humor is targeted. And they'll be laughing too hard to take offense." [...] Kurt Loder of MTV contrasted the opposition to the lines with Downey character portrayal of an African American, [...] "The scene in which the derisive Alpa Chino [...] nails Lazarus' recitation of black-uplift homilies as nothing more than the lyrics to the Jeffersons theme is funny; but the one in which Lazarus quietly explains to Speedman that his Simple Jack character failed because he made the mistake of going 'full retard'—rather than softening his character with cuteness in the manner of Forrest Gump—is so on-the-nose accurate, it takes <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} met with {{positive}} reaction by critics. Gaffa Norway critic Tord Litleskare considered it [...] "the most positive song from Truth Serum with its strong chorus and subdued verses". Additionally, he called it a [...] "must-hear track" [...] alongside [...] "Habits" [...] and [...] "Not On Drugs". Richard S. Chang of Redbull.com ranked it at number 3 on his Top 5 Best Tove Lo songs list and wrote that [...] "'Out Of Mind' provides the blueprint for Tove Lo's hits: soft and spare verse, followed by an explosive chorus — all fitting in nicely at just over three minutes". Under the Gun Review's Tarynn Law called it a [...] "powerful shadow pop track" [...] that [...] "shows off [...] outstanding vocals and just how much promise she has". Mark Savage of BBC wrote that the pre-chorus of the song was [...] "a moment on [...] that will take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away". Idolator critic Sam Lansky called it [...] "a cinematic anthem, perfectly suited for some big heartbreak montage, with a big, gorgeous stampeding chorus that crashes in out of nowhere". He also noted that, with the song, the singer positions as [...] "the next great Swedish pop act".|$|E
500|$|Media {{reactions}} to the race were positive, with Kevin Eason of The Times saying, [...] "What the inaugural Rockingham 500 CART FedEx race in Britain lacked in quantity, it made up for with driving of the highest quality."

Writing for The Sunday Telegraph, Brough Scott stated, [...] "Births have always come with their share of noise, difficulty, danger and the odd touch of absurdity. But never can all the elements have been mixed as heavily as in yesterday's much-delayed launch of the Rockingham 500, which opened and closed with overtaking manoeuvres dramatic enough to take <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> away." [...] Richard Williams of The Guardian wrote, [...] "the 38,000 people who had battled against uncertainty and Silverstone-style traffic jams to see US single-seater cars racing on a banked oval track {{for the first time}} in Britain were rewarded with a race that fully reflected the present strengths of a branch of motor sport that can trace its roots back to the first running of the Indianapolis 500 race in 1911." [...] The Associated Press stated that despite the race almost being cancelled it became [...] "one of CART's most dramatic of the season." ...|$|E
