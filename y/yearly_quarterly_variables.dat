Comparisons of out-of-sample forecasts are made with other methods used in the M 3 -Competition via the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE).

40|$|In this paper, various {{enhanced}} {{sales forecast}} methodologies and {{models for the}} automobile market are presented. The methods used deliver highly accurate predictions while maintaining the ability to explain the underlying model at the same time. The representation of the economic training data is discussed, {{as well as its}} eects on the newly registered automobiles to be predicted. The methodology mainly consists of time series analysis and classical Data Mining algorithms, whereas the data is composed of absolute and/or relative market-specic exogenous parameters on a <b>yearly,</b> <b>quarterly,</b> or monthly base. It can be concluded that the monthly forecasts were especially improved by this enhanced methodology using absolute, normalized exogenous parameters. Decision Trees are consider ed as the most suitable method in this case, being both accurate and explicable.

By {{estimating}} a Structural DynamicFactor model on a panel of 109 US <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> from 1982 to 2010, we find that,although the Federal Reserve’s policy between 2002 and 2004 was slightly expansionary,its contribution to the recent housing cycle was negligible. We also show that a morerestrictive policy would have smoothed the cycle but not prevented the recession. Wethus find no role for the Federal Reserve in causing the recession. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|We present two results {{concerning}} soybean prices. First, we {{exhibit a}} simple relationship between stocks and price volatility. The observation of an increasing price volatility with decreasing inventory is often {{mentioned in the}} literature, but {{has so far been}} documented using a proxy for inventory (see Fama and French 1987, 1988; Litzenberger and Rabinowitz 1995). Instead, we reconstruct a <b>yearly,</b> <b>quarterly,</b> and monthly database of worldwide soybean inventories using aggregate data from the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. We show that under all time scales, price volatility is an increasing linear function of inverse inventory, which we term "scarcity. " Second, we show how the addition of the factor scarcity in a state-variable approach to the dynamics of the term structure of soybean forward prices improves the quality of the fit. We document this property on a 25 -year database of CBOT futures contracts and show that the superior accuracy also affects long-maturity futures contracts, an important property for the valuation of long-term origination contracts between producing countries and the agrifood industry. term structure of soybean forward prices, state variables, scarcity-related volatility...|$|R
40|$|The {{populations in}} many {{developed}} countries throughout the world are aging rapidly {{and the number of}} geriatric patients is expected to rise steeply in those countries. This will exert greater pressures on the management of hospital resources as a result. Hospital length of stay (LOS) is an important indicator of hospital activity and management because of its direct relation to resource consumption. Planning of hospital resources according to identified trends of LOS is, thus, an effective way to meet such future needs. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the temporal trends of LOS based on the Coxian phase-type distributions, a special type of continuous-time Markov process. By fitting and regressing the probabilities of discharge from each phase of the distribution on time, we have found a growing trend in the proportion of long-staying patients in our sample of stroke patients from a general hospital in Singapore. We compare the <b>yearly,</b> <b>quarterly</b> and monthly trends over the same period to see the common pattern. The datasets were also robustified by bootstrapping to aid the analysis...|$|R

S. In this paper, we introduce and examine a new international real-time dataset assembled from original quarterly releases of 13 <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> presented in the OECD Main Economic Indicators from 1962 to 1998 for 26 OECD countries. By merging this data with the current OECD real-time dataset, which starts in 1999, researchers get access to a standard, up-to-date resource. To illustrate the importance of using real-time data in macroeconomic analysis, we consider five economic applications analyzed from a real-time perspective.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} {{establish}} mathematical relationships between {{some of the}} most used concepts in the analysis of cyclical developments, such as the month-on-month and year-on-year percentage variations, or the annual rate of growth. Some of these relationships are already used in practice, but up to now never demonstrated in a formal way. The ultimate aim is to develop a set of precise analytical tools for the short term analysis of high frequency variables. Analytical derivations are followed by various empirical examples based on data on main Italian economic variables, both monthly (such as the consumer price index) and <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> (like gross domestic product) for the most recent years, in order to illustrate the theoretical relationships and clarify their practical uselfuness. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} current {{literature}} which questions {{the stability of}} the monetary transmission mechanism, by proposing a factor-augmented vector autoregressive (VAR) model with time-varying coefficients and stochastic volatility. The VAR coefficients and error covariances may change gradually in every period or be subject to abrupt breaks. The model is applied to 143 post-World War II <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> fully describing the US economy. I show that both endogenous and exogenous shocks to the US economy resulted in the high inflation volatility during the 1970 s and early 1980 s. The time-varying factor augmented VAR produces impulse responses of inflation which significantly reduce the price puzzle. Impulse responses of other indicators of the economy show that the most notable changes in the transmission of unanticipated monetary policy shocks occurred for GDP, investment, exchange rates and money. ...|$|R

40|$|We define nowcasting as the {{prediction}} of the present, {{the very near future}} and the very recent past. Key in this process is to use timely monthly information in order to nowcast <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> that are published with long delays. We argue that the nowcasting process goes beyond the simple production of an early estimate and it consists in the analysis of the link between the news in consecutive data releases and the resulting forecast revisions for the target variable. We describe an econometric framework that allows us to mimic, via a coherent statistical model, the judgemental process of nowcasting traditionally conducted in policy institutions and used, alongside the judgemental procedures, in many central banks. To illustrate our ideas, we study the nowcast of euro area GDP {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008. Factor Model; Forecasting; News; Nowcasting...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{literature}} on statistical properties of interbank loans has reported various power-laws, {{particularly for the}} degree distribution (i. e. the distribution of credit links between institutions). In this paper, we revisit data for the Italian interbank network based on overnight loans recorded on the e-MID trading platform during the period 1999 - 2010 using both daily and quarterly aggregates. In contrast to previous authors, we find no evidence in favor of scale-free networks. Rather, the data are best described by negative Binomial distributions. For quarterly data, Weibull, Gamma, and Exponential distributions tend to provide comparable fits. We find comparable results when investigating {{the distribution of the}} number of transactions, even though in this case the tails of the <b>quarterly</b> <b>variables</b> are much fatter. The absence of power-law behavior casts doubts on the claim that interbank data fall into the category of scale-free networks...|$|R
