Those tiny nuances are really helpful to show their character and show what they are after." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clarice {{is one of}} the escaped {{inmates and}} was {{originally}} intended to be an homage to Chop Top Sawyer, a character from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, but was later developed into her own character. Seth M. Sherwood stated that [...] "When you see her, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> little of that DNA in there", describing Chop Top as his favourite Sawyer. A revisionist take on Chop Top was added due to the diminished role of the family in earlier drafts of the script, but was removed when the filmmakers began to feel that she was more of a [...] "rip-off" [...] than a genuine tribute. The version of Clarice that appears in the final film emerged when Sherwood imagined [...] "an image of this little girl in pigtails burning down her house with her parents inside". Out of all the performances in Leatherface, Sherwood called Jessica Madsen's the most accurate of what he envisioned while writing. Deciding that Clarice is [...] "much more than just a pyromaniac", Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo removed scenes detailing her backstory, such as her weaponising fire for the first time, her addiction for [...] "watching the flames dancing", and exposition on her family's disappearance. As the film begins, it remains ambiguous as to which inmate is actually Jedidiah Sawyer, the eventual Leatherface. Maury and Bustillo even considered leading the audience to believe that Clarice could become the titular character, [...] "It wasn’t a so crazy idea to have regarding the passion Leatherface had for dresses and makeup in the previous movies." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Kewpie doll {{has been}} the mascot of the school for the last 100 years. Hickman is the only known school {{in the world with}} a Kewpie as its mascot. The name dates back to the {{basketball}} season of 1913 -1914 at what was known then as Columbia High School. Apparently, the school secretary owned a Kewpie doll, as they were popular figurines then, and she kept it on her desk. [...] At one of the first basketball games in December 1913 she placed her Kewpie doll {{in the center of the}} court, and the entire game was played around it without it being broken. [...] This was somewhat remarkable since the dolls were very fragile. [...] Because it survived the game and brought a victory, it was thereafter considered the good luck mascot. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> picture of that Kewpie doll beneath Sam Church in the team photograph in the 1914 school annual. That team had a straight claim to the state championship of Missouri for 1914 as they had an undefeated season. Coincidentally Sam Church was the Captain of the 1914 Kewpie basketball team and was the first Kewpie to letter in four sports. The school annual, the Cresset of 1914 was the first annual to display a Kewpie. In addition to the doll between Sam’s feet in the team picture a drawing of a Kewpie appeared as a dedication to the team. The dedication said, “To the Basket Ball Team of 1914, whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling’, has won the State Championship, this volume of the Cresset is dedicated.” The only previous known mascot for Columbia High School, which became David Henry Hickman High School in 1927, was the Trojans. [...] It is referenced in the first school annual, the Cresset of 1912. Columbia/Hickman High School has graduated over 35,000 “Kewpies” in its history and they are still proud to be called “Kewpies!” ...|$|E
