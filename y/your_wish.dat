500|$|Girls' Generation {{is known}} for reinventing their fashion styles and stage {{performances}} throughout their career. In their early years, the group performed in uniforms; with the debut single [...] "Into the New World", they introduced themselves as high school students. In 2009, the group set the [...] "colorful skinny jeans" [...] fashion trend with [...] "Gee", and later opted for a marine-inspired image on wearing uniforms and shorts that highlighted their legs with [...] "Tell Me <b>Your</b> <b>Wish</b> (Genie)". In 2010, the group's image became more diverse: they used a cheerleader concept for [...] "Oh!", while the performances of their 2010 single [...] "Run Devil Run" [...] was noted for conveying a darker theme, which was billed [...] "Black SoShi". Later that year, the group transformed themselves to Bond Girls-inspired singers for the visual of [...] "Hoot". In 2011, the group established a [...] "heroine" [...] image, with members choosing their own outfits, emphasizing each of the members' own tastes rather than performing in uniforms. For the performances of [...] "I Got a Boy" [...] (2013), the members opted for flat shoes instead of their signature high heels in order to perform the choreography correctly.

The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. <b>Your</b> <b>wish</b> could not have two meanings.

We sent Shyamsundar, “Go and bargain, see what you can manage.” Shyamsundar went and could fix her up for three hundred rupees. He came back and said, “Three hundred rupees and two bottles of brandy.” On hearing about the brandy we were taken aback, mummy could object. Shyamsundar said, “She cannot sing without taking brandy.” Everything was ready. Saraswati entered the gathering. She was demure, round nosed, nothing great. Natore said, “Abanda, what have you done? Just thrown away three hundred rupees.” She was going to sing two songs. Natore was ready to {{accompany}} her on the mridangam. As the clock struck ten she started singing. One song and it was eleven at night. Natore was paralysed with the mridnagam in his lap. The wonderful voice of Saraswati reverberated around that dance-hall. How wonderfully she had tuned her voice. Some of us with pillows in our laps, others with hands close to our hearts, we were all wonderstruck. The gathering was won over with just one song. Everyone was still immersed in the song, when Saraswati said, “Aur kuch farmaiye.” (present <b>your</b> <b>wish).</b> After listening to her, no one dared to put anything forward. Then I told Shyamsundar, “Ask her to sing a bhajan. We have heard that bhajans of Kashi are very famous.” She sang a bhajan known to all, “Ao to Brajachandalal...” (Come oh, Lord!)
