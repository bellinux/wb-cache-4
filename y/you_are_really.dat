He {{said of the}} Stuka, [...] "I had flown a lot of dive-bombers and it’s {{the only one that}} you can dive truly vertically. Sometimes with the dive-bombers...maximum dive is usually in the order of 60 degrees.. When flying the Stuka, because it’s all automatic, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> flying vertically... The Stuka was in a class of its own." ...|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{create a}} typical [...] "save-the-world" [...] {{story with a}} large cast, Futatsugi wanted to {{concentrate}} on {{a small number of}} characters [...] "who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> close to", which he felt would make the story more meaningful. An early version had Edge as an imperial soldier who defects; Craymen also had an extensive backstory, explaining his motivations for betraying the Empire. Both stories were cut for time. Although Edge is not a silent protagonist, Futatsugi minimized his dialogue outside cutscenes to focus on Azel's story, who he felt was the most important character. Sega estimated that the game's dialogue amounted to over 1,500 pages of Japanese text. Like the other Panzer Dragoon games, Saga features a fictional language, [...] "Panzerese", which combines elements of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian; Saga only features Panzerese in the introduction sequence, {{with the rest of the}} dialogue in Japanese, subtitled in English for the western release.|$|E
500|$|The cast {{itself has}} {{received}} criticism from reviews. Lundigran criticized {{the manner in}} which romantic interactions play out, stating that [...] "considering that the love story is so integral to everything that happens—not to mention forming the central image of the box art—it's incomprehensible why no one says 'I love you' to anyone, ever". With Squall, he felt that [...] "FFVIII does break one cardinal rule: when your story is character centered, you'd better center it on a character the audience can care about. Squall, unfortunately, just doesn't fit the bill". However, GameSpot felt that Final Fantasy VIII shifts the story from the [...] "epic" [...] concepts of Final Fantasy VII to the [...] "personal", in that [...] "the characters and their relationships are all extremely believable and complex; moreover, the core romance holds up even under the most pessimistic scrutiny". A later editorial by IGN's Ryan Clements echoed this sentiment, appreciating that Squall and Rinoa's single kiss during the finale serves [...] "one of the player's main rewards for hours of dedication". Although the reviewer at Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine acknowledged possible fears over a romantic storyline, he stated that [...] "it's only later in the game, once <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> attached to all the distinct and complex characters, that the more emotional themes are gradually introduced".|$|E

500|$|... 10 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and noted {{it as an}} 'Album Pick', calling it [...] "one {{of the best and}} most long-awaited greatest-hits albums in recent memory". Johnson praised the amount of content, saying [...] "For fans, the videos alone make this worth picking up". Jenna DeWitt of The Baylor Lariat gave it an A-, praising [...] "I Can Only Imagine (Symphony Edition)" [...] as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] as well as the DVD content, and saying [...] "the only mistake in buying this album is if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> tired of the extensive radio airplay that these hits have gotten". Dave Derbyshire of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, calling it a [...] "brilliant introduction" [...] to the band. His only criticism on the album was that he considered a few of the songs as being overly sentimental. Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars. Johnson noted the DVD content as being [...] "what really makes this worth your money", but was critical of the interface; he also felt the CD content, while solid, did not include enough songs and that the new recordings weren't particularly impressive. He noted the orchestra and Millard's vocals as conflicting on the re-recording of [...] "I Can Only Imagine", but also said that it [...] "takes the song to new heights than previously conceived". Justin Michael of Sight Magazine gave the album a positive review, calling it [...] "A must for all MercyMe fans, for those who need a hooky melody with a message and for people who love getting a free DVD with their albums!"; he also praised the one-camera tour videos, but noted [...] "Ten Simple Rules" [...] is [...] "not their brightest musical moment".|$|E
500|$|The Southern Rhodesian {{electoral system}} allowed {{only those who}} met certain {{financial}} and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria were applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most Black citizens {{did not meet the}} set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly White. Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many White families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort. On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the Labour candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe. At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. The Liberals, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City, retired and was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Raymond Stockil, who renamed the Liberals the Rhodesia Party. Having grown up in an area of Cape Town so pro-Smuts that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband's entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. [...] "First of all I was marrying a farmer," [...] she later said, [...] "now {{he was going to be}} a politician as well. So I said, 'Well, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> interested in it, carry on.'...It never dawned on me—being so naive about politicians—that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his 2015 book, Farage {{reflected}} {{that based on}} his experiences, [...] "the NHS is so over-stretched {{that if you can}} afford private health care, you should take it, particularly for diagnostics and preventative medicine.

But what testicular cancer taught me is that the NHS will probably let you down if you need screening, fast diagnosis and an operation at a time that suits you". He supports reform within the NHS, saying that its resources have become stretched due to increased immigration, and blaming Labour for high costs of new hospitals built through private finance initiatives.|$|E

In response, Duterte threatened to leave the UN and form a separate organization with China and African nations.

He and {{his family}} {{migrated}} to Queens, New York {{when he was a}} child and then moved to Flushing, Queens, New York during his teenage years. Before American Idol, he was a non-profit organizer, working with children with special needs. He has spoken of suffering from emotional depression and credited the children that he worked with for helping him to recover from his illness. He has also said that the children motivated him to audition for American Idol. He auditioned in Pittsburgh with [...] "How Am I Supposed to Live Without You". His audition brought Jennifer Lopez to tears, and Steven Tyler stated [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> great. I think you could be the American Idol". He is the first Korean American to make the finals on American Idol. He was eliminated on March 29, coming in ninth place.|$|E
2500|$|Ghostbusters: The Video Game was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Greg Miller of IGN gave both the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions an 8.0 out of 10. Miller describes the game as a [...] "love letter to Ghostbusters fans", saying that it [...] "makes you feel like <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> a Ghostbuster". He lauds the CGI cutscenes as a positive feature, but finds fault with stiff character animation and bad lip sync in the other cutscenes. Miller gave the Wii version a 7.8 out of 10. Unlike Miller, fellow reviewer Matt Casamassina believed that the aiming system in Ghostbusters {{was better than the}} aiming system in Resident Evil 4. PSM3 gave the game a score of 85 out of 100, stating that the game was [...] "too short, but packed with quality and imagination." [...] The A.V. Club gave the game a B-, concluding that [...] "It’s the best Ghostbusters game of all time, though that really isn’t saying much." [...] Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot rated the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game a 7.5 out of 10, listing the ghost-trapping gameplay and multiplayer mode as positives and frustrating spots in the game and repetitive gameplay as negatives. He also reviewed the Wii version and gave it an 8 out of 10 stating that [...] "Ghostbusters is such riotous fun that you'll forgive its short length." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{after several}} years of tense relations, Abramović and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called Lovers, {{starting}} from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramović described it: [...] "That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the Gobi Desert and I from the Yellow Sea. After each of us walked 2500km, we met in the middle and said good-bye." [...] She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of mysticism, energy, and attraction. She later described the process: [...] "We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending... Because in the end <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> alone, whatever you do." [...] She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature. She felt that the metals in the ground influenced her mood and state of being; she also pondered the Chinese myths in which the Great Wall {{has been described as a}} [...] "dragon of energy." [...] It took the couple eight years to acquire permission from the Chinese government to perform the work, by the time of which their relationship had completely dissolved.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy asked Scherzinger to {{describe}} Killer Loves sound, {{during an interview}} she replied said [...] "the album is largely produced by RedOne, I wanted something explosive that could be staged live in a full performance and I needed music to match the intensity. That's what he did. It's raw, dangerous and big. That's what I {{want to be on}} stage. It's a different energy to Lady Gaga. The music is more rock, funk and soul inspired." [...] Killer Love sees Scherzinger duet with two male vocalists. On the ballad, [...] "Power's Out", she duets with English recording artist Sting. Speaking of their collaboration, which took place with both singers in the same studio, Scherzinger said [...] " [...] energy is very commanding, in a subtle way. He is giving, generous and kind. I flew to Boston for his show with The Police. I met him and he was everything and more than I thought. I felt like we were doing yoga when we were singing. He was such an easy guy to work with... Singing on the same mic <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> close. He had fresh breath. No broccoli in the teeth." [...] David Renshaw from PopDash said the song borrowed elements and the sound from The Police, a band Sting was previously lead singer of, and in particular their 1983 hit single [...] "Every Breath You Take". The other duet is with Enrique Iglesias, on his 2010 single [...] "Heartbeat". The version featured on Killer Love is the [...] "Rude Well's Open Heart Remix". Ellwood noted that the remix [...] "added beats changing the tone of the song completely." ...|$|E
