40|$|Abstract — Today, {{enterprises}} are {{flooded with}} data – terabytes and petabytes of it. Exabytes, zettabytes and <b>yottabytes</b> are definitely on the way. This tsunami of data, as some experts call it, which is growing exponentially, {{at a very}} high velocity from different sources in diverse formats, is being termed as Big Data. Big Data is the data pouring globally from transactional systems like SCM, CRM, ERP and non-transactional sources such as sensors, mobile communications, RFID, Social Media, satellites, web logs, clickstreams and emails and is structured, semi-structured or unstructured in schema. Big Data is a source of big opportunities, which need to be extracted by applying advanced analytics on it. However, there are several challenges posed by Big Data to the enterprises. Since most of the Big Data is unstructured, new approaches must be adopted by the enterprises to ingest, store, analyze, manage, distribute and process this streaming data and gain insights for innovation and competition in the business process. New infrastructure is needed to handle the explosive volume, velocity, variety and complexity of Big Data. Core competence is required to analyze in real time, the full spectrum of data and discover the patterns, trends and relationships in Big Data, which are the sources of innovation and business transformation. The highlights of this research paper are to define Big Data, explain the significance of Big Data, discuss the approaches to leverage the benefits of Big Data in the Enterprises and look at the future state of Big Data...|$|R
40|$|The BRAIN Initiative aims {{to break}} new {{ground in the}} scale and speed of data {{collection}} in neuroscience, requiring tools to handle data in the magnitude of <b>yottabytes</b> (1024). The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified ‘big science’ for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, {{the promise of the}} BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behaviour and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this ‘data driven’ paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new ‘open neuroscience’ projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity. Our paper serves to highlight some foreseeable tensions around data sharing relevant to the emergent ‘open neuroscience’ movement...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{report is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, 2012. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 46). The everlasting necessity to process data is only {{becoming more and more}} challenging due to the exponential growth of the data itself. We are talking about exabytes, zettabytes and even <b>yottabytes</b> of data; generally referred to as Big Data. Hence, the conventional processing methods of data have become obsolete when handling Big Data. It is simply not feasible to use a single machine to analyze data of such tremendous volume. This is where Hadoop comes in. Simply put, using the Hadoop Distributive File System (HDFS), an enormous chunk of data can be divided into smaller pieces and be distributed amongst multiple machines referred to as nodes to parallel process them using a technique called MapReduce. The potential for such a concept is limitless. However, for our thesis, we have used the HDFS to identify similarities between multiple documents. The initial idea was to make an algorithm to detect full or partial plagiarism in documents as there are countless materials of interest readily available on the internet. However, upon successfully being able to implement an algorithm for the English language, we realized that there is no record of any work on document similarity detection carried on upon Bangla language. Therefore, with some modifications to our existing algorithm to fit our specifications (as the Bangla language is completely different from the English language as far as construction is concerned), we were able to develop an algorithm to detect document similarities on a broad scale using the Ferret model.
