He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when Mountain Lion hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is whether Mountain Lion is worth the upgrade. Let's get that out of the way now — yes, it is definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, Mountain Lion was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|E
