Scott of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review and wrote, [...] "If your {{intention is to}} make a brooding, hauntingly allegorical terror-thriller, it's probably not a good sign when spectacles of mass death and intimations of planetary destruction are met with hoots and giggles ... The draggy, lurching two hours of [...] "Knowing" [...] will make you long {{for the end of the}} world, even as <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> there will not be time for all your questions to be answered." [...] In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Hartlaub called the film [...] "an excitement for fans of Proyas" [...] and [...] "a surprisingly messy effort." [...] He thought Nicolas Cage [...] "borders on ridiculous here, in part because of a script that gives him little to do but freak out or act depressed".|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} William Ruhlman {{wrote of the}} album [...] "One Big Town is not a subtle album by any means, {{but it is an}} impassioned one, even if <b>you</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> its creator might be ready to quit the music {{business}} and retire to some remote farm by the end of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} be {{entering}} that world of the strange cliche-ed cop, but you soon realise {{that you have to}} get comfortable in that world. You think [...] "Hang on, some of the clichés are part of that territory". It would like writing a Western and going [...] "Oh no Ive given him a horse! What a terrible cliché!" [...] Its not a cliché - Its {{part and parcel of the}} genre - cowboys have six-guns, horses and stetsons and detectives have a past... problems and flaws, because if they dont, then there is nothing to read about.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the first}} multi-party {{election}} of Kenya, in 1992, Maathai strove {{to unite the}} opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga) and FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba); former vice president Mwai Kibaki had left the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party, and formed the Democratic Party. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group {{in an effort to}} unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament. It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian regime. You don't know who to trust. <b>You</b> <b>worry</b> <b>that</b> you, your family, or your friends will be arrested and jailed without due process. The fear of political violence or death, whether through direct assassinations or targeted [...] "accidents", is constant. Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.

5000|$|A {{more recent}} trend is for sarcastic tips {{to be offered}} that are {{observations}} by the readers regarding other people's behaviour, such as a barmaid who suggests male public house customers who are [...] "trying {{to get into a}} barmaid's knickers" [...] should [...] "pull back your tenner just as she reaches to take it when paying for a round.
