500|$|Kafka was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round (122nd overall) in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the fifth quarterback taken in the draft, behind Sam Bradford (1st overall), Tim Tebow (25th overall), Jimmy Clausen (48th overall) and Colt McCoy (85th overall). Kafka {{was expected to be}} the team's third-string quarterback behind Kevin Kolb and Michael Vick. Eagles head coach Andy Reid said of Kafka, [...] "I think once <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> I think you'll see he's a smart guy. He has some of the intangible things â€“ the leadership, he's a tough kid. Inner city, Chicago kid. He's got a little grit to him. I think that's important. You have to be wired right to handle you guys and play in the city of Philadelphia. I think he's wired right. He likes to compete." [...] Kafka was signed to a four-year contract worth $2.256 million with $467,000 guaranteed on June 15, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Jones tirelessly {{defended the}} {{integrity}} of country music, telling Billboard in 2006, [...] "It's never been for love of money. [...] I thank God for it because it makes me a living. [...] But I sing because I love it, {{not because of the}} dollar signs." [...] Jones also {{went out of his way}} to promote younger country singers that he felt were as passionate about the music as he was. [...] "Everybody knows he's a great singer," [...] Alan Jackson stated in 1995, [...] "but what I like most about George is that when <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> he is like some old guy that works down at the gas station...even though he's a legend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't want to {{hear any}} more! This is your respect for your father's memory,' groaned the widow. 'When did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> again?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} you them with pleasure, sir. Only, if <b>you</b> <b>meets</b> <b>him</b> and gets to know him afterwards, don't you let out that I showed you his rooms. He is a mighty perticular sort of gent, though he is so affable and pleasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> this Umslopogaas, as <b>you</b> will <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> he who {{is called}} the Woodpecker and the Slaughterer, say these words to him, ...|$|R
60|$|You {{could not}} tell Maecenas that <b>you</b> would <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> again; <b>you</b> could only promise to tread the dark path with him.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is a most}} unpleasant-looking man," [...] Lady Deringham faltered, white now to the lips. [...] "Where did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him?</b> Here or in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The next valley, my son, is {{inhabited}} by the giant Hartilaf," [...] said the King, [...] "and should <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> {{he might do}} you an injury." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, she sought her brother's {{knowledge}} of Kelley. [...] "Tell me about him, Fred. Where did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> first? He interests me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{my friend}} Father Brown," [...] said Flambeau. [...] "I've often wanted <b>you</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>him.</b> Splendid weather, this; a little cold for Southerners like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But did <b>you</b> not <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> Monsieur?" [...] she demanded. [...] "He left an {{hour ago}} for New Orleans. You must have met a gentleman riding very fast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{he did not}} see you at {{the hour}} he expected, but {{required}} <b>you</b> should <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> alone at Muschat's Cairn this night, so soon as the moon rises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... --Haines missed you, he said. Did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him?</b> He'll see {{you after}} at the D. B. C. He's gone to Gill's to buy Hyde's Lovesongs of Connacht.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blind Hal bids <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> at the Spital, at {{your good}} pleasure," [...] said the boy; {{and like the}} mountebank he was, tumbled three times head over heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to see}} him. When <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> next, {{tell him}} to call on me. Why has he not been here? Surely you are not keeping up your old quarrel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are on a}} {{hunt for}} a missing man," [...] {{answered}} Randolph Rover. [...] "Did <b>you</b> ever <b>meet</b> <b>him?</b> His name is Anderson Rover, and he is my brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he hoped, lady. He {{said that}} he would have come {{straight}} here, first, but {{he thought it would be}} more pleasant for <b>you</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> in privacy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{have nothing}} to say to you beyond this: tell me what has passed between you and Philip Wakem. When did <b>you</b> first <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> in the Red Deeps?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I prophesy, Captain Mallett, that if ever <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> in {{the future}} you will turn the tables on him. Such a man as that can never win in the long run." ...|$|E
60|$|Reynard, {{wherever}} <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> {{whether on}} the old road at twilight, or on the runway before the hounds, impresses you as an animal of dignity and calculation. He never seems surprised, much less frightened; never loses his head; never does things hurriedly, or {{on the spur of}} the moment, as a scatter-brained rabbit or meddling squirrel might do. <b>You</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> perhaps as he leaves the warm rock on the south slope of the old oak woods, where he has been curled up asleep all the sunny afternoon. (It is easy to find him there in winter.) Now he is off on his nightly hunt; he is trotting along, head down, brows deep-wrinkled, planning it all out.|$|E
60|$|This fellow is typical; <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> {{everywhere}} abroad. He translates {{your bill}} into English for you, calls ten centimes a penny, calculates twelve francs to the pound, and presses {{a handful of}} sous affectionately upon you as change for a napoleon.|$|E
6000|$|... "His horse was, and {{the boys}} found his hat. That, however, is quite a played-out trick. If you're not satisfied, I can fix it for <b>you</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> here any time you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That he is {{the real}} 'Arry Axes! Hush, not a word now! We join the dahabiyeh to-night. At daybreak <b>you</b> will <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> at the fourth angle of the pyramid, first turning from the Nile!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> will <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> elsewhere, Lord. For {{if you do}} not go to {{look for}} Jana, Jana will come to look for you who have hurt him so sorely. Remember that henceforth, {{wherever}} you go in all this land, it may happen that <b>you</b> will <b>meet</b> Jana." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} it {{advisable}} to see Fletcher, you might run down to San Jose {{for a day or}} two with your mother, and call on the Ramirez. They may know him or somebody who does. Of course if <b>YOU</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> and casually invite him it would be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father will}} thank you, when <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> Monsieur Fletcher. As for me, I cannot {{tell you what}} I feel, but I shall pray for you always; and that God, who sent you to my aid, will watch over you in all dangers," [...] Claire de Valecourt had said, as she bade him goodbye.|$|E
6000|$|... "Blaikie {{was saying}} {{something}} about it this morning," [...] resumed Swann, regarding him from half-closed lids, [...] "but he was punching and tapping me all about the ribs while he was talking, and I didn't catch all he said, but I think it's all arranged. Murchison is there nearly every day, I understand; I suppose <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Make haste--my little Rachel--do, [...] The first <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with--bid <b>him</b> come, [...] Ask him to lend {{his horse}} to-night, [...] And this good Man, whom Heaven requite, [...] Will help {{to bring the}} body home." [...] 1065 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It lies at {{your own}} option, Miriam, to do away the obstacle, at any moment," [...] remarked the sculptor. [...] "It is but to ascend Donatello's tower, and <b>you</b> will <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> there, under the eye of God." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Vernon thoughtfully, [...] "I know an English {{shipping}} {{boss who}} might {{help you get}} a berth. I'd rather like <b>you</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> but we'll talk about this again. Now let's join those fellows at deck-quoits." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, please!' cried Alice deprecatingly, {{at first}} not apprehending {{the force of}} the words, having never known the gulf from which Mrs. Houghton had saved her, and that lady, seeing that the girl was {{listening}} with all her ears, thought of little pitchers and restrained her reminiscences, asking with real warm interest, 'And how was it? How did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> again?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my pet," [...] replied Mrs Stanley, {{pressing}} {{the child to}} her bosom, [...] "but you must pray for him, and speak kindly to him when <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him,</b> and that will perhaps put it away. And now let us talk of the far-off country that papa was speaking about. I wonder {{what he has to}} tell you about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} he did have to. He talked to you {{as if there was}} no one else here. How did <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> before? When did you?" [...] She could not wait for Cornelia to say, but broke out with fresh astonishment. [...] "Why, Walter Ludlow! Do you know who Walter Ludlow is? He's one of the {{greatest}} painters in New York. He's the greatest!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lurking," [...] said Mr. Clare. [...] "It {{is one of}} the {{intolerable}} {{peculiarities of}} louts that they always lurk. I haven't seen my lout this morning. It <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> with <b>him</b> anywhere, give him a kick, and say I want him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, honestly, Fred,' I said, 'I'm not fooling you. There {{is a man}} downstairs. He got {{in through}} the window. I want <b>you</b> to <b>meet</b> <b>him.</b> He's very shy, and I think it will do him {{good to have a}} chat with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{but he said}} <b>you</b> were to <b>meet</b> <b>him</b> there," [...] {{continued}} Markham, {{glancing around}} the empty room with a slight expression of relief.|$|R
