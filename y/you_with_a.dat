She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

Ann Oldenburg of USA Today summarized that the episode required viewers to [...] "reach for the Kleenex".

500|$|The {{day before}} the All-Star Game, Giants' manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, {{announced}} his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about Kemp, [...] "He's a guy with speed, power, a guy that can beat <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> base hit or a long ball. He's {{what you call a}} complete player – tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous." [...] Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.|$|E

[...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless.

Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis rated the film 4 out of 5 and remarked that movie [...] "engages you at a personal level", and further added that, [...] "Barfi cannot be missed. It demands patience, but the payoff is incredible".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{lingering}} shadow of these accusations, [...] "Cog" [...] drew an unprecedented amount of critical acclaim. It received more awards than any commercial in history; {{so many that}} it was both the most-awarded commercial of 2004 and the 33rd-most-awarded commercial of 2003. The jury for the British Television Advertising Awards gave the piece the highest score of any commercial ever recorded; the jury's chairman Charles Inge commented: [...] "My own opinion {{is that this is}} the best commercial that I have seen for at least ten years."

500|$|SF writer Alfred Bester, {{an editor}} of Holiday Magazine and a {{sophisticated}} Manhattanite, recounted at some length his [...] "one demented meeting" [...] with Campbell, a man he imagined from afar to be [...] "a combination of Bertrand Russell and Ernest Rutherford." [...] The first thing Campbell said to him was that Freud was dead, destroyed by the new discovery of Dianetics, which, he predicted, would win L. Ron Hubbard the Nobel Peace Prize. Campbell ordered the bemused Bester to [...] "think back. Clear yourself. Remember! You can remember when your mother tried to abort <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> button hook.

500|$|Despite the praise, Patrick Joynt of 1UP.com {{criticized the}} conversations between in-game NPCs and the player: [...] "When an NPC greets <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> custom piece of {{dialogue}} (such as a guard's warning) and then reverts {{to the standard}} options (like a guard's cheerful directions just after that warning) it's more jarring than the canned dialogue by itself". GameSpy's Justin Speer criticized the [...] "disruptive loading stutters while moving across the game world" [...] and long loading times. Speer noted several miscellaneous bugs, such as unintended floating objects and unsynchronized lip-synching and speech. Onyett of IGN criticized the disjunction between enemies that scaled up according to the player's level and not their combat abilities or NPC allies, the loading times and the imprecision in the combat system, but stated that [...] "none of those minor criticisms hold back Oblivion from being a thoroughly enjoyable, user-friendly, gorgeous experience with enough content to keep you returning time and time again".|$|E
