The Croatian government carried out a counterstrike against the rebels, sending Interior Ministry special police to re-establish control. Fighting broke out between the two sides.

5|$|In the 1980s the {{political}} situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina, Kosovo and Montenegro. In January 1990, the Communist Party fragmented along national lines, with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation. In the same year, the first multi-party elections were held in Croatia, with Franjo Tuđman's win raising nationalist tensions further. The Serbs in Croatia, intent on achieving independence from Croatia, left the Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK). As tensions rose, Croatia declared independence in June 1991; however the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991. Tensions escalated into the Croatian War of Independence when the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>National</b> <b>Army</b> and various Serb paramilitaries attacked Croatia. By the end of 1991, a high intensity war fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to controlling about two-thirds of its territory.|$|E

Western Slavonia was occupied in August 1991, following an advance by the Yugoslav forces north from Banja Luka across the Sava River cutting the primary communication route to the nation's capital.

5000|$|Dartmouth College Professor Gerd Gemünden {{believed}} the film's {{popularity in the}} German Democratic Republic, and that of its sequels, {{could be attributed to}} the manner in which both the personal biography of Mitić and the characteristics of his screen personae resonated with both the audience and the establishment. First, the actor was the son of Živojin Mitić, an officer of Marshal Josip Broz Tito's <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>National</b> Liberation <b>Army</b> who fought the Germans in World War II, thus fitting in with the GDR' state-espoused Anti-fascism, which was central part of national identity. The Native Americans he portrayed, like Tokei-ihto, were members of an oppressed minority [...] "refusing to be a passive victim to genocide", thus offering a [...] "fantasy of a resistance fighter" [...] to the audience, especially as he was seen to organize an Old West parallel of partisan warfare; the obvious capitalistic traits of the antagonists and the fact they were American comfortably embedded the picture's narrative into the Cold War discourse. Another factor was Mitić's character's ideally German behavior: with his athleticism, serenity, leadership and express anti-alcoholism [...] he was often seen to spill [...] "firewater" [...] offered to him, a characteristic shared also by Karl May's heroeshe symbolized a [...] "particularly Teutonic form of model citizen". In addition to all this, while he already worked with Western filmmakers, he chose to emigrate to East Berlin a welcome contrast to the constant flow of local actors defecting to the Federal Republic.|$|R

40|$|Historians of <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> identities {{have claimed}} that the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> idea {{remained}} subordinate to well established Serbian, Croatian or {{to a lesser degree}} Slovenian national identities. Within the framework of a dynamic approach this paper focuses on the interwar period and argues that Yugoslavism was not inherently incompatible with other (sub) -national ideas. An analysis of the discourse of the ruling political elites of the interwar Yugoslav Kingdom shows that they all favored Yugoslavism. However, the concrete ways in which Yugoslavism was formulated and adopted by the ruling elites discredited the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> idea itself and resulted in increasing delineation and polarization in the continuum of national ideas available in Yugoslavia during the period. Throughout the three consecutive periods of political rule under scrutiny, ruling elites failed to reach a wider consensus regarding the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> idea and could not create a framework within which a constructive elaboration of <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> identity could take place. By the end of the interwar period, the <b>Yugoslav</b> <b>national</b> idea had become exclusively linked to conservatism, centralism, authoritarianism and, for non-Serbian elites at least, Serbian hegemony. Other national ideas gained significance as ideas providing viable alternatives for the regime’s Yugoslavism...|$|R
