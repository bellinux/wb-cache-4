2500|$|Although {{her role}} as Nova was expanded, the sequel was a disappointing rush to {{production}} {{to capitalize on the}} original. Harrison's character eked out one word before she was shot to death, but nothing fresh was added.The budget was half that of Planet of the Apes. Director Ted Post said, [...] "It moved basically as an entertainment piece, nothing more." [...] Post wanted the script rewritten. [...] "I was very unhappy with the script, and I thought the script was far from what it should have been. The story was unclear, and didn't measure up." [...] On his first reading of the script for Beneath the Planet of the Apes, star James Franciscus phoned Charlton Heston.

2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> <b>This,</b> I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E
