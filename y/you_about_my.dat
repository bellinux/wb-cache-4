2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>my</b> bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had brushed his pad without touching his bat.|$|E
