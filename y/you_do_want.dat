500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just you and that goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{sources of}} funding {{meant that the}} {{production}} team had to field opinions from various sources. Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> to see something like a kiss", she said.|$|E
