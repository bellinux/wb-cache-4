Campany (2005:16) calls this [...] "the decline of Power and the ever-farther departure from the natural Dao into systems of social constraint and what passes for culture." [...] The ancients, in the midst of chaos, were tranquil together with the whole world. At that time, yin and yang were harmoniously still, ghosts and spirits caused no disturbances; the four seasons came in good time; the myriad things went unharmed; the host of living creatures escaped premature death. … This condition persisted until integrity deteriorated to the point that Torchman Suiren and Fuhsi arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was accord, but no longer unity. Integrity further declined until the Divine Farmer and the Yellow Emperor arose to manage all under heaven, whereupon there was repose, but no longer accord. Integrity declined still further until T'ang and Yu arose to manage all under heaven. They initiated the fashion of governing by transformation, whereby purity was diluted and simplicity dissipated.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 73 - 79). vii, 79 leaves, bound 29 cmZebrasoma flavescens {{is one of}} 80 species {{within the}} surgeonfish family Acanthuridae (Nelson, 2006). Acanthurids are gonochoristic and primarily herbivorous, and are found in coral reef habitats in tropical and subtropical seas, although they are absent in the Mediterranean (Nelson, 2006). Zebrasoma flavescens (the <b>yellow</b> <b>tang)</b> and several other surgeonfish species are common on most reefs in the Hawai'ian islands, including an exceptionally large population along the Kona coast of the Big Island of Hawai'i. In fact, local mythology suggests that the nickname 'Gold Coast' is {{in reference to the}} many golden-colored fishes visible in the shallow waters of Kona, thanks to the prevalence of yellow tangs. <b>Yellow</b> <b>tang</b> provide 70. 5 % of the total catch for the aquarium trade in the state of Hawai'i, and the majority of these fish are taken from the Kona (west) side of Hawai'i island (Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources, unpublished data, FY 2006). At the urging of local interests, whose intentions were to protect coral reef fish targeted for the aquarium trade, the state legislature established a network of nine separate Fish Replenishment Areas (FRAs) on the Kona coast of Hawai'i in 2000. Currently, these protected areas, where aquarium fishing is prohibited, encompass over 30 % of the total western coastline. Since the inception of the FRA network, the Hawai'i Division of Aquatic Resources (HOAR) has been charged with maintaining populations of popular reef species, including the <b>yellow</b> <b>tang,</b> at levels that satisfy fishing interests, the burgeoning snorkel/scuba diving industry, and local conservationists. Information regarding the basic reproductive biology of a species can contribute to developing appropriate fishing regulations in terms of both location and season. The purpose of this research was to elucidate the timing and seasonality of <b>yellow</b> <b>tang</b> spawning along the Kona coast, and to use this information to estimate the reproductive potential of adult females within the population...|$|E
40|$|A {{network of}} nine Fish Replenishment Areas (FRA) {{reserves}} was demarcated in West Hawai’i in 2000 {{in response to}} declines of reef fishes taken by aquarium collectors. In 1999, we established 23 study sites in FRAs, areas open to collectors and reference areas (existing protected areas) to collect data both prior to and after {{the closure of the}} reserve network in 2000. To date we have conducted 30 bimonthly surveys as well as surveys of the benthic habitats of all sites. Baseline surveys, done prior to reserve closure, document significant effects of aquarium collector harvesting on selected fishes. On average, aquarium fishes were 26 % less abundant in newly-established reserves (formerly open) than adjacent reference areas. Analysis of post-closure surveys in 2000 - 2003 using a Before-After-Control-Impact procedure provided evidence of a significant increase of aquarium fishes in reserves, primarily in the <b>yellow</b> <b>tang</b> (Zebrasoma flavescens), the most collected aquarium fish in Hawaii.

40|$|Hundreds of {{thousands}} of juvenile <b>yellow</b> <b>tang,</b> Zebrasoma flavescens, are caught {{each year in the}} state of Hawai’i (USA) for the live aquarium trade. As part of an extensive adaptive management strategy built around a network of protected areas, an emphasis was placed on understanding this important species ’ life history. Multiple capture-mark-recapture techniques and a model selection approach to data analysis in Program MARK were used to estimate the effects of individual age and conspecific density on natural per-capita daily survival probabilities of <b>yellow</b> <b>tang</b> recruits (recently settled individuals, 30 – 50 mm total length) and the effects of body size and site on natural per-capita monthly survival probabilities for juveniles (58 – 127 mm total length). The models of recruit survival that included additive effects of density and age were best supported by the data and indicated an increase of survival with age and decrease of survival with increased conspecific density. At 1 day post-settlement, the model averaged daily per-capita survival probability ranged from 0. 963 (95 % CI: 0. 932 – 0. 981) at a low density of 0. 1 recruits m- 2 to 0. 848 (95 % CI: 0. 752 – 0. 911) at a high density of 1. 3 recruits m- 2.

40|$|A {{network of}} Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) in West Hawai’i {{has been shown}} to vary in its {{effectiveness}} to replenish depleted aquarium fish stocks. To determine the abundance and distribution of habitat needed to better design and manage MPAs along West Hawai’i, underwater video transects, existing remote sensing data and a benthic classification scheme were used to interpret and map reef habitats at a spatial scale of 10 - 100 ’s m (mesohabitats). A stratified monitoring effort was carried out to quantify ontogenetic habitat use by the primary aquarium reef fish, <b>yellow</b> <b>tang</b> (Zebrasoma flavescens) in existing MPAs. Rugosity, microhabitat features (1 – 10 m scale), abundance and size of fish were quantified in a total of 115 circular plots. In addition, mesohabitat features (10 - 100 m scale) were assessed in order to determine accuracy of mapping efforts. Visual categorization and mapping of habitat was accurate and consistent with the habitats quantified on a microhabitat scale. Patterns of abundance of reef fish and the distribution of benthic substrates were distributed along distinct habitat types at each site. Reef morphology and the distribution of coral species among sites was strongly associated with wave exposure. Ontogenetic shifts in habitat use by reef fish were significant at all study sites. Recruits and juveniles of the <b>yellow</b> <b>tang</b> showed strong patterns of mesohabitat and microhabitat selection among sites by associating with deep aggregate coral rich areas and patches of finger and cauliflower coral while the distribution and abundance of adults varied greatly within and among sites.
