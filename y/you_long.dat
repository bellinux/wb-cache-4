5|$|As <b>you</b> <b>long</b> ago wrote me, {{and told}} me personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

I don't think you worth the trouble, or I would have given <b>you,</b> <b>long</b> since, such a lesson, that you should {{remember}} me long enough. But before long you will get a slight ducking.|$|E

[...] He praised all of the actors' performances, and particularly those of Quandt and Sunpanich. [...] "If you truly love theater, you must see this play," [...] he concluded. [...] "And I promise you, it is a play you will carry with <b>you</b> <b>long</b> after the lights have gone up." ...|$|E

500|$|It is {{doubtful}} {{whether it was}} possible for Speyer to resign from the Privy Council or as a baronet, there being no normal mechanism to do so, but the Prime Minister's response was supportive: [...] "I have known <b>you</b> <b>long,</b> and well enough to estimate at their true value these baseless and malignant imputations upon your loyalty to the British Crown. The King is not prepared to take any step such as you suggest in regard to the marks of distinction which you have received in recognition of public services and philanthropic munificence." [...] On 26 May 1915, Speyer and his family left for America.|$|E
500|$|Written by Perry, Klas Åhlund, Max Martin, Adam Baptiste, and Caméla Leierth, [...] "Walking on Air" [...] {{discusses}} a love [...] "so {{strong that}} even heaven is jealous". Gil Kaufman from MTV {{commented on the}} song's composition: [...] "Between her wailing diva vocals, a gospel choir that kicks in during the final minute and the driving beat, Perry has captured a unique sound that both recalls the classic 1970s disco era {{as well as the}} EDM thump of today's clubs." [...] HitFix writer Melinda Newman opined that the song was [...] "redolent of '90s dance thumpers and is light as cotton candy and just as enjoyable", adding that it would [...] "make <b>you</b> <b>long</b> for C+C Music Factory". The song was also described as evoking the music of Swedish singer Robyn, an artist of whom Perry is a fan.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed-to-positive reviews. Ryan McGee of Zap2it {{wrote that}} [...] "this episode wasn't a stinker by any measure, {{but after the}} run of early episodes, {{this is the first}} that really didn't hold its own when compared to the others", adding that [...] "The moth imagery/metaphor just beats you down by episode's end, making <b>you</b> <b>long</b> for the more subtle writing the show has produced up until this point." [...] The TV Critic gave the episode a 68/100, writing that it falls between being [...] "obvious and cheesy" [...] and [...] "beautifully paced and structured". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B, and shared his opinion that it is [...] "one of the more intensely metaphorical—and thus writerly—episodes of the series. The eponymous metaphor—delivered by Locke—is one of the series’ most blatant, and the moth’s consistent reappearance in the episode calls {{a lot of attention to}} the construction of the narrative." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lift Up Your Face" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} praised the vocals of The Blind Boys of Alabama. C. E'Jon Moore of The Christian Manifesto praised [...] "Lift Up Your Face", saying [...] " [...] gets {{you out of your}} seat and sticks with <b>you</b> <b>long</b> after the last note has faded". In his review of Move, Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com regarded [...] "Lift Up Your Face" [...] as an exception to a [...] "ho-hum affair" [...] of an album and regarded the song as a [...] "classic Third Day rocker in the vein of 'Consuming Fire'". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout regarded the song as [...] "edgy" [...] and the praised the vocal support from The Blind Boys of Alabama. Brian Mansfield of USA Today listed the song as a download pick from Move. Andrew Greer of Christianity Today regarded the song as a [...] "fiery collaboration with music's legendary Blind Boys of Alabama" [...] and [...] "a hearty charge to look heavenward for lasting hope".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love <b>you</b> <b>long</b> time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't wait to hear the response? What if I was actually going to go, 'Oh, OK'? They never stick around to hear the answer." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] is a [...] "mid-tempo", [...] "party jam", {{that draws}} {{influence}} from pop, R and soul music genres. Critics elaborated on the song's [...] "soul" [...] influence, with Melissa Ruggieri from The News & Advance {{described it as}} a [...] "soul-thumper", while Digital Spys Nick Levine called it a [...] "nod towards classic soul". The song's title is derived from the popular line, [...] "me love <b>you</b> <b>long</b> time", from the 1987 war film, Full Metal Jacket. Additionally, its hook and instrumentation is derived from sampling DeBarge's [...] "Stay with Me". Critics also noted how [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] "recalls" [...] the melody riff and chord progression of the Hill Street Bluess theme song. The song's main source of production comes from its [...] "lush keyboard work", and Carey's usage of the [...] "double voice", which she uses throughout the song's bridge. Carey described the effect as [...] "layering her voice", so that the bridge would sound like a [...] "swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs". The song was written by Carey, Aldrin Davis, Crystal Johnson and Clifford Harris, and features Mark DeBarge and Etterlene Jordan on the songwriting credits, due to the inclusion of the samples. [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was produced by Carey and Davis (DJ Toomp), and is arranged in the key of D Major, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of A3 to the high-note of D5.|$|E

500|$|... "I'm That Chick" [...] {{is a song}} Carey wrote {{alongside}} Norwegian duo, Stargate. It is a fast-paced song, {{which features}} a [...] "care-free feel", and is influenced by soul, pop and disco music genres. The song incorporates a sample from Michael Jackson's [...] "Off the Wall", and features a strong thumping bass-line and hand claps. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters {{described it as a}} [...] "late-night disco-bass groove", and highlighted its production as the album's finest. [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time", the album's eventual third single, was written and produced by Carey and DJ Toomp. The song was described as a [...] "mid-tempo", [...] "party jam", that is influenced by pop, R and soul genres.

2500|$|A. O. Scott of The New York Times {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review and wrote, [...] "If your {{intention is to}} make a brooding, hauntingly allegorical terror-thriller, it's probably not a good sign when spectacles of mass death and intimations of planetary destruction are met with hoots and giggles ... The draggy, lurching two hours of [...] "Knowing" [...] will make <b>you</b> <b>long</b> {{for the end of the}} world, even as you worry that there will not be time for all your questions to be answered." [...] In the San Francisco Chronicle, Peter Hartlaub called the film [...] "an excitement for fans of Proyas" [...] and [...] "a surprisingly messy effort." [...] He thought Nicolas Cage [...] "borders on ridiculous here, in part because of a script that gives him little to do but freak out or act depressed".|$|E

2500|$|Minna {{pursued a}} career as an actress, specialising in female {{juvenile}} lead roles ("Erste Liebhaberin") in tragedies. She was in demand by many German theatre companies, and appeared in Dessau, Altenburg, Magdeburg and Dresden before she met Richard Wagner. In a letter dated December 27, 1833, Minna sets out her conditions for employment: she would not accept guest appearances, but expected the leading tragic and young heroine parts. Her fee was 600 thaler plus travelling expenses. While she was praised for her abilities as an actress, her physical charms also brought her admiration. One anonymous suitor wrote to her: [...] "When Nature created you, O Fair One, she broke the mold and never more may create so fair an image.
