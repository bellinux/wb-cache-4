500|$|Most {{critics were}} not {{impressed}} with the medley, comparing it to Aguilera's identity during the Bionic era. Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves <b>you!</b> <b>And</b> <b>that</b> the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures you that when she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from the bottom of her light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E

Ian O'Doherty of The Irish Independent asked regarding the PTC's marriage depiction study: [...] "After all, would you rather watch people having fun or would you rather watch a realistic depiction of marriage, which...would simply be an hour of two people sullenly chewing their food, pausing occasionally only to throw each other filthies and occasionally grumbling under their breath how the biggest regret of their life was ever setting eyes on <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> their mother was right all along?" [...] PTC released a report in October 2009 stating that prime-time television shows on broadcast networks had twice as many depictions of violence against women in 2009 than in 2004.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{a reality}} series {{originated}} when Doherty and Iswarienko were interested in documenting {{the weeks leading up}} to their wedding in a filming and production style similar to [...] and Deadliest Catch. Doherty had previously worked on reality television when she hosted Scare Tactics and Breaking Up with Shannen Doherty and participated on the tenth season of Dancing with the Stars. She called the project her agreement with Iswarienko to [...] "chronicle this time in our lives and let future brides and future grooms know that [...] not just <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> goes through the stress". According to Doherty, it was a way to celebrate her third marriage: [...] "Can you bring all of those qualities to reality TV? Can you be that brutally honest, that completely raw, but with the quality of those two shows where you do use different cameras and you do want it to look spectacular?" [...] Doherty planned to develop the idea with her own production company, originally partnering with an unidentified television network. However, the series was picked up by WE tv when Doherty thought that the previous network was making the material too sensational. Miller said that he approved the series after seeing its pitch, and he found Doherty an appealing person to watch on reality television.|$|E
