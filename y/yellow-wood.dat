6000|$|... "That will {{be through}} the <b>Yellow-wood</b> Swamp. Can't {{we take the}} other road to Pilgrim's Rest and Lydenburg, or to Barberton?" [...] asked Anscombe in a vague way, and as I thought, rather nervously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my father," [...] added Marie, {{leaning forward}} across the scored <b>yellow-wood</b> table, her chin {{resting on her}} hand and her dark, buck-like eyes looking him in the face. [...] "Yes, my father, that is so, as I have told you already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, Mr. Quatermain. We do {{business}} with these people, also they sometimes come to be doctored by Rodd when they are sick, so this place is sacred ground to them. They stopped hunting you {{when they got to}} the <b>Yellow-wood</b> swamp where our land begins, did they not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know the}} <b>Yellow-wood</b> swamp," [...] he said. [...] "It passes {{straight}} through that. That is why those Basutos who were following you pulled up upon {{the edge of}} the swamp, though as a matter of fact, according to their ideas, they had a perfect right to kill you on their side of the line which cuts through the middle." ...|$|E
60|$|My way took {{me through}} the <b>Yellow-wood</b> grove, past the horns of the blue wildebeeste which still lay there, past that mud-hole also into which Rodd had fallen dead. Here, however, I made no more search, who had seen enough of bones. To this day I {{do not know whether}} he still lies beneath the slimy ooze, or was removed and buried.|$|E
60|$|He spun a half-crown {{into the}} air. It fell and rolled under a great, <b>yellow-wood</b> chest full of curiosities that I had collected, which {{it took all}} our united {{strength}} to move. We dragged it aside and not without some excitement, for really a good deal hung upon the chance, I lit a match and peered into the shadow. There in the dust lay the coin.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{we came to}} {{the place}} he {{mentioned}} where the timber, although scattered, was quite large for South Africa, of the <b>yellow-wood</b> species, and interspersed wherever the ground was dry with huge euphorbias, of which the tall finger-like growths and sad grey colouring looked unreal and ghostlike in the waning light. Following the advice given to us, we rode in single file along the narrow path, fearing lest otherwise we should tumble into some bog hole, until we came to higher land covered with the scattered thorns of the country.|$|E
60|$|At {{this answer}} the lawyer grew white with anger, {{and the young}} lord burst into a roar of laughter, for, as I have said, these English people have no manners. However, they settled {{themselves}} down again on the <b>yellow-wood</b> bench and looked at me; while I, folding my hands, sat opposite, and looked at them for somewhere about another hour, as the interpreter told them that if they moved I should be offended, and, for my part, I was determined that I would not speak to them of their business until Suzanne had gone to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be better to give it up in any case," [...] said a third voice, [...] "since it is known {{throughout}} the land that no luck has ever come to those who tried to trap the Watcher-by-Night. Oh! he is a leopard who springs and is gone again. How many are the throats in which his fangs have met. Leave him alone, I say, lest our fate should be that of the white doctor in the <b>Yellow-wood</b> Swamp, he who set us on this hunt. We have his wagon and his cattle; let us be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit," [...] I said, {{pointing}} to the <b>yellow-wood</b> bench which was seated with strips of rimpi, {{and the three of}} them squeezed themselves into the bench and sat there like white-breasted crows on a bough; the young man staring at me with a silly smile, the lawyer peering this way and that, and turning up his sharp nose at the place and all in it, and the interpreter doing nothing at all, for he was a sensible man, who knew the habits of well-bred people and how to behave in their presence. After five minutes or so the lawyer grew impatient, and said something in a sharp voice, to which the interpreter answered, [...] "Wait." ...|$|E
60|$|After this we {{had quite}} an {{interesting}} time. I scrambled {{on to the}} horse behind Anscombe, whereon that intelligent animal, feeling the double weight, reduced its pace proportionately, to a slow tripple, indeed, out of which {{it could not be}} persuaded to move. So I slipped off again over its tail and we went on as before. Meanwhile the Basutos, very active fellows, were coming up. By this time the <b>yellow-wood</b> grove in the swamp, of which I have already written, was close to us, and it became quite a question which of us would get there first (I may mention that Footsack & Co. had already attained its friendly shelter). Anscombe kicked the horse with his sound heel and I thumped it with my fist, thereby persuading it to a hand gallop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it ain't {{easy to say}} exactly. You see it {{was getting}} dark at the time, and I was doin' my best to drive a thief of a hox down a place in the kloof where it had to stand upright, a'most, on its front-legs, with its tail whirlin' in the hair. An' I 'adn't much time to waste neither, for I knew there was Kafirs all about, an' the troops was gettin' a'ead of me, an' my 'oss was tied to a <b>yellow-wood</b> tree at the foot o' the kloof, an' I began to feel sort o' skeery with the gloomy {{thickets}} all around, an' rugged precipices lookin' as if they'd tumble on me, an' the great mountains goin' up to 'eaven--oh! I can tell you it was--it was--" ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well; I slept very badly. To begin with, Maurice Anscombe, {{generally}} the most cheerful and nonchalant of mortals with a jest for every woe, {{was in a}} most depressed condition, and informed me of it several times, while I {{was getting ready to}} turn in. He said he thought the place hateful and felt as if people he could not see were looking at him (I had the same sensation but did not mention the fact to him). When I told him he was talking stuff, he only replied that he could not help it, and pointed out that it was not his general habit to be downcast in any danger, which was quite true. Now, he added, he was enjoying much the same sensations as he did when first he saw the <b>Yellow-wood</b> Swamp and got the idea into his head that he would kill some one there, which happened in due course.|$|E
60|$|Before {{we reached}} the patch of <b>Yellow-wood</b> forest where I knew that the cart must travel very slowly because {{of the trees and}} the swampy nature of the ground, I pushed on ahead to reconnoitre, fearing lest there might be Basutos hidden in this cover. Riding {{straight}} through it I went as far as the deserted wagon at a sharp canter, seeing nothing and no one. Once indeed, {{towards the end of the}} wood where it was more dense, I thought that I heard a man cough and peered about me through the gloom, for here the rays of the sun, which was getting low in the heavens, scarcely penetrated. As I could perceive no one I came to the conclusion that I must have been deceived by my fancy. Or perhaps it was some baboon that coughed, though it was strange that a baboon should have come to such a low-lying spot where there was nothing for it to eat.|$|E
6000|$|At {{the back}} of these bushes there was a hole large enough {{for a man to}} creep through. I crept through with the object of ascertaining whether the marble veins continued. To my {{surprise}} I found a stout <b>yellow-wood</b> door within feet of the mouth of the hole. Reflecting that no doubt it was here that the quarrymen kept, or had kept tools and explosives, I gave it a push. I suppose it had been left unfastened accidentally, or that something had gone wrong with the lock; at any rate it swung open. Pursuing my researches as to the depth of the marble I advanced boldly and, the place being dark, struck a match. Evidently the marble did continue, as I could see by the glittering roof of a cavern, for such it was. But the floor attracted my attention as well as the roof, for on it were numerous cases not unlike coffins, bearing the stamp of a well-known Birmingham firm, labelled [...] "fencing iron" [...] and addressed to Messrs. Marnham & Rodd, Transvaal, via Delagoa Bay.|$|E
60|$|But {{though she}} had {{suffered}} no hurt in her terrible voyage, so exhausted was Nanea that she could scarcely stand. Here the gloom was that of night, and shivering with cold she looked helplessly to find some refuge. Close to the water's edge grew an enormous <b>yellow-wood</b> tree, and to this she staggered--thinking to climb it, and seek shelter in its boughs where, as she hoped, she would be safe from wild beasts. Again fortune befriended her, for {{at a distance of}} {{a few feet from the}} ground there was a great hole in the tree which, she discovered, was hollow. Into this hole she crept, taking her chance of its being the home of snakes or other evil creatures, to find that the interior was wide and warm. It was dry also, for at the bottom of the cavity lay a foot or more of rotten tinder and moss brought there by rats or birds. Upon this tinder she lay down, and covering herself with the moss and leaves soon sank into sleep or stupor.|$|E
6000|$|The next {{anxiety was}} at a spot called the <b>Yellow-wood</b> River, where the mid-day halt was {{disturbed}} by an assembly of natives with a hostile appearance. Captain Gardiner sent orders to collect the oxen, and in- span (i.e. harness) them as soon as possible, but without appearance of alarm, {{and in the meantime}} he tried to keep the natives occupied. To one he lent his penknife, and after the man had vainly tried to cut off his own beard with it, he offered to shave him, lathered him well, and performed the operation like a true barber, then showed him his face in a glass. His only disappointment was that the moustache had not been removed, and as by this time the razor was past work, Captain Gardiner had to pacify him by assuring him that such was the appearance of many English warriors (for these were the days when moustaches were confined to the cavalry). The amusement this excited occupied them nearly long enough, but hostile murmurs then began to be heard--"One of our chiefs has been killed by the white men, no more shall enter our country!" [...] Fearing that an angry word would be fatal, Captain Gardiner asked for a war-song, promising some tobacco at the conclusion. Accordingly they danced madly, and shouted {{at the top of their}} voices, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the hither side of {{the river}} the scenery is different. Along the edge of its banks, where the land is flat, are green patches of swamp. Then comes a wide belt of {{beautiful}} grass land covered thickly with game, and sloping up very gently to the borders of the forest, which, beginning at about a thousand feet above the level of the plain, clothes the mountain-side almost to its crest. In this forest grow great trees, most of them of the <b>yellow-wood</b> species. Some of these trees are so lofty, that a bird in their top branches would be out of range of an ordinary shot gun. Another peculiar thing about them is, that they are for the most part covered with a dense growth of the Orchilla moss; and from this moss the natives manufacture a most excellent deep purple dye, with which they stain tanned hides and also cloth, when they happen to get any of the latter. I do not think that I ever saw anything more remarkable than the appearance of one of these mighty trees festooned from top to bottom with trailing wreaths of this sad-hued moss, in which the wind whispers gently as it stirs them. At a distance it looks like the gray locks of a Titan crowned with bright green leaves, and here and there starred with the rich bloom of orchids.|$|E
6000|$|This done, the Heer Marais {{showed me}} the room in which we were to have our lessons, one of the [...] "sitkammer", or sitting chambers, whereof, unlike most Boer stead, this house boasted two. I {{remember}} that the floor was made of [...] "daga", that is, ant-heap earth mixed with cow-dung, into which thousands of peach-stones had been thrown {{while it was still}} soft, in order to resist footwear--a rude but fairly efficient expedient, and one not unpleasing to the eye. For the rest, there was one window opening on to the veranda, which, in that bright climate, admitted a shaded but sufficient light, especially as it always stood open; the ceiling was of unplastered reeds; a large bookcase stood in the corner containing many French works, most of them the property of Monsieur Leblanc, and in the centre of the room was the strong, rough table made of native <b>yellow-wood,</b> that once had served as a butcher's block. I recollect also a coloured print of the great Napoleon commanding at some battle in which he was victorious, seated upon a white horse and waving a field-marshal's baton over piles of dead and wounded; and near the window, hanging to the reeds of the ceiling, the nest of a pair of red-tailed swallows, pretty creatures that, notwithstanding the mess they made, afforded to Marie and me endless amusement in the intervals of our work.|$|E
6000|$|... "So be it, Macumazahn. These are {{the words}} of Zikali: 'O Watcher-by-Night, the time draws on when the Thing-who-should-never-have-been-born will be as though he never had been born, whereat he rejoices. But first there is much for him to do, and as he told you nearly three hundred moons ago, in {{what must be done}} you will have your part. Of that he will speak to you afterwards. Macumazahn, you dreamed a dream, did you not, lying asleep in the house that was built of white stone which now is black with fire? I, Zikali, sent you that dream through the arts of a child of mine who is named Nombe, she to whom I have given a Spirit to guide her feet. You did well to follow it, Macumazahn, for had you tried the other path, which would have led you back to the towns of the white men, you and those with you must have been killed, how it does not matter. Now by the mouth of Nombe I say to you, do not follow the thought that is in your mind as she speaks to you and go to Natal, since if you do so, you and those with you will come to much shame and trouble that to you would be worse than death, over the matter of the killing of a certain white doctor in a swamp where grow <b>yellow-wood</b> trees. For there in Natal you will be taken, all of you, and sent back to the Transvaal to be tried before a man who wears upon his head horse's hair stained white. But if you come to Zululand this shadow shall pass away from you, since great things are about to happen which will cause so small a matter to be forgot. Moreover, I Zikali, who do not lie, promise this: That however great may be their dangers here in Zululand, those half-fledged ones whom you, the old night-hawk, cover with your wings, shall in the end suffer no harm; those of whom I spoke to you in your dream, the white lord, Mauriti, and the white lady, Heddana, who stretch out their arms one to another. I wait to welcome you, here at the Black Kloof, whither my {{daughter}} Nombe will guide you. Cetewayo, the king, also will welcome you, and so will another whose name I do not utter. Now choose. I have spoken.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|The reserve {{supports}} a wide diversity of flora, with over 190 species recorded. [...] Typical brigalow communities which {{are found in}} the park include; grassy and shrubby woodlands or open forests, whipstick brigalow, sucker brigalow, and open forests where A. harpophylla and another species such as <b>yellow-wood,</b> belah or various Eucalyptus spp. dominate. [...] Endangered plant species protected inside the park include the Solanaceae Solanum adenophorum and the Solanaceae Solanum elachophyllum. [...] In addition to these, another two species have been identified as 'near threatened'; the Apocynaceae Cerbera dumicola and the Poaceae Dichanthium setosum.|$|E
50|$|Exploration of {{the timber}} {{resources}} in the Cooloola area commenced in the early 1860s. William Pettigrew visited the area in 1863, exploring the Noosa River and its lakes. Although Pettigrew subsequently concentrated his timber operations in northern Cooloola, he recorded quantities of hardwoods including cedar, Bunya pine, Kauri pine, Hoop pine, Cypress pine, beech, ash, tulip and <b>yellow-wood</b> in various locations. Cedar-getters {{appear to have been}} working in the Noosa River area by the mid-1860s. The development of the timber industry in southern Cooloola has been attributed, at least in part, to the capital injected into the area {{as a result of the}} exploitation of the gold resource at Gympie.|$|E
50|$|Acacia argyrodendron {{is found}} in central Queensland in the basins of the Cape, Suttor and Belyando Rivers on clay soils {{in areas where the}} annual {{rainfall}} ranges between 475 and 655 mm. It forms open forests as the dominant (and sometimes only) tree species. Associated understory plants include shrub species such as the false sandalwood (Eremophila mitchellii), <b>yellow-wood</b> (Terminalia oblongata) and conkerberry (Carissa spinarum), and smaller herbaceous plants such as brigalow grass (Paspalidium caespitosum), yakka grass (Sporobolus caroli), blue trumpet (Brunoniella australis) and Dipteracanthus australasicus. Occasionally, there may be trees such as Dawson River blackbutt (Eucalyptus cambageana), coolibah (E. coolabah) and Brown's box (E. brownii).|$|E
50|$|In {{the swamp}} regions of {{north-east}} Africa papyrus and associated plants, including the soft-wooded ambach, flourish in immense quantities, {{and little else}} {{is found in the}} way of vegetation. South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions. Tropical flora disappears, and in the semi-desert plains the fleshy, leafless, contorted species of kapsias, mesembryanthemums, aloes and other succulent plants make their appearance. There are, too, valuable timber trees, such as the <b>Yellow-wood</b> (Podocarpus elongatus), stinkwood (Ocotea), sneezewood or Cape ebony (Pteroxylon utile) and ironwood. Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent. Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range.|$|E
5000|$|The {{region that}} {{the park is}} located in has been {{demonstrated}} {{to have one of}} the highest rate of annual clearance, when compared with other subregions within Queensland. [...] This high clearance rate has contributed to a number of Brigalow-typical ecosystems becoming otherwise at risk or endangered, which highlights the importance of the parks biodiversity, as 12 of the regions ecosystems are represented within the reserve. [...] Endangered open forest or woodland ecosystems in the park include; vegetation associations dominated by A. harpophylla with either belah (Casuarina cristata) or dawson gum (Eucalyptus cambageana), or in combination with wilga (Geijera parviflora) and false sandalwood (Eremophila mitchellii). [...] Brigalow shrubland/forest assemblages of A. harpophylla with <b>yellow-wood</b> (Terminalia oblongata) and false sandalwood, are also endangered, having undergone wide-scale clearing throughout the 1900s. [...] Ecosystem communities represented within the park which are considered to be 'of concern' include; open and grassy woodlands dominated by poplar box (E. populnea) and grassy or scrubby woodlands that are dominated by Eucalyptus spp. with or without Corymbia spp.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify and characterise the toxic principle in Terminalia oblongata, commonly known as <b>yellow-wood.</b> Crude aqueous extracts of <b>yellow-wood</b> leaf were found to produce the same liver lesion in mice as has been reported in ruminants. The hepatotoxic fraction was isolated and identified as a hydrolysable vegetable tannin called punicalagin. When given orally, the dose required to produce toxicity was at least 20 times greater than when given intraperitoneally. Following a given dose of punicalagin, the onset and severity of liver necrosis was found {{to be related to the}} time interval after dosing. In addition to punicalagin, an unidentified nephrotoxic substance was found which was capable of producing avascular renal necrosis without liver necrosis...|$|E
40|$|An aqueous {{suspension}} of air-dried, hammer-milled leaf of Terminalia oblongata (<b>yellow-wood)</b> {{was administered to}} sheep by gavage, as a single dose of 5 to 20 g (dry weight) /kg body weight. Doses of 15 g/kg, or more, caused depression, inappetence, abdominal pain and reduced ruminal movements within 24 to 48 h and some sheep also showed dyspnoea, opisthotonus and champing of the jaws. Haematology and blood gas and acid-base measurements were unaffected. In sheep given a dose of 12. 5 g/kg, or more, plasma osmolality, aspartate aminotransferase activity and potassium and bilirubin concentrations increased while plasma total protein markedly decreased and plasma sodium concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity remained normal. Most sheep were necropsied 48 h after dosing. The liver showed zonal hepatocellular necrosis, the pattern of which varied with the dose given. No renal lesions were observed, although one sheep given a very high dose became azotaemic and hyperkalaemic. Hydrothorax, hydropericardium and ascites developed in sheep given doses of 15 or 20 g/kg...|$|E
