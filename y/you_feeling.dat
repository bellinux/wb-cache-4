500|$|By season 10's [...] "Memento Mori", TV Zones Anthony Brown {{felt that}} [...] "Ben Browder and Claudia Black have [...] {{reached a point}} where they can play out an amusing take on Misery without <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> that [...] have somehow starbursted onto SG-1s Earth". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called Browder and Black's {{interaction}} in season 10 [...] "great fun; the rapport they developed on the stellar Farscape was still much in evidence, even though they played radically different characters on SG-1." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Needless to say, {{the pair}} work their superstar pulling power for all it's worth. Over sparse and eerie beats, they deliver innuendo-laced lyrics, groan near-orgasmically and {{generally}} tease {{us with the}} prospect of doing all sorts of naughty things on, well, your video phone. While the promo clip offers some of the intended thrill, the track itself - single number eight from I Am... lacks the sparkle of previous offerings. It may provide a brief rush of excitement to the loins, but ultimately leaves <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> fluffed rather than serviced by the twosome." ...|$|E
500|$|Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune {{noted that}} Rihanna assumes {{the role of}} playing the victim in the song, and not the offender, saying [...] "She's wary of men even when she’s flirting with them in Wait Your Turn." [...] Prior to Greenblatt's album review of Rated R, where she briefly commented on [...] "Wait Your Turn", she also {{reviewed}} the song when it leaked onto the Internet in early November, saying [...] "Now that the wait is nearly ova, are <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> it, Music Mixers? I cannot tell a lie; I’m a little underwhelmed by this new walk-the-plank Pirate incarnation." [...] William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song, saying [...] "Wait Your Turn'...leaked online over the weekend, and like the album's lead track, 'Russian Roulette,' it's a total let down: clunky, Auto-Tuned vocals repeat The wait is ova / The wait is ova ad nauseam, over dark atmospherics and a spare dub beat that fails to connect...it's certainly not worth the wait." ...|$|E

500|$|Heather Phares of AllMusic {{felt that}} the record was [...] "not simply Debut redux", concluding: [...] "The work of a {{constantly}} changing artist, Post proves that as Björk moves toward more ambitious, complex music, she always surpasses herself". Writing for MTV Online, Lou Stathis wrote that, [...] " [...] Björk's wacky, mind-altered perspective that makes Post modern pop music at once both baffling and engaging". He believed that the album was a rewarding experience for both the casual consumer, {{as well as the}} serious listener, also pointing out that, [...] "it not only sounds good while you're listening to it, but it leaves <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> good when it's over, too". Robert Christgau, reviewing the album for The Village Voice, was less enthusiastic. He {{felt that the}} singer [...] " [...] primeval suspicion of Europeans who presume to [...] "improve" [...] on rock and roll," [...] criticizing her [...] "self-involved vocal devices" [...] and poor grasp of the English language. He gave Post a C+ rating, meaning he considered it [...] "a not disreputable performance, most likely a failed experiment or a pleasant piece of hackwork." [...] MusicHound awarded the album two out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine {{stated that}} the album is [...] "Madonna's most purely beat-driven album since her self-titled 1983 debut" [...] and [...] "easily her finest effort since Ray of Light." [...] Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times called the album [...] "exuberant." [...] Christian John Wikane from PopMatters commented that the album [...] "proved that Madonna, {{approaching}} 50 years-old, is a vital force in the ever-expansive landscape of popular music." [...] Joan Morgan from The Village Voice noted that [...] "ith Confessions on a Dance Floor, Madonna at long last finds her musical footing. Easily dance record of the year, Confessions is an almost seamless tribute to the strobe-lit sensuality of the '80s New York club scene that gave Madge her roots, which she explores with compelling aplomb." [...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment {{is far more important}} than what they mean, and Madonna knows that better than anyone. Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments. It will leave <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> silly for all the right reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sun Herald {{thought of}} the {{character}} as [...] "a thoroughly charming intergalactic thief famed for using her allure to get what she wants", and Matt Roush of TV Guide called Claudia Black [...] "great fun to watch in [...] ". TV Zones Stephen Graves believed that Browder and Black's first post-Farscape encounter in Stargate SG-1s [...] "Avalon" [...] was [...] "somewhat underplayed [...] but Black makes up for this with her sparky, snarky characterization of Vala." [...] He welcomed the producers' decision to not cast a carbon copy of Samantha Carter, and thought that Claudia Black's Vala in her six-episode arc remained [...] "the best thing in the series". By season 10's [...] "Memento Mori", TV Zones Anthony Brown felt that [...] "Ben Browder and Claudia Black have...reached {{a point where they}} can play out an amusing take on Misery without <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> that [...] have somehow starbursted onto SG-1s Earth".

500|$|Terra's role in Birth by Sleep has {{received}} mixed critics with Adam Ghigiino from PALGN criticizing his naive personality when finding the three protagonists unappealing. VideoGamer.com writer Emily Gera stated that players may {{know little about}} them due to their role in Kingdom Hearts II, but with Birth by Sleep, players will able to know about them. Writing for GamesRadar, Crhis Antista commented {{that he did not}} understand the importance of him and the other characters being briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II, although it could be explained once the player finishes Birth by Sleep. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. X-Play found Terra to be very similar to Riku due to his personality and vulnerability to evil's allure. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot criticized Jason Dohring's work as Terra's English voice actor, saying he [...] "can't express angst, excitement, sincerity, or any other emotion", affecting the storyline. VanOrd also pointed this out when Terra interacts with Disney characters, finding the latters' voice actors to be [...] "uniformly excellent and absolutely comparable to the original source." [...] Bob Miur from Destructoid compared Terra's storyline with the film [...] due to the struggles he faces, and found that gamers familiar to the series may realize that his fate in the game [...] "won't turn out to be very pretty." [...] Miur also commented on Dohring's work, praising how he makes Terra [...] "tortured and conflicted", but still criticizing the result. UGO Networks listed Terra's Helmet nineteenth on their list of [...] "The Coolest Helmets and Headgear in Video Games", stating [...] "For a minute, but only a minute, the two-horned helmet will get <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> like the Keyblade is a viable weapon." [...] In a Famitsu poll, Terra was voted as the fifth most popular Kingdom Hearts character. Kimberly Wallace from Game Informer expected Terra, alongside his friends, to appear in the upcoming game, Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E

2500|$|Lucas Sullivan from GamesRadar {{gave the}} game a 8/10, praising its {{exquisite}} animation, phenomenal atmosphere, uplifting music, and intuitive gameplay, which he stated [...] "has conveyed {{a real sense}} of lightweight agility." [...] However, he criticized the save system, which may lead to constant death, the difficulty spikes during the escape sequences. He summarized the game by saying that [...] "Completing Ori's six-to-nine-hour journey will certainly leave <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> warm, fuzzy, and accomplished - just be ready to dig in for some particularly trying segments." [...] Nick Tan from Game Revolution gave the game a 4/5, criticizing the short length, meaningless health bar, low replay value, and the game not providing direction and guidelines to players in escape sequences.|$|E
2500|$|March Fires {{received}} generally positive reviews. Sean Palmer of The Sydney Morning Herald {{gave the}} album a 4-star review, stating that [...] "March Fires is a gem and channels emotion but never {{to the point}} of nausea, leaving <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> comfortable in the pleasant tones of a band that know what they are doing." [...] He noted the stylistic similarities of the album to the band's previous work and wrote [...] "There is nothing here to shock or bewilder unless you are expecting Birds of Tokyo to return to their alt-rock origins with a hardened edge. If that's the case, you will be in for a jolt of disappointment, as beneath Kenny's words there is an astounding sense of positivity - as though one can climb that mountain, fix that bridge or restore faith." [...] Simon Collins of The West Australian gave the album three stars, writing [...] "Synth-laden mid-album tracks [...] "The Others" [...] and [...] "White Leaves" [...] briefly revive listeners, before they are plunged into a downbeat run home to [...] "Hounds"." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 24, 1961, Blanc was {{involved}} in a near-fatal car accident. He was driving alone when his sports car collided head-on with a car driven by 18-year-old college student Arthur Rolston on Sunset Boulevard. Rolston suffered minor injuries, but Blanc was rushed to the UCLA Medical Center with a triple skull fracture that left him in a coma for two weeks, along with sustaining fractures to both legs and the pelvis. About two weeks after the accident, one of Blanc's neurologists tried a different approach. Blanc was asked, [...] "How are <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> today, Bugs Bunny?" [...] After a slight pause, Blanc answered, in a weak voice, [...] "Eh... just fine, Doc. How are you?" [...] The doctor then asked Tweety if he was there, too. [...] "I tot I taw a puddy tat," [...] was the reply. Blanc returned home on March 17. Four days later, Blanc filed a US$500,000 lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles. His accident, one of 26 in the preceding two years at the intersection known as Dead Man's Curve, resulted in the city funding the restructuring of curves at the location.|$|E

2500|$|The English-language {{adaptation}} of Missions of Love has received mixed to positive ratings: Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network gave {{the first volume}} an overall rating of a C+ calling it a quick read, much racier than Toyama's earlier works, and telling readers who do not like an unequal romance to [...] "steer clear". She described the art as [...] "easy on the eyes" [...] and sensual while calling it a [...] "very uncomfortable romance". John Rose from The Fandom Post gave volume one an A rating calling it [...] "Incredibly smart, sexy and possessing" [...] and also praised the artwork. Darkstorm from Anime UK News gave the series a 6/10 saying that although the story is unoriginal and has overused things such as a school setting and love triangle, {{the layout of the}} story is great and the heart is in the right place when it comes to it. Thalia Sutton of Suvudu gave the second volume a good review, calling the series thus far appealing for commutes, and light emotional handling overall. She went on to say [...] "Missions of Love, volume 2 closes with many possibilities for its romantic future, and leaves <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> introspective, too" [...] The second volume of Missions of Love spent two weeks on the New York Times best seller list for manga from January 13–26, 2013. The fourth volume was also on the New York Times best seller list for a week from July 21–27, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Manhunt 2 was {{met with}} mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Positive reception came from the game's presentation of graphic violence and its psychological horror-based storyline. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd said the game was [...] "not as shocking as you'd expect, but Manhunt 2 still satisfies your primal instincts", and that the game was better {{to play on the}} PSP platform. Mikel Reparaz from GamesRadar stated that [...] "if you're in the mood for something creepy and horrific that'll leave <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> a little dirty, Manhunt 2s still-shocking murders and eerie, is-it-real-or-am-I-just-insane storyline won't disappoint." [...] Game Informer gave the Wii version of the game 7.75/10, saying [...] "Manhunt 2 is every bit as grim and brutal as the first [...] the writing, as is typical of Rockstar's games, is top-notch, and Daniel {{and the rest of the}} characters do come off the screen as very real and human [...] It's a testament to this quality that I was really driven to see the tale out to its end." [...] Similarly, Nintendo Power gave the Wii version 7.5/10, stating that while the game does deliver for the most part, they were disappointed by the way external influences led Rockstar to change the game, and that the story, while interesting, is [...] "highly predictable". [...] Yahoo! reviewed the PSP version, stating [...] "there's simply never been a game quite as squeamishly immersive as this [...] it's even more terrifying for seeming like the most real thing in a game this year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] a {{four out}} of five rating. He felt that when N-Dubz teamed up with Bodyrox for their soundtrack {{contribution}} to StreetDance 3D, they clearly took on board what the film was all about: overcoming prejudices and, the merging of diverse styles of music and dance. Copsey said, [...] "Much like the film itself, 'We Dance On' features an assortment of different influences that might seem contradictory on paper, but inevitably work out for the best in the end." [...] He noted that the verses about pursuing your dreams like a [...] "fox on a mission" [...] and [...] "the big, Bob Marley-inspired chorus – [...] "I know everything's gonna be alright/Now you're standing here by my side" [...] will surely tug at the heartstrings of the song's listener. Copsey {{went on to say that}} the track [...] "leaves <b>you</b> <b>feeling</b> warm, fuzzy and [...] better inside." [...] BBCs Fraser McAlpine felt that [...] "We Dance On" [...] was capable of bringing its listener to tears with, [...] "massive churning string section" [...] from Johann Pachelbel's [...] "Canon in D Major" [...] and few [...] "everything's gonna be alright" [...] chants. McAlpine noted that the string section contains influences from The Farm's [...] "All Together Now" [...] (1990). He went on to interpret the song's chants as being inspired by Bob Marley's [...] "No Woman, No Cry" [...] (1974). Gavin Martin of the Daily Mirror gave [...] "We Dance On" [...] three out of five stars in his review of the single. He highlighted Tulisa Contostavlos' contribution in the song, saying: [...] "Often forced to take a back seat while her male counterparts lead, N-Dubz' front lady Tulisa comes out front for this". Martin went on to describe the song as a [...] "crowd-pleasing and unifying floor filler with a hint of classical spice." ...|$|E
