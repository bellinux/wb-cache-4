500|$|In 2002, {{when the}} New England Patriots held their victory celebration after winning their first Super Bowl {{and the first}} {{championship}} {{for the city of}} Boston since the Celtics won the 1986 NBA Championship, linebacker Larry Izzo fired up the crowd, chanting [...] "Yankees suck!" [...] The chant would become a fixture of Patriots Super Bowl victory rallies following their victories in Super Bowls XXXVIII in 2004 and XXXIX in 2005, which were sandwiched around the Red Sox 2004 World Series win. Dan Shaughnessy wrote about the chant: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> Giants or a Jets celebration in New York City in which a New York player would take the time to chant, 'Red Sox suck? Shaughnessy opined that should such a thing occur, it would be more likely at a Jets celebration, as a Giants celebration, like those of the Mets and the Rangers, {{would be more likely to}} feature such chants made in reference to the Philadelphia teams, as one of the Giants' primary rivalries is with the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E
500|$|... "Nature Boy" [...] was {{released}} for streaming on Gaga's Vevo channel from September 16, 2014. Preceding the release, Gaga tweeted about {{the background of}} the song, about the death of flautist Horn, as well as about ahbez, saying [...] "This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance". Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review, saying that [...] "This song sounds like what <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like." [...] Grow praised it as [...] "sublime", describing the track as a [...] "loungier" [...] version Gaga and Bennett's collaboration. Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the [...] "magic" [...] of the song really happened once Bennett's vocals were heard, following Gaga's singing and the orchestration. Lewis said that [...] "It's not exactly 'Do What You Want with My Body', but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was [...] "treated with the greatest delicacy". He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga's [...] "vulnerable" [...] vocals and Bennett's [...] "assured" [...] one. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that her timbre in [...] "Nature Boy" [...] appeared inconsistent, [...] "shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical, often within just a few short bars." [...] "Nature Boy" [...] debuted on the Billboard Trending 140 Chart at number five and within a few hours, rose to number one. It also debuted at number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart. In Russia, it peaked at number 259 on the official Tophit airplay chart.|$|E

2500|$|The post-game {{celebrations}} even {{played out}} the rivalry, {{but to a}} lesser extent. Giants fans called it revenge for the Red Sox coming back from 3–0 down to beat the Yankees in the 2004 American League Championship Series, en route to ending the Curse of the Bambino. In response to Patriots fans chanting [...] "Yankees suck!" [...] when celebrating their victory in Super Bowl XXXVI, Dan Shaughnessy of The Boston Globe wrote [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> Giants or Jets celebration in New York City in which a New York player would {{take the time to}} chant, 'Red Sox suck?'" [...] He referred to retaliation for the [...] "Yankees suck!" [...] chants.|$|E
2500|$|Khamenei is an {{advocate}} of Islamic practice of Hijab. He believes that hijab is aimed at honoring women. To the Western objection to the compulsory hijab in Iran, he responds by pointing out the compulsory unveiling in certain western countries and obstacles created for veiled Muslim {{women who want to}} enter universities. He further argues that women in the West have lost their honor by pointing out perceived high rate of sexual violence in the West as well as the widespread exploitation of female sexual appeal for commercial purposes: [...] "In effect, they have been treating women like a commodity, like another of their products. If you were to look at the magazines, which are published in the West, you would see that they advertise a commodity for sale next to the naked picture of a woman. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> bigger insult to women? They [...] must be answerable [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2013, Beyoncé {{explained}} {{the idea behind}} [...] "Bow Down" [...] on iTunes Radio: [...] "The reason I put out 'Bow Down' is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn't the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning. It was the Beyoncé that was angry. It was the Beyoncé that {{felt the need to}} defend herself. And if the song never comes out…OK! I said it! And I listened to it after I finished, and I said, This is hot! I'mma put it out. I'm not going to sell it. I'm just going to put it out. People like it, great; they don't, they don't. And I won't do it every day because that's not who I am. But I feel strong. And anyone that says, 'Oh that is disrespectful,' just imagine the person that hates <b>you.</b> <b>Imagine</b> <b>a</b> person that doesn't believe in you. And {{look in the mirror and}} say, 'Bow down, bitch' and I guarantee you feel gangsta! So listen to the song from that point of view again if you didn't like it before." ...|$|E

60|$|And this Thing I saw! How can I {{describe}} it? A monstrous tripod, {{higher than}} many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the clattering tumult of its passage {{mingling with the}} riot of the thunder. A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression those instant flashes gave.

6000|$|... 'Far away up {{the desolate}} slope I heard a harsh scream, {{and saw a}} thing like a huge white {{butterfly}} go slanting and fluttering {{up into the sky}} and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it moved.|$|E

6000|$|Yokohama is not {{the proper}} place to arrange {{impressions}} in. The Pacific Ocean knocks at your door, asking to be looked at; the Japanese and American men-of-war demand serious attention through a telescope; and if you wander about the corridors of the Grand Hotel, you stop to play with Spanish Generals, all gold lace and spurs, or are captured by touts for curio-shops. It is not a nice experience to find a Sahib in a Panama hat handing you the card of his firm {{for all the world}} like a Delhi silk-merchant. You are inclined to pity that man, until he sits down, gives you a cigar, and tells you all about his diseases, his past career in California, where he was always making money and always losing it, and his hopes for the future. You see then that you are entering upon a new world. Talk to every one you meet, if they show the least disposition to talk to you, and you will gather, as I have done, a host of stories that will be of use to you hereafter. Unfortunately, they are not all fit for publication. When I tore myself away from the distractions of the outer world, and was just sitting down to write seriously on the Future of Japan, there entered a fascinating man, with heaps of money, who had collected Indian and Japanese curios all his life, and was now come to this country to get some old books which his collection lacked. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> more pleasant life than his wanderings over the earth, with untold special knowledge to back each signature of his cheque-book? ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{morning as}} I was busy over the 10th {{page of a}} letter to Wilky [...] in he popped and made my labour of no account.

60|$|So far as I can {{pretend to}} judge, {{she must have}} been pretty, in a healthy way, when she was young. I declare I hardly know whether she is not pretty now. She {{certainly}} has no marks or wrinkles; her hair either has no gray in it, or is too light to show the gray. She has preserved her fair complexion; perhaps with art to assist it--I can't say. As for her lips--I am not speaking disrespectfully, I am only describing them truly, when I say that they invite kisses in spite of her. In two words, though she has been married (as I know from what one of the guests told me after dinner) for sixteen years, she would be still an irresistible little woman, but for the one startling drawback of her eyes. Don't mistake me. In themselves, they are large, well-opened blue eyes, and may at one time have been the chief attraction in her face. But now there is an expression of suffering in them--long, unsolaced suffering, as I believe--so despairing and so dreadful, that she really made my heart ache when I looked at her. I will swear to it, that woman lives in some secret hell of her own making, and longs for the release of death; and is so inveterately full of bodily life and strength, that she may carry her burden with her to the utmost verge of life. I am digging the pen into the paper, I feel this so strongly, and I am so wretchedly incompetent to express my feeling. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>a</b> diseased mind, imprisoned in a healthy body? I don't care what doctors or books may say--it is that, and nothing else. Nothing else will solve the mystery of the smooth face, the fleshy figure, the firm step, the muscular grip of her hand when she gives it to you--and the soul in torment that looks at you all the while out of her eyes. It is useless to tell me that such a contradiction as this cannot exist. I have seen the woman; and she does exist.|$|E
