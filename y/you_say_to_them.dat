5000|$|What does it profit, my brethren, {{if someone}} {{says he has}} faith but does not have works? Can faith save him?

6000|$|What {{was he to}} do? A {{sense of}} what was fitting for his wife rather than for himself forbade him to fly at the man and take him by the throat. And now, of course, the wretched story would be told through all Cambridgeshire. Nothing could prevent that now.

[...] "If you go on like this, I will warrant that, if Percy delays his return for two months, you will know as much as many who have been two years at the work. I have always said that {{it is a mistake to}} teach {{children}} young; their minds do not take in what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> You may beat it into them, but they only get it by rote; and painfully, because they don't understand how one thing leads to another, and it is their memory only, and not their minds, that are at work." ...|$|E

6000|$|Pitt {{expressed}} his perfect acquiescence. He, too, {{had been carried}} along by the energy of his noble kinswoman, and future mother-in-law. He {{had been made to}} accept Saunders McNitre, Luke Waters, Giles Jowls, Podgers' Pills, Rodgers' Pills, Pokey's Elixir, every one of her Ladyship's remedies spiritual or temporal. He never left her house without carrying respectfully away with him piles of her quack theology and medicine. O, my dear brethren and fellow-sojourners in Vanity Fair, which among you does not know and suffer under such benevolent despots? It is in vain <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> [...] "Dear Madam, I took Podgers' specific at your orders last year, and believe in it. Why, why am I to recant and accept the Rodgers' articles now?" [...] There is no help for it; the faithful proselytizer, if she cannot convince by argument, bursts into tears, and the refusant finds himself, {{at the end of the}} contest, taking down the bolus, and saying, [...] "Well, well, Rodgers' be it." ...|$|E
60|$|CANDIDA. Yes, I MUST {{be talked}} to sometimes. (She makes him sit down, and seats {{herself on the}} carpet beside his knee.) Now (patting his hand) you're {{beginning}} to look better already. Why don't you give up all this tiresome overworking--going out every night lecturing and talking? Of course {{what you say is}} all very true and very right; but it does no good: they don't mind what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> one little bit. Of course they agree with you; but what's the use of people agreeing with you if they go and do just the opposite of what you tell them the moment your back is turned? Look at our congregation at St. Dominic's! Why do they come to hear you talking about Christianity every Sunday? Why, just because they've been so full of business and money-making for six days that they want to forget all about it and have a rest on the seventh, so that they can go back fresh and make money harder than ever! You positively help them at it instead of hindering them.|$|E

Under Tadić, pundit Šaša Dragojlo notes, the Foreign Ministry's sole task was {{ensuring}} that Kosovo remained part of Serbia, and that if it did declare its independence, that it attained only partial recognition. At first, many in Serbia and abroad were skeptical that the 32-year-old Jeremić would make for an effective Foreign Minister. [...] "When you’re young and when ... they see you for the first time," [...] Jeremić remarked, [...] "a lot of them are just kind of surprised. ...

5000|$|Sola fide, or [...] "faith alone", {{asserts that}} good works {{are not a}} means or {{requisite}} for salvation. Sola fide is the teaching that justification (interpreted in Protestant theology as [...] "being declared just by God") is received by faith alone, without any need for good works {{on the part of}} the individual. In classical Protestant theology, good works are seen to be evidence of saving faith, but the good works themselves do not determine salvation. Some Protestants see this doctrine as being summarized with the formula [...] "Faith yields justification and good works" [...] and as contrasted with the Roman Catholic formula [...] "Faith and good works yield justification." [...] The Catholic side of the argument is based on James 2:14-17. [...] "What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of <b>you</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> 'Depart in peace, be warmed and filled', but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead." [...] (James 2:14-17, NKJV) ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{combination}} {{of being an}} actor and a parent proved to be frustrating at times for von Furstenberg, who believed that the two roles sometimes blended together in daily life and posed special challenges both in and outside the home. In 1972, six years after her divorce from Guy Vincent, she expressed her views on the subject in a personal essay titled [...] "Actors Are Not the Only Ones Who Act", {{which was published in}} The New York Times on September 24, 1972. [...] In one portion of her essay she shares the following: ...I have gotten my way by 'acting' in some very significant moments in my life when perhaps {{in the long run it}} would have been better if I hadn't gotten my way...One of the most frustrating drawbacks of being an actor‐parent is to have your children accuse you of acting when you're being perfectly sincere. Of course, they've seen you being 'perfectly sincere' on stage so for the poor things I guess the better you are the more confusing it is for them (and how do you explain that both are real and yet not the same?). Ultimately your actions must bear out the truth of what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> After a prolonged period of being single, von Furstenberg finally married for the second time in 1984, then to New York real-estate broker John J. Reynolds. They remained together until his death in 1994. [...] She lived another twenty-one years. On April 21, 2015, von Furstenberg died at her home in Manhattan at the age of 83 from complications attributed to Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works. You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. Likewise, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way? For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.|$|R

Even the demons believe—and shudder! 20Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? 21Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? 22You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works; 23and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a friend of God. 24You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 25And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?26For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.|$|R
