Despite his public overture to the conservative boyars, he had also joined the Wallachians' secret society, Frăția ("The Brotherhood"), which was repressed at home but maintained {{a presence in the}} diaspora; the Society itself may have been a front for Rosetti's revolutionary conspiracy. Privately, he expressed his dislike for the patronage, noting that Ghica-Comănești and the others had surrendered the Society to [...] "backbiters". The Society was still highly popular, and, according to ledgers published by Vârnav, made a <b>yearly</b> <b>profit</b> of 21,200 francs in subscriptions and donations. He was able to sponsor scholarships for new recruits to the nationalist cause, including Nicolae Ionescu, N. Chinezu, and Ianache Lecca.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, a 45% stake of the {{state-owned}} Puerto Rico Telephone Company (PRTC) {{was sold to}} a consortium led by GTE (now Verizon) and Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, with another stake set aside to benefit allof the company's employees. [...] This sale led to a general strike organized by several labor unions. A similar attempt to privatize PRTC in 1988, under then Governor Rafael Hernández Colón, led to a similar strike which doomed the sale. Rosselló was successful in his plan to sell PRTC. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 deregulated the monopolies many regional telephone and cable television companies held. [...] From then on, PRTC's telecommunications monopoly {{would no longer be}} able to properly compete in the environment and the losses to the government would have been onerous. The sale price was 2 billion dollars, which union leaders described as [...] "ridiculously low" [...] (PRTC generated about a 100 million dollars of <b>yearly</b> <b>profit</b> at the time of the sale) ...|$|E

"While a daily {{paper is}} not {{appropriate}} in Millville, a weekly paper, distributed throughout Chazy County, would not only be desirable but {{could be made to}} pay an excellent <b>yearly</b> <b>profit.</b> Through the enterprise of Joe Wegg, Millville is destined to grow rapidly from this time on, and Chazy County is populous enough to support a good weekly paper, in any event. Therefore, my proposition is this: To turn the plant over to Mr. and Mrs. Thursday Smith, who will change the name to the Millville Weekly Tribune and run it as a permanent institution. Your only expense for labor will be one assistant to set type and do odd jobs, since you are so competent that you can attend to all else yourselves. We will cut out the expensive news service we have heretofore indulged in and dispense with the private telegraph wire. Joe Wegg says he'll furnish you with what power you need free of all charge, because the paper will boost Millville's interests, with which his own interests are identified. Now, then, {{tell me what you think}} of my proposal." ...|$|E

40|$|Organisations are {{increasingly}} using strategy {{tools such as}} workforce scorecards {{to keep track of}} human resource management related change processes that have been implemented and the effects of these on business unit performance. However, in this area, the challenge of finding appropriate indicators, establishing temporal relationships and providing useful management information still remains. Using longitudinal archival data from 171 branches of a large financial service organisation, this study examines to what extent employee surveys can serve as a predictor of better financial performance at the branch level. Results from a series of models in AMOS (Analysis of Moment Structures) showed that a significant part of branch profits could be predicted using employee surveys after correcting for prior profits. Based on extrapolation to all branches of this organisation, the changes in employee survey scores predict higher <b>yearly</b> <b>profits</b> of 178 million euros (17. 9 per cent of the total <b>yearly</b> <b>profits)</b> across the entire company.

500|$|Current whaling {{nations are}} Norway, Iceland, and Japan, despite their joining to the IWC, {{as well as}} the {{aboriginal}} communities of Siberia, Alaska, and northern Canada. Subsistence hunters typically use whale products for themselves and depend on them for survival. National and international authorities have given special treatment to aboriginal hunters since their methods of hunting are seen as less destructive and wasteful. This distinction is being questioned as these aboriginal groups are using more modern weaponry and mechanized transport to hunt with, and are selling whale products in the marketplace. Some anthropologists argue that the term [...] "subsistence" [...] should also apply to these cash-based exchanges as long as they take place within local production and consumption. In 1946, the IWC placed a moratorium, limiting the annual whale catch.
