500|$|After being {{a member}} of the Scientology {{organization}} for ten years, Christman reached the spiritual [...] "Operating Thetan" [...] level of OT III. She recounted her experience of reading the Xenu story upon reaching the level of OT III: [...] "You've jumped through all these hoops just to get to it, and then you open that packet, and the first thing <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is,</b> 'Come on.'" [...] She explained, [...] "You're surrounded by all these people who're going, 'Wow, isn't it amazing, just getting the data? I can tell it's really changed you.' After a while, enough people say it and you're like, 'Wow. You know, I really feel it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>Is</b> this what you were looking for? He was so open".|$|E

500|$|Book III {{covers the}} mediaeval Quadrivium, the four {{subjects}} which supplemented the Trivium being mathematics, geometry, music and astronomy. He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever number <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed to mark out people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, {{the sky and the}} celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
500|$|... "Liberty Walk" [...] {{was written}} by Cyrus, Nicholas J. Scapa, John Read Fasse, Michael McGinnis, Antonina Armato and Tim James. It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{left his}} job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost {{and changes in the}} {{executive}} structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series. As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead. That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: [...] "I don't think you have an alternative to writing about what you know. You've no life experience to go on other than your own. Even if you're writing something <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close to your own experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon Burton's casting, it was {{revealed}} by MSN that Dylan, who was described as [...] "the mysterious ex Avery keeps bringing up" [...] by Jillian Bowe of Zap2it, {{would be involved in}} a love triangle with his ex-girlfriend Avery Bailey Clark (Jessica Collins) and her current lover, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> going to happen is not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind {{despite the fact that she}} had moved on.|$|E

The Home Secretary David Blunkett noted that celebration was tempting, saying: [...] "You wake up and you receive a call telling you Shipman has topped himself and <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> it too early to open a bottle?

He theorized that Bigfoot creatures share a [...] "space-time origin and connection with UFOs and come from an alternative universe by a wormhole." ...|$|E

The pair's first webcomic, Never as Bad as <b>You</b> <b>Think,</b> <b>is</b> a comedic slapstick comic strip with little to no story. Greg Burgas of Comic Book Resources noted the difference in tone between the Never as Bad as You Think and Moving Pictures, the latter taking on a much darker subject matter and more complex story. The two webcomics share a [...] "sharp" [...] artstyle, with characters being rendered as [...] "skinny and pointy".|$|E
2500|$|Europe {{was known}} for his outspoken {{personality}} and unwillingness to bend to musical conventions, particularly in his insistence on playing his own style of music. He responded to criticism by saying, [...] "We have developed a kind of symphony music that, no matter what else <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> different and distinctive, and that lends itself to the playing of the peculiar compositions of our race... My success had come... from a realization of the advantages of sticking to the music of my own people." [...] And later, [...] "We colored people have our own music that is part of us. It's the product of our souls; it's been created by the sufferings and miseries of our race." ...|$|E
2500|$|This is at {{the heart}} of the tetralogy's achievement. Updike once said of the Rabbit books that they were an {{exercise}} in point of view. This was typically self-deprecating, but contains an important grain of truth. Harry's education extends no further than high school, and his view is further limited by a range of prejudices and a stubborn, combative spirit, yet he is the vehicle for a half-million-word meditation on postwar American anxiety, failure and prosperity. A mode had to be devised to make this possible, and that involved pushing beyond the bounds of realism. In a novel like this, Updike insisted, you have to be generous and allow your characters eloquence, [...] "and not chop them down to what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> the right size." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Supreme Court {{has been}} criticized for not keeping within Constitutional bounds by {{engaging}} in judicial activism, rather than merely interpreting law and exercising judicial restraint. Claims of judicial activism are not confined to any particular ideology. An often cited example of conservative judicial activism is the 1905 decision in Lochner v. New York, which {{has been criticized}} by many prominent thinkers, including Robert Bork, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Chief Justice John Roberts, and which was reversed in the 1930s. [...] An often cited example of liberal judicial activism is Roe v. Wade (1973), which legalized abortion in part {{on the basis of the}} [...] "right to privacy" [...] inferred from the Fourteenth Amendment, a reasoning that some critics argued was circuitous. Legal scholars, justices, and presidential candidates have criticized the Roe decision. The progressive Brown v. Board of Education decision has been criticized by conservatives such as Patrick Buchanan and former presidential contender Barry Goldwater. More recently, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission was criticized for expanding upon the precedent in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti (1978) that the First Amendment applies to corporations. Lincoln warned, referring to the Dred Scott decision, that if government policy became [...] "irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court...the people will have ceased to be their own rulers." [...] Former justice Thurgood Marshall justified judicial activism with these words: [...] "You do what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> right and let the law catch up." [...] During different historical periods, the Court has leaned in different directions. Critics from both sides complain that activist-judges abandon the Constitution and substitute their own views instead. Critics include writers such as Andrew Napolitano, Phyllis Schlafly, Mark R. Levin, Mark I. Sutherland, and James MacGregor Burns. Past presidents from both parties have attacked judicial activism, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan. Failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork wrote: [...] "What judges have wrought is a coup d'état,– slow-moving and genteel, but a coup d'état nonetheless." [...] Senator Al Franken quipped that when politicians talk about judicial activism, [...] "their definition of an activist judge is one who votes differently than they would like." [...] One law professor claimed in a 1978 article that the Supreme Court is in some respects [...] "certainly a legislative body." ...|$|E
