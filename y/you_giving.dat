2500|$|With a {{somewhat}} technical-sounding name, {{this is the}} most important bar to rescission in practice. [...] "Counter restitution" [...] simply means [...] "putting the parties back" [...] to their positions before the contract was consummated. For example, if our contract was a pen for £1, counter restitution would mean <b>you</b> <b>giving</b> back the pound and me giving up the pen. The aim is to ensure that a claimant is not unjustly enriched as a result of rescission. It used to be that common law courts insisted on precise restitution. So in Clarke v Dickson it was held that a defrauded investor could not rescind the purchase of his shares because the investment was bound up in the company and the shares were now worth less. Precise counter restitution was impossible. However, the rule was mitigated, becoming more lenient. Now only substantial restitution is necessary. In Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co promoters (who are in law fiduciaries, and therefore subject to a duty to disclose material facts) did not tell investors that a mine on Sombrero island had been bought by the promoters for half the price that they were now valuing it for in the company. By the time investors realised, however, a substantial amount of phosphate had been mined. It clearly could not be put back in the ground. But Lord Blackburn held that since substantial restitution (i.e. the money equivalent) could be paid, rescission of the share contracts was not barred.|$|E
