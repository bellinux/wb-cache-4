5|$|On December 15, 2015, Heyward {{signed an}} eight-year, $184 million {{contract}} with the Cubs. One of his first acts after signing his contract was to pay for hotel suites {{large enough to accommodate}} teammate David Ross, his wife, and their three young children on all of the Cubs' road trips during the 2016 season. Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of my heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E
5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden in the folds), or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
25|$|Hughes vehemently opposed Japan's racial {{equality}} proposition. Hughes recognised {{that such a}} clause would {{be a threat to}} White Australia and made it clear to British Prime Minister David Lloyd George that he would leave the conference if the clause was adopted.

You may do with it what you please, but at any rate, the soldiers have achieved the victory and my colleagues and I have brought that great principle back to <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> conference, as safe as it was on the day when it was first adopted.|$|E

25|$|Sunshine Village offers terrain for {{all levels}} of skiers and boarders. It offers a mix of gentle tree lined {{beginner}} slopes, wide open above tree-line intermediate and expert terrain. Visitors to the resort will often access adjacent backcountry terrain such as 'Wawa Ridge' or Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park in British Columbia. Avalanche rescue equipment is recommended for most backcountry areas. Rescue equipment is a requirement {{for access to the}} freeride zones of Delirium Dive and Wild West where the entrances are via a gate which remains locked at all times unless it detects a working avalanche transceiver on each person that passes through it. The entrance for Wild West is located on Goats Eye Mountain while the entrance to Delirium Dive is located near the Great Divide. Sunshine also features a 5km ski-out which brings <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> village to the gondola base.|$|E
25|$|In the {{conclusion}} to the essay, he wrote of the Jews that 'only one thing can redeem <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> burden of your curse: the redemption of Ahasuerus — going under!' Although this has been taken by some commentators to mean actual physical annihilation, {{in the context of}} the essay it seems to refer only to the eradication of Jewish separateness and traditions. Wagner advises Jews to follow the example of Ludwig Börne by abandoning Judaism. In this way Jews will take part in 'this regenerative work of deliverance through self-annulment; then are we one and un-dissevered!' Wagner was therefore calling for the assimilation of Jews into mainstream German culture and society - although there can be little doubt, from the words he uses in the essay, that this call was prompted at least as much by anti-semitism as by a desire for social amelioration. (In the very first publication, the word here translated as 'self-annulment' was represented by the phrase 'self-annihilating, bloody struggle').|$|E

500|$|Still, Achebe {{seeks to}} portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability. In 1972, he said: [...] "I never {{will take the}} stand that the Old must win or that the New must win. The point is that no single truth {{satisfied}} me—and this is well founded in the Ibo world view. No single man can be correct all the time, no single idea can be totally correct." [...] His perspective {{is reflected in the}} words of Ikem, a character in Anthills of the Savannah: [...] "whatever you are is never enough; you {{must find a way to}} accept something, however small, from the other to make you whole and to save <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mortal sin of righteousness and extremism." [...] And in a 1996 interview, Achebe said: [...] "Belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things... Evil is never all evil; goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. You just have to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said.

500|$|After the 2009–10 {{season was}} over, {{there was much}} {{speculation}} over whether coveted free agents such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Bosh would sign with new teams for the 2010–11 season. Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute here and I just wanted to thank <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bottom of my heart..." [...] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, {{he was one of}} only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.|$|E
500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms around you and keep <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Madonna compares rain with {{feelings}} of love. Just as rain washes away dirt, love washes clean the sorrows of the past, leaving a person and their lover to focus on their feelings of the present moment. Richard Harrington from The Washington Post described [...] "Rain" [...] as [...] "an optimistic Peter Gabriel-like ballad in which water {{is a metaphor for}} love ('Wash away my sorrow, take away my pain')." [...] According to Stephen Sears from music website Idolator, [...] "the synths turbo-charge at 2:46 into a sleek middle eight that features dueling Madonnas reciting lines of poetry out of the left and right channels [...] 'By sheer force of will / I'll raise <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground', she says softly, 'And without a sound, you'll appear and surrender to me, to love'." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought lyrically the ballads on Erotica to be primarily concerned with sex, saying that some might even view [...] "Rain" [...] as an extended metaphor for ejaculation, though he didn't subscribe to that knee-jerk interpretation.|$|E

500|$|Mariel Concepcion of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} [...] "Diva" [...] {{is not something}} new, nevertheless it manages to be a radio-ready dance song. Alex Thornton of AllHipHop noted that Beyoncé adopts a masculine character on [...] "Diva" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "something decent to bounce to at least". The Observers Adam Mattera described the song as a potential source of inspiration to drag queens, however concluded that it can also leave many persons confused and bewildered. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian, also reviewed the song negatively, stating, [...] "The sonic trickery on the most experimental track, 'Diva', isn't interesting enough to distract <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> absence of a tune." [...] Spence D. of IGN Music, felt that Beyoncé's rapping in the song was a [...] "bad idea" [...] and described the song as [...] "awkward, [...] horribly dated." [...] On The Village Voices 2009 Pazz & Jop singles list, [...] "Diva" [...] was ranked at number 224. In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number nine on their list of ten best Beyoncé's songs.|$|E
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Bill Lamb of About.com explained that, after many believed that rejecting her judge {{role on the}} US version of The X Factor in 2011 would be a career setback, {{the release of the}} [...] "hot, current dance pop" [...] track proved them wrong. Writing for the same website, DJ Ron Slomowicz stated that, despite being [...] "a little generic" [...] when compared to mainstream tracks, [...] "there's still something undeniably catchy about the track." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated [...] "Call My Name" [...] four out of five stars, and added: [...] "unsurprisingly, is a ballsy dance anthem about an elusive lover complete with a foot-stomping trance section that becomes more addictive with each listen." [...] Copsey also added that it isn't the [...] "greatest song of all time, nor the most original you'll hear this year, but the feeling we get from it more than makes up for it." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator said that, despite not being innovative, the song has catchy hooks and melodies that [...] "manage to grab <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first listen, no matter how familiar they might sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowe and Hanton busked {{through the}} song, which {{was cut short}} by Phillips waving his hands to {{indicate}} that the cutting needle was getting close to the centre of the acetate. He then handed the band a fragile 78rpm 10-inch acetate record. It was later lost until Lowe rediscovered it in 1981, and planned to put it up for auction at Sotheby's, but sold it to McCartney for an undisclosed amount. McCartney later had the two songs digitally re-mastered and pressed 50 copies, giving them to friends as a Christmas present, although the two songs were released on 21 November 1995, as part of The Beatles Anthology (Anthology 1). McCartney later said, [...] "The strangest thing for me, listening to it, is that it's like drowning, it's like your life flashing by in front of <b>you.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> earliest things by me and John when we used to sag off school and the earliest demo tape we ever made, to the first little record we made which was a version of John singing [...] "That'll Be The Day", and a little song of mine [...] on the other side that's never been released before." ...|$|E
