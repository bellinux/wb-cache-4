2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess on your hands necessarily. It doesn’t mean that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg.... And he may, and often will be, black and blue. My children have been many times. And it cleans evil from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|Closing {{arguments}} were heard July 3 and July4. Jeff Ashton, for the prosecution, told the jury, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> that child becomes your life. This case {{is about the}} clash between that responsibility, and the expectations that go with it, and the life that Casey Anthony wanted to have." [...] He outlined the state's case against Casey Anthony, touching on her many lies to her parents and others, the smell in her car's trunk—identified by several witnesses, including her own father, as the odor from human decomposition—and the items found with Caylee's skeletal remains in December 2008. He emphasized how Anthony [...] "maintains her lies until they absolutely cannot be maintained any more" [...] and then replaces [...] with another lie, using [...] "Zanny the Nanny" [...] as an example. Anthony repeatedly told police that Caylee was with the nanny that she specifically identified as Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. Police, however, {{were never able to}} find the nanny. Authorities did find a woman named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez, but she denied ever meeting the Anthonys.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Mr. Watling agreed, [...] "but there a {{principle}} is involved.

2500|$|Healing a {{man with}} dropsy is {{described}} in [...] In this miracle, Jesus cured {{a man with}} dropsy {{at the house of}} a prominent Pharisee on the Sabbath. Jesus justified the cure by asking: [...] "If one of <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> or <b>an</b> ox that falls into a well on the Sabbath day, will you not immediately pull it out?" ...|$|R

At the same time, I am here to have my {{question}} answered. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with you who is apparently terrified to death. I insist upon hearing from her own lips whether she {{is in need of}} friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Finally, {{the king}} {{said to her}} one day, 'This can't be borne any longer. I go about childless, and it's your fault. I am going on a journey and shall be away for a year. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> when I come back again, all will be well, and I shall love you beyond all measure, and never more say an angry word to you.

If there be anything that I can do to add to your happiness, I will do it. You must believe this of me,--that to make you happy shall be the only enjoyment of my life.' ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{those early}} {{formative}} days families {{around the world}} began to question the accepted wisdom that they should institutionalize their son or daughter with a disability. [...] But parents were isolated from each other. They {{had no way of}} knowing who else felt the same way. It was not easy for parents to get to know each other. Some resorted to placing ads in newspapers. Even here they faced challenges as some newspapers felt it was inappropriate to advertise the fact <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> with <b>a</b> disability. It is hard to understand today but this was the accepted wisdom of the time.|$|R
60|$|Lady Windermere, before Heaven {{your husband}} is guiltless of all offence towards you! And I--I tell you that had it ever {{occurred}} to me that such a monstrous suspicion would have entered your mind, I would have died rather than have crossed your life or his--oh! died, gladly died! Believe what you choose about me. I am not worth a moment's sorrow. But don't spoil your beautiful young life on my account! You don't know what may be in store for you, unless you leave this house at once. You don't {{know what it is to}} fall into the pit, to be despised, mocked, abandoned, sneered at--to be an outcast! to find the door shut against one, to have to creep in by hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the mask should be stripped from one's face, and all the while to hear the laughter, the horrible laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than all the tears the world has ever shed. You don't know what it is. One pays for one's sin, and then one pays again, and all one's life one pays. You must never know that.--As for me, if suffering be an expiation, then at this moment I have expiated all my faults, whatever they have been; for to- night you have made a heart in one who had it not, made it and broken it.--But let that pass. I may have wrecked my own life, but I will not let you wreck yours. You--why, you are a mere girl, you would be lost. You haven't got the kind of brains that enables a woman to get back. You have neither the wit nor the courage. You couldn't stand dishonour! No! Go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who loves you, whom you love. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> Lady Windermere. Go back to that child who even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling to you. God gave you that child. He will require from you that you make his life fine, that you watch over him. What answer will you make to God if his life is ruined through you? Back to your house, Lady Windermere--your husband loves you! He has never swerved for a moment from the love he bears you. But even if he had a thousand loves, you must stay with your child. If he was harsh to you, you must stay with your child. If he ill-treated you, you must stay with your child. If he abandoned you, your place is with your child.--Lady Windermere's Fan.|$|E

60|$|A lady of distinction, {{whose name}} shall {{therefore}} be concealed in this place, came {{with two or}} three of her special friends, who took her for the most merry, innocent, spotless virgin upon earth, and whose modesty was never suspected in the least by her relations or servants that were nearest about her; after having rallied Mr. Campbell with several frivolous questions, doubting his capacity, and vexing and teasing him with gay impertinences beyond all patience, was by him told, that he did not take fees in his profession to be made a jest of like a common fortuneteller, but to do real good to those who consulted him, {{as far as he was}} able by his predictions; that he was treated with more respect by persons of a higher condition, though her own was very good, and so offered her guinea back again with a bow and a smile. She had a little more generosity of spirit than not to be a little nettled at the proffer she had caused by so coarse an usage. She affected appearing grave a little, and told him she would be serious for the future, and asked him to set down her name, which she had neglected before, to ask other questions that were nothing to the purpose. He promised to write it down, but pausing a little longer than ordinary about it, she returned to her former way of uncivil merriment and ungallant raillery. She repeated to him in three or four little scraps of paper, one after another, as fast as she could write them, the same words, viz., That he could not tell her name, nor whether she was maid, wife, or widow; and laughed as if she would split her sides, triumphing to the rest of her companions over his ignorance and her own wit, as if she had posed him, and put him to an entire stand. But see what this overweening opinion of security ended in: the man of the second-sight was not to be so easily baffled. Vexed at being so disturbed, and coming out of his brown study, he reaches the paper and begins to write. Now it was the lady's turn to suffer, she had deserved hearty punishment, and it came into her hands with the note, to a degree of severity, as you will perceive by the contents of it just now. She read it, and swooning away, dropped from her chair. The whole room being in a bustle, I, that was in the outward chamber, ran in: while Mr. Campbell was sprinkling water in her face, a lady snatched up the note to read it, at which he seemed mightily displeased; I, therefore, who understood his signs, recovered it out of her hands by stratagem, and ran to burn it, which I did so quick that I was not discovered in the curiosity which I must own I satisfied myself in by reading it first; a curiosity raised too high by so particular an adventure, to be overcome in so little a time of thought, as I was to keep it in my hands, and so I came by the knowledge of it myself, without being informed by Mr. Campbell. This shows how a sudden curiosity, when there is not time given to think and correct it, may overcome a man as well as a woman; for I was never over-curious in my life, and though I was pleased with the oddness of the adventure, I often blushed to myself since for the unmanly weakness of not being able to step with a note from one room to another to the fireside, without peeping into the contents of it. The contents of it were these: Madam since you provoke me, your name is ----. You are no widow, you are no wife, and yet you are no maid; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> at nurse at such a place, by such a gentleman, and you were brought to bed in Leicestershire. The lady, convinced by this answer of his strange and mystical power, and pleased with his civility in endeavouring to conceal from others the secret, after so many repeated provocations, though she showed great disorder for that day, became one of his constant attenders some time after, and would not take any step in her affairs without his advice, which she often has said since, she found very much to her advantage. She was as serious in her dealings with him afterwards, and improved by being so, as she was gay and turbulent with him before, and smarted for it. In fine, she was a thorough convert, and a votary of his; and the only jest she used afterwards to make, concerning him, was a civil witticism to his wife; to whom she was wont, every now and then, smiling, to address herself after this manner: Your husband, madam, is a devil, but he is a very handsome and a very civil one.|$|E
40|$|It seems {{natural to}} choose whether to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> by {{reflecting}} {{on what it}} would be like to actually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child.</b> I argue that this natural approach fails. If you choose to become a parent, and your choice is based on projections about what you think it would be like for <b>you</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. If you choose to remain childless, and your choice is based upon projections about what you think it would be like for <b>you</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>child,</b> your choice is not rational. This suggests we should reject our ordinary conception of how to make this life-changing decision, and raises general questions about how to rationally approach important life choices...|$|R
