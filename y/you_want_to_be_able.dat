50|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags {{can be used}} in many {{different}} applications. These tags {{can be used in}} packaging, inventory control, used to verify authenticity and even allow or deny access to something. These ID tags can even have other integrated sensors to allow for the physical environment to be monitored, such as temperature or shock during travel or shipping. Also, the distance required to read the information in the tag depends on the strength of the battery. The farther away <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to read the information, the stronger the output will have to be and thus the greater the power supply to accomplish this output. As these tags get more and more complex, the battery requirements will need to keep up. Thin film lithium ion batteries have shown that they can fit into the designs of the tags because of the flexibility of the battery in size and shape and are sufficiently powerful enough to accomplish the goals of the tag. Low cost production methods, like roll to roll lamination, of these batteries may even allow for this kind of RFID technology to be implemented in disposable applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Idealy, {{everyone}} {{would like to}} embed test into their products today, whether it’s to reduce costs, build in support capabilities, ensure better quality, reduce dependacy on expert technicians, or for one of many other intelligent motivations. However, it seems the technology of Built in Test (BIT) has not taken off or been adopted like many believed it would. The reasons for this poor adoption are diverse: some blame it on design, others fault product specifications and even others {{blame it on the}} fundementals of the technology itself. The underlying root cause of slow BIT adoption may be a result of an inaccurate belief that designing an embedded test is more difficult than designing any other test. In reality, understanding what to embed is simply a function of knowing the coverage you are seeking and at what level <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to diagnose the problem when a failure occurs. Presented in this paper are several considerations on how to best approach Built in Test. This preferred approach is illustrated by explaining the importance of understanding how to achieve effective and appropriate coverage levels, while also maintaining a useful level of diagnostic resolution. Understanding and application of these concepts will effectively enable optimal design and implementation of Built in Test. I...|$|E
40|$|You {{have heard}} about issues {{surrounding}} indexing and retrieval of nuclear records and automation and micrographics of these records. Now {{we are going to}} get each of you involved in indexing and assigning keywords. The first part of this hands-on workshop will be a very basic, elementary step-by-step introduction, concentrating on how to assign keywords. It is a workshop for beginners, People who have never done it before. It is planned to demonstrate what an analyst has to do to index and assign keywords to a document. Then I will take some pages of a report and demonstrate how I choose keywords for it. Then each of you will have a chance to do the same thing with similar pages from another report. Then we will discuss the variations ln the keywords you individually assigned. There are many systems that can be used. In this particular workshop we will cover only a system of building your own keyword listing as you index your documents. We will be discussing keywords or descriptors or subject words, but first I want to point out a few other critical points about indexing. When developing an indexing project the most important thing to do first lS decide what elements you want to retrieve by. Whether you go into a large computer retrieval system or a small three-by-five card system, you have to decide in advance what you want to retrieve. Then you can go on from there. If you only need to search by equipment number or by purchase order or by contract number, then you can use a very simple retrieval system. But if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to retrieve a record by any combination of elements, then you have to consistently input these into your system. For example, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to ask for the drawings of the piping in the secondary cooling system, level 3, manufactured by a certain vendor, then you must have put the information into the index by a retrieval file point, in advance. I want to stress that the time spent in deciding what has to be retrievable is never wasted. It will save going back later to re-do thousands of records. Let me quickly read a list of some of the elements to index: Personal author, corporate author (including contractor, supplier, manufacturer or designer), contract number, report number, purchase order number, equipment number, part number, revision number, building number, room number, level number, drawing number, specification or standard number, date, change notice number, and even date of change notice. There are probably many other elements you have identified for your own records. To be able to retrieve by any combination of these elements is invaluable. Then, if you add subject retrievability to these elements, you have a very comprehensive system. The elements mentioned are usually readily discernable by skilled non-technical people who are familiar with the paperwork issued by and flowing through their organization. Therefore, no matter how many of these elements are determined to be necessary, they can readily be identified and incorporated into the indexing form or coding sheet...|$|E
