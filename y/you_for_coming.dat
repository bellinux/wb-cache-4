During the performances at the clubs, Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket, velvet pedal pushers and knee-high boots. In the Confessions Tour, the song was the fourth performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show. Madonna wore a skin-tight, full body black leotard. As the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] ended, Madonna sat on a platform and announced [...] "Ladies and Gentleman! Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to our show. The night is young, and the show has just begun." [...] A huge assortment of steel rods and gymnastic equipment were planted on the stage. Madonna started singing the song, as her dancers started running around, displaying routines in parkour. Madonna climbs on blocks to sing the song as well as to strike poses. As the final chorus approached, Madonna went to the front of the stage and struck poses while holding on to the steel rods. The song continued with Madonna swiveling around the rods and the dancers continuing their routine. The performance ends with Madonna disappearing through the middle of the stage and her dancers doing a final vault before the lights are turned off. In the Sticky & Sweet Tour, [...] "Jump" [...] was sampled in the song [...] "Into the Groove" [...] during which Madonna performed stunts in the air.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, {{poor little}} things, let them finish their game. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to me. My aunt will, I hope, hear nothing of it. Good evening.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{we thank}} <b>you</b> much <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to warn us," [...] murmured Margaret. [...] "I will go find my father," [...] and she slipped past him towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will lay}} your advice to heart; {{and we thank}} <b>you,</b> meanwhile, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to see us in this foul den, which I dislike less because of {{moisture}} and dirt--these being familiar to me--than because of the lively reptiles which hold their nightly revels in it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} let my mother go out without me on such an {{occasion}} as this. But I am grateful to <b>you,</b> Mrs. Orme, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> up so speedily," [...] {{he said as}} {{he shook}} the young thane by the hand. [...] "You have heard the news, I suppose?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, daily. He is {{so anxious}} to see you, Mr. Neville, and so much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming.</b> I was sure that you would come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go," [...] she declared. [...] "We {{are busy}} here, {{and so many}} of the girls are away--down with the heat, I suppose. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> Aaron." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{obliged to}} <b>you,</b> sir, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to me first. You {{are in my}} house, and I don't want to be discourteous, but I should be glad {{if you would be}} good enough to {{withdraw}} and take it that I shall certainly oppose your wish as best I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank <b>you,</b> Sire, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> and <b>for</b> hearing me. Another day, if I am spared, I {{may tell}} you more. Meanwhile, bear well in mind what I have said already. I have no {{interests}} {{in this world}} but your own, Sire." [...] And he kissed the royal hand in farewell.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to {{ask your}} pardon," [...] said the old soldier, [...] "because I have wronged you by a moment of unjust suspicion. For my daughter's sake, I bitterly regret {{that we did not}} see each other long ago; but I thank <b>you,</b> nevertheless, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> here, even at the {{eleventh}} hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{suppose that}} Lady Aylmer is,--is vexed with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> here. I shall be {{so sorry for}} that;--so very sorry, as no good can come of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as I bid you," [...] he said sharply, in {{the same}} language. [...] "Effie, my love, give me a kiss and go home. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night," [...] {{said the}} farmer, [...] "and thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> and {{giving me the}} fresh advice. It ain’t {{everybody}} that ’ud ha’ taken the trouble. If I hadn’t lost that key——" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May God bless <b>you,</b> Biarne, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> so opportunely," [...] said Karlsefin. [...] "Let {{your men}} join {{and extend the}} circle. There, spread it out wider; that will do. I won't trouble you with {{questions}} just now, Biarne, as to what made you think of coming. We have more pressing work on hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{she said}} hurriedly. [...] "I am very {{grateful}} to <b>you,</b> Kirylo Sidorovitch, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> at once--like this.... Only, I wish I had.... Did mother tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> left Rome <b>for</b> this? We {{understood}} <b>you</b> were <b>coming</b> <b>for</b> something else," [...] said Lady St. Jerome, in {{a significant}} tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> but I am going to talk plainly," [...] he said. [...] "You connived at the {{meetings}} between my daughter and the rascally adventurer who has married her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I saw you, Mr. Davies, only I {{could not}} stop the song to say how do you do. By the way, I have to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to inquire after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did quite right," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "and I thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming.</b> I {{told him he}} might go up there occasionally, but I {{particularly}} warned him against giving any annoyance to the neighbours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} lieutenant, [...] "if {{you choose to}} try that, you may do as <b>you</b> please; <b>for</b> I'm <b>coming</b> aboard of you as sure as heaven." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he said, {{as he led}} the {{way towards}} the exit, [...] "that I must go back to work. Thank <b>you</b> so much <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> and taking pity upon a lonely man, Miss Lane." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Chase Those (Meal Time) Blues Away" [...] by Bonnie Appetite and the Kitchen KrackpotsThe Kitchen Krackpots band (containers of mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, a {{spinning}} bottle of mustard, etc.) played a boisterous ragtime intro, as Bonnie reappeared, now in showgirl attire, to [...] "Thank <b>you</b> all <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to (her) kitchen." [...] The only figure {{that did not}} feature atriculated facial features was the mustard jar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. And now, Frank, as I am so very tired, if {{you please}} I'll say good-bye to you. I am very much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> with me. Good-bye." [...] And so they parted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dear Cecilia. She {{has brought}} {{it on her}} own head. I must get into my train now, as we are just off. I am so much obliged to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to see me start." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was in bed," [...] {{she said}} shortly. [...] "I can't have gentlemen callers {{there at all}} now. Father's gone off on tour. Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to meet me, but I don't think you'd better stop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then why didn't he {{behave as}} such?' and Mrs Hurtle again smiled. 'Did not you {{yourself}} feel that <b>you</b> were rebuked <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> here with me, when he expressed surprise at your journey? Has he authority over you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laggard!" [...] one exclaimed, [...] "what excuse have <b>you</b> to make <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> so late? I noted {{not that}} De Jouvaux's wine had mounted {{into your head}} last night, and surely the duke cannot have had need of your {{valuable}} services this morning?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Clavering," [...] said she, {{rising from}} her chair; [...] "I am {{so glad to}} see you, though I am almost angry with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> not <b>coming</b> to us sooner. I have heard so much about you; of course you know that." [...] Harry {{explained}} that he had only been a few days in town, and declared that he was happy to learn that he had been considered worth talking about.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Thomasin! Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> tonight," [...] said Clym {{when she}} entered the room. [...] "Here am I, you see. Such a wretched {{spectacle}} am I, that I shrink from being seen by a single friend, and almost from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what I think of <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> Bob, for insisting upon seeing me as you did," [...] she said, remembering with shame Ellen's account of that proceeding. [...] "It was very unkind and very thoughtless of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|But I {{must tell}} you all {{the realities of the}} Castle and around it. [...] So I will write again within a day or two, and try to let you know [...] enough to prepare <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> here. Till then adieu, my dear.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we can't," [...] shouted Gashford, fiercely. [...] "These mean pilferers {{have become}} a perfect pest at the diggin's, an' we intend to stop their little game, we do, by stoppin' their windpipes when we catch them. Come, don't shilly-shally any longer, Paul Bevan. He's here, and no mistake, so you'd better hand him over. Besides, you owe us something, <b>you</b> know, <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> to your help agin the redskins {{in the nick of}} time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Finally, {{when she}} took her departure, Fan, still strangely quiet and grave-eyed, {{accompanied}} her to the door. [...] "Thank <b>you</b> so much <b>for</b> <b>coming,</b> Mary," [...] she said, a little coldly. They {{were standing in the}} hall, and the other attentively studied her face for some moments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you really}} so much disappointed?" [...] she asked. [...] "I am so sorry. If I {{had known that}} <b>you</b> were <b>coming</b> <b>for</b> me, I would have kept myself free." ...|$|R
