6000|$|He responded gallantly, [...] "I {{am quite}} {{prepared}} to believe that, Mrs. Lambert. But do many nice people like <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> all the year round?" [...] He was bent on drawing the girl out, {{but she did}} not respond.|$|E
6000|$|But all the time, I felt ill at heart; and {{was filled}} with an {{undercurrent}} of dismal forebodings. But I strove to dispel them; and turning to my companion, exclaimed, [...] "And pray, do <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here,</b> Harry, in this Palace of Aladdin?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{mind the}} shop this morning," [...] he said casually. [...] "I've {{to go and}} get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon, and to call elsewhere.

6000|$|... “That’s right,” {{returned}} Phil. “Because, if <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here,</b> <b>you</b> might {{some day}} find yourself buried before your time!” And this quaint {{way of expressing}} it made all of the boys grin {{in spite of their}} excitement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have brought}} your hat back," [...] {{said the old}} lady with a {{kindling}} eye; [...] "they told me <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> and I was anxious {{to know that you}} and your dear dog were none the worse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You're {{never to}} be trusted,' screamed the woman; 'you were out all day yesterday, and gallivanting somewhere I know. You know you were! Isn't it enough that I paid two pound {{fourteen}} for you, and took you out of prison and let <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> like a gentleman, but must you go on like this: breaking my heart besides?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Whereat, to {{his great}} delight, I winced {{once more and}} hastily {{continued}} the conversation :--"And how do <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> from day to day? What do you do?"

6000|$|... "I {{have said}} nothing, and will say nothing, {{if you wish}} it," [...] said Rosey hastily; [...] "but others may find out how <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here.</b> This is not fit work for you.

6000|$|... "I {{heard you}} say to the cop that <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here,</b> so I came along to tell your folks what had happened, so that they could do something. The maid said that your uncle was {{expected}} any minute, so I waited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} her about Miss Trefoil," [...] said Lady Ushant. [...] "You know, my dear, I look upon you almost as one of {{ourselves}} because <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> so long. But perhaps you had better postpone coming again till she has gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, nonsense!" [...] {{returned}} the little man; [...] "you cannot become ill eating {{this sort of}} candy, for it's the purest in all the world.

6000|$|... "It {{is such a}} {{long way}} for you to come, and you have so little time to stay when you are here, that I am {{thinking}} of asking your aunt to let <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> at the Mission, as a pupil, in the house of the Senora Hernandez, until your lessons are finished. Padre Jose will attend to the rest of your education. Would you like it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For three reasons, Allan, each {{of which}} is final. You are English, and I do not wish my {{daughter}} to marry an Englishman; that is the first. You are poor, which is no discredit to you, and since I am now ruined my daughter cannot marry a poor man; that is the second. <b>You</b> <b>live</b> <b>here,</b> and my daughter and I are leaving this country, therefore you cannot marry her; that is the third," [...] and he paused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comment?" [...] the Frenchman exclaimed, with {{surprise}} and delight. [...] "A lady as well; a charming English lady! What an acquisition {{to the society}} of Boupari! Quelle chance! Quel bonheur! Monsieur, you are welcome, and mademoiselle too! And in what quality do <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here?</b> You are a god, I see; otherwise {{you would not have}} dared to transgress my taboo, nor would this young man--your Shadow, I suppose--have permitted you to do so. But which sort of god, pray? Korong--or Tula?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The English law is in {{the main}} a just law. You will get no worse than your deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this man know that <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here,</b> or how to get into your house, or where to hide to get you?" ...|$|R

5000|$|She played six to ten shows {{a week at}} block parties, nightclubs, strip clubs, {{and other}} venues while the city recuperated. According to Fensterstock, [...] "Freedia {{was one of the}} first artists to come back after the storm and start working, and he worked really, really hard.

6000|$|... "Good sooth, sir," [...] {{replied the}} stranger, {{with a quiet}} smile on his kind, weather-beaten face, [...] "I can return you the compliment, for when I saw you come thundering down the corrie with that {{wonderful}} horse and no less wonderful dog of yours, I thought you were the wild man o' the mountain himself, and had an ambush ready to back you. But, young man, {{do you mean to}} say that <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> in the mountain all alone after this fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> {{long you}} vill get your proof. But I forget {{that you are}} {{yourself}} one of them. You vill soon {{be as bad as}} the rest. But you vill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad enough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare not turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes, indeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>here</b> {{long enough}} you won't care {{to see any}} other places; you'll know they're not worth seeing." [...] Lemuel looked up {{as if he did}} not {{understand}} exactly, and Mr. Evans stepped in and lifted the book he had been reading. It was one he had bought at second hand while he was with Miss Vane: a tough little epitome of the philosophies in all times, the crabbed English version of a dry German original. Mr. Evans turned its leaves over. [...] "Do you find it a very exciting story?" [...] he asked.|$|E

What? have <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>here</b> so long, and never heard?' And here he put his mouth to my ear and whispered, as if even the fowls of the mountain might have over-heard and been stricken with horror.|$|R
50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2009 (August 28-November 16), e-flux {{presented}} If <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> <b>Here</b> Still... An Archive Project by Martha Rosler, the archive of the artist’s foundational project from 1989, “If <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> Here…” Part research-based artwork, part curated group show, part discursive series on and around the subject of homelessness and housing in America, “If <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> Here…” {{took place at the}} Dia Art Foundation building in Soho, New York City, in 1989. In structuring her project, Rosler worked with the young artist and student of urbanism Dan Wiley as well as with a self-organized group of homeless people calling itself Homeward Bound, and with such groups as the MadHousers, a Southern architecture collective building “huts for the homeless.” She also worked with numerous advocacy and activist groups in the city, as well as with architects and urbanists. In the exhibition space at e-flux If <b>You</b> <b>Lived</b> <b>Here</b> Still... An Archive Project by Martha Rosler presented documents, photographs, videos and slideshows that revealed the original project's extensive organization. The exhibition included images from presentations since the project began at Dia in 1989 as well as materials sourced from current activist and advocacy groups.|$|R
