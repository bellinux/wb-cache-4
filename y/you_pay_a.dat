Wired magazine also said Monster's HDMI cables made a difference over [...] distances, but that, [...] "with Monster, <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> staggering premium for durability and good looks". In tests by PC World, Monster's M500CV video cables had the least distortion {{out of all the}} cables tested, being within 1 ohm of the standard 75 ohm impedance.|$|E

[...] In 1989, Forbes magazine estimated Escobar to be one of 227 billionaires in the world with a personal net worth of close to US $3 billion while his Medellín Cartel controlled 80% of the global cocaine market. It is commonly believed that Escobar was the principal financier behind Medellín's Atlético Nacional, which won South America's most prestigious football tournament, the Copa Libertadores, in 1989.|$|E

50|$|The {{two-part tariff}} is {{another form of}} price {{discrimination}} where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee {{for the use of}} the product. An example of this is razors, <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>an</b> initial cost for the razor and then pay for the replacement blades. This pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right: since you have already paid for the initial blade holder you will buy the blades which are now cheaper than buying a disposable razor.|$|R

60|$|Besides {{taking the}} baths Jone has {{to drink the}} waters, and as I cannot do much else to help him, I am {{encouraging}} him by drinking them too. There are two places {{where you can get}} the lukewarm water that people come here to drink. One is the public well, where there is a pump free to everybody, and the other is in the pump-room just {{across the street from the}} well, where <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> penny a glass for the same water, which three doleful old women spend all their time pumping for visitors.|$|E
60|$|In {{the streets}} {{neighboring}} on Piccadilly {{there are many}} apartments which are effectively small hotels, where <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> certain price for your rooms, and a certain fixed price for your meals. You must leave this neighborhood {{if you want the}} true lodging where you pay for your apartment, and order the provisions which are cooked for you, and which are apportioned to your daily needs. This is the ideal, and it is not seriously affected by the reality that your provisions are also apportioned to the needs of your landlord's family. Even then, the ideal remains beautiful, and you have an image, somewhat blurred and battered, of home, such as money cannot elsewhere buy you. If your landlord is the butler who has married the cook, your valeting and cooking approach as nearly perfection as you can hopefully demand.|$|E

"You {{are from}} a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult Nature, and, through her, Nature's God, if by so doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket.

Hear and obey: --You will immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the Schiller monument; <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> fine of ten thousand francs; you will suffer two years' imprisonment at hard labor; you will then be horsewhipped, tarred and feathered, deprived of your ears, ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton, and banished forever.

They have therefore passed over the obvious punishment of whipping on the bare back, in mercy to your years; but, as the dignity of the law requires an open exhibition of the consequences of your crime, it is ordered that you be conveyed from this room to the public stocks, where you are to be confined for one hour; that <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> fine to the State of one hundred dollars; and that you be imprisoned in the jail of this county for one calendar month, and, furthermore, that your imprisonment do not cease until the said fine shall be paid.

6000|$|I find by me {{a violent}} little {{fragment}} of undelivered lecture, which puts this, perhaps, still more clearly. Your idle people (it says), {{as they are}} now, are not merely waste coal-beds. They are explosive coal-beds, which <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> high annual rent for. You are keeping all these idle persons, remember, at far greater cost than if they were busy. Do you think a vicious person eats less than an honest one? or that it is cheaper to keep a bad man drunk, than a good man sober? There is, I suppose, a dim idea {{in the mind of}} the public, that they don't pay for the maintenance of people they don't employ. Those staggering rascals at the street corner, grouped around its splendid angle of public-house, we fancy that they are no servants of ours! that we pay them no wages! that no cash out of our pockets is spent over that beer-stained counter! ...|$|E
60|$|My notion, then, is this.

I am told that I do not spell correctly. This of course I don't know; but you will remember that Richelieu and Marlborough could not spell, and egad! I am an honest man, and desire to be no better than they. I know that it is the matter, and not the manner, which is of importance. Have the goodness, then, to let one of your understrappers correct the spelling and the grammar of my papers; and you can give him a few shillings in my name for his trouble.|$|E
