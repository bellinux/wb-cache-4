Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards."

That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding. The couple honeymooned in Paris, and there she met and befriended the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani.|$|E

In doing this they consider that they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honour the living image of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry about his image.|$|E

[...] Like Huxley, [...] "the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle." [...] A paragraph on [...] "the great hippopotamus test" [...] opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring [...] "that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have", but then like Owen presenting the argument that [...] "If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, you are no ape".|$|E
