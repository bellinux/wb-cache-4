5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, <b>Yugoslavia</b> {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came under {{increasing}} pro-Axis political pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, <b>Yugoslavia</b> gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, <b>Yugoslavia</b> was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that <b>Yugoslavia</b> also join the Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around <b>Yugoslavia.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the championship, {{the captains}} of the United States team (Tom Florie) and <b>Yugoslavia</b> (Milutin Ivković) both {{received}} bronze medals. Yet a FIFA technical committee report on the 1986 World Cup included full retrospective rankings of all teams at all previous World Cup finals; this report ranked the United States third and <b>Yugoslavia</b> fourth, a practice since continued by FIFA. In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of <b>Yugoslavia</b> at the time, claimed that <b>Yugoslavia,</b> as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years. According to this source, <b>Yugoslavia</b> was placed third because of the semi-finals loss to the eventual champions, Uruguay.|$|E

5|$|During {{the breakup}} of <b>Yugoslavia,</b> the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, known {{at the time as}} the Federal Republic of <b>Yugoslavia</b> (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against <b>Yugoslavia</b> in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic relations between the United States and <b>Yugoslavia</b> were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of <b>Yugoslavia.</b> Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} semi-final there were shades of the 1924 Summer Olympics match between <b>Yugoslavia</b> and Uruguay.

Then shortly before half-time <b>Yugoslavia</b> had a goal disallowed by a controversial offside decision. The hosts scored three more {{in the second half}} to win 6–1, Pedro Cea completing a hat-trick.|$|E

50|$|The {{external}} status quo, {{which the}} Communist Party had depended upon to remain viable was thus beginning to disappear. Furthermore, {{the failure of}} communism all over Central and Eastern Europe once again brought <b>Yugoslavia's</b> inner contradictions, economic inefficiencies (such as chronic lack of productivity, fuelled by the country's leaderships' decision to enforce a policy of full employment), and ethno-religious tensions to the surface. <b>Yugoslavia's</b> non-aligned status resulted in access to loans from both superpower blocs. This contact with the United States and the West opened up <b>Yugoslavia's</b> markets sooner {{than the rest of}} Central and Eastern Europe.|$|R

5|$|Serbian–American {{relations}} are bilateral {{relations between the}} governments of Serbia and the United States. They were first established in 1882.

The Socialist Federal Republic of <b>Yugoslavia</b> also participated using the <b>Yugoslavia</b> (YUG) designation, for all Games between 1948–1988. Because of United Nations {{sanctions}} in Security Council Resolution 757, athletes from the Federal Republic of <b>Yugoslavia</b> (Serbia and Montenegro) competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games. They were {{not permitted to}} compete in team sports such as basketball, handball, or water polo, and the Olympic flag was used in medal ceremonies. Athletes from the Republic of Macedonia competed as Independent Olympic Participants (IOP) at the 1992 Games because their NOC had not been formed. The Federal Republic of <b>Yugoslavia</b> (later State Union of Serbia and Montenegro), consisting of the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, participated at the Games of 1996 and 2000 as <b>Yugoslavia</b> (YUG), and at the Games of 2004 as Serbia and Montenegro (SCG). In 2008 and 2012, the former republics of <b>Yugoslavia</b> were represented by six successor NOCs. In 2016, the autonomous province of Kosovo became the seventh successor NOC.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was clear}} that Austria-Hungary had lost World War I, the Austrian {{government}} decided to give Viribus Unitis, along with much of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, to <b>Yugoslavia,</b> the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. This move would have avoided handing the fleet to the Allies, since the new state had declared neutrality. Following the transfer, she was renamed <b>Yugoslavia.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, the United States {{sought to}} take {{advantage}} of the Ottoman Empire's retreat from the Balkans by establishing diplomatic relations with the region's newly emerged nation states, among which was Serbia. The two countries were allies during World War I. After the war, Serbia united with Montenegro and territories previously held by Austria-Hungary to a create a unified South Slavic state that would come to be known as <b>Yugoslavia.</b> The country had diplomatic relations with the United States up to the start of World War II. During World War II in <b>Yugoslavia,</b> the United States supported the Serbian royalist Chetniks over their rivals, the communist Partisans. The Chetniks ultimately lost out to the Partisans and <b>Yugoslavia</b> became a single-party communist state with Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito at its head. In the immediate aftermath of the war, <b>Yugoslavia</b> and the United States had little diplomatic relations. The end of the war also resulted in the mass emigration of refugees from <b>Yugoslavia,</b> many of whom were Serbs that ended up moving to the United States. This helped create the first major Serbian diaspora in the United States. Some of the Serbian refugees who settled in the United States after World War II were anti-communist exiles who attempted to undermine Tito during the Cold War, using the United States as a venue for their anti-communist aims.|$|E

Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with <b>Yugoslavia</b> on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with <b>Yugoslavia.</b> In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
