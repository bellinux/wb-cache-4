500|$|As he {{had with}} Clay, Harrison {{resisted}} pressure from other Whigs over partisan patronage. When a group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from any appointed office, Harrison proclaimed, [...] "So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be guilty of such an iniquity!" [...] Harrison's own cabinet attempted to countermand the president's appointment of John Chambers as Governor of Iowa in favor of Webster's friend, General James Wilson; when Webster attempted to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting, however, Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten note (which said simply [...] "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States"), then announced that [...] "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells <b>you,</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> that, by God, John Chambers shall be governor of Iowa!" ...|$|E
500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure <b>you</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> it is no laughing matter, whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for <b>you</b> <b>gentlemen</b> to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

2500|$|In 220, {{following}} Cao Cao's death, Cao Gun's half-brother Cao Pi usurped {{the throne}} from Emperor Xian, ended the Han dynasty, and established the Cao Wei state with {{himself as the}} new emperor. He enfeoffed Cao Gun as a duke in the following year. When some officials congratulated him on becoming a duke, Cao Gun said, [...] "I've lived in the palace my whole life so I don't understand the hardships faced by the common people and mistakes caused by arrogance and oversight. I hope that <b>you,</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> can also point out my weaknesses apart from simply congratulating me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rather ironically, while Fox {{was being}} denounced {{by many in}} Britain as a Jacobin traitor, across the Channel he {{featured}} on a 1798 list of the Britons to be transported after a successful French invasion of Britain. According to the document, Fox was a [...] "false patriot; having often insulted the French nation in his speeches, and particularly in 1786." [...] According {{to one of his}} biographers, Fox's [...] "loyalties were not national but were offered to people like himself at home or abroad". In 1805 Francis Horner wrote that: [...] "I could name to <b>you</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> with good coats on, and good sense in their own affairs, who believe that Fox...is actually in the pay of France".|$|E

2500|$|As head {{of naval}} logistics, Horne was the Navy's {{principal}} {{point of contact}} for the Truman Committee, a special Senate committee headed by Senator Harry S. Truman that was charged with investigating waste, corruption, and profiteering in the wartime defense industry. Called to testify about alleged waste in the Pacific theater, Horne unapologetically retorted {{that it was impossible}} to run a war effort on that scale without some waste. [...] "I don't deny for a moment that there are billions of dollars worth of materiel out on Pearl Harbor and elsewhere in the Pacific.... But I just have to resolve the balance in favor of giving the commanders what they say they need, and at the same time, I'm fully aware that <b>you</b> <b>gentlemen</b> are interested, as I am, in saving.

I heard that he was trapped by <b>you</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> so I came here to help him. I don't enjoy getting into conflicts, but I enjoy helping others resolve conflicts." [...] He then had a ji erected at {{the gate of the}} camp, and said, [...] "Gentlemen, watch me fire an arrow at {{the lower part of the}} curved blade on the ji. If I hit it in one shot, all of you must withdraw your forces and leave. If I don't, you can remain here and prepare for battle." [...] He then raised his bow and fired an arrow at the ji, hitting exactly the lower part of the curved blade. Everyone present at the scene was shocked. They said, [...] "General, you possess godlike skill!" [...] The following day, they threw another party and then withdrew their forces.|$|E
