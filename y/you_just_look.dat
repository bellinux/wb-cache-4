25|$|The Croydon area {{by itself}} is {{considered}} a fairly safe Labor area. The table to the right shows that when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at the polling booths in the suburb of Croydon, Labor has consistently returned around 60% of the two-party preferred vote even when the first preference votes have fluctuated. The Greens vote, while not as large as {{in other parts of}} the inner-west has been steadily increasing in recent years.|$|E
500|$|Fazekas {{called him}} [...] "a comedy guy, {{who plays the}} lab tech who is kind of disgruntled. He feels like, 'You agents, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> down your nose at the lab techs,' and he’s a thorn in Sousa’s side. He’s so funny because {{everything}} he says is completely earnest, but hilarious. He just annoys everyone ... he also has his little hero moments as well." [...] Butters called Braunger [...] "a great comic addition to our cast." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] cried Mrs. Wragge, cheerfully; [...] "we'll {{have that}} Cashmere Robe to-morrow. Come here! I want to whisper {{something}} to <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at me--I'm {{going to sleep}} crooked, and the captain's not here to bawl at me!" ...|$|R

500|$|Lynch recalls {{having a}} happy childhood, {{although}} {{he suffered from}} bouts of agoraphobia in his youth, especially after having been scared by a screening of Henry King's 1952 film Wait till the Sun Shines, Nellie, when he was six years old. He would develop a brief habit of wearing three [...] neckties at a time, which he understands {{to have been a}} manifestation of his personal insecurity. He also points to a particular image from his childhood that shaped his understanding of the world—" [...] was a dream world, those droning airplanes, blue skies, picket fences, green grass, cherry trees. Middle America as it was supposed to be. But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E
500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, a {{children}} performed a song at a kindergarten graduation ceremony in the West Bank which included these lyrics: [...] "If you stretch your hand, {{it will be}} chopped off. If <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> with your eye, it will be gouged out. ... We come for you before, and woe betide you if we come back again. You come to this land alive, but you will leave it as body part." [...] Yasser Arafat's image accompanied the children on stage as they carried toy guns and wore uniforms. A woman's charity sponsored the ceremony.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hear, hear!" [...] cried Peterkin. [...] "Nobly spoken, Jack!--Hand me {{a drop of}} water, Ralph.--Why, girl, what's {{wrong with}} <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>just</b> like a black owl {{blinking}} in the sunshine!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peg Bowen doesn't need {{to catch}} {{you to do}} things to you," [...] said Peter ominously. [...] "She can put ill-luck on <b>you</b> <b>just</b> by <b>looking</b> at you--and she will if you offend her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't use your eyes," [...] {{retorted}} Harry. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at yonder rock ahead of us, {{and tell me}} what you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, miss, I am sorry, but I am {{not able}} to show you our up-stairs {{department}} to-day, the lift is not working. But I am sure we shall {{be able to find}} something in this room to suit <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> round, my dear, perhaps you will see something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Smoke of life an' snakes of purgatory! Will <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at that! Wood an' water an' grass an' a side-hill! A pocket-hunter's delight an' a cayuse's paradise! Cool {{green for}} tired eyes! Pink pills for pale people ain't in it. A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for tired burros, by damn!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty smiled sardonically. [...] "Oh, yes, I know! Still, it's {{really very}} little--or I wouldn't ask <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> to <b>look</b> after Tom to-morrow. Now, {{he has in}} most ways {{a good deal more}} sense than you----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, gentlemen, if {{you will}} take my advice <b>you</b> will <b>just</b> <b>look</b> round, and then go below and turn in. Now you can do so easily. Another hour, {{and there will be}} no keeping a footing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Can I be so changed? Look at me. Or is it I who am mistaken?--Are you not, sir, Henry Roberts, {{forwarding}} merchant, of Wheeling, Pennsylvania? Pray, now, {{if you use}} {{the advertisement}} of business cards, and happen to have one with <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it, and see whether you are not the man I take you for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will try, mother. Will <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> {{outside the}} door and see if Denis is there? Denis, this is my mother," [...] he said as the soldier came in. [...] "She has come over to help nurse me; and as she will be principally {{with me in the}} daytime, you will be at liberty to be out {{whenever}} you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those are {{the kind}} of folks I {{practise}} among, good share of the time. Nels Erdstrom, fine clean young Svenska. He'll have a corking farm in ten years, but now----I operated his wife on a kitchen table, with my driver giving the anesthetic. Look at that scared baby! Needs some woman with hands like yours.

6000|$|... "I s’pose he’ll be all right," [...] {{said the}} skipper, uneasily; [...] "there’s {{food and a}} bed down the fo’c’s’le. <b>You</b> might <b>just</b> <b>look</b> round to-night and see he’s safe. I expect we’ll have {{to take him back}} to London with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, no!" [...] said Father Keon, {{speaking}} in a discreet, indulgent, velvety voice. [...] "Don't let me disturb <b>you</b> now! I'm <b>just</b> <b>looking</b> for Mr. Fanning...." ...|$|R
6000|$|And Elma {{answered}} with bated breath, in almost inarticulate tones, [...] "Don't you see? Don't <b>you</b> see, mother? <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> at the judge! It's himself! It's Sir Gilbert!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, of course. Here {{we are in}} a {{state where}} no licence is required, a {{minister}} in the house, and you all dressed in the most beautiful wedding silk imaginable. You must see, if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it calmly, how much better it will be than going up to Mrs. Kemble's and thereby publishing your difference with Louisa to all the village. I'll give you fifteen minutes {{to get used to the}} idea and then I'll call Jim down." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{produced}} {{a letter from}} his pocket. 'Don't you bar chaps who show you their letters?' he said. 'This was written by an aunt of mine. I don't want to inflict the whole lot on <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> at line four. You see what she says: [...] "A boy is coming to Mr Leicester's House this term, whom I particularly wish you to befriend. He {{is the son of}} a great friend of a friend of mine, and is a nice, bright little fellow, very jolly and full of spirits."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By gad, sir, I {{sometimes}} dream, now, {{that the}} Doctor's walking into me," [...] Foker continued (and Pen {{smiled as he}} thought that he himself had likewise fearful dreams of this nature). [...] "When I think of the diet there, by gad, sir, I wonder how I stood it. Mangy mutton, brutal beef; pudding on Thursdays and Sundays, and that fit to poison <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> at my leader--did you ever see a prettier animal? Drove over from Baymouth. Came the nine mile in two-and-forty minutes. Not bad going, sir." ...|$|E
5000|$|He cites {{childhood}} experiences birdwatching for {{reed warbler}} {{with his father}} {{as the starting point}} for his interest in sound in space. He has stated, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>looked</b> in the reeds you'd see nothing. If you listened you got an idea of space and a sense of where it might be, then you understood it. That's probably my first experience with these ideas of space and sound, which are basically the fundamental building blocks of what I've been interested in since then." [...] These experiences have led to a long engagement with field recordings, and more recently the development of theoretical approaches to the practice including his Relational Listening theory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>just</b> lovely!" [...] exclaimed Florence, impulsively, as {{she gazed}} wide-eyed up at Madeline. [...] "And somehow so different!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why did you {{slip away}} by stealth like this?" [...] said d'Urberville, with upbraiding breathlessness; [...] "on a Sunday morning, too, {{when people were}} all in bed! I only {{discovered}} it by accident, and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>look</b> at the mare. Why go off like this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how unnecessary {{it has been for}} you to toil along on foot, and encumber yourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't come back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where was I {{to get a}} young lady--just {{outside of}} my own class? There was Miss Puffle. I did think of her. But just at the moment she went off with young Tazlehurst. That was another misfortune. Why should Miss Puffle have descended so low just before I had thought of her? And I couldn't marry quite a young girl. How could I expect such a one to live here with me at Buston, where it is rather dull? When I looked about there was nobody except that horrid Miss Thoroughbung. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> about and tell me {{if there was any}} one else. Of course my circle is circumscribed. I have been very careful whom I have {{admitted}} to my intimacy, and the result is that I know almost nobody. I may say that I was driven to ask Miss Thoroughbung." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another {{thing that}} troubled Polly was her clothes, for, {{though no one}} said anything, she knew they were very plain; and now and then she wished that her blue and mouse colored merinos were rather more trimmed, her sashes had bigger bows, and her little ruffles more lace on them. She sighed for a locket, and, {{for the first time}} in her life, thought seriously of turning up her pretty curls and putting on a [...] "wad." [...] She kept these discontents to herself, however, after she had written to ask her mother if she might have her best dress altered like Fanny's, and {{received}} this reply: [...] "No, dear; the dress is proper and becoming as it is, and the old fashion of simplicity the best for all of us. I don't want my Polly to be loved for her clothes, but for herself; so wear the plain frocks mother took such pleasure in making for you, and let the panniers go. The least of us have some influence in this big world; and perhaps my little girl can do some good by showing others that a contented heart and a happy face are better ornaments than any Paris can give her. You want a locket, deary; so I send one that my mother gave me years ago. You will find father's face on one side, mine on the other; and when things trouble <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at your talisman, and I think the sunshine will come back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now, my lads,” shouted Will, “break {{open the}} doors of those storehouses; there {{is not likely to}} be much that is of value in the huts. You had better take four men, Dimchurch, and set fire to them all; of course <b>you</b> can <b>just</b> <b>look</b> in and see if there is {{anything}} worth taking before you apply a light.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gee, George, who'd {{have thought}} it! Fancy you {{being one of}} the high-brows! You ought to hang out a sign. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>just</b> ordinary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, noble tars," [...] {{said the}} auctioneer, [...] "you may well stare at it; {{you will not}} find another jacket like this {{on either side of}} Cape Horn, I assure <b>you.</b> Why, <b>just</b> <b>look</b> at it! How much, now? Give me a bid--but don't be rash; be prudent, be prudent, men; {{remember}} your Purser's accounts, and don't be betrayed into extravagant bids." ...|$|R
