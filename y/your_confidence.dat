The two men met for an hour at Voorhis's office and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends.

Thanks... God bless you." ...|$|E
500|$|Former congressman Hoeppel, who {{gathered}} just over {{one percent of}} the vote, wrote Nixon after the election, stating that he had never expected to win, and that his purpose had been [...] "to expose what I considered to be the alien-minded, un-American, PAC, Red, congressional record of the Democratic incumbent". [...] Despite any hard feelings, Voorhis sent Nixon a letter of congratulations in early December 1946. Nixon and Voorhis met for an hour at Voorhis's office, and parted, according to Voorhis, as friends. In 1971, Voorhis said that the two had never spoken again. [...] Voorhis's final letter as a congressman, written on December 31, was to his father, who had been his political adviser throughout his congressional career.

[...] "I {{have no reason}} for disliking Mr. Thurston; indeed, I do not dislike him and my feeling may be mere jealousy. You give--him--most of <b>your</b> <b>confidences</b> now, and I should hate anybody who divided you from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I am on {{the right}} track at last," [...] said the man. [...] "And since you have told me so much I will return <b>your</b> <b>confidences</b> by stating that I am a Secret Service officer. We had an idea that the Germans might try {{something}} of that sort in this vicinity, and I am pretty sure now that we are {{on the right track}}." ...|$|R
500|$|Armstrong {{would later}} declare his {{candidacy}} {{for that particular}} election (the Edmonton municipal election, February 1912), for the position of what {{was referred to as}} the first mayor of [...] "Greater Edmonton" [...] Stating that in his belief, 1911 {{was one of the most}} successful years in the history of the city, he ran on the premise that he had unfinished work from his first term, stating, [...] "I ask for a continuance of <b>your</b> <b>confidence,</b> support and influence to allow me an opportunity to complete those undertakings which are in the best interests of Greater Edmonton". His opponent, Bryce J. Saunders charged that the city had long lacked efficiency in its utilities, particular the water supply, which he believed in the public ownership of. Armstrong would later go on to defeat Saunders in the general election, 1791 votes to Saunders' 1072, a margin of just over 700, with a voter turnout of around 30 percent.|$|E
500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, it was something to savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does a lot for <b>your</b> <b>confidence,</b> even an ageing Nash." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{you lose}} <b>your</b> <b>confidence</b> you don't want to bowl again. When I {{went on the}} West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in {{first-class}} games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When you lose <b>your</b> <b>confidence</b> it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] I was pleased to get back home.|$|E

"Awful crimes, no doubt; {{but he did}} {{not tell}} me what: there, you know, the seal of the confessional checked his garrulity, and my curiosity. <b>Your</b> <b>confidences,</b> however, had not made an enemy of the good father; it seems he was so struck, and felt so sorry that you should be out on such a night alone, that he had esteemed it a Christian duty to watch you when you quitted the church, and so to manage as not to lose sight of you, till you should have reached home.
