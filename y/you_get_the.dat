5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not {{know as much as}} I do and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> opening advantage not only do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E

In 1984, he {{developed}} the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire, a widely-used screening tool for seasonality. As a result of his research and publications, [...] "it is now widely acknowledged that winter depression has a sound medical basis, involving changes in the body's mood centers" [...] associated with exposure to light.

500|$|Lou Reed, {{who wrote}} the {{majority}} of the album's lyrics, never intended to write about such topics for shock value. Reed, a fan of poets and authors such as Raymond Chandler, Nelson Algren, William S.

An English major who studied for a B.A. at Syracuse University, Reed {{said in an interview that}} he thought joining the two (gritty subject matter and music) was [...] "obvious".

500|$|Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin, {{a cynical}} red dwarf. Dinklage was Adamson and Johnson's first choice, having {{seen him in}} The Station Agent. He {{accepted}} because [...] "often, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hero and the villain and not much in between. Trumpkin is in between. He is not a lovable Snow White dwarf. Audiences appreciate these cynical characters. It helps parents and adults {{to go along with}} the journey." [...] Dinklage's prosthetics took three hours to apply, and restricted his performance to his eyes. Even his frown was built into the make-up. On his first day of filming, he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river. [...] "We were lucky that he returned after his first day!" [...] recalled Johnson.|$|E
500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens you up for so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> idea that through tragedy something good will come.

500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E

500|$|... "Better Off This Way" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} written for the album, and re-written [...] "at least 3 {{different}} times". The song was the final one finished for the album. The title for [...] "All Signs Point to Lauderdale" [...] came from an occasion when McKinnon and bassist Joshua Woodard were in a rough neighborhood in West Palm Beach, Florida. A piece of the song came from a recording session for Homesick when Gilbert said he had an idea for the melody, which McKinnon took a while to write over: [...] "Chad had a cool idea, vocally, for something". In an interview with PopCrush in 2011, McKinnon said the song was when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> [...] "feeling like you're stuck in a place that's leading you nowhere" [...] and [...] "standing up for yourself and taking charge of your life." [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] was written with the band's former guitarist, Tom Denney; the song was made up of several separate pieces from different song ideas, with a chorus McKinnon had re-written 4 times.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older <b>you</b> <b>get,</b> <b>the</b> worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

Christman eventually got on a flight to Tampa, Florida, but was met at the gate when she arrived by agents of Scientology. Tampa police were notified, and escorted Christman safely away from the Scientologists. While a member of Scientology, Christman had given over $1 million to the organization; she used her inheritance money to pay for coursework. She commented to the St. Petersburg Times of Florida about the thought process she underwent after leaving the organization, [...] "When you get out and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> whole thing, you're like, 'What was I thinking?'. I know the people inside are brainwashed and they're laughing at me. But to me, the truth is, I'm free. I can do what I want. I can say what I want." ...|$|E
