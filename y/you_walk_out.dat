2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Don’t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "You’re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there. And when <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of that room, feel good that you got it all out there." [...] So that was sound advice, and I did put it all out there.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1978 Forster's first {{recorded}} work was the group's debut single, [...] "Lee Remick", {{which appeared in}} September. It was a paean to the Hollywood actress of the same name. Forster later recalled [...] "I didn't have a girlfriend or any sort of romantic side to my life ... I {{wanted to write a}} love song. But who was I in love with? No-one. I had to find someone and I found Lee Remick". He also wrote the B-side, [...] "Karen", as an ode to the university's library staff, [...] "here was kindness in the library, then <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of the library into the harsh real world". Forster then wrote their second single, [...] "People Say". According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, both singles were [...] "sparsely produced, poorly played yet passionately performed folksy, post-punk pop songs. They were sunny, catchy and hopelessly romantic, earning the band immediate local and international acclaim".|$|E

2500|$|Monica Denise Brown (née Arnold; born October 24, 1980), simply {{known as}} Monica, is an American singer, songwriter, producer, and actress. Born {{and raised in}} College Park, Georgia, she began {{performing}} {{as a child and}} became part of a traveling gospel choir at the age of ten. She rose to prominence after releasing her debut studio album, Miss Thang, in 1995. It went multiplatinum, while its first two singles, [...] "Don't Take It Personal" [...] and [...] "Before <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>Out</b> of My Life", made her the youngest recording act to ever have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the Billboard Top R Singles chart. In 1998, Monica's second album, The Boy Is Mine, earned her major international chart success. Pushed by its Grammy Award-winning number-one hit title track, a duet with singer Brandy, it spawned two further Billboard Hot 100 chart-toppers, [...] "The First Night" [...] and [...] "Angel of Mine", and established her position {{as one of the most}} successful urban R female vocalists to emerge in the mid to late-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, {{at the age}} of eleven, Monica was {{discovered}} by music producer Dallas Austin at the Center Stage auditorium in Atlanta performing Whitney Houston 1986's [...] "Greatest Love of All". Amazed by her voice, Dallas offered her a record deal with his Arista Records-distributed label Rowdy Records and consulted rapper Queen Latifah to work as Monica's first manager. Shortly afterwards Dallas and then staff producers Tim & Bob entered the studio with Monica to start writing and producing her debut Miss Thang which was eventually released in July 1995 and scored number thirty-six on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number seven on the Top R Albums chart. It was certified triple platinum by the RIAA for more than three million store-shipped copies and produced three top ten singles, including debut single [...] "Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)" [...] and [...] "Before <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> <b>Out</b> of My Life", both of which made Monica the youngest artist ever to have two consecutive chart-topping hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot R Singles chart. Miss Thang subsequently won Monica a Billboard Music Award and garnered her an American Music Award nomination in the Favorite Soul/R New Artist category.|$|E

60|$|I {{could have}} waited patiently {{for a long}} time indulging the {{thoughts}} which the place called up. In a few minutes, however, I heard steps in the entry, the door was opened, and Wordsworth came in, it could be no other--- a tall figure, a little bent with age, his hair thin and grey, and his face deeply wrinkled.... The expression of his countenance was sad, mournful I might say; he seemed one on whom sorrow pressed heavily. He gave me his hand, and welcomed me cordially, though without smiling. 'Will <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out,</b> Sir, and join us at the table?' said he. 'I am engaged to dine elsewhere.' 'But you can sit with us,' said he; so, leading the way, he conducted me to the dining-room. At {{the head of the table}} sat Mrs. Wordsworth, and their three grandchildren made up the party.... It was a humble apartment, not ceiled, the rafters being visible; having a large old-fashioned chimney-place, with a high mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|The hamlet {{behind is}} one of the least {{considerable}} of hamlets, and consists of a few cottages on a green beside a burn. Some of them (a strange thing in Scotland) are models of internal neatness; the beds adorned with patchwork, the shelves arrayed with willow-pattern plates, the floors and tables bright with scrubbing or pipe-clay, and the very kettle polished like silver. It is the sign of a contented old age in country places, where there is little matter for gossip and no street sights. Housework becomes an art; and at evening, when the cottage interior shines and twinkles in the glow of the fire, the housewife folds her hands and contemplates her finished picture; the snow and the wind may do their worst, she has made herself a pleasant corner in the world. The city might be a thousand miles away, and yet it was from close by that Mr. Bough painted the distant view of Edinburgh which has been engraved for this collection; and you have only to look at the etching, {118} to see how near it is at hand. But hills and hill people are not easily sophisticated; and if <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> here on a summer Sunday, it is as like as not the shepherd may set his dogs upon you. But keep an unmoved countenance; they look formidable at the charge, but their hearts are in the right place, and they will only bark and sprawl about you on the grass, unmindful of their master’s excitations.|$|E
