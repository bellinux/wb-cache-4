2500|$|In this children's spoof show on CBBC, three {{sketches}} spoofing Doctor Who are shown. The first {{begins with}} the Doctor and Rose {{stepping out of the}} TARDIS into a darkened room. The Doctor, using his Sonic Screwdriver as a torch, reveals several aliens who are all blasted by Rose's ray gun. The Doctor then turns on the light and sees that they have materialised at a child dress-up party. The child then comes in. The Doctor and Rose wish him a happy birthday. He calls them to get a doctor. [...] "Funny <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that" [...] says the Doctor.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Sparks {{had been}} {{wrapping}} up The Lucky One {{and beginning to}} ponder an original plot for his next book. The author told himself he could [...] "either go younger than 20 or older than 50", having recently written about every age in between. Wary of venturing above 50 again after his best-seller The Notebook, Sparks had already been leaning toward writing a teenage story when he {{received a phone call}} from Gibgot on behalf of the film in August 2008. Sparks recalled, [...] "Jennifer asked if I had anything laying around? I said no, but funny <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that…" [...] Sparks returned with a premise by the end of July 2008. Once the proposal had been agreed upon by Cyrus, her family, and Offspring Entertainment, Sparks, with the aid of co-screenplay writer Jeff Van Wie, completed the screenplay before starting the book. Sparks explained that such an arrangement was necessary in order to accommodate filming in summer 2009, as Disney had scheduled, but that [...] "this is similar to the way it’s gone with movies based on my novels; it’s just out of order." [...] Sparks and Van Wie completed the first draft of the screenplay in December 2008, the first rewrite later that month, and the second and final rewrite in January 2009. Both rewrites took approximately one or two days, and Sparks found them relatively simple. The finished screenplay was approximately 100 pages long. While The Last Song is not the first screenplay Sparks has written, it is his first to be optioned for film. The novel was completed in June 2009, the same time shooting for the film began, and was published on September 8, 2009 by Grand Central Publishing. The plot of the film and novel remained secret throughout development.|$|E

5000|$|Carton's book No {{is a love}} word {{offers a}} seven-part formula for {{learning}} the three No's <b>you</b> <b>should</b> never <b>say</b> to children, and the four No's <b>you</b> <b>should</b> always <b>say.</b> It teaches parents to get the [...] "No"-how, {{and learn how to}} say it fairly, firmly, calmly and consistently.|$|R

6000|$|... "He didn't mean {{anything}} of that kind, Emily. You know he did not, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> so. It would be too horrible to think of." ...|$|R
6000|$|I think Elsie {{was quite}} shocked that I should apply these terms to a {{courtesy}} lord, {{the eldest son}} of a peer. Nature had endowed her with the profound British belief that peers should be spoken of in choice and peculiar language. 'If a peer's a fool,' Lady Georgina said once to me, 'people think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> his temperament does not fit him {{for the conduct of}} affairs: if he's a roué or a drunkard, they think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> he has unfortunate weaknesses.' ...|$|E
60|$|EVE. That is {{just what}} I feel; {{but it is very}} strange that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> so: there is no {{pleasing}} you. You change your mind so often.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> this," [...] Virginia answered. [...] "I find my uncle {{very easy to}} get on with so long as he is obeyed." ...|$|E
60|$|FAITH. Nay, hold, let us {{consider}} of one at once. I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>say,</b> It shows itself by inclining the soul to abhor its sin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother, {{there can}} have been {{nothing of the}} kind. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> such things. The Lord in his {{providence}} allows us no foreshadowing of that kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush! <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> such things, Pigott! Now I {{will tell}} you something; I am going on to ask your master {{to allow me to}} educate Angela." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Till {{this gentleman}} marches with the flower of France against our old enemy of England, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> father, {{and helps to}} show them another Bannockburn on Loire-side." ...|$|E
6000|$|My uncle visibly reared at the affront. [...] "I'm {{sorry you}} should think so," [...] said he, [...] "and still more sorry <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> so before present company." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have a {{right that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that--I {{have a right}} that you should always say it. I think he has behaved very foolishly, but I don't blame him----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, {{you tell}} it your own way," [...] {{suggested}} the bewildered Clodd. [...] "If it was anyone else but <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> didn't know your own business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot think that, mademoiselle. From what I saw of <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> {{would have}} {{resisted}} all threats, and even undergone hopeless imprisonment, rather than yield." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you mean by {{everything}}. It is a very little everything to <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say.</b> I do not quite understand your everything and your everybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's extraordinary," [...] replied Chiltern, slowly, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> this to me. It is what I {{have come}} to believe, but I couldn't have said it half so well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Since {{you came}} ashore, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say.</b> But come, Dick," [...] said Charlie, [...] "let's {{hear about this}} {{wonderful}} shooting. I'm sure it will amuse Buck--unless he's too wearied to listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas, that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> so! No {{wonder the}} days of Cressy and Agincourt are no more, when respect for ancient valour has died away in the breasts of the British soldiery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't send me away so soon, Arthur," [...] she returned. [...] "What {{is it that}} I {{could not}} forgive? <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> that before you put me to the test." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, sir, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> that; <b>you</b> {{were led}} {{there by the}} hand of God. But {{tell me how you}} came to be in the wood, and pray omit nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Neumann. Fy, fy! <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say</b> so, friend. There are [...] {{among them}} our very best generals, {{and those on}} whom the [...] Duke at this moment relies the most. [...] 120 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that, papa," [...] she declared. [...] "Mary {{knows nothing about}} society, and she has no friends {{who would be the}} least use to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But--am I--the fact is, Dick, I feel {{a little}} sore that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> ye had a likin' for me, an' then tell me I must be off, an' never look near ye again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Them {{diamonds}} is gone {{where none}} of you can get at 'em. That five hundred pounds as the lawyers 'ave offered is just nowhere. If you want information, Mr. 'Oward, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> information." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, how can't <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say?</b> We {{are both}} in the same ship. I love Paula, you love Mr. Somerset; it behoves both of us {{to see that this}} flirtation of theirs ends in nothing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "After a {{time you}} can open your eyes," [...] went on his instructor; [...] "then, if I were <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say,</b> ’Good-bye, Venia,’ and close ’em again. Work it up affecting, and send {{messages}} to your aunts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well,' said Faith. 'I {{will not}} depress you. If I had to {{describe}} <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> {{were a child}} in your impulses, and {{an old man in}} your reflections. Have you considered when we shall start?' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{smiled again}} as she {{answered}} him: [...] "Yes; {{if you make}} up your mind to do as Sir Harry asks you, I will write a draft of what I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] replied Morris, [...] "though I don't {{quite know}} why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that. I am always {{about the place}} if you want me." [...] But in his heart he groaned, {{guessing}} what was coming.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{strange that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>say</b> that, because {{just before you}} {{came out of the}} house I was {{thinking}} that I'd sat still long enough. It's a thing that gets monotonous. One must keep going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know one}} thing about you, and that is enough for me. I know I love you!" [...] he said. [...] "Margaret, can't you care for me a little? Don't tell me {{anything}} <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>say.</b> I'm not curious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now tell {{me exactly}} what it is you want," [...] she said. [...] "You cannot expect to be asked to take tea with the sisters, you know, though I see no reason why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not. <b>Say</b> what they will, they are not nuns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my dear young lady, let us come to business." [...] His {{large face}} broadened into a smile. [...] "You want work? Well, I {{have work to}} offer <b>you.</b> What <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> now to L100 down, and all {{expenses}} paid?" [...] Mr. Whittington {{leaned back in his}} chair, and thrust his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat.|$|R
