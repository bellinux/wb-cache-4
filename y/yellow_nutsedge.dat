40|$|Weed {{control in}} the absence of methyl bromide is a major concern to {{vegetable}} producers. Losses in fresh market tomatoes in Florida due to weed pressure, with methyl bromide available, have been estimated at more than US$ 291 million (Bridges, 1992). In the absence of methyl bromide, these losses are likely to increase. Alternative soil disinfestation methods have been tested in several locations throughout Florida and a few methods have provided adequate control of some weeds. <b>Yellow</b> and purple <b>nutsedge</b> have been the focus of several studies and are the most significant weed problems facing growers immediately after cessation of methyl bromide use. However, a greater diversity of weed problems is expected to develop without the broad-spectrum activity of methyl bromide. Studies were conducted to identify what weed problems arise with the use of alternative soil disinfestation practices in production fields. Nutsedges (Cyperus spp.), pigweeds (Amaranthus spp.), grass weeds belonging to several genera, and purslane (Portulaca spp.) were among the most commonly occurring weeds in plots treated with various alternative fumigants and soil solarization. Fungal biological control agents for these weeds were either already under development or were sought...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of StatisticsLeigh MurrayAn {{experiment}} {{was performed in}} 2005 - 2006 {{to determine if the}} variety of an alfalfa (Medicago sativa) crop rotation can effectively reduce the pest complex consisting of the <b>yellow</b> and purple <b>nutsedge</b> (YNS & PNS) weeds and the southern root-knot nematode (SRKN). During the 2005 - 2006 growing season, six months were selected to take samples from the alfalfa field (three months in 2005 and three months in 2006). The field was divided into 1 m x 2 m quadrats. Each month eighty quadrats were randomly selected. The counts of PNS, YNS and a soil sample (analyzed for the count of juvenile SRKN) were taken from each quadrat. In this study, two different ways were examined use [i. e. using] spatial information provided from the experiment to alter the original model. First spatial information was treated as fixed effects. Second spatial information was treated as random effects by modifying the residual variance matrix using various “spatial” variance-covariance structures. The results were compared to the original Poisson model and the spatial models to each other but did not have an effective way of comparing random effects models with the fixed effects models. For this data, the use of spatial statistics did not improve the original model consistently. This may be partly {{because of the nature of}} the experiment.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of methyl bromide (MeBr) {{has been a}} hot topic for policymakers {{for more than a}} decade. As a result, of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, signatory nations began implementing guidelines aimed at reducing or eliminating a variety of toxic substances, including MeBr, which has been identified as one of the toxic contributors to ozone depletion. In 1997 the Ninth Meeting of the Parties in Montreal recommended an accelerated phase-out schedule for MeBr. The accelerated phase-out program is a major concern to most U. S. farmers, and in particular to farmers in Georgia, where the product is used not only as an important soil fumigant but also to control both the <b>yellow</b> and purple <b>nutsedge</b> (Cyperus sp.). Furthermore, this chemical is used for the production of most of Georgia's economically important vegetable crops such as cucumber, eggplant, green pepper, tomato, squash, and zucchini. If MeBr is phased out without alternatives, the production of these crops will be impossible under Georgia weather conditions. The adverse economic impact to the State of Georgia will be devastating. Although most of the data used in previous economic-impact analyses regarding the {{elimination of}} MeBr has been obtained through the testing of tomatoes and strawberries in Florida and California, this study-which focuses on bell pepper production-is aimed at evaluating the economics of three alternative fumigants and herbicides and determining which alternative will provide the best yield, quality, and profitability for bell pepper in the absence of MeBr.

MSMA products are unique in that they combine selectivity, low weed-resistance, and cost-efficiency.MSMA is an herbicide used to control a wide spectrum of hard to control grass and broad-leaf weeds including some weeds that are resistant to the herbicide Glyphosate.MSMA products are effective, cost efficient and selective. Weed-resistance to herbicides is on the rise due to both the repeated use of the herbicides and the introduction of genetically modified crops. These crops are endowed with natural resistance to certain herbicides, a resistance which they may impart to non-crops through cross pollination. There are very few, if any, new herbicides capable of economically combating the resistance problem. With the exception of isolated cases of common cocklebur Xanthium strumarium, no resistance build-up has occurred with the weeds that MSMA controls.MSMA provide post-emergent selective annual grass and <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> control, in cool season [...] MSMA is an effective treatment to control Convolvulaceae (morning glory) and Cyperus rotundus (nutgrass).

The application of naptalam to <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> plants increased the number of new shoots produced by the weed when the herbicide was applied to the soil, through a liquid growth medium, or as a topical spray. The {{increase in the number of}} new shoots in naptalam-treated plants was due to the transformation of rhizomes to shoots and to an increase in the number of rhizomes produced. Growth of naptalamtreated plants was inhibited. Split topical applications of naptalam proved to be more effective in producing new shoots than single topical applications. There was no difference in the number of new shoots produced by plants treated with either single or split soil applications except at the highest concentration where the split application resulted in more new shoots than the single application. Results of experiments conducted in growth chambers showed that naptalam- treated plants produced more new shoots than untreated plants when grown under a 20 -hour photoperiod. Growing the plants under short day conditions (10 to 12 -hour photoperiod) induced tuber production but this was inhibited by naptalam application. The application of nitrogen to naptalam- treated plants grown under long day conditions increased the dry weight of new shoots produced by the plants. Naptalam was more effective in inducing the production of new shoots in younger plants than in older ones. Glyphosate was more effective for reduction of shoot growth of younger <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> plants than of older ones. There were no significant differences in dry weights of shoots of the plants when split and single topical applications were compared. Tubers produced by glyphosate-treated plants sprouted less than tubers produced by the untreated plants. Glyphosate appeared to make the tubers dormant at the lower rates and to kill many of them at the higher rates. However, over 50 percent of the tubers were not killed and were still capable of regeneration. It was more advantageous to apply glyphosate to <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> plants after naptalam treatment than to apply the two herbicides simultaneously. Simultaneous application of naptalam and glyphosate delayed the production of naptalam-induced new shoots because glyphosate was preferentially translocated to the rhizomes that were being transformed to shoots and inhibited their growth. On the other hand, application of glyphosate 1 to 4 weeks after naptalam treatment resulted in a synergistic effect on the <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> plants. The application of naptalam followed by glyphosate was superior to either glyphosate or naptalam alone in reducing the number of tubers produced by regrowth of <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> plants. There was a marked reduction in the total number of rhizomes and tubers of plants treated with naptalam followed by glyphosate indicating that most of the rhizomes that were transformed to shoots by the naptalam treatment were killed by the glyphosate spray. Based on the findings of this study, a spray program using naptalam and glyphosate to provide improved control of <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> appears possible...|$|E

40|$|Permit, {{containing}} {{the active ingredient}} halosulfuron (750 g/kg WG) is a new herbicide in maize. It is listed in Annex I since October 2013. Permit plays a special role when dealing with the hard to control weed <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> (Cyperus esculentus). <b>Yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> is an invasive plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae (sedges). Specific graminicides used to control Poaceae (sweet grasses) are not effective against Cyperacea. Propagation is rapid and occurs exclusively via tubers formed in the soil. Affected areas in Germany grow rapidly, especially in Lower-Saxony. Application rates from 30 - 50 g/ha Permit were tested in solo or split application in 7 trials to control Cyperus esculentus in maize. Application timing proved critical for successful control. High levels of control were achieved with 30 - 50 g/ha Permit with single applications at BBCH 16 (efficacy 94 - 98 %) {{as well as with}} split applications at BBCH 14 and 16 of the crop (efficacy 94 - 99 %). Because <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> often emerges in multiple waves, the split application provides more reliable control. Permit offers new opportunities to effectively control Cyperus esculentus in maize and thus closes an important gap in the weed spectrum of currently available maize herbicides...|$|E
40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> (Cyperus esculentus L.) {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1981 as an agricultural pest. A {{considerable number of}} fields {{was found to be}} infested. Because the species is very damaging to agriculture legal measures were taken to restrict the dispersion and promote the control of the weed.

After 1985 the legal measures led to a decline of the species; however, the eradication was not successful on the national level.

Nematode reproduction on nutsedges and associated chile pepper plants varied among years, possibly due to differing levels of tuber infection or soil temperature, but was not affected by fumigation.

40|$|In This Issue: Herbicide Injury-Replant? Yellow Nutseoge Control in Turf Delayed Preemergence Herbicides Herbicide Injury-Replant? There is {{some risk}} of crop 1 nJury {{with the use}} of any herbicide. Certain {{herbicides}} are more likely to injure crops than others. Reasons for herbicide injury include incorrect application rate, nonuniform application (overlapping), herbicide carryover, incorrect choice of herbicide for the situation, unfavorable weather conditions, spray drift, etc. <b>Yellow</b> <b>Nutsedge</b> Control in Turf <b>Yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> {{is one of the most}} troublesome weeds in lawns. Basagran is the safest and most effective herbicide for <b>yellow</b> <b>nutsedge</b> control. Mix 1 oz. /gal of water along with an equal amount of surfactant or detergent and apply to vigorous growing plants. If desired control is not obtained with the first application, make additional applications at 10 to 14 day intervals. Because nutsedge can germinate later in the season, additional applications are usually required. As with all postemergence treatments, applications should be made to unmowed turf and mowings made after herbicide treatments should be delayed for 3 to 5 days. Delayed Preemergence Herbicides Timely herbicide application is not always possible in the busy planting season. Some but not all preemergence herbicides can be applied early postemergence with good results. However, most of these treatments are more effective when applied preemergence than postemergence especially against annual grasses. A rain or sprinkler irrigation is required after application for best control. The following table lists herbicides that are commonly used in Nebraska and can be used both preemergence and early postemergence...|$|E
