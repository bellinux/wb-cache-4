Producer John Williamson stated in an interview, [...] "I thought, just based on everything I always read online, {{that it would never}} get through, but it went through on the first pass." [...] Williamson attempted to justify the release of the game by noting the intellectual elements of both the game and the film franchise. He pointed out: I think they reviewed the game based on everything that was in it, not just on a couple of minutes of it, just like the Saw movies themselves aren't really pure torture porn.

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire {{to know what was going}} to happen combined with my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books.

500|$|... "We {{did a lot}} of work on {{character}} and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation," [...] Hui noted. [...] "In Antz, we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In Shrek, we applied that to whole body. So, if <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>attention</b> to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us {{a long time to get}} right." [...] One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a Chia Pet. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.). It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the Shrek movie including grass, moss, beards, eyebrows, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the lighting and visual effects teams.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Music, Madonna had enlisted Ahmadzaï {{also as a}} {{songwriter}} on American Life hence what transpired was Madonna's wholesale adaptation of the producers style and sound. He explained {{that there are some}} influences from his work, but Madonna mostly wanted a minimalist structure for the album. This was beneficial for him since he did not like working with a lot of people, and hence it became a close collaboration. Since electronic music was already popular, Ahmadzaï felt that it was necessary to go back to its underground roots and focus on the songwriting, rather than the technical aspects of recording and mixing. Describing it as modified songwriting, he said that although the concept [...] "might sound simple at first, even rough. But when <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>attention,</b> {{there is a lot of}} technology underneath". This approach was an imperative for American Life. Recorded at three different studios using Ahmadzaï's own gear along with the studio's SSL mixing consoles, the album's recording process was often laborious but was sparse in the musical arrangements of the songs. About the musical composition, Ahmadzaï told to Remix magazine that they [...] "tried to under-produce many tracks to make them sound rougher than the average international pop production. We wanted to do something totally modern and futuristic but not very apparent. You have to be very minimalist and choose every sound very carefully. Some tracks were composed in the big studio; that can be very dangerous because you can lose perspective. But all initial directions of the tracks were made in my home studio." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eikev in [...] {{is given}} a {{conditional}} meaning in some English translations ('if') and a consequential meaning in other translations ('because').

The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges argues that 'because' is a better translation [...] and the Pulpit Commentary notes that 'the Hebrew conveys the idea of a reward as consequent on their hearkening; as there would be retribution for transgression, so would there be recompense for obedience'. The Jerusalem Bible reflects this 'recompense' interpretation in its translation: [...] "Listen to these ordinances, be true to them and observe them, and in return Yahweh your God will be true to the covenant and love which he promised on oath to your ancestors".|$|E

Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As far as I could see, he followed the book on how to win an election. I saw him on the campaign trail more than anybody. He was out door-to-door; he had impressive literature. He wanted it." [...] Ali ascribed his electoral victory to connecting with voters. [...] "Our campaign had a lot of energy. It had that underdog feel that struck a chord with people and resonated.

[...] She is the supplement to me, and hence when I am separated from her, as I am now, I suffer absurdly from being obliged to think about my own affairs; I would rather have to chop wood all day.... My children ought to kiss her very steps; for my part, I have no gift for education. She has such a gift, that I look upon it as nothing less than the eighth endowment of the Holy Ghost; I mean a certain fond persecution by which it is given her to torment her children from morning to night to do something, not to do something, to learn--and yet without for a moment losing their tender affection for her. How can she manage it? I cannot make it out.' She was laughingly called by himself and her friends, Madame Prudence.
