25|$|I've {{heard it}} {{said of the}} NDP that we are too {{attached}} to the past, but I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> our political opponents who are the Jurassic Park of Canadian politics. They would {{take us back to}} a meaner time when money was the measure of all things. We stand for the future that was sought and won and which must now be defended and enhanced.|$|E
25|$|The natives, whose {{presence}} causes so much disgust to you, often {{take pride in}} {{the fact that they are}} Italian subjects. In Libya, Somalia and in the recent war against their homeland, in foreign struggles, they have shielded you with their bodies, and sometimes paid with their lives. I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no exaggeration to say that the natives provided you the means with which you could overcome. The misinterpretation of so many merits and acts of heroism carried out for Italy can only be indicative of an essentially alien and imperial government.|$|E
500|$|Gingrich {{has taken}} a {{diminutive}} view of internationalism and the United Nations. He said in 2015, [...] "after several years {{of looking at the}} UN, I can report to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently corrupt and sufficiently inefficient. That no reasonable person would put faith in it." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now un guerre à mort and if I had been the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

2500|$|When {{someone asks}} a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they would tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always {{feel that they are}} practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1804 Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the {{commander}} of the slave rebellion in Haiti declared independence from France. Perkins was sent by Admiral Duckworth and Governor Nugent in Tartar as a British observer to the island. Perkins was accompanied by Edward Corbet. Corbet was a government advisor appointed by Nugent. Perkins described the situation on Haiti in his official letters to the Admiral. [...] "I assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> horrid to view the streets in different places stained with the Blood of these unfortunate people, whose bodies are now left exposed to view by the river and sea side. In hauling the seine the evening we came to our anchor several bodies got entangled in it, in fact such scenes of cruelty and devastation have been committed as is impossible to imagine or my pen describe." ...|$|E
