25|$|In morphosyntax, {{the use of}} the {{auxiliary}} verb kho 'to come' as opposed to wird 'will' in phrases such as leg di warm a, sunscht khunscht krank ('put on warm clothes, otherwise <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> sick') in Grisons-German is sometimes attributed to Romansh, as well as the lack of a distinction between the accusative and dative case in some Grisons-German dialects and the word order in phrases such as i tet froge jemand wu waiss ('I would ask someone who knows'). In addition, some words, neuter in most dialects of German, are masculine in Grisons-German. Examples include der Brot 'the bread' or der Gäld 'the money'. Common words of Romansh origin in Grisons-German include Schaffa (derived from Romansh scaffa 'cupboard'), Spus/Spüslig 'bridegroom' and Spus 'bride', Banitsch 'cart used for moving dung', and Pon 'container made of wood'. In areas where Romansh either is still spoken or has disappeared recently, Romansh words are even more common in the local dialects of German.|$|E

The Kinematograph Weekly thought the film was [...] "quite well acted, and has good atmosphere" [...] but thought, too, it was [...] "not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent". The Cinema News and Property Gazette thought the film was for the [...] "less sophisticated" [...] and that the [...] "exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction".

USA Today gave the episode its highest rating of four stars. Tom Shales of The Washington Post called it, [...] "a tour de force for D'Onofrio and Braugher". Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts said, [...] "This is as gripping an hour of television as you're ever likely to see." [...] Television and literary critic John Leonard said that [...] "Subway" [...] was [...] "an artistic experience that is as genuine and accomplished and crafted as <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> anywhere".

500|$|Bowie drew {{criticism}} {{during the}} tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of}} the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Station to Station tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that [...] "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in NME. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: [...] "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> a Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it..." [...] The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines [...] "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" [...] from Scary Monsters opening track [...] "It's No Game", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.|$|E

He described his age, unknown status and willingness {{to work for a}} relatively low fee as being his main assets for getting work in America. His drama teacher, who he has remained with ever since, told him [...] "that you might want to play great roles, but truth is <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> cast as a specific type. Just work out your type. The others in the class said I was a bit Anthony Hopkins and a bit Sean Connery and that went into my head.

[...] The first role he was offered was a part in a series called Sign of Life, a show about a rock band, which eventually fell through. Dale only received a couple of auditions during his first year in America, but his break came when he was cast as the South African Al Patterson in four episodes of ER. Since then, Dale has been [...] "busier than ever". He has appeared in many television series including guest appearances on The West Wing, Torchwood, The Lone Gunmen, Californication, and The Practice. Many of these have been recurring roles, such as the part of Tom Morrow in JAG and its spin-off NCIS, as well as appearing in three episodes, including the series finale, of The X-Files, playing the [...] "Toothpick Man". He played the recurring role of Vice President of the United States Jim Prescott for seven episodes of the second season of 24, a part which was originally supposed to be a single scene. Dale had recurring roles in the serial Midnight Man and the Australian series Sea Patrol in 2008. He also had recurring parts on Undercovers, Entourage as John Ellis, the fictional owner of Warner Bros., and the British series Moving Wallpaper as a fictional version of himself. He had a recurring role as King George in the series Once Upon a Time, and Emmett in Hot in Cleveland, before joining the main cast of Dominion in 2014, playing General Edward Riesen.|$|E
