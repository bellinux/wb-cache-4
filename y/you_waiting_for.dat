500|$|The {{phenomenon}} also inspired several {{rock and}} pop music hits. As early as 1997, [...] "A Certain Shade of Green" [...] by Incubus {{referred to the}} mystical belief that a shift in perception would arrive in 2012 ("Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D.? / What are <b>you</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for,</b> a certain shade of green?"). More recent hits include [...] "2012 (It Ain't the End)" [...] (2010) performed by Jay Sean and [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] (2011) performed by Britney Spears. Towards mid-December 2012, an internet hoax related to South Korean singer Psy {{being one of the}} Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse was widely circulated around social media platforms. The hoax purported that once Psy's [...] "Gangnam Style" [...] YouTube video amassed a billion views, the world would end. Indian composer A. R. Rahman, known for Slumdog Millionaire, released his single [...] "Infinite Love" [...] to [...] "instill faith and optimism in people" [...] prior to the predicted doomsday.

500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, hold on to your hats. [...] Those of <b>you</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E

He would keep <b>you</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> five hours and then appear wearing shorts. He would then tell you how much he wanted you to pay him, and that you had a week to do so, saying: 'If you don't pay, we will confiscate the machinery and give your concession to the Chinese.' We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him." [...] Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, [...] "had to pay commissions at every stage of the way" [...] and was confronted [...] "with permits and other obstacles"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople. [...] "He caught malaria and had a fever....In return for being allowed to leave, he had to agree to leave all his money and the timber warehouse behind." ...|$|E

2500|$|The story {{revolves}} around Leonardo da Vinci's mysterious disappearance {{in the year}} 1506. Ezio arrives at Leonardo's workshop with his assistant Salaì and finds him missing. It is soon revealed that Leonardo found a secret vault and his plans were discovered by the Hermetics, members of the Cult of Hermes. Ezio finds writing on the floor that implies he should seek out five of Leonardo's paintings once owned by Ezio at Monteriggioni but now missing. The majority of this sequence focuses on the search for and retrieval of these paintings by Ezio. After finding these paintings, Ezio identifies {{the location of a}} new subterranean location in Roma and proceeds there, to find Da Vinci imprisoned by Hermetics. After freeing Leonardo, the two of them find another vault, in which they are revealed the numbers 43 39 19 N and 75 27 42 W. Ezio comments on these numbers [...] "It is not intended for us". At the end of the sequence, two male voices (one is the Assassin, William) are heard commenting that Desmond has fallen into a coma. They also comment [...] "we have a location for the temple" [...] and [...] "then what are <b>you</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for,</b> let's go." [...] This DLC doubles as the technical Animus Project Update 3.0, with the addition of the preorder multiplayer characters, the Harlequin and Officer, as well as the preorder-only special Drachen Armor for Ezio.|$|E
