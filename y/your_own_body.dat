500|$|In Kids Can Say No!, Australian celebrity Rolf Harris appears {{with four}} {{children}} between the ages of seven and eight and warns them about paedophiles. The film begins with its theme song, [...] "My Body", which has the chorus [...] "My body's nobody's body but mine. You run <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>body.</b> Let me run mine." [...] During the song, children ride a seesaw, skip rope and cycle. Harris sits under a tree in a park with the children—two girls and two boys—and tells them about proper and improper physical intimacy, which he calls [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] feelings; a parent's hug is given as an example of a [...] "yes" [...] feeling. In vox populi segments, children give other examples of [...] "yes" [...] and [...] "no" [...] feelings; one child says that being tickled by his father is a [...] "yes" [...] feeling, and another says that being squeezed hard is a [...] "no" [...] feeling. Harris leads the children in a chant of [...] "Go away!" [...] as an exercise in how to respond to [...] "no" [...] feelings. He teaches the children about stranger danger, and that adults they know can also be a threat.|$|E

5000|$|Christianity {{developed}} {{the belief that}} the story of Isaac's binding was a foreshadowing of the sacrifice of Christ, whose death and resurrection enabled the salvation and atonement for man from its sins, including original sin. There is a tradition that the site of Isaac's binding, Moriah, later became Jerusalem, the city of Jesus's future crucifixion. The beliefs of most Christian denominations hinge upon the substitutionary atonement of the sacrifice of God the Son, which was necessary for salvation in the afterlife. According to Christian doctrine, each individual person on earth must participate in, and/or receive the benefits of, this divine human sacrifice for the atonement of their sins. Early Christian sources explicitly described this event as a sacrificial offering, with Christ in the role of both priest and human sacrifice, although starting with the Enlightenment, some writers, such as John Locke, have disputed the model of Jesus' death as a propitiatory sacrifice.Rene Girard has demonstrated that the Gospels are a radical subversion of pagan notions of sacrifice. Instead of humans offering victims to angry deities (as is always the case with pagan sacrifice), Jesus, as the incarnate presence of God (YHWH), offers himself into the hands of violent humans to reveal what the Hebrew prophets meant when they said that [...] "the Lord" [...] (YHWH) rejects sacrifice and desires justice and mercy instead.

Give me what you can, while you can, without grudging, but the moment you feel you love me no more, don't pollute <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>body</b> by yielding it up to a man you have ceased to desire; don't do injustice to your own prospective children by giving them a father whom you no longer respect, or admire, or yearn for.

[...] No woman, in turn, is truly civilized till she can say to every man of all the men she loves, of all the men who love her, [...] "Give me what you can of your love, and of yourself; but don't think I am so vile, and so selfish, and so poor as to desire to monopolize you. Respect me enough never to give me your body without giving me your heart; never to make me the mother of children whom you desire not and love not."
