The navy had just forty-five {{percent of its}} authorized personnel in 1896, and amid quickly improving naval technology, the only modern armored ships were two small coast-defense vessels launched in 1898. With such dilapidated defenses, José Paranhos Jr., the Baron of Rio Branco and Foreign Minister of Brazil, stated [...] "In such conditions, <b>you</b> ... <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> upset I am and all the worries I have. All that still protects [...] is the moral force and old prestige still left from [...] when there was still foresight in this land..." ...|$|E
2500|$|You're in such {{a strong}} {{position}} when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, [...] "Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was {{figuring out how to}} make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity—if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> powerful that is?" [...] And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could only}} make <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> very strong is my inclination, or disinclination--how {{impossible}} to be conquered, then--" ...|$|E
60|$|CLEOPATRA (with superb contempt). <b>YOU</b> <b>understand</b> Caesar! <b>How</b> could <b>you?</b> (Proudly) I do--by instinct.|$|R
60|$|RIDGEON. Oh, quite. More, perhaps. In {{twenty years}} <b>you</b> will <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> little {{difference}} that makes.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not for}} my own sake, but for yours, that I would {{recommend}} caution," [...] he continued. [...] "The situation is unusual, and such disclosures might impel persons to interfere for what they thought your interest; but you have promised me your implicit trust, and you will, I hope, prove it. <b>You</b> can <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> painful would be such well-meaning interference, though <b>you</b> cannot <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> fatally mischievous it would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Beatrice," [...] he said, [...] "I often wish I {{could make}} <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> {{extraordinarily}} helpful and useful {{to me you}} have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not think}} <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it was, Mr. Fordyce,' said Clarence, who by this time was quivering and {{trembling}} as in his boyish days.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I wish you," [...] {{continued}} the teacher, [...] "to fill {{up such a}} table as this, with ten nouns. Do <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{only want}} <b>you</b> to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> the land lies.' Merton dropped his voice again, 'He {{has made a}} will leaving you everything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had every}} warning," [...] she told him. [...] "I {{tried to make}} <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> exactly <b>how</b> your {{behaviour}} disgusted me before you went away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Brand. <b>You</b> cannot <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> have eased my mind. I {{know of no}} {{one else}} who would, or could, have done so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it is? Your {{friends are}} up yonder in the frost {{with nothing to}} eat. I {{have to take the}} Indians back for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The work I {{have for}} you will take you out more or less," [...] he said. [...] "And {{it is a great}} help if <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> to get around." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{a girl of}} sense. I'll settle {{matters for}} Rosy, and you'll lend a hand. Is {{everything}} ready in her room, and are you sure <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> they go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{live without}} her--I can't work. She's {{all mixed up}} with this--and everything. And besides, there's things <b>you</b> can't <b>understand.</b> There's {{feelings}} you've never felt.... <b>You</b> don't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> much we've been to one another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delora," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "how comes it {{that you}} have let your brother intervene? Did <b>you</b> not <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> secret your mission was to be?--how important?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{the doctor}} said, [...] "we three must put our heads {{together}} {{and see what}} is to be done. <b>You</b> <b>understand,</b> Ned, <b>how</b> matters stand, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's----But I am {{glad for}} you. Will you believe that? And perhaps <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> I felt, now. I'm very sorry I let myself go. I hope you will----Oh, please go now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} would be more {{effective}} if I could show the letter itself at large. I have it in my pocket now. <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> pleased I was to come upon you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Unless <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> {{to manage}} a boat in a heavy sea, and the winds and tides of this coast thoroughly, I don't think that you should wish that, Mr. Layard," [...] said Stella.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} apologize, I know, for {{bringing}} these people up without notice, but I didn't suppose you'd object when <b>you</b> <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> naturally {{it all came}} about. I thought a little livening up, as I said, wouldn't, hurt us. We've had a quiet winter, to put it mildly." [...] He laughed a little. [...] "I didn't {{have a chance to}} see you until this morning, and when I went to your room they told me you'd gone out." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{acknowledged}} it by immediately going on. [...] "The question, <b>you</b> <b>understand,</b> was <b>HOW</b> I should save you. Well, I'm {{trying it}} by thus letting {{her know that}} I consider you worth saving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, if {{you think}} Ruth's story was true," [...] pursued my grandmother, [...] "what's the reason you are always cavilling at things just 'cause <b>you</b> can't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> they came to be so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Worst of {{them all}} was Verona. [...] "TED! Some way MUST be found to make <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> dreadfully SERIOUS this is, instead of {{standing}} AROUND with that silly foolish SMILE on your face!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Conrad replied softly: [...] "I know, I know! I {{just heard}} of it. Too bad! but <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it is. Herds get going that way, and you can't stop 'em nor head 'em off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arranmore," [...] she said, [...] "this is {{so painful}} to me. Do let us cease to discuss it. I have {{tried so hard}} to make <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> I feel. I cannot alter. It is impossible!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not require}} further assurance, my Lord," [...] said I, hastily; [...] "I merely wish <b>you</b> to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> {{important}} it is that secrecy should be observed. I will reveal it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} didn't. But at times you seem so--indifferent, and <b>you</b> can't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it hurts. I haven't anybody but you, now, and it's in your {{power to make}} me happy or--or miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{want to hear}} it. Oh, Florence, Florence, I do {{not think}} <b>you</b> can <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> {{completely}} I am beyond myself with joy. I cannot dance again, and will not. Oh, my wife, my wife!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{look at me}} like that, Hawk. So hard. Studying me.... Can't you understand---- Haven't you any perception? Can't <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> hard it is for me to come to {{you like}} this, after last night, and try----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} I can't go," [...] said Phil, to Dave. [...] "But, <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it is," [...] and {{he jerked his}} thumb in the {{direction}} of the supercargo, who was writing in one of his books.|$|E
60|$|And now <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> it {{was that}} {{he was the first to}} return, and that seeing him thus returning, {{apparently}} safe and sound, the two ladies, intent upon preventing the encounter, should have assumed that their worst fears were realized.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a gentleman, every inch," [...] {{he exclaimed}} delightedly to Alice. [...] "If you knew how I {{have thought of}} him <b>you</b> would <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> happy it makes me to see him what he is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, you do, Alan. You mustn't be logical! You {{might as}} well say <b>you</b> can't <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>you</b> came to be more serious than sober." [...] The brother laughed helplessly. [...] "It was the excitement." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If <b>you</b> want to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> the Pentagon operates, like {{everything}} else in Washington, you follow the money." ...|$|R
