In this study, the authors presented a new approach which, hopefully, is simpler than the existing methods. The paper outlines the works carried out to arrive at the formula. About 300 Malaysian timber nailed joints were fabricated and tested to obtain the relationship between <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> and maximum load and to propose a new method to predict the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> of a nailed joint.

40|$|The <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> {{equivalent}} for mechanical joints is {{a characteristic}} joint value, which appraises the joint specific deformation behavior. The value considers the maximum load {{of a joint}} {{as well as the}} ductility of the joint. Therefore the value is a combined strength / deformation value with high information content. The value guaranties an adequate joint deformation reserve. The shown examples and the application variety prove the adaptability of the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> equivalent. Those examples as been verified for different fastener types and joint geometries. Based on the appraisal of shear loaded lock bolt and blind rivet joints the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> equivalent has been used and proven for the appraisal of: 1. punch rivets / self piercing riveting 2. clinching 3. spot welding 4. tension loaded joints 5. peel loaded joints The appraisal of multiple joint specimens was difficult and is now possible with the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> equivalent. For this kind of joints the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> equivalent de liver the possibility to describe the complex joint characteristic with one comparable value. The easy appraisal of the transition area between force and form closure is an additional and important issue for the characterization of load bearing characteristic of mechanical joints. Due to this value a comparability of test result is possible without knowledge of the exact test assembly.

Experimental tests on six types of steel-to-timber joints and two types of timber-to-timber joints were carried out, considering one single diameter for the bolt (16 mm) and only one wood specie (Red-Spruce). The load-slip curve of each specimen (5 specimens for every joint type) allowed to determine the characteristic limits of each joint type that are: the proportional load, the <b>yield</b> <b>load,</b> the ultimate load, maximum slip at failure and the stiffness in service of the connection as well. Predictions of the <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> and the service stiffness were obtained using the EYM and the BEFM, respectively.

A total of 11 specimens have been manufactured of which specimens strengthened with bonded or unbonded CFRP strips considering the level of post-tensioning as experimental variable, and a specimen with simply bonded CFRP strips. The following phenomena have been observed through the experimental results. The specimen with simply bonded CFRP strips failed below 50 % of its tensile strength due to premature debonding. On the other hand, all the specimens strengthened with post-tensioning CFRP strips showed sufficient strengthening performance up to the ultimate rupture load of the CFRP strips. Also, {{it was observed that}} the cracking <b>loads</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>loads</b> of the strengthened beams were increased proportionally to the post-tensioning level, but the ultimate loads were nearly equal regardless of the post-tensioning level and bonded or unbonded system. In addition, the <b>yield</b> <b>loads</b> and cracking loads of the beams with bonded post-tensioning systems were increased about 20 % compared with those of the unbonded post-tensioning systems.

MethodsIn 13 human cadaver knees the MPFLs were dissected protecting their insertion at the patellar border. The MPFL was loaded to failure after preconditioning with 10 cycles in a uniaxial testing machine evaluating stiffness, <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> and maximum load to failure. In the second part Quadriceps-MPFL-reconstruction was performed and tested in a uniaxial testing machine. Following preconditioning, the constructs were cyclically loaded 1000 times between 5 and 50 N measuring the maximum elongation. After cyclic testing, the constructs have been loaded to failure measuring stiffness, <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> and maximum load. For statistical analysis a repeated measures (RM) one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons was used. The significance was set at P< 0. 05. ResultsDuring the load to failure tests of the original MPFL the following results were measured: stiffness 29. 4 N/mm (+ 9. 8), <b>yield</b> <b>load</b> 167. 8 N (+ 80) and maximum load to failure 190. 7 N (+ 82. 8).
