500|$|Work on the game's storyline {{and levels}} began in January 1993. Jones {{recalled}} that starting from cliché plots they moved towards [...] "very interesting and unique but {{extremely difficult to}} understand stories". One of the more complicated stories cast the player {{as one of a}} group of Roman soldiers who discovered a mountain spring that extended their lives. Every seven years one soldier would be picked to descend into the caves and bring back more water. If the leader died, a new one would be selected to undertake the journey to ensure their survival. [...] "It was a very interesting plot since your quest wasn't necessarily virtuous, it didn't involve doing good things or saving the world," [...] Jones said. [...] "It was just you were chosen, more or less against <b>your</b> <b>will,</b> to become the next leader of this freak cult of immortals." [...] The final plot occupied a middle ground between the simple and complex stories, because the developers did not want to force players to become deeply involved in the story.|$|E
500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, knowing you can go out there and impose <b>your</b> <b>will</b> each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. We were having a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, you want to run the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E

Guidebooks, such as Sasojeol (士小節, Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (이덕무; 李德懋), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as [...] "when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it", [...] "when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea," [...] "when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against <b>your</b> <b>will</b> nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food.

Fronto felt that, because of Marcus' prominence and public duties, lessons {{were more important}} now than they had ever been before. He believed Marcus was [...] "beginning to feel the wish to be eloquent once more, in spite of having for a time lost interest in eloquence". Fronto would again remind his pupil of the tension between his role and his philosophic pretensions: [...] "Suppose, Caesar, that you can attain to the wisdom of Cleanthes and Zeno, yet, against <b>your</b> <b>will,</b> not the philosopher's woolen cape." [...] The early days of Marcus' reign were the happiest of Fronto's life: his pupil was beloved {{by the people of}} Rome, an excellent emperor, a fond pupil, and, perhaps most importantly, as eloquent as could be wished. Marcus had displayed rhetorical skill in his speech to the senate after an earthquake at Cyzicus. It had conveyed the drama of the disaster, and the senate had been awed: [...] "not more suddenly or violently was the city stirred by the earthquake than the minds of your hearers by your speech".
