Soon afterward, he received a letter from Watchman Nee that read, “Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with <b>your</b> <b>full</b> time. How do you feel? May the Lord lead you.” Lee [...] felt this letter strongly confirmed his decision. From that point onward, Lee began to work closely with Nee.|$|E
2500|$|Island Records {{gave the}} band a choice: [...] "We're legally obliged {{to make your}} [...] but we’re not really up for it. So we either do it or do a half-arsed job of it or you can take <b>your</b> <b>full</b> record advance and leave." [...] The band took the advance {{and used it to}} build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a worker}} delays {{receiving}} Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age {{there is a}} Social Security benefits increase by a certain percentage—depending on date of birth. After age 70 {{there are no more}} increases in retirement benefits allowed. Social Security uses an [...] "average" [...] survival rate at <b>your</b> <b>full</b> retirement age to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever you retire. Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the [...] "average" [...] survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men. The other consideration is that workers only have a limited number of years of [...] "good" [...] health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy.|$|E

2500|$|The Quran at its {{several places}} {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} death. Death is inevitable. No matter how much people try to escape death, it will reach everyone (...) [...] Again, those who deny resurrection and afterlife, and thus challenge God, the Quran challenges them by saying that why these people then do not put back the soul which has reached the throat (of the dying person) {{and is about to}} escape the body? (...) [...] It also says that when death approaches the sinners and disbelievers, and they sense the upcoming chastisement, they pray to Godto go back to life to do some good deeds; but this will never be granted (...) [...] Probably the most-frequently quoted verse of the Quran about death is: [...] "Every soul shall taste death, and only on the Day of Judgment will you be paid <b>your</b> <b>full</b> recompense." [...] At another place, the Quran urges mankind: [...] "And die not except in a state of Islam" [...] (...) because [...] "Truly, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam" [...] (...) [...] Other verses related with this issue are: [...] "He (Allah) who created death and life, so that He may test you as to which of you is better in deeds. And He is the All-Mighty, the Most-Forgiving" [...] (...) [...] "Certainly, they see it (resurrection) as distant, but We see it as near" [...] (...) [...]|$|E
