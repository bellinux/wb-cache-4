500|$|Living {{near the}} Shawangunks during her college years, Hill pioneered many new free {{climbing}} routes. In 1984 at The Gunks she performed an on-sight first ascent of Yellow Crack (5.12c) and Vandals (5.13a); Vandals {{was the most}} difficult route on the East Coast at the time and the area's first climb of its grade. Her lead of Yellow Crack was a very dangerous ascent, her climbing partner at the time Russ Ruffa calling it [...] "one of the boldest leads I've ever seen... I had tried leading it. I knew you had to totally commit to doing the moves, otherwise the chance of surviving would be minimal. Those are the moments that really stand out—when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> totally on the edge." [...] It was her climb of Vandals that led Hill to reconsider her climbing style; rather than begin the climb again every time she fell or leaned on the rope for support, she hung on the rope in her harness to gain more information about the climb. As she writes in her autobiography, [...] "In one moment I had, to some degree, thrown out years of climbing philosophy... The subtle advantage of hanging on the rope to figure out the crux moves gave me the added information that helped me learn and eventually succeed on the route. The old style of climbing suddenly seemed rigid, limited, and contrived." [...] That year, she performed a series of impressive feats, leading Tourist Treat on-sight with only one fall, [...] "perhaps the most difficult first ascent in the north country at the time". She was arguably [...] "the best climber in the Gunks", as local climbing legend Kevin Bein called her, and [...] "no man was climbing significantly better" [...] than her.|$|E

2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the decade, Haggard {{composed}} several number-one hits, including [...] "Mama Tried," [...] "The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde," [...] "Hungry Eyes," [...] and [...] "Sing Me Back Home." [...] Daniel Cooper calls [...] "Sing Me Back Home" [...] "a ballad {{that works}} on so many different levels of the soul it defies one's every attempt to analyze it." [...] In a 1977 interview in Billboard with Bob Eubanks, Haggard reflected, [...] "Even though the crime was brutal and the guy was an incorrigible criminal, it's a feeling you never forget when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> you know make that last walk. They bring him through the yard, and there's a guard in front and a guard behind—that's how you know a death prisoner. They brought Rabbit out ... taking him to see the Father, ... prior to his execution. That was a strong picture that was left in my mind." [...] In 1969, Haggard's first tribute LP , was also released to acclaim.|$|E

2500|$|Sarambha can be {{translated}} as [...] "accompanied by violence". As the mind filled with lobha, dosa and moha (lust, hatred and delusion) is led to actions which are akusala. Indulging in violence {{is a form of}} self-harming. The rejection of violence in society is recognized in Buddhism as a prerequisite for the spiritual progress of society's members, because violence brings pain to beings with similar feelings to oneself. The Buddha is quoted in the Dhammapada as saying, [...] "All are afraid of the stick, all hold their lives dear. Putting oneself in another's place, one should not beat or kill others". Metta (loving kindness), the development of mindstates of limitless good-will for all beings, and karuna, compassion that arises when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> suffering of the human being, are attitudes said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings (sattesu samma patipatti). The Sutta Nipata says [...] "'As I am, so are these. As are these, so am I.' Drawing the parallel to yourself, neither kill nor get others to kill." ...|$|E

You intellectually grasp a general moral truth. Should moral perceptions be thought of as high-level perceptions or as intuitions? Most proponents of moral perception have thought of them as high-level perceptions. I give epistemological and methodological reasons for thinking that at least some are examples of what I call low-level intuitions—experiences in which we both apprehend abstract generalities and apply them to concrete particulars...|$|R

50|$|Pokonoket was a {{very dark}} country, one where the people were {{required}} by law to have squeaky sneakers and phosphorescent buttons on their clothes and phosphorescent names on their umbrellas. All of this was necessary so that <b>you</b> could <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> coming towards <b>you.</b> The people of Pokonoket were peaceful and rarely committed crimes. There once was an Ogress who lived in the darkness somewhere in Pokonoket and ate anyone that she could catch. Toby was a widower who spent all of his days making soup and knitting stockings for his grandchildren. Toby also had arthritis, and therefore couldn’t keep up with the knitting and the soup making, so he went in search of a widow, Mrs. Clover-Leaf, to ask for her hand in marriage so she could assist him in making soup for his grandchildren.|$|R

Interestingly, studies have typically shown putting a name to a face is harder than remembering biographical memories about someone. Using the LRP, studies {{have tried to do}} precise mapping of different factors that affect the order of access to different types of information about someone, just by seeing their face.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Radio X, Albarn spoke of the song, saying [...] "At one point this song had Graham, Noel and me on {{it and it was}} sort of heading slightly in the wrong direction. It was becoming almost retro in its sort of spirit and way too rocky for this record so I kind of stripped it right back down again. We play it slightly different live than how it is on the record. It’s sort of the song that comes on during the final titles of a film. The climax. I thought Jehnny would take a bit of the testosterone off".

He then started his research career at the University of St Andrews by investigating cells in the Temporal cortex with David Perrett, and described cells that respond when the monkey views particular faces in a way that correlates with conscious perception. After that, he moved to the University of Parma where {{he was part of the}} team that discovered auditory mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of the macaque monkey. He then expanded the notion of mirror neurons to emotions and sensations, by showing that your somatosensory cortex is active not only when you are being touched, but also if <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> else being touched, and that your insular cortex is active not only if you feel disgusted, but also if <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> else being disgusted. More recently, he has looked at the neural basis of abnormal empathy in schizophrenia, autism and psychopathy. Currently, Keysers is a full Professor for the Social Brain at the Brain and Cognition program of the University of Amsterdam and he co-leads the Social Brain Lab of the prestigious Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.He has recently published a book called 'The Empathic Brain' which won the Independent Publisher Book Award for best science book 2012 and explains his research to a wider public.He is married to Neuroscientist Valeria Gazzola, and is a long-standing friend of the German writer Bas Kast.|$|E

They're tough guys on the street and nobody's going to tell them what to do. Then one day, they'll come to you crying, saying, 'I need someone to talk to.' All of sudden they start changing their ways and they become the men they always wanted to be. Then other soldiers start looking up to them as role models. Then they're proud and they hold their heads high. That's more gratifying than anything I've done.

5000|$|An urban {{legend has}} arisen around [...] "In the Air Tonight", {{according}} to which the lyrics {{are based on a}} drowning incident in which someone who was close enough to save the victim did not help them, while Collins, who was too far away to help, looked on. Increasingly embellished variations on the legend emerged over time, with the stories often culminating in Collins singling out the guilty party while singing the song at a concert. Collins has denied all such stories; he commented on the legends about the song in a BBC World Service interview: I don't know what this song is about. When I was writing this I was going through a divorce. And the only thing I can say about it is that it's obviously in anger. It's the angry side, or the bitter side of a separation. So what makes it even more comical is when I hear these stories which started many years ago, particularly in America, of someone {{come up to me and}} say, [...] "Did <b>you</b> really <b>see</b> <b>someone</b> drowning?" [...] I said, [...] "No, wrong". And then every time I go back to America the story gets Chinese whispers, it gets more and more elaborate.

500|$|The {{mathematician}} Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, {{stating that}} [...] "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research. King cites the mathematician G. H. Hardy's 1940 essay A Mathematician's Apology. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of classical times as first rate, namely Euclid's proof there are infinitely many prime numbers, and the {{proof that the}} square root of 2 is irrational. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for mathematical elegance: [...] "seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy" [...] (King's italics), and describes the proof as [...] "aesthetically pleasing". The Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: [...] "Why are numbers beautiful?

When you have really famous people, I find that {{it is very hard to}} transcend that awareness. I am always aware of who they are.

[...] The accompanying music video for the song was directed by Canadian actor and director Xavier Dolan and released on 22 October 2015. The concept of the video revolves around a recently broken-up woman calling a younger version of herself. Portions of the video—mostly the finale on the pond and the shot of her opening her eyes in the beginning—were filmed with IMAX cameras, making it the first music video in IMAX format. The video draws inspiration from Dolan's semi-autobiographical debut I Killed My Mother, which was made when Dolan was barely 20. The video was filmed on a farm in Québec over 4 days in September 2015.|$|E
