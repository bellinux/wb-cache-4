25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, {{had promised}} Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay {{action on the}} {{election}} bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders that sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. [...] Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. [...] Bringing troops into the chamber, he {{put an end to}} the debate, saying [...] "You are no Parliament. [...] I say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> Parliament. [...] I will put an end to your sitting." [...] Vane protested, [...] "This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty", to which Cromwell shouted in response, [...] "O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!" [...] This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. [...] Vane, [...] "daily missed and courted for his assistance", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{writers have}} noted the strong {{historical}} tradition of open bisexuality and homosexuality among male Buddhist institutions in Japan. When the Tendai priest Genshin harshly criticised homosexuality as immoral, others mistook his criticism as having been because the acolyte wasn't one's own. Chigo Monogatari, [...] "acolyte stories" [...] of love between monks and their chigo were popular, and such relationships {{appear to have been}} commonplace, alongside sex with women. In the 15th century, maverick Zen monk Ikkyu Sojun (1394–1481) wrote, [...] "follow the rule of celibacy and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> more than an ass." [...] Later, [...] "exhausted with homosexual pleasures", he took a wife.|$|E
2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E
2500|$|Denouncing the UDA, {{the trial}} judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, [...] "What appears before me today {{under the name}} of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising {{organisation}} of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation". During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court [...] "trial". Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, [...] "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When you heard what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character."

2500|$|Keeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley {{introduced}} {{as a character}} in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was [...] "very good to all the world {{as long as it}} was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if you look out of the nursery window—that, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all." [...] Like Huxley, [...] "the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle." [...] A paragraph on [...] "the great hippopotamus test" [...] opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring [...] "that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have", but then like Owen presenting the argument that [...] "If you have a hippopotamus major in your brain, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> ape".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of 1649 until 1651 Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to engage in infighting. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and {{to put in place}} a broad-brush, {{tolerant}} national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, in April 1653 Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government of 40 members (drawn both from the Rump and the army) and then abdicate. However, the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that on 20 April 1653, supported by about forty musketeers, he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force. Several accounts exist of this incident: in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said [...] "you are no Parliament, I say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting". At least two accounts agree that Cromwell snatched up the mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the [...] "bauble" [...] be taken away. Cromwell's troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rivalry between}} Chris Jericho and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield started in Jericho's WWE Championship match against the {{defending}} champion, Randy Orton, at Armageddon. During the match, Orton whipped Jericho over the SmackDown! announce table straight into JBL. As Jericho {{tried to get}} up, he ended up [...] "nudging" [...] JBL out of his way. Later in the match, Jericho had Orton trapped in the Walls of Jericho, when, JBL stormed into the ring and gave a kick to Jericho's face, thus giving the win to Jericho, but via disqualification, and hence, Jericho did not win the WWE Championship. This led to an argument the next night on Raw, where Jericho, who was angry about not becoming the new WWE Champion, ended up stating to JBL, who confronted Y2J via satellite from the Raw TitanTron, that [...] "John, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> longer a wrestling god, you're a wrestling afterthought". Afterward, JBL gave his farewell address as SmackDown color commentator on the December 21, 2007 airing of Friday Night SmackDown and announced his return as an active wrestler on Raw. When JBL made his return to Raw on December 31, entering in his personal limousine with balloons and confetti shooting from the ceiling, and proceeded to address the crowd, Jericho quickly interrupted his promo and the two got engaged in a brawl along the barricade. The following week, Jericho was put into a handicap match against Snitsky and JBL. The match started with Snitsky and Jericho in the ring, but, soon after Jericho hit a Springboard dropkick on Snitsky, JBL came into the ring and attacked Jericho from behind. JBL {{get the better of}} this confrontation as he hit Jericho on the head with the ring bell and tied a cable wire around his neck. JBL then dragged Jericho, by the wire, from near the ring to the Raw set, where he assaulted him some more. Jericho suffered from a bruised larynx, burns around his neck, and had difficulty speaking for a week.|$|E
