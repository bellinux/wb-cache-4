500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide whether you want to play against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Washington Post writer Bob Woodward {{reported}} that Hillary Clinton {{had been having}} [...] "imaginary discussions" [...] with Eleanor Roosevelt {{from the start of}} Clinton's time as First Lady. Following the Democrats' loss of congressional control in the 1994 elections, Clinton had engaged the services of Human Potential Movement proponent Jean Houston. Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding séances with Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> right person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{mid-twentieth century}} a number of {{philosophers}} focused on the place of rules in utilitarian thinking.

2500|$|Skills are {{categorized}} by difficulty: Easy, Average, Hard, and Very Hard. Easy skills cost few points to purchase levels in, {{and the cost}} per skill level increases with each level of difficulty. [...] Game mechanics allow that eventually it may be less expensive to {{raise the level of}} the base attribute the skills depend on as opposed to purchasing higher levels of skills. [...] A player can generally purchase a skill for his character at any level he or she can afford. [...] The lower <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>the</b> fewer points it costs to buy the skill, and the higher you go, the more points it costs. Some skills have default levels, which indicate the level rating a character has when using that skill untrained (i.e. not purchased). For example, a character with a Dexterity of 12, is using the Climbing skill untrained. Climbing has a default of DX-5 or ST-5, which means that using the skill untrained gives him a Climbing skill level of 7 (12-5) if he tied it to the Dexterity stat. If the character had a higher Strength stat, he could {{have a better chance of}} success if he tied the Climbing skill there instead.|$|E
