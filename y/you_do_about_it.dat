When our good people come down of a cold winter morning, and see the squirrels dancing and frisking down the trees, and chasing each other so merrily over the garden chair between them, or sitting with their tails saucily over their backs, they look so jolly and jaunty and pretty that they almost forgive them for disturbing their night's rest, and think that they will not do anything to drive them out of the garret to-day. And so it goes on; but how long the squirrels will rent the cottage in this fashion, I'm sure I dare not undertake to say.|$|E

For as human beings, {{we know that we}} will progress in some fashion, good or bad, and make adjustments to what we wear, do, and how we think about things. What was essential before may not be essential now or in the future. All that we can predict is that change will happen. We do know that we will look different physically, think different mentally, and change in what is important to us. Focusing on “what was essential ” rather than “what changed ” during the past years causes us to ground our speculation in hope. What is essential to us is the same as what gives meaning to our lives, work, and world community. Factors in society cause changes in what we consider essential. Political decisions are made.

40|$|My {{topic for}} this Geary lecture is `Making Globalisation Work. A {{question}} I am often asked is ? how did I come to write my book entitled Making Globalisation Work? It was said: ?You have complained enough. What would <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>about</b> <b>it??</b> This {{was an important}} challenge, and in fact as I thought about it, there are a wealth of changes that could be proposed: some small, some large, some that one could do almost overnight, and some that would take years, perhaps decades, to bring about. However, thinking through systematically {{about the kinds of}} changes one could bring about to make globalisation work, or at least work better than it has been working, seemed to me something that was really very important. So what I did in this book, and what I will try to do in this lecture, is first to list what has gone wrong and which grievances, amongst all those that have been raised, are the most legitimate. Second, I will analyse how things have been changing and explore whether they have been getting better or worse. Third, I will make a diagnosis of why globalisation has not been living up to its potential and why it is failing in each of the several areas that I am going to talk about. Finally, based on that diagnosis, I will discuss {{what can be done to}} at least ameliorate some of the problem situations...|$|E
