2500|$|Following his conversion, Yusuf {{abandoned}} his musical career {{for nearly three}} decades. In 2007, he {{said that when he}} became a Muslim in 1977, the Imam at his mosque told him that it was fine to continue as a musician, as long as the songs were morally acceptable, but others were saying that [...] "it was all prohibited", and he decided to avoid the question by ceasing to perform. He has said that there was [...] "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been [...] "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore". In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said [...] "A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want {{to get down to the}} job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life. I'd been searching, been on the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it and I knew it would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in terms}} of the more general epistemological implications of common sense, modern philosophy came to use the term common sense like Descartes, abandoning Aristotle's theory. While Descartes had distanced himself from it, John Locke abandoned it more openly, while still maintaining the idea of [...] "common sensibles" [...] that are perceived. But then George Berkeley abandoned both. David Hume agreed with Berkeley on this, and like Locke and Vico saw himself as following Bacon more than Descartes. In his synthesis, which he saw as the first Baconian analysis of man (something the lesser known Vico had claimed earlier), common sense is entirely built up from shared experience and shared innate emotions, and therefore it is indeed imperfect as a basis for any attempt to know the truth or to make the best decision. But he defended the possibility of science without absolute certainty, and consistently described common sense as giving a valid answer to the challenge of extreme skepticism. Concerning such sceptics, he wrote:But would these prejudiced reasoners reflect a moment, there are many obvious instances and arguments, sufficient to undeceive them, and make them enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not see the vast variety of inclinations and pursuits among our species; where each man seems fully satisfied with his own course of life, and would esteem it the greatest unhappiness to be confined to that of his neighbour? Do they not feel in themselves, that what pleases at one time, displeases at another, by the change of inclination; and that it is not in their power, by their utmost efforts, to recall that taste or appetite, which formerly bestowed charms on what now appears indifferent or disagreeable? [...] Do <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> philosopher as to a cunning man, to learn something by magic or witchcraft, beyond what can be known by common prudence and discretion? ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{kissed her}} affectionately, and went upstairs with her, {{stopping}} {{at her door}} to give her another embrace, and to say [...] "Bless you, my dear child, and help <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> right decision--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But if he {{knew that}} <b>you</b> had <b>come</b> here he would {{withdraw}} them altogether. Of course, he will know now. That man will be sure to tell him. He will let all London know. Of course, {{it would be so}} when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place of such common resort as Monte Carlo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do," [...] said Bragg, and added, [...] "One thing more. On {{your present}} mission let nothing stop you. Go forward at all costs. If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> river, swim it. If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tree, cut it down. If you strike a fence, climb over it. But don't stop! If you are killed, never mind. Do you understand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't {{take you}} long. You know that path that runs past the {{greenhouses}} {{into the kitchen}} garden. If you go along it, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pond." ...|$|E

6000|$|If <b>you</b> then <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{layer of}} {{limestone}}, {{would you not}} say the same? [...] And if you found that limestone full of shells and corals, dead, {{but many of them}} quite perfect, some of the corals plainly in the very place in which they grew, would you not say--These creatures must have lived down here before the coal was laid on top of them? And if, lastly, below the limestone <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bottom rock quite different again, would you not say--The bottom rock must have been here before the rocks on the top of it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] Julian began, [...] "a {{few hours}} ago <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> momentous decision. <b>You</b> are all at work, {{prepared}} to carry that decision into effect. I have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> because I am very much afraid {{that we have been}} the victims of false statements, the victims of a disgraceful plot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear child, I seem to {{remember}} your admiring Freddy Dabney because he is so heroically poor. It's very good for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place like this. Now you know what it's like to be poor, Marky. You can see precisely how romantic it really is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Her cab's on {{its last}} legs," [...] the Honourable Jimmy warned him, [...] "three {{cylinders}} missing, {{and the fourth}} makes a noise like popcorn when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gradient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rede you to {{say nothing}} of that matter when you get there. You will then journey as though to London until <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair town named Guildford." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet, Sire," [...] {{said the}} Admiral, [...] "before <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{decision}} I should wish {{you to hear}} Captain Sirius, who has a very definite plan of campaign against the English." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'You shall do this,' {{said the}} old woman: 'to-morrow morning, at the first light, you shall go up to yonder {{mountain}},' and {{she pointed to the}} mountain where you are now, stranger, on which the stone Witch sits forever waiting for the world to die. 'Two-thirds of the way up the mountain <b>you</b> will <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> path that is difficult to climb. You shall climb the path and enter a gloomy forest. It is very dark in the forest, but you must push through it till <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open place with a wall of rock behind it. In the wall of rock is a cave, and in the cave you will find the bones of a man. Bring down the bones in a bag, and I will give you the club!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is no {{explanation}} possible," [...] she answered sternly. [...] "Go. You have wrecked {{a life that}} might otherwise have been happy and famous, and then <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mother with an explanation!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, it {{all depends}} upon what stones you meet with," [...] Harry said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> big solid block, I don't see how {{you are going to}} get through it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} you are wise, old man; but I am glad to have you, just the same." [...] He gave Walthew a {{whimsical}} look. [...] "Haven't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decision rather suddenly?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Before I {{go to my}} work," [...] {{said the}} latter, [...] "it is my habit {{to sit here and}} enjoy the scenery and a few puffs. I suppose when <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place like this you throw work to the winds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mention such nonsense, Winifred," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "trying to frighten the boy.

6000|$|About half-way to {{the cabin}} Margery {{suddenly}} stopped and turned round towards the young man, who was following her. [...] "How did <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> guide?" [...] she asked.|$|R

60|$|If, {{after walking}} through the {{entrance}} in the hedge that separated the Brackens from the main road, you turned {{to the left and}} followed a driveway newly laid out between young poplars, <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mass of cedars. Behind these was hidden the stable. There were four stalls, all replete with brass trimmings, and a box, and the carriage-house was made large enough for the break which Mr. Fern had been getting ready to buy when he had been forced, so unexpectedly, to change his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "After that, you go {{perfectly}} straight along {{a sort of}} cart track until <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gate.

6000|$|The {{older man}} {{changed the subject}} abruptly. [...] "You have your own course to consider. Have <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{decision}} yet?
