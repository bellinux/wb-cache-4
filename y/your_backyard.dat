The whole effect rather suggests the idea that Providence and Norman Wilkinson have dropped mutual jealousies and collaborated to produce a background for an open-air Russian Ballet; in point of fact, it is merely the background to your luncheon party. If there is any kick left in Gwenda Pottingdon, or whoever your E.O.N. guest of the moment may be, just mention carelessly that your climbing putella is the only one in England, since the one at Chatsworth died last winter. There isn’t {{such a thing as a}} climbing putella, but Gwenda Pottingdon and her kind don’t usually know one flower from another without prompting.” ...|$|E

50|$|The name, Die Wasgoedlyn (The Washing Line), {{was chosen}} for two reasons. The first being that a washing line (in literal terms) is not usually {{a place where you}} would take your guests. It is usually in <b>your</b> <b>backyard</b> where things are a lot less presentable than the front (street view) of your house. In the same vain Die Wasgoedlyn {{attempts}} to unearth these raw performances of artists in a space (mentally and physically) that they take comfort in - in which {{they do not have to}} pretend. The second reason is that on a washing line you'll find a large variety of items, from work-shirts to church-blouses, patched socks, vest with holes in it, underwear from Jockey, petticoats, etc. Die Wasgoedlyn is as much about putting the artist in their most natural surrounding as it is about surrounding them with other artists - enabling the somewhat mystical bond between creatives to flourish resulting in instinctive collaborations.|$|E
5000|$|Merullo’s {{early works}} have been termed {{thoughtful}} and reflective. [...] "I think I am {{a person who}} cares about the emotional life of people...and so I {{spend a lot of time}} on the emotional experiences of my characters—rather than, say, their intellectual experiences," [...] he once said. [...] But, Golfing with God, Breakfast with Buddha and American Savior exhibited a more overtly spiritual theme - albeit humorous in tone. The seeds of this thematic shift can perhaps be traced to A Little Love Story. However, in the fall of 2008, Merullo surprised many with the release of Fidel’s Last Days, his first thriller. Merullo has addressed these changes saying, [...] "...I've had editors counsel me to write the same book over and over, and some readers who complained that I haven’t kept writing books set in greater Boston. But it would be like trying to keep a migratory bird in <b>your</b> <b>backyard.</b> I just want to go places, to see things, to observe the human predicament in different forms...
