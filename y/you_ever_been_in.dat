500|$|A New Day Has Come {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} the music critics, who noticed that Dion explores a [...] "broader, more adventurous" [...] range of pop music and [...] "dips its toe" [...] into modern music, particularly dance ("Sorry for Love"). However, the album also contains the usual adult contemporary songs, including power ballads like [...] "I Surrender" [...] and [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love", or the title track.

500|$|Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album B−. He felt that A New Day Has Come was [...] "over-arranged" [...] by producers, which works [...] "against Dion's {{enthusiasm for the}} wonders of babies and innocence." [...] Nevertheless, he praised the [...] "jaunty disco" [...] of [...] "Sorry for Love", and [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love" [...] which [...] "builds in {{intensity}} to sound like [...] "a James Bond movie theme as delivered by Barbra Streisand." [...] Tucker described [...] "Rain, Tax (It's Inevitable)" [...] as the most [...] "idiosyncratic" [...] and [...] "idiomatic" [...] song that Dion has ever recorded. According to the positive review from Mike Ross of Jam!, A New Day Has Come [...] "picks up where Falling into You left off." [...] Dion's album is a full of [...] "bombast, melodrama and soaring love ballads indistinguishable from anything she's ever done." [...] Attempts at modernity are [...] "spotty", though [...] "welcome". Ross noticed that ballads are the strongest tracks on the album and praised [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", with [...] "two soaring key changes" [...] in the same song, which is then launched into a [...] "high Earth orbit of melodrama by an orchestra that would make John Williams blush with envy." [...] Barnes & Noble also gave the album favorable review and wrote that the new songs reveal a more [...] "spiritual" [...] and [...] "edgier" [...] Dion. They praised the [...] "uplifting" [...] title track, [...] "heartfelt, country-tinged" [...] "Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)", [...] "anthemic, gospel choir-accented ballad" [...] "Prayer", [...] "bluesy, honky-tonk rocker" [...] "Ten Days", [...] "soaring ballad" [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love", and [...] "solid renditions" [...] of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and [...] "At Last".|$|E

500|$|The album {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Chuck Taylor from Billboard {{gave it a}} favorable review, saying that Dion explores a [...] "broader, more adventurous" [...] range of pop music. Among the highlights, he mentioned [...] "Sorry for Love" [...] where Dion [...] "dishes out her first all-out dance anthem" [...] and holds a twelve-second [...] "authentic note that puts the [...] "d" [...] in diva", [...] "I'm Alive" [...] and [...] "When the Wrong One Loves You Right", which he described as [...] "hitworthy uptempo gems", the rock-leaning [...] "Ten Days", and a Spanish track, [...] "Aun Existe Amor". According to Taylor, Dion does not disappoint with ballads like the [...] "rafter-shaking" [...] "I Surrender" [...] where she sings of [...] "forbidden love amid a firestorm of utterly volcanic instrumentation" [...] and [...] "The Greatest Reward", and two standards – the [...] "diamond-dipped" [...] "Nature Boy" [...] and gospel [...] "At Last". He called the album the most [...] "versatile and gratifying" [...] Dion's recording yet. Larry Flick, also from Billboard wrote about another song, [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Been</b> <b>in</b> Love" [...] that [...] "at a time when music is frightfully aggressive and {{the world at large}} is fraught with turmoil, a classic Dion power ballad is a warm source of comfort." [...] The track [...] "builds from a gentle, piano-laced opening into a deliciously theatrical, string-framed climax." [...] All along, Dion offers an [...] "appealing palette of vocal colors that range from delicate and breathy to full-bodied and appropriately dramatic." ...|$|E

[...] Rebecca Wallwork wrote a positive review for Amazon, calling it [...] "the car-commercial-driven tempo," [...] while Jam!'s Darryl Sterdan named it [...] "a Cher-style eurodisco." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani echoed the same thought, saying that [...] "she gets the Cher treatment on the blazing cover."
