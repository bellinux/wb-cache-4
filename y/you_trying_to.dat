[...] Yost said, [...] "Dutchman, what are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] "Stop 'em", replied Schulz. [...] "But you're supposed to play in the line", Yost insisted. [...] "They'll run over us." [...] "Listen Yost", Schulz claims to have said, [...] "My way is best. [...] If any of 'em gets by me, I'll move back into the line and stay there". [...] Yost eventually saw the wisdom in Schulz's technique, and soon nearly all centers were backing up the line on defense.|$|E
500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I {{want him to do}} something with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be mean?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his younger}} days, Lü Meng was not {{competent}} {{in reading and}} writing. Whenever he issued orders, he had to verbally instruct his subordinates or ask someone to help him write. Cai Yi (蔡遺), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery, scorned him because of that. However, Lü Meng never hated Cai Yi for treating him with contempt. When Gu Shao (顧邵), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, died, Lü Meng recommended Cai Yi to Sun Quan to replace Gu Shao. Sun Quan laughed and asked Lü Meng, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> be like Qi Xi?" [...] He heeded Lü Meng's suggestion.|$|E

2500|$|A {{story is}} {{recorded}} of Ní Mháille chiding her son Tíoboíd {{in the course}} of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: [...] "An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo thóin atá tú, an áit a dtáinig tú as?" [...] ("Are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?"). She is also recorded as saying with regard to her followers [...] "go mb'fhearr léi lán loinge de chlann Chonraoi agus de chlann Mhic an Fhailí ná lán loinge d'ór" [...] (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao's general Yu Jin was {{captured}} by Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng and was held captive in Nan Commandery. After Sun Quan seized control of Nan Commandery, he released Yu Jin and treated him with respect. One day, when Sun Quan travelling on horseback, he asked Yu Jin to ride beside him. Yu Fan saw that and shouted at Yu Jin, [...] "You're a surrendered prisoner-of-war. How dare you ride side-by-side with my lord!" [...] He wanted to hit Yu Jin with his horsewhip but Sun Quan ordered him to stop. Later, when Yu Jin joined Sun Quan in a feast with his subjects on board a ship, he shed tears when he heard music being played. Yu Fan mocked him, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> pretend to plead for mercy?" [...] Sun Quan was very unhappy with Yu Fan.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Gabe gets his picture taken in the photobooth, and when he's grabbing it, a picture of Sabi appears to be stuck in the slit. Both picture's feelings read [...] "Incomplete". Then Gabe makes his goal of the night to find the girl in the picture. While this is happening, Victoria Asher is seen dragging different people into the bathroom, these people including twins and a girl, hence her feeling being [...] "kinky". Gabe goes around the club (his [...] "world" [...] girl I've been all over the world looking for <b>you)</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find Sabi and stumbling upon different people who embrace him in hugs or handshakes. Sabi is seen dancing around the club when her part of the song comes on. Nate Novarro instead of dancing, orders a burger through Vicky-T's iPad; his feeling being [...] "munchy". During the first two thirds of the video, all drinks seem to be taken away from Ryland Blackinton, hence why on his picture he's feeling [...] "thirsty". When Gabe finally finds Sabi, they give each other a look of sheer happiness, before they both enter the photobooth. The lights go off, and at the moment they go back on, Gabe and Sabi seem to be kissing. They take a new picture together, and it reads [...] "Complete", thus ending the video.|$|E

2500|$|When Huang Quan met the Wei emperor Cao Pi, {{the latter}} said, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> emulate Chen Ping and Han Xin when you {{abandoned}} the villains {{and agreed to}} serve me?" [...] Huang Quan replied, [...] "Lord Liu treated me generously so I won't surrender to Sun Quan. I can't return to Shu so I chose to submit to Wei. As a commander of a defeated army, I already feel grateful for being spared from death. Why would I even think about emulating the ancients?" [...] Cao Pi was very impressed with Huang Quan. He appointed Huang Quan as a Palace Attendant (侍中) and General Who Guards the South (鎮南將軍), and enfeoffed him as the Marquis of Yuyang (育陽侯). Later, when other Shu defectors brought news to Wei that Liu Bei had executed Huang Quan's family, Cao Pi ordered a memorial service to be held, but Huang Quan said that the news were false. He was proven right after the defectors were thoroughly questioned. In 223, when news of Liu Bei's death reached Wei, many Wei officials congratulated Cao Pi, except for Huang Quan. Cao Pi knew that Huang Quan would not betray him, {{but he wanted to}} intimidate Huang Quan, so he repeatedly sent messengers to summon Huang to see him. Huang Quan's subordinates were very fearful when they saw that Cao Pi had sent so many messengers but Huang remained calm and composed.|$|E
