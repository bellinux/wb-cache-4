40|$|The {{effects of}} two thread {{construction}} variables, yarn twist and polymeric sizing, on break strength {{were obtained for}} a silica thread and two types of aluminoborosilicate (ABS) threads at temperatures ranging from 23 C to 1200 C. It was shown that increasing the degree of twist for the silica thread produced an optimum twist level until all the <b>yarn</b> <b>finish</b> was removed. The break strength of both ABS threads was inversely proportional {{to the degree of}} twist caused by increased filament breakage with increasing twist that was controlled by the gradual removal of the polymeric processing aids. At elevated temperatures, above 950 C, strength loss was observed for both ABS threads {{because of the presence of}} a glass phase that softens and causes fiber deformation. This was not observed for the silica thread at similar test temperatures because of the higher viscosity of the pure silica glass phase...|$|E

40|$|AbstractSewing {{damage is}} one of the most {{troublesome}} problems for the knitted fabrics and this damage is caused by the resistance of fabric to the penetration of needle during sewing operation. Such resistance comes from the fact that the spaces in fabric (between the fibers or the <b>yarns).</b> <b>Finishing</b> treatments directly affect these spaces and so, the sewability and the sewing conditions of fabrics are affected. The aim of this study is; to research the effect of the parameters, such as knitting structure, softeners type and chemical concentration to the sewability and seam puckering in apparel on cotton knitted fabrics. For this purpose, five various softeners with two concentration were applied to the pre-treated 100 % of cotton single jersey, interlock and fleece fabrics. After applications, the sewability and the seam puckering of all fabrics were measured and the obtain results were statistically evaluated. The softening treatments improved the sewability and seam puckering markedly. Especially, macro silicone emulsion had the lowest needle penetration force value. After softening treatment, seam puckering increased nearly 1. 5 - 2 grades. The lower concentration is sufficient to get same effect...|$|R

40|$|Many {{different}} {{indigenous communities}} from Oaxaca {{have been exposed}} to trade routes that have been active even before the first Europeans came to the continent. Such exposure has led to a “global market” that has influenced the way in which these communities behave. Textiles (from fibres and dyes to <b>yarns</b> and <b>finished</b> cloths) {{have been a part of}} this very active exchange. What could be considered “traditional” now, was in fact very avant-garde at the beginning. Silk is one of the products that has transformed the appearance of Oaxacan textiles: it is soft, it is easy to dye, it offers a very bright and diverse range of colours, and it gives a sheen that contrasts nicely with other fibres, such as cotton and wool. Silk has been dyed with natural and synthetic dyes. Some of the most valued wrap-around skirts from the coast of Oaxaca, said to be dyed with cochineal, consist of hand-spun silk dyed with fuchsine. This aniline has been used to create and develop different techniques of ornamentation. Silk satin or embroidered ribbons have also been used to complement fabrics woven on the back-strap loom. Some communities discontinued their weaving tradition and favoured the use of imported silk satins, taffetas, and velvets [...] all of these by the end of the 19 th century. Silk, therefore, is a raw material that allows us to understand the ever-changing taste of indigenous communities, forcing us to broaden our mindset when referring to “traditional” textiles...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the behavior}} to creasing of some woven materials made from yarns type wool used for ready-made clothes. Factors like fibrous composition, properties of constituent fibers, wovens structure parameters, mechanical properties of {{warp and weft}} <b>yarns</b> and <b>finishing</b> treatments that influenced the recovery capacity from crease/folding were investigated experimentally through several tests which revealed their importance in the process. The creasing of woven materials made from combed yarns type wool used for ready-clothes is an undesired deformation effect with temporary or permanent character, which {{is caused by a}} composed strain of bending and compression during utilization, processing or maintenance. It is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, folds or stripes on the surface of wovens materials, thus diminishing their qualitative appearance and also their practical value. Creasing is the result of irreversible changes created through the reciprocal sliding of structural fiber components when exposed to a bending strain. Creasing is specific to oriented structures with high crystallinity (cellulosic fibers). The sliding appears because of hydrogen bond breaking which can, however, reform easy in other positions conferring a permanent character to creasing. Functional apparel will be subjected {{to a wide range of}} end uses such that a garment will be affected by intern (fibres, yarn fineness warp/weft, fabric density, thickness, fabric count) and external factors (external environment - exposure to sunlight, wind, rain, cold weather conditions, fabric/human body interaction).
