2500|$|George de Mohrenschildt {{testified that}} he [...] "knew that Oswald disliked General Walker." [...] Regarding this, de Mohrenschildt and his wife Jeanne {{recalled}} an incident that occurred the weekend following the Walker assassination attempt. The de Mohrenschildts testified that on April 14, 1963, just before Easter Sunday, they were visiting the Oswalds at their new apartment and had brought them a toy Easter bunny to give to their child. As Oswald's wife Marina was showing Jeanne around the apartment, they discovered Oswald's rifle standing upright, {{leaning against the wall}} inside a closet. Jeanne told George that Oswald had a rifle, and George joked to Oswald, [...] "Were <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who took a pot-shot at General Walker?" [...] When asked about Oswald's reaction to this question, George de Mohrenschildt told the Warren Commission that Oswald [...] "smiled at that." [...] When George's wife Jeanne was asked about Oswald's reaction, she said, [...] "I didn't notice anything"; she continued, [...] "we started laughing our heads off, big joke, big George's joke." [...] Jeanne de Mohrenschildt testified that this was the last time she or her husband ever saw the Oswalds.|$|E
2500|$|This {{marked the}} debut of Henry Mancini for score {{composition}} of an animated feature aside from the animated opening for The Pink Panther. Initially, Mancini composed a song titled [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Who Loves Me?" [...] to serve as parody of a Victorian British music hall. Already in rough animation, the song was recorded by Shani Wallis. However, Katzenberg and the new management desired a more contemporary song as they would help make the film more marketable. Michael Jackson was considered by Eisner to voice a character who would enter the saloon, confront Basil, and sing a song at the tavern, but the suggestion was met with uncomfortable silence for which Eisner withdrew the idea; Eisner later proposed for Madonna to perform the song. Eventually, Melissa Manchester was brought in where she wrote and performed [...] "Let Me Be Good to You" [...] by which the rough animation had to be re-timed and often re-animated to properly sync with the song. Mancini also co-wrote two of the film's three original songs, [...] "The World's Greatest Criminal Mind" [...] and [...] "Goodbye So Soon" [...] (both performed by Vincent Price). Unusually for a Disney animated feature, there was no soundtrack album released alongside the film; it was released in 1992 alongside the film's reissue under its new title by Varèse Sarabande, the only Disney cartoon to have an original soundtrack on the label to date (and the only one not to be issued under a Walt Disney imprint).|$|E
