A series of {{embarrassing}} encounters with English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, {{on one of his}} final trips outside, [...] "My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go." [...] On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: [...] "Terribly weak. Please come." [...] His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found Wilde very depressed after a nightmare. [...] "I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!" [...] "I am sure", Turner replied, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the life and soul of the party." [...] Turner was {{one of the very few}} of the old circle who remained with Wilde right to the end, and was at his bedside when he died.|$|E

6000|$|... "You, young Page!" [...] exclaimed Sir John. [...] "Are you jesting? Ha! then <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have,</b> page-like, <b>been</b> eaves-dropping!--I should scarce {{have thought}} it of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'From mamma!' said she; 'and this one,' {{holding it}} up, 'is for <b>you.</b> It <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hunting us everywhere. How many {{different}} directions!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You met Rateau!" [...] exclaimed Gourdon impatiently. [...] "Impossible! He {{was here}} then, I feel sure. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well! I {{did not see}} you! Fancy your {{sitting in}} the {{twilight}} chatting with the mater. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an unscrupulous bore, maman.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Halloo, Pearson! <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in a skirmish," [...] he said, {{seeing that}} the hunter's head was bound up with a bloodstained bandage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you?</b> It <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a {{wonderful}} romance. I can't conceive of {{anything but a}} love-story keeping youth indoors on a night like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can testify}} to it, good Father," [...] said Gaston. [...] "Ay! and <b>you,</b> Ingram, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> within hearing--to {{say nothing of}} Du Guesclin." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, Mr. Wadsworth, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{reading my}} thoughts!" [...] exclaimed the country boy. [...] "I {{was going to}} suggest that very thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have not}} been copying that wretched concern!' exclaimed Louis. 'Why, Mary, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> at it all night. It is a week's work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--er--I {{might as}} well tell <b>you.</b> I <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> walking in my sleep," [...] stammered Roger, and got red. [...] "I'm as bad as Shadow Hamilton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{girl and}} the {{children}} whom <b>you</b> saw <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> some aristocrats in disguise. The old man who spoke to you was that cursed Englishman--the Scarlet Pimpernel!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That makes thirty francs," [...] {{continued}} Desiree coldly; [...] "and {{now for the}} work. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{a fortnight}} doing all this pretty work." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is going}} beyond your means, foolish child; <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> naughty {{enough to have}} listened, or you could know nothing of our talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, [...] "we {{began to think that}} <b>you</b> two <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> out canoeing and got yourselves drowned in good earnest this time. What <b>have</b> you <b>been</b> doing?" ...|$|R
60|$|CAMMA. Come, come, we {{will not}} quarrel about the stag. I have had a weary day in {{watching}} <b>you.</b> Yours <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a wearier. Sit and eat, And take a hunter's vengeance on the meats.|$|R

6000|$|... "And you," [...] said Middleton. [...] "Have {{you been}} all along in England? For <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{little more than}} an infant at the time." ...|$|E

6000|$|His face {{burned with}} a dark flush. [...] "I don't know how I lived; <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> through these things to know, you would never understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{ashamed of}} it. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> slept well--you <b>are</b> radiant. I am sorry I cannot promise you the Elk for a sitter to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, father, I {{will not}} go away! <b>You</b> <b>must</b> open the door! <b>You</b> <b>must!</b> I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> hunting for you so long--ever since mother died and you disappeared, and now that I have found you, we shall never {{separate}} again. Open the door; do, please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} the poor creature's motive in joining your Community," [...] he said. [...] "To a person of any sensibility her position, among such relatives as <b>you</b> describe, <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> simply unendurable after what had happened.
