500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Doo Rags" [...] contemplates Nas' youth and society's {{cyclical}} nature. It features a contemporary piano loop and jazz tones. Richard Hazell from HipHopDX describes the song as [...] "a piano propelled painting {{of time and}} space as seen through the third eye of Nas, which can easily be envisioned by any New York City dweller." [...] On [...] "My Way", he meditates over his rise out of poverty to the [...] "life of a rich thug", recalls the death of his childhood friend Ill Will, and concedes that he [...] "still feels broke with millions in the bank." [...] On [...] "U Gotta Love It", Nas makes reference to the [...] "'86 crack blitz" [...] and discusses his own significance: [...] "This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment / Now back in the , certain cats they wanna kill me / They ice-grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me." [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever" [...] advises to appreciate life's small epiphanies and be optimistic about the future. On [...] "No Idea's Original", Nas notes the similarities of people in life and views other rappers as creatively derivative, while distinguishing himself from them: [...] "No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun / It's never what you do, but how it's done / What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper / That means you inferior, not major." [...] He references the line [...] "there's nothing new under the sun" [...] from the Book of Ecclesiastes in the song's chorus. [...] "No Idea's Original" [...] samples Barry White's 1973 song [...] "I'm Gonna Love <b>You</b> <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> Little More Baby", a frequently sampled recording in hip hop music.|$|E
