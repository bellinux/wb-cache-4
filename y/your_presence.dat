25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since <b>your</b> <b>presence</b> here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E

Also in 2010, Guy {{was a member of the}} cast of the Alabama Shakespeare Festival and the Alliance Theatre Company co-production of Pearl Cleage’s The Nacirema Society Requests the Honor of <b>Your</b> <b>Presence</b> at a Celebration of Their First One-Hundred Years.

His apartments at court were next to hers, and—perceived as knowing [...] "the Queen and her nature best of any man"—his influence was matched by few. Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth's possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave.

500|$|In 1911 Cobden was {{responsible}} for the Indian women's delegation in the Women's Coronation Procession, a London demonstration organised by suffrage associations from Britain and the Empire. The procession marched on 17 June 1911, a few days before King George V's coronation. During 1910–12 several Conciliation Bills extending the parliamentary vote to a limited number of propertied women, were debated in the House of Commons. When the third of these was under discussion, Cobden sought the help of the Irish Parliamentary Party by reminding them of the support women had given to Ireland during the Land League agitation: [...] "In the name of those 40,000 Englishwomen we urge you to support at every division this Bill by <b>your</b> <b>presence</b> and your vote". The bill was finally abandoned when the Liberal prime minister, H. H. Asquith, replaced it with a bill extending the male suffrage. In protest against the Liberal government's suffrage policies and its harsh treatment of militants, Cobden resigned her honorary presidency of the Women's Liberal Association in Rochdale, her father's last constituency.|$|E

2500|$|Blessed Sister Mary of the Divine Heart Droste zu Vischering {{said that}} in her mystical {{experiences}} Jesus Christ inspired her to build a shrine dedicated to his Sacred Heart. The imposing Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (also referred as Church of the Good Shepherd or Sanctuary of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) was built between 14 July 1957 and 21 April 1966, in the civil parish of Ermesinde in north Portugal, and consecrated to the Heart of Christ in fulfillment of the vow made by the nun. According to the writings of Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Jesus had made this promise: [...] "I will make it a place of graces. I will distribute copiously graces to all who live in this house , those who live here now, those who will live here after, and even to their relatives." [...] Jesus also promised her: [...] "Know this, My daughter, that by the charity of My Heart I desire to pour out floods of graces through your heart over the hearts of others. This is why people will come to you with confidence; {{it will not be}} your personal qualities which will attract them, but Me. No one, even the most hardened sinner, will leave <b>your</b> <b>presence</b> without having received, in one way or another, consolation, relief, or a special grace." ...|$|E

Once a heretic asked Rav Idit why [...] says, [...] "And to Moses He said, ‘Come up to the Lord,'" [...] when surely God should have said, [...] "Come up to Me." [...] Rav Idit replied {{that it was the}} angel Metatron who said that, and that Metatron's name {{is similar to that of}} his Master (and indeed the gematria (numerical value of the Hebrew letters) of Metatron (...) equals that of Shadai (...) , God's name in [...] and elsewhere) for [...] says, [...] "for my name is in him." [...] But if so, the heretic retorted, we should worship Metatron. Rav Idit replied that [...] also says, [...] "Be not rebellious against him," [...] by which God meant, [...] "Do not {{exchange}} Me for him" [...] (as the word for [...] "rebel," [...] ( [...] , tameir) derives from the same root as the word [...] "exchange"). The heretic then asked why then [...] says, [...] "he will not pardon your transgression." [...] Rav Idit answered that indeed Metatron has no authority to forgive sins, and the Israelites would not accept him even as a messenger, for [...] reports that Moses told God, [...] "If <b>Your</b> <b>Presence</b> does not go with me, do not carry us up from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before.

[...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in <b>your</b> <b>presence.</b> [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun."
