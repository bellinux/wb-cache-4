6000|$|... 'I {{will try}} {{everything}} that is possible,' said the wife, who did {{not in the least}} wish her husband to die, but was determined to show that he was more foolish that the other man.

6000|$|He stopped panting at his mother's knees {{where she}} sat on the cabin {{threshold}} nearly as high as he stood. She put up her hand and pushed the wet hair from his forehead. [...] "How you do sweat, Joey! Go round and wash your face at the bench. Maybe Jane will give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of the milk, while it's warm yet, before she lets it down in the well. She's just through milkin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Power," [...] he said, [...] "I don't {{know much}} about you, and you don't seem to know {{anything}} at all about us. I am only at present a member by courtesy of this club, but it isn't often that any one has reason to complain of lack of hospitality here. If you take my advice, you'll apologise to these gentlemen for your shockingly bad behaviour when you came in.

[He throws {{his feet up}} on the sofa.] Don' you make a noise, {{whatever}} you do. You pour out a drink--you make yourself good long, long drink--you take cigarette--you take anything you like. Sh'd never have got in without you. [Closing his eyes.] You're a Tory--you're a Tory Socialist. I'm Liberal myself--have a drink--I 'm an excel'nt chap.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't get you any lemons or oranges neither," [...] {{the woman}} said; [...] "but I might make <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> out of {{molasses}} and herbs, with some spirits in it. I {{have got a}} keg of old rye buried away ever since my man went off, six months ago; I am out of molasses, but I dare say I can borrow some from a neighbor, and as for herbs they are {{about the only thing}} the Yankees haven't stole. I think I could fix you up something that would do. As long as it has got spirits in it, it don't much matter what you put in besides, only it wouldn't do to take spirits alone. You can call it plantation drink, and I don't suppose anyone will ask too closely what it's made of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} {{that you are going}} to stay some time in California. Do you mind my giving you a little advice? I am speaking now of towns that are still rather brusque in their manners. When a man offers <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> accept at once, and then stand drinks all round. I don't say that the second part of the programme is as necessary as the first, but it puts you on a perfectly safe footing. Above all, remember that where you are going you must never carry anything. The men you move among will do that for you. They have been accustomed to it. It is in some places, unluckily, a matter of life and death as well as daily practice to draw first. I have known really lamentable accidents occur from a man carrying a revolver when he did not know what to do with it. Do you understand anything about revolvers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] the Cave-man went on, [...] "there {{are lots}} of ways and {{passages}} through. I guess they went in another direction. The wife generally likes to take a stroll round {{in the morning and}} see some of the neighbours. But, say," [...] he interrupted, [...] "I guess I'm forgetting my manners. Let me get <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> of cave-water. Here, take it in this stone mug! There you are, say when! Where do we get it? Oh, we find it in parts of the cave where it filters through the soil above. Alcoholic? Oh, yes, about fifteen per cent, I think. Some say it soaks all through the soil of this State. Sit down and be comfortable, and, say if you hear the woman coming just slip your mug behind that stone out of sight. Do you mind? Now, try one of these elm-root cigars. Oh, pick a good one--there {{are lots of}} them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all I want {{of it for}} a bit, any way," [...] Rowsell muttered, {{pushing his}} way along the quay. [...] "If there's any of <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>drink,</b> I'm your man. What-ho, Nichols?--Lethbridge?" ...|$|R

6000|$|LANCASTER bore him--such {{a little}} town, [...] Such a great man. It doesn't see him often [...] Of late years, though {{he keeps the}} old {{homestead}} [...] And sends the children down there with their mother [...] To run wild in the summer--a little wild. [...] Sometimes he joins them {{for a day or}} two [...] And sees old friends he somehow can't get near. [...] They meet him in the general store at night, [...] Pre-occupied with formidable mail, [...] Rifling a printed letter as he talks. [...] They seem afraid. He wouldn't have it so: [...] Though a great scholar, he's a democrat, [...] If not at heart, at least on principle. [...] Lately when coming up to Lancaster [...] His train being late he missed another train [...] And had four hours to wait at Woodsville Junction [...] After eleven o'clock at night. Too tired [...] To think of sitting such an ordeal out, [...] He turned to the hotel to find a bed. [...] "No room," [...] the night clerk said. [...] "Unless----" [...] Woodsville's a place of shrieks and wandering lamps [...] And cars that shook and rattle--and one hotel. [...] "You say 'unless.'" [...] "Unless you wouldn't mind [...] Sharing a room with someone else." [...] "Who is it?" [...] "A man." [...] "So I should hope. What kind of man?" [...] "I know him: he's all right. A man's a man. [...] Separate beds of course you understand." [...] The night clerk blinked his eyes and dared him on. [...] "Who's that man sleeping in the office chair? [...] Has he had the refusal of my chance?" [...] "He was afraid of being robbed or murdered. [...] What do you say?" [...] "I'll have to have a bed." [...] The night clerk led him up three flights of stairs [...] And down a narrow passage full of doors, [...] At the last one of which he knocked and entered. [...] "Lafe, here's a fellow wants to share your room." [...] "Show him this way. I'm not afraid of him. [...] I'm not so drunk I can't take care of myself." [...] The night clerk clapped a bedstead on the foot. [...] "This will be yours. Good-night," [...] he said, and went. [...] "Lafe was the name, I think?" [...] "Yes, Layfayette. [...] You got it the first time. And yours?" [...] "Magoon. [...] Doctor Magoon." [...] "A Doctor?" [...] "Well, a teacher." [...] "Professor Square-the-circle-till-you're-tired? [...] Hold on, there's something I don't think of now [...] That I had on my mind to ask the first [...] Man that knew anything I happened in with. [...] I'll ask you later--don't let me forget it." [...] The Doctor looked at Lafe and looked away. [...] A man? A brute. Naked above the waist, [...] He sat there creased and shining in the light, [...] Fumbling the buttons in a well-starched shirt. [...] "I'm moving into a size-larger shirt. [...] I've felt mean lately; mean's no name for it. [...] I just found what the matter was to-night: [...] I've been a-choking like a nursery tree [...] When it outgrows the wire band of its name tag. [...] I blamed it on the hot spell we've been having. [...] 'Twas nothing but my foolish hanging back, [...] Not liking to own up I'd grown a size. [...] Number eighteen this is. What size do you wear?" [...] The Doctor caught his throat convulsively. [...] "Oh--ah--fourteen--fourteen." [...] "Fourteen! You say so! [...] I can remember when I wore fourteen. [...] And come to think I must have back at home [...] More than a hundred collars, size fourteen. [...] Too bad to waste them all. You ought to have them. [...] They're yours and welcome; let me send them to you. [...] What makes you stand there on one leg like that? [...] You're not much furtherer than where Kike left you. [...] You act as if you wished you hadn't come. [...] Sit down or lie down, friend; you make me nervous." [...] The Doctor made a subdued dash for it, [...] And propped himself at bay against a pillow. [...] "Not that way, with your shoes on Kike's white bed. [...] You can't rest that way. Let me pull your shoes off." [...] "Don't touch me, please--I say, don't touch me, please. [...] I'll not be put to bed by you, my man." [...] "Just as you say. Have it your own way then. [...] 'My man' is it? You talk like a professor. [...] Speaking of who's afraid of who, however, [...] I'm thinking I have more to lose than you [...] If anything should happen to be wrong. [...] Who wants to cut your number fourteen throat! [...] Let's have a show down as an evidence [...] Of good faith. There is ninety dollars. [...] Come, if you're not afraid." [...] "I'm not afraid. [...] There's five: that's all I carry." [...] "I can search you? [...] Where are you moving over to? Stay still. [...] You'd better tuck your money under you [...] And sleep on it the way I always do [...] When I'm with people I don't trust at night." [...] "Will you believe me if I put it there [...] Right on the counterpane--that I do trust you?" [...] "You'd say so, Mister Man.--I'm a collector. [...] My ninety isn't mine--you won't think that. [...] I pick it up a dollar at a time [...] All round the country for the Weekly News, [...] Published in Bow. You know the Weekly News?" [...] "Known it since I was young." [...] "Then you know me. [...] Now we are getting on together--talking. [...] I'm sort of Something for it at the front. [...] My business is to find what people want: [...] They pay for it, and so they ought to have it. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me--he's editor-- [...] Feel out the public sentiment--he says. [...] A good deal comes on me when all is said. [...] The only trouble is we disagree [...] In politics: I'm Vermont Democrat-- [...] You know what that is, sort of double-dyed; [...] The News has always been Republican. [...] Fairbanks, he says to me, 'Help us this year,' [...] Meaning by us their ticket. 'No,' I says, [...] 'I can't and won't. You've been in long enough: [...] It's time you turned around and boosted us. [...] You'll have to pay me more than ten a week [...] If I'm expected to elect Bill Taft. [...] I doubt if I could do it anyway.'" [...] "You seem to shape the paper's policy." [...] "You see I'm in with everybody, know 'em all. [...] I almost know their farms as well as they do." [...] "You drive around? It must be pleasant work." [...] "It's business, but I can't say it's not fun. [...] What I like best's the lay of different farms, [...] Coming out on them from a stretch of woods, [...] Or over a hill or round a sudden corner. [...] I like to find folks getting out in spring, [...] Raking the dooryard, working near the house. [...] Later they get out further in the fields. [...] Everything's shut sometimes except the barn; [...] The family's all away in some back meadow. [...] There's a hay load a-coming--when it comes. [...] And later still they all get driven in: [...] The fields are stripped to lawn, the garden patches [...] Stripped to bare ground, the apple trees [...] To whips and poles. There's nobody about. [...] The chimney, though, keeps up a good brisk smoking. [...] And I lie back and ride. I take the reins [...] Only when someone's coming, and the mare [...] Stops when she likes: I tell her when to go. [...] I've spoiled Jemima in more ways than one. [...] She's got so she turns in at every house [...] As if she had some sort of curvature, [...] No matter if I have no errand there. [...] She thinks I'm sociable. I maybe am. [...] It's seldom I get down except for meals, though. [...] Folks entertain me from the kitchen doorstep, [...] All in a family row down to the youngest." [...] "One would suppose they might not be as glad [...] To see you as you are to see them." [...] "Oh, [...] Because I want their dollar. I don't want [...] Anything they've not got. I never dun. [...] I'm there, and they can pay me if they like. [...] I go nowhere on purpose: I happen by. [...] Sorry there is no cup to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>drink.</b> [...] I drink out of the bottle--not your style. [...] Mayn't I offer you----?" [...] "No, no, no, thank you." [...] "Just as you say. Here's looking at you then.-- [...] And now I'm leaving you a little while. [...] You'll rest easier when I'm gone, perhaps-- [...] Lie down--let yourself go and get some sleep. [...] But first--let's see--what was I going to ask you? [...] Those collars--who shall I address them to, [...] Suppose you aren't awake when I come back?" [...] "Really, friend, I can't let you. You--may need them." [...] "Not till I shrink, when they'll be out of style." [...] "But really I--I have so many collars." [...] "I don't know who I rather would have have them. [...] They're only turning yellow where they are. [...] But you're the doctor as the saying is. [...] I'll put the light out. Don't you wait for me: [...] I've just begun the night. You get some sleep. [...] I'll knock so-fashion and peep round the door [...] When I come back so you'll know who it is. [...] There's nothing I'm afraid of like scared people. [...] I don't want you should shoot me in the head. [...] What am I doing carrying off this bottle? [...] There now, you get some sleep." [...] He shut the door. [...] The Doctor slid a little down the pillow.|$|E

5000|$|Food {{and eating}} were {{frequent}} themes of Satie's own extramusical humor. His poverty made him uncomfortably familiar with hunger at times, leading to his wry observation, [...] "It's odd.

[...] According to his brother Conrad, the composer's appetite was gargantuan on those occasions when {{he was able to}} eat to his heart's content: he could devour a 30-egg omelette or 150 oysters in one sitting. His affinity for the bawdy, food-obsessed Rabelais is made clear in the Trois petites pièces montées.|$|E
