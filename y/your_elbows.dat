50|$|In 1948 Handley's whodunnit novel Kiss <b>Your</b> <b>Elbow</b> {{was first}} published. Its setting is the New York {{theatrical}} scene. To mark their sixtieth anniversary in 2009, Harlequin NA republished Kiss <b>Your</b> <b>Elbow</b> {{as one of}} their six earliest books, with the original text and cover art.|$|R

Apparently one of {{his efforts}} got home on <b>your</b> <b>elbow</b> instead of <b>your</b> {{expressive}} countenance, and whether it was that <b>your</b> <b>elbow</b> was particularly tough or his wrist particularly fragile, I don't know. Anyhow, it went. It's nothing bad, but it'll {{keep him out of}} the game tomorrow." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But there's {{no reason}} you shouldn't learn the manner. That's the way I succeeded. Fix {{your eye on}} one of the bottles; put your thumbs in your waist-coat pockets; stick out <b>your</b> <b>elbows,</b> bend your knees a little, and then go ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are now," [...] said Florizel, [...] "in {{the middle}} of the bridge. Lean <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> on the parapet and look over. As the water rushing below, so the passions and {{complications}} of life carry away the honesty of weak men. Let me tell you a story." ...|$|E
60|$|But come; {{for the sun}} burns bright, {{and fishing}} is impossible: lie down upon the bank, above this stop. There is a campshutting (a {{boarding}} in English) on which you can put <b>your</b> <b>elbows.</b> Lie down on your face, and look down through two or three feet of water clear as air into the water forest where the great trout feed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had I been at <b>your</b> <b>elbow,</b> it is {{possible}} that something better might have been done; but two months;--they run by--oh, so quickly!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But I {{certainly}} would not employ a tradesman just at <b>your</b> <b>elbow</b> who has directly opposed what was generally understood in the town to be your interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] growled a grim rammer-and-sponger behind me; [...] "it's all devilish {{fine for}} you nobs to look at; {{but what would}} you say if you had to holy-stone the deck yourselves, and wear out <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> in {{polishing}} this cursed old iron, besides getting a dozen at the gangway, if you dropped a grease-spot on deck in your mess? Ay, ay, devilish fine for you, but devilish dull for us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{reindeer}} sprang {{high for}} joy. The robber-girl lifted little Gerda up, {{and had the}} foresight to tie her on firmly, and even gave her a little pillow for a saddle. 'You must have your fur boots,' she said, 'for it will be cold; but I shall keep your muff, for it is so cosy! But, so that you may not freeze, here are my mother's great fur gloves; they will come up to <b>your</b> <b>elbows.</b> Creep into them!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Algie!' said Lady Wetherby, tensely. 'I don't {{know what}} you've come here for, and I don't {{remember}} {{asking you to}} sit down and put <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> on that table, but I want to begin by saying that I will not be called Pauline. My name's Polly. You've got a way of saying Pauline, {{as if it were a}} gentlemanly cuss-word, that makes me want to scream. And while you're about it, why don't you say how-d'you-do to Claire? You ought to remember her, she was my bridesmaid.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just a taste, William, son, of what {{my father}} give me often enough," [...] Old Tarwater crooned, as he laid on his son's back and {{shoulders}} with the single-tree. [...] "Observe, I ain't hitting you on the head. My father had a gosh-wollickin' temper and never drew the line at heads when he went after tar.--Don't jerk <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> back that way! You're {{likely to get a}} crack on one by accident. And just tell me one thing, William, son: is there nary notion in your head that I'm crazy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Letty, I am {{ashamed of}} you," [...] said her mother, {{wringing}} out the caps from the tub. [...] "When your brother began, {{you ought to}} have waited {{to see if he could}} not tell the story. How rude you look, pushing and frowning, as if you wanted to conquer with <b>your</b> <b>elbows!</b> Cincinnatus, I am sure, would have been sorry to see his daughter behave so." [...] (Mrs. Garth delivered this awful sentence with much majesty of enunciation, and Letty felt that between repressed volubility and general disesteem, that of the Romans inclusive, life was already a painful affair.) [...] "Now, Ben." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't truckle, and I {{hate being}} patronized {{as much as}} you do!" [...] {{returned}} Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions arose. [...] "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean {{to make the most of}} every chance that comes. You can go through the world with <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. That's not my way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Modesty {{is always}} admirable,’ chuckled the theorist. ‘But yet I assure you, {{a man like}} you, with such a man as, say, Doctor Gotthold at <b>your</b> <b>elbow,</b> would be, for all {{practical}} issues, my ideal ruler.’ ...|$|R

5000|$|Put the crutch on so {{the open}} {{end of the}} cuff faces away from your body. Position the cuff one to two inches below <b>your</b> <b>elbow,</b> around the {{thickest}} part of your forearm. Grip the handles firmly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I've {{worked as}} hard as most other men, but somehow I don't seem to have gone to {{windward}} as the rest did," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I was too easy with the money, and a little slack in other ways. Still, your blood's red, Jimmy, and there's a streak of hard sand in you. You got it from your mother; {{it was she who}} made me. Hard work don't count, boy. You want to get <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> into the other people who're standing in your way. Well, I'm glad there's that streak of grit in you. You'll get those fingers on the throat of the man who brought your father down, and gripe the life out of him, some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dears, I do. But then, I protest, I'm not fairly treated. I think, {{for a young}} American girl, {{who looks}} as most of my fair friends do look, to come down with her bright eyes and all her little panoply of graces upon an old fellow like me, and expect him to like a fashion merely because she looks well in it, is all sheer nonsense. Why, girls, if you wore rings in your noses, and bangles on your arms up to <b>your</b> <b>elbows,</b> if you tied your hair in a war-knot {{on the top of}} your heads like the Sioux Indians, you would still look pretty. The {{question}} isn't, as I view it, whether you look pretty,--for that you do, and that you will, do what you please and dress how you will. The question is whether you might not look prettier, whether another style of dress, and another mode of getting up, would not be far more becoming. I am one who thinks that it would." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{handed me}} a small book bound in red cloth. It was a guide to English {{conversation}} {{for the use of}} German travellers. It commenced [...] "On a Steam- boat," [...] and terminated [...] "At the Doctor's"; its longest chapter being devoted to conversation in a railway carriage, among, apparently, a compartment load of quarrelsome and ill-mannered lunatics: [...] "Can you not get further away from me, sir?"--"It is impossible, madam; my neighbour, here, is very stout"--"Shall we not endeavour to arrange our legs?"--"Please have the goodness to keep <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> down"--"Pray do not inconvenience yourself, madam, if my shoulder is of any accommodation to you," [...] whether intended to be said sarcastically or not, there was nothing to indicate--"I really must request you to move a little, madam, I can hardly breathe," [...] the author's idea being, presumably, that by this time the whole party was mixed up together on the floor. The chapter concluded with the phrase, [...] "Here we are at our destination, God be thanked! (Gott sei dank!)" [...] a pious exclamation, which under the circumstances must have taken the form of a chorus.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not then}} {{know it was}} Miss Mordaunt I had been so {{fortunate}} as to serve; but here is Mr. Newcome at <b>your</b> <b>elbow,</b> Follock, and dying to be introduced, as he sees I have been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{sit down}} again," [...] {{answered}} Pepper, merrily. [...] "And next time keep <b>your</b> <b>elbow</b> {{out of my}} ribs," [...] he added. [...] "Come on, we don't want to get left!" [...] he added to his chums.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Great Scot, it's lucky you've got a {{business}} man at <b>your</b> <b>elbow.</b> I couldn't stand that chap at any price. A bit too hairy in the fetlocks for my taste. Couldn't {{you see that}} he was only bluffing?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{do not say}} so,' {{returned}} the other; 'but I look on these things from a different side, and when the life is done my interest falls. The man has lived to serve me, to spread black looks under colour of religion, or to sow tares in the wheat-field, as you do, in a course of weak compliance with desire. Now that he draws so near to his deliverance, he can add but one act of service--to repent, to die smiling, and thus to build up in confidence and hope the more timorous of my surviving followers. I am not so hard a master. Try me. Accept my help. Please yourself in life as you have done hitherto; please yourself more amply, spread <b>your</b> <b>elbows</b> at the board; and when the night begins to fall and the curtains to be drawn, I tell you, for your greater comfort, that you will find it even easy to compound your quarrel with your conscience, {{and to make a}} truckling peace with God. I came but now from such a deathbed, and the room was full of sincere mourners, listening to the man's last words: and when I looked into that face, which had been set as a flint against mercy, I found it smiling with hope.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, stiffen your {{backbone}} {{and stick}} out your chin, and square <b>your</b> <b>elbows,</b> and really amount to something. Why do you simply flop about {{and do nothing}} and leave everything to what you call 'the family'? Why {{do you have to}} be helped all the time? Why don't you help yourself? Why do you have to have jobs found for you? Why don't you rush out and get one? Why do you have to worry about what, 'the family' thinks of you? Why don't you make yourself independent of them? I know you had hard luck, suddenly finding yourself without money and all that, but, good heavens, everybody else in the world who has ever done anything has been broke at one time or another. It's part of the fun. You'll never get anywhere by letting yourself be picked up by the family like... like a floppy Newfoundland puppy and dumped down in any old place that happens to suit them. A job's a thing you've got to choose for yourself and get for yourself. Think what you can do--there must be something--and then go at it with a snort and grab it and hold it down and teach it to take a joke. You've managed to collect some money. It will give you time to look round. And, when you've had a look round, do something! Try to realize you're alive, and try to imagine the family isn't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|But the honours of such benchfellowship can be accorded but to few, and {{the task}} becomes very {{tiresome}} when the spectator has to enter the Court as an ordinary mortal. There are two modes open to him, either of which is subject to grievous penalties. If he be the possessor of a decent coat and hat, and can scrape any acquaintance with any one concerned, he may get introduced to that overworked and greatly perplexed official, the under-sheriff, who will stave him off if possible,--knowing that even an under-sheriff cannot make space elastic,--but, if the introduction has been acknowledged as good, will probably find a seat for him if he persevere to the end. But the seat when obtained must be kept in possession from morning to evening, and the fight must be renewed from day to day. And the benches are hard, and the space is narrow, and {{you feel that the}} under-sheriff would prod you with his sword if you ventured to sneeze, or to put to your lips the flask which you have in your pocket. And then, when all the benchfellows go out to lunch at half-past one, and you are left to eat your dry sandwich without room for <b>your</b> <b>elbows,</b> a feeling of unsatisfied ambition will pervade you. It is all very well to be the friend of an under-sheriff, but if you could but have known the judge, or have been a cousin of the real sheriff, how different it might have been with you! ...|$|E
