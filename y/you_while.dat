5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on the Big Three television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are <b>You!,</b> <b>while</b> others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Savior" [...] {{deviates}} {{from the}} social and political topics normally discussed in Rise Against songs, and is instead about forgiveness and broken relationships. It {{tells the story of a}} couple who have recently split up. The two attempt to reconcile their differences, with lines such as [...] "I don't hate you, boy / I just want to save <b>you</b> <b>while</b> there's still something left to save." [...] Hanson and Liz Ramanand of Loudwire have characterized the lyrics as [...] "poignant", and [...] "poetic".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of [...] "The Wave" [...] was generally positive. Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly named {{it one of}} the best tracks on Happy to <b>You,</b> <b>while</b> Will Salmon of Clash and Amber Genuske of The Huffington Post called it a standout. Exclaim! Ashley Hampson deemed it [...] "incredibly catchy", writing that it [...] "capitalize on the falsetto musings of vocalist Andrew Wyatt". Andy Baber of musicOMH described the track as [...] "much more like the Miike Snow that many came to know and love". The writer praised the piano and marching drums for [...] "giving the song a sense of direction that the opener lacked". Caroline Sullivan, writing for The Guardian, commented that [...] "a martial beat, contrastingly languid vocals and a snaggy hookline give 'The Wave' a toothsome kick", and Slant Magazine's Kevin Liedel wrote that the beat [...] "succeeds".|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics who {{called it a}} beautiful film and a complete entertainer, according to International Business Times India. Prabalika M. Borah of The Hindu praised the performances of the film's cast, {{the work of the}} technical crew, and Kumar's execution of the film's script in narrating a complex story without confusion. She summarised, [...] "The smile and laughter will not leave <b>you</b> <b>while</b> it still manage to moisten your eyes here and there". Sandhya Rao of Sify stated, [...] "Manam`s story is something new within Telugu films context, but the way the film showcases romance and emotion, it is far from a regular fare. Go watch Manam, a complete entertainer, which will surely enthrall!". She recognised Nageswara Rao as the pillar of the film and termed his performance as an [...] "outstanding" [...] one.|$|E
500|$|Rajeev Masand {{also gave}} the film a {{positive}} review, calling it [...] "a barrel of non-stop laughs": [...] "It puts the fun {{back into the}} movies. You laugh harder than you have in a long time. It’s a film with a one-point agenda – to entertain <b>you</b> <b>while</b> you’re in your seat. It achieves that, no two ways about it." [...] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu noted [...] that Dostana [...] "largely reflects a society in transition and begins to address the issues of acceptance within the Indian framework of marriage": [...] "Dostana is great mass entertainment manipulating the inherent homophobia of a country {{on the threshold of}} change, but what’s significant is that it will bring parents and children together to share laughs over alternative sexuality and related issues that will no longer remain in the closet." ...|$|E
500|$|Such musicians as Todd Rundgren, Robert Palmer and Madonna {{have stated}} they were {{influenced}} by I Want <b>You,</b> <b>while</b> songs from the album have been sampled by such hip hop artists as EPMD to Mary J. Blige, who sampled the title track for her hit song [...] "Be Happy". The careers of neo soul and R musicians including D'Angelo, Musiq Soulchild, R. Kelly, Maxwell (particularly on Urban Hang Suite), Sade, and Prince show {{the influence of the}} soulful sound and equally romantic and erotic lyrics of I Want You, Let's Get It On and Leon Ware's Musical Massage. According to one critic, Ware's arrangements [...] "solidified the suite-like theme for the album." [...] Much like Let's Get It On, slow jam music, as well as modern soul and the quiet storm genre, are now viewed by critics to have been engendered by I Want You and by Gaye.|$|E

500|$|The album's first recording, [...] "Let's Get It On", was {{composed}} by Gaye with {{friend and former}} Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye's preliminary mix of Stover's draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly [...] "about making sweet love." [...] Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter's presence during the album's recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently {{became the basis for}} his 1976 album I Want <b>You.</b> <b>While</b> recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH {{said that the}} song was [...] "probably the best thing here [...]" [...] He also complimented the [...] "brilliant bridge" [...] and {{the ending of the}} song where the caller gets through to her voicemail. Popjustice gave the song a positive review: [...] "It's a little bit like Gwen's 'What You Waiting For?' meets Timbaland's 'The Way I Are' meets about fifty other things... The structure's quite exciting... there is something tumultuously brilliant about Beyoncé's contribution that makes everything seem fine and as if it was the plan all along." [...] Evan Sawdey from PopMatters said that [...] "The much talked-about Beyoncé collaboration 'Telephone', which—with its double-time beat and rapid-fire verses—proves {{to be one of the}} most adrenaline-pumped songs that Gaga has yet crafted, the whole thing feeling like it's about to veer of [...] the tracks at any moment simply due to the giddy excitement shared between the two divas, easily turning it into the unquestioned highlight of The Fame Monster". Mikael Woods from Los Angeles Times felt that [...] "Telephone" [...] is [...] " [...] a carefully considered meditation on how annoying it is when a dude keeps calling <b>you</b> <b>while</b> you're throwing down at the club." [...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN Music praised [...] "Ave Maria", {{writing that}} it shows Knowles in [...] "crystal clear form" [...] {{due to the}} mellow accompaniment that {{highlighted}} her [...] "often captivating" [...] voice. Darryl Sterdan, writing for the Canadian website Jam!, noted that Knowles [...] "draws on the classic composition for this sweeping number" [...] and echoes a similar line to John Lennon's quote: [...] "Life {{is what happens to}} <b>you</b> <b>while</b> you're busy making other plans." [...] Talia Kraines of BBC Online called the song [...] "very strange, but wonderful". In his consumer guide, Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "But me, I'm a hater, and thus I'm something like outraged, by not just those two pimp-outs but an 'Ave Maria' lacking even the dumbstruck literalism of Pink's rendition or the grotesque conversion of 'Umbrella' into 'Halo.'" [...] Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald wrote that the song was [...] "pompous and frankly embarrassing". Colin McGuire of PopMatters commented that [...] "Ave Maria" [...] is a [...] "pretty normal take, a piece that has simply been done too many times before to think [...] would even have a shot at putting her stamp on it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the song as [...] "dreary". According to James Reed of The Boston Globe, the song is [...] "an intriguing proposition torpedoed by a soggy arrangement". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times gave a negative review for the song, writing that the high notes included [...] on [...] "Ave Maria", [...] "should have remained a secret between Beyonce and her producers". In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the song at number ten on their list of ten best Knowles' songs. They further added, [...] "The new classic kicks off with the plucking off some light strings and you know by the end you'll be singing through tears." ...|$|E

2500|$|And [...] when Moses {{said to his}} people, [...] "O my people, indeed {{you have}} wronged yourselves by your taking of the calf [...] So repent to your Creator and kill yourselves.

2500|$|P-Orridge has vociferously criticized {{contemporary}} Christianity, {{describing it}} as [...] "an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion", and {{arguing that it}} was based upon the tenet of [...] "Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish <b>you</b> <b>while</b> you're alive...". [...] P-Orridge maintains that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the [...] "ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 208, when Cao Cao {{became the}} Han Chancellor, Cui Yan was {{appointed}} as a Senior Clerk in the East and West Bureaus (東西曹掾屬). The {{order from the}} Han imperial court conferring the appointment on Cui Yan read, [...] "You possess the style of Boyi {{and the integrity of}} Shi Yu (史魚).

We have meddled with no will, nor hidden one. We simply refuse {{to aid in the}} discovery of an unjust document, and by so doing prevent a great wrong being done to ourselves.

2500|$|The {{recording}} process {{also was}} marked by disputes: the label refused Hartman's request to name the album God Gave Rock and Roll to <b>You</b> <b>while</b> a bluesy, crowd-favorite track written by Hartman about rejecting the pre-Christian self, [...] "Killing My Old Man," [...] was deemed too controversial and cut from the album (the song would later appear on the album Never Say Die). With a harder-edged sound reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, Come and Join Us was released in 1977. It failed to sell well, however, and Myrrh dropped Petra from its label.|$|E

[...] I understand that regulations of the Buffalo Bill show require that no Indian shall be given any liquor. [...] You all know that I do not drink, and I am going to keep you all from it. [...] Don’t think because you may be closely related to me I will shield you, for I will not. [...] I will report to Colonel Cody immediately anyone I find drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his defeat}} at Red Cliffs, Cao Cao {{returned}} to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and left Cao Ren and others behind to defend Jiangling County (江陵縣; present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), {{the capital of}} Nan Commandery (南郡). Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu led their troops towards Nan Commandery and were separated from Cao Ren's forces by the river. Liu Bei told Zhou Yu, [...] "Cao Ren is defending Jiangling and he has much supplies in the city. He poses a big threat to us. I'll send Zhang Yide with 1,000 men to accompany <b>you,</b> <b>while</b> you despatch 2,000 troops to follow me. We'll then cross the Xia River (夏水; {{a tributary of the}} Yangtze River starting from southeast of Shashi District and ending at north of Jianli County in Hubei) and attack Cao Ren's rear.
