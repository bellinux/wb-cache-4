25|$|The plot is {{centered}} on a bachelor man called Asker, who wants to see and choose his bride before marriage. His wife quest, however, is difficult because in that time (in the 19th century) based on traditions women were kept at home and when allowed out they were heavily covered in hijab and because actually you {{were not allowed to}} know who <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married with in the 19th century. Asker's friend Suleyman suggests him disguising as a fabric peddler, a sure way to meet women. Asker agrees and starts to go round the houses selling fabrics.|$|E
500|$|For the CGI used {{throughout}} the film, companies Rhythm & Hues (R) and Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) developed {{different parts of the}} film. R focused on the animation of the animals, while ILM completed the final scene of the ark rushing through Washington D.C. Lindy De Quattro, the ILM associate visual effects supervisor, revealed that [...] "This is the first time where we had to do a whole series of shots that were happening mid-day, where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a really long look at the water and what it was doing." [...] The company initially experienced problems creating the water effects and had to develop new tools which would choreograph the movements of the water. In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film Poseidon. Lighting was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a greenscreen stage, and the visual effects company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.|$|E
2500|$|They {{studied the}} book and built Steve Davis's own {{technique}} {{on it in the}} 1970s. He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname [...] "Nugget" [...] because, according to Hearn, [...] "you could put your case of money on him and you knew <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> paid." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, Lynch {{moved with}} his wife and {{daughter}} to Los Angeles, where he began studying filmmaking at the AFI Conservatory, a place that he would later describe as being [...] "completely chaotic and disorganized, which was great... you quickly learned that if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something done, you would have to do it yourself. They wanted to let people do their thing." [...] He began writing a script for a proposed work titled Gardenback, which had [...] "unfolded from this painting I'd done". In this venture he was supported by a number of figures at the Conservatory, who encouraged him to lengthen the script and add more dialogue, something that he reluctantly agreed to do. Nonetheless, with all the interference on his Gardenback project, he became fed up with the Conservatory and quit after returning to start the second year and being put in first year classes. Dean of the AFI, Frank Daniel, asked Lynch to reconsider, believing {{that he was one of}} the school's best students. Lynch agreed on the condition that he could create his own project that would not be interfered with. Feeling that Gardenback was [...] "wrecked", he instead set about on a new film, which he called Eraserhead.|$|E
2500|$|Their live {{performances}} were notoriously hit-or-miss, and were usually far more rough-edged than their recordings; the Horrible Truth of their live album (The Horrible Truth About Burma) being an in-joke about their inconsistency. Boston critic Tristam Lozaw described Mission of Burma live: [...] "When they were good, {{they were very}} very good, but when they were bad they were horrid ... But that {{was the nature of}} the beast ... Because they took chances, you never knew whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one of the most spectacular experiences of your life or {{if it was going to}} be a ball of incomprehensible noise." [...] While the band's improvisational side and the unpredictable chaos of Swope's tape work contributed a little to this inconsistency, the two main factors were (as Lozaw implies) the live sound and the pacing and timing of their sets. When faced with a venue where the sound system or room acoustics weren't up to the task of conveying clarity along with the band's trademark volume, Swope always refused to compromise, and opted for volume. The band's set lists (composed by committee a few minutes before going on stage) could range from well-constructed to seemingly picked at random, and (aside from [...] "Secrets" [...] as a frequent opener and [...] "All World Cowboy Romance" [...] or a cover as an encore) there was a general reluctance to repeat any song placement or sequence that had worked in the past.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one.

Oh, Peter, hurry up and get well, for we are having such good times and we miss you so much. I have coaxed Uncle Alec not to burn his potato stalks till you are well, because I {{remember}} how you always liked to see the potato stalks burn. Uncle Alec consented, though Aunt Janet said it was high time they were burned. Uncle Roger burned his last night and it was such fun.|$|E
6000|$|Armine {{knew there}} was no chance of an {{immediate}} and entire recovery for him, and this was a severe stroke to Babie, who was quite unprepared. And, as her face began to draw up with tears near the surface, he hugged her close, and consolingly whispered that now they would be together always, he should not have to go away from his own dear Babie Bunting, and there was a little kissing match, ending by Babie saying, disconsolately, [...] "But you did like Eton so, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the Newcastle and the Prince Consort's prize, and to be in the eleven and all—-and you were so sure of a high remove!

6000|$|So far in this {{controversy}} I can get no answer {{at all from}} Judge Douglas upon these subjects. Not one can I get from him, except that he swells himself up and says, [...] "All of us who stand by {{the decision of the}} Supreme Court are the friends of the Constitution; all you fellows that dare question it in any way are the enemies of the Constitution." [...] Now, in this very devoted adherence to this decision, in opposition to all the great political leaders whom he has recognized as leaders, in opposition to his former self and history, there is something very marked. And the manner in which he adheres to it,--not as being right upon the merits, as he conceives (because he did not discuss that at all), but as being absolutely obligatory upon every one simply because of the source from whence it comes, as that which no man can gainsay, whatever it may be,--this is another marked feature of his adherence to that decision. It marks it in this respect, that it commits him to the next decision, whenever it comes, as being as obligatory as this one, since he does not investigate it, and won't inquire whether this opinion is right or wrong. So he takes the next one without inquiring whether it is right or wrong. He teaches men this doctrine, and in so doing prepares the public mind to take the next decision when it comes, without any inquiry. In this I think I argue fairly (without questioning motives at all) that Judge Douglas is most ingeniously and powerfully preparing the public mind to take that decision when it comes; and not only so, but he is doing it in various other ways. In these general maxims about liberty, in his assertions that he [...] "don't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down,"; that [...] "whoever wants slavery has a right to have it"; that [...] "upon principles of equality it should be allowed to go everywhere"; that [...] "there is no inconsistency between free and slave institutions"--in this he is also preparing (whether purposely or not) the way for making the institution of slavery national! I repeat again, for I wish no misunderstanding, that I do not charge that he means it so; but I call upon your minds to inquire, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the best instrument you could, and then set it to work in the most ingenious way, to prepare the public mind for this movement, operating in the free States, where there is now an abhorrence of the institution of slavery, could you find an instrument so capable of doing it as Judge Douglas, or one employed in so apt a way to do it? ...|$|E
