500|$|Along with Ohiya, Pattipola and Ambewela, Horton Plains forms {{one of the}} Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Together {{with the}} {{adjacent}} Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Horton Plains contains 21 bird species which occur only on Sri Lanka. Four, Sri Lanka blue magpie, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, and Sri Lanka wood pigeon, occur only in Horton plains, while other endemic species [...] include Sri Lanka spurfowl, Sri Lanka junglefowl, yellow-fronted barbet, orange-billed babbler, Sri Lanka bush warbler, and Sri Lanka whistling-thrush. Many birds migrate here in winter including swiftlets, and alpine swift. Crested serpent eagle, mountain hawk-eagle, black-winged kite, and peregrine falcon are among the birds of prey found in Horton Plains. Harriers are among the migratory raptors. This is a key wildlife area. All six highland endemic birds are found here, including dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, and Sri Lanka bush warbler. <b>Yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> and black-throated munia are widespread throughout the highlands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> was {{formerly}} {{classified in the}} monotypic genus Kelaartia, named after Dr. E.F. Kelaart. Alternate names for the <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> include the Ceylon bulbul, Sri Lanka bulbul and yellow-tufted bulbul.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> {{appears on}} the 10-rupee Sri Lankan postage stamp and {{can also be seen}} on the new LKR රු5000 note of Sri Lanka.|$|E
50|$|Sexes {{are similar}} in plumage, but young birds are duller than adults. The flight is {{bouncing}} and woodpecker-like. <b>Yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbuls</b> feed on fruit and insects.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus penicillatus) is {{a species}} of {{songbird}} in the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is an endemic resident breeder in the highlands of Sri Lanka. The common name is also used as an alternate name for the yellow-throated bulbul.|$|E
50|$|Two {{species of}} birds found in Sri Lanka are named after him: the black-throated munia (Lonchura kelaarti) and the hawk-eagle Nisaetus kelaarti. The Sri Lankan {{subspecies}} of jungle nightjar, Caprimulgus indicus kelaarti, also refers to Kelaart. The disused monotypic genus Kelaartia (<b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul)</b> likewise commemorated him.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> {{is about}} 20 cm in length, {{with a long}} tail. It has olive upperparts and {{yellowish}} underparts. The crown of the head is grey, and there are yellow ear tufts and a yellow patch below the eye. There is a white tuft {{in front of the}} eye and the throat is also white.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-throated bulbul was {{originally}} described by Thomas Jerdon in the genus Brachypus (a synonym for Pycnonotus), and later re-classified {{it in the}} genus Ixos. It has since been re-classified to the genus Pycnonotus. The alternate name <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul</b> {{should not be confused}} with the species of that name, Pycnonotus penicillatus. The name 'yellow-throated bulbul' is also used as an alternate name for Falkenstein's greenbul.|$|E
50|$|The {{city is a}} {{base for}} visits to Horton Plains National Park. This is a key {{wildlife}} area of open grassy woodland. Species found here include the leopard, sambar, and the endemic purple-faced langur. Endemic highland birds include the dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, and <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul.</b> The plains have a well-visited tourist attraction at World's End — a sheer precipice with a 1050 m drop. The return walk passes the scenic Baker's Falls. Early morning visits are best, both to see the wildlife and to view World's End before mists close in during the later part of the morning.|$|E
50|$|Avifauna of {{the reserve}} {{exhibits}} {{a high degree of}} variety and endemicity. Some of the noteworthy species include mountain hawk-eagle, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, jungle nightjar, Sri Lanka blue magpie, <b>yellow-eared</b> <b>bulbul,</b> brown-capped babbler, orange-billed babbler, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka bush warbler, Sri Lanka whistling thrush, spot-winged thrush, common blackbird, and Sri Lanka white-eye. All five species of bird which are strictly endemic to this ecoregion are present in the reserve. Common birds are scarlet minivet, small minivet, black bulbul, Sri Lanka scimitar babbler, grey-headed canary-flycatcher, pied bushchat, and Sri Lanka scaly thrush. Indian pitta, Asian brown flycatcher, Kashmir flycatcher, Indian blue robin, pied thrush, black-throated munia, and large-billed leaf warbler are amongst the large number of migratory species.|$|E
40|$|Montane zone mixed-species bird flock {{system is}} {{distinct}} from that of low-land wet zone of SriLanka, although some species are present in both systems. The present study identified the mixed speciesflocks of birds in Riverstan at Knuckles Region, Sri Lanka. Monthly transect counts and opportunisticobservations were made between January and May, 2012. A total of 78 flocks and 27 bird species wereencountered at Riverstan during the study period. The flock size varied between 2 to 13 species and 4 to 58 individuals. The mean number of species per flock was 6. 03 ± 2. 25 and the mean number ofindividuals in a flock was 18. 41 ± 9. 87. The flock size {{was positively correlated with}} the number of speciespresent (r = 0. 756, P < 0. 05). Grey-headed Canary Flycatcher was the most abundant species (mean 2. 68 ± 1. 02 birds per flocks) while Sri Lanka White-eye was the most frequent species (mean 5. 69 ± 3. 92 birds per flocks). Grey-headed Canary Flycatcher and Sri Lanka Scimitar-babbler were the nuclear speciesin Riverstan. The leading species were Sri Lanka white-eye and Sri Lanka <b>Yellow-eared</b> <b>Bulbul.</b> Differentbird species used different heights within flocks.
