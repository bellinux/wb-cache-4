5|$|Johann Ludwig Schneller {{brought in}} skilled Arab laborers from Bethlehem and Beit Jala to {{construct}} a total of eight buildings, which were constructed in stages and completed in the early 20th century. The <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> {{and the name of}} the German city in which the donors for that building lived were engraved on each building façade. One of the buildings, called “the Red House” or “the model house,” was built entirely from materials produced on the orphanage grounds, including bricks, floor tiles and wrought-iron work.|$|E
5|$|The cornerstone, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} corner of the building, bears the dates 1872, the start of construction, and 1878, the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b> The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15, 1978, the centennial of the building's completion. Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture, although several coins from the era remained intact. Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan's history, people, and lifestyles. At the lawn's southeast corner is the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial, a 1924-bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the Union.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion,</b> the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; this distinction is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether formal clinical research training is of value in the initiation of a successful career as a clinical investigator. We conducted a retrospective review of the career choices of all 25 fellows who entered the Academic Clinical Research Track at Brigham and Women's Hospital since its inception in 1995 and examined the impact of formal clinical research training during their fellowship on their career choice. The primary measure of a successful career as a clinical investigator was the obtainment of external funding for clinical research within 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> fellowship. Thirteen of the 25 fellows (52 %) received a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree at the Harvard School of Public Health during their fellowship. Ten of these 13 fellows (77 %) obtained external funding for clinical research within 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> their fellowship. None of the 5 fellows who had already obtained an MPH degree prior to their fellowship and none of the 7 fellows who completed a 7 -week summer Program in Clinical Effectiveness but did not complete an MPH degree attempted to receive external funding for clinical research within 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> their fellowship. We conclude that formal clinical research training culminating in an MPH degree was extremely valuable in the initiation of a successful career as a clinical investigator...|$|R

25|$|The church {{combines}} the staggered layered {{design of the}} earliest (1505–08) part of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower, the central tent of the Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye (1530s), and the cylindric shape of the Church of Beheading of John the Baptist in Dyakovo (1547), but the origin of these unique buildings is equally debated. The Church in Kolomenskoye, according to Sergey Podyapolsky, was built by Italian Petrok Maly, although mainstream history has not yet accepted his opinion. Andrey Batalov revised the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> of Dyakovo church from 1547 to the 1560s–70s, and noted that Trinity Church could have had no tangible predecessors at all.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than eight}} months after {{breaking}} ground, the Empire Center's first stores opened in October 2001. Local officials estimated the complex would generate about $3.2 {{million a year in}} sales tax revenue for the city, and as many as 3,500 local jobs. Within a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion,</b> the Empire Center was helping the city to post healthy growth in sales tax revenues despite a down economy. Alone, the Empire mall generated close to $800,000 in sales tax revenues {{in the second quarter of}} 2002. The outdoor mall's buildings hark back to Lockheed's glory days by resembling manufacturing plants. Each of the outdoor signs features a replica of a Lockheed aircraft, while the mall design brings to mind an airport, complete with a miniature control tower.|$|E

On the list of tallest structures are the 19th century Manchester Town Hall and the Refuge Assurance Building (now more {{commonly known as the}} Palace Hotel) from the early 20th century. The Manchester Assize Courts, once the tallest building in the city at 85 metres, was demolished after suffering unrepairable damage during the Manchester Blitz.|$|E
500|$|Lochner's {{identity}} remained unknown for centuries, and {{no other}} known works {{were associated with the}} Dombild altarpiece. In 1816 Ferdinand Franz Wallraf identified him as Philipp Kalf, based on a reading of a name inscribed on the cloth of a figure on the right of the centre panel. He misinterpreted markings on the stone floor pictured in Annunciation to read 1410, which he took as the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b> Johann Dominicus Fiorillo discovered a 15th-century record that read [...] "in 1380 there was an excellent painter in Cologne called Wilhelm, who had no equal in his art and who depicted human beings as if they were alive". In 1850 Johann Jakob Merlo identified [...] "Maister Steffan" [...] with the historical Stefan Lochner.|$|E
500|$|Ryūjō ( [...] "Prancing Dragon") {{was a light}} {{aircraft}} carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the early 1930s. Small and lightly built {{in an attempt to}} exploit a loophole in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, she proved to be top-heavy and only marginally stable and was back in the shipyard for modifications to address those issues within a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion.</b> With her stability improved, Ryūjō returned to service and was employed in operations during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During World War II, she provided air support for operations in the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, where her aircraft participated in the Second Battle of the Java Sea. During the Indian Ocean raid in April 1942, the carrier attacked British merchant shipping with both her guns and her aircraft. Ryūjō next participated in the Battle of the Aleutian Islands in June. She was sunk by American carrier aircraft at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942.|$|E

40|$|Drug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (DR-TB) {{has been}} reported in India, but has been rarely documented in children. HIV co-infection has led to resurgence of tuberculosis (TB), making treatment even more difficult due to complex drug interactions. Poly-resistant TB is rare in children, especially in HIV-infected children. We report an HIV-infected child who developed poly-resistant TB (resistance to Streptomycin and Isoniazid) after 3 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>completion</b> <b>of</b> anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). His mother had also received ATT 3 years back.
