50|$|One subspecies, Mauremys mutica kami, is {{currently}} {{recognized in the}} Ryukyu Islands. Research has shown unexpected genetic diversity in M. mutica, raising the possibility that additional subspecies might exist.

Several hybrid Asian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> that were described as new species {{have been found to}} be hybrids. Fujian <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> (Mauremys iversoni) are hybrid specimens mainly produced in Chinese turtle farms, usually from matings between female <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtles</b> and golden coin turtles (Cuora trifasciata) males.

We first obtained an ecogeographical favourability model for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> We then modelled the presence/absence of the red-eared slider in the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> range and obtained an encroachment favourability model. We also obtained a favourability model for the red-eared slider using the ecogeographical favourability for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> as a predictor.

We also calculated favourability overlap between the two species, which is their simultaneous favourability. Grids with low overlap had higher favourability values for the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and, consequently, were of lesser conservation concern. A few grids had high values for both species, being potentially suitable for coexistence. Grids with intermediate overlap had similar intermediate favourability values for both species and were therefore areas where the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> was more vulnerable to encroachment by the red-eared slider. We mapped the favourability overlap to provide a map of vulnerability of the Mediterranean <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> to encroachment by the red-eared slider.

50|$|This species inhabits ponds, creeks, swamps, {{marshes and}} other bodies of shallow, slow-moving water.

50|$|The Japanese-style garden {{takes up}} {{about half the}} land area (approximately 33060 m2). Renowned {{gardener}} Ogawa Jihei VII, also known as Ueji, created the garden over a 20-year period. The water used in the ponds comes from the Lake Biwa Canal. Species otherwise rare in Japan such as Acheilognathus cyanostigma, the <b>Yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> and the Japanese pond turtle live around the ponds.

5000|$|It hybridizes vigorously {{with its}} {{relatives}} in captivity {{and in the}} wild, and hybrids may be fertile. Several of these {{have been described as}} new species, such as the Fujian pond turtle ("Mauremys" [...] × iversoni), a hybrid between (usually) males of this species and females of the Asian <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys mutica). In addition, the golden coin turtle is suspected to be a parent of the supposed species Chinese false-eyed turtle and Philippen's striped turtle.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{threatened}} with extinction. China {{is the largest}} consumer of turtles {{in the world and}} this trade has been cited as the greatest threat to Asian turtles including M. mutica. Most of the turtle trade is destined for human consumption but traditional medicine and the pet trade are also driving demand for turtles. Habit loss and water pollution are additional impacts. The IUCN considers M. mutica an endangered species and it is listed in CITES Appendix II.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species is}} notorious {{for its ability}} to produce hybrids with other Geoemydidae, even species that are only distantly related. The {{supposed}} new species [...] "Mauremys" [...] pritchardi was based on a hybrid of unknown origin between a male of this species and a female <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys mutica). Furthermore, it has hybridized with the Chinese stripe-necked turtle (Ocadia sinensis), female Malayan box turtles (Cuora amboinensis), a male four-eyed turtle (Sacalia quadriocellata), and the Japanese pond turtle (Mauremys japonica) in captivity.|$|E

As of July 2010, 17 juvenile turtles were released from captivity. This process is known as headstarting, where hatchlings are raised in captivity until they are large enough to avoid predators and then released to the wild.|$|R
50|$|Mauremys reevesii, {{commonly}} known as the Chinese <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> the Chinese three-keeled <b>pond</b> <b>turtle,</b> or Reeves' turtle, is a species of turtle in the family Geoemydidae, a family which was formerly called Bataguridae. The species is endemic to Asia.|$|R

50|$|The Fujian pond turtle, {{described}} as Mauremys iversoni, is a farm-bred hybrid, between yellow pond turtles (usually females) {{and the golden}} coin turtle or Cuora cyclornata (usually males). Similarly, the turtles {{described as}} Mauremys pritchardi are farm-bred and wild-occurring hybrids between the Chinese pond turtle and the <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle.</b> While {{it is not unusual}} for valid species of geoemydid turtles to arise from hybrids, this is yet to be discussed with M. pritchardi; M. iversoni is probably not, since they only seem to be produced in farms and most males are sterile.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys mutica), is a {{medium-sized}} (to 19.5 cm), semi-aquatic turtle {{in the family}} Geoemydidae. This species has a characteristic broad yellow stripe extending behind the eye and down the neck; the carapace ranges in color from grayish brown to brown and the plastron is yellow or orange with black blotches along the outer edges. It is found in East Asia, ranging from central Vietnam, north through the coastal provinces of south and central China. Additional insular populations are found in Taiwan, Hainan, Ryukyu Islands, and Japan. The Japanese populations {{are believed to have}} been introduced as a result of imports from Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{parents of}} this hybrid are the Asian <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> {{and the golden}} coin turtle, with the male {{apparently}} usually of the latter species. While {{it is not unusual}} for perfectly valid geoemydid species to arise from hybridization, recognition as a species would require that the hybrids are fertile and constitute a phenotypically distinct and self-sustaining lineage. This does not appear to be the case in this [...] "species" [...] as only single specimens have been found rather than an entire population of these turtles and captive breeding has rarely been successful as most males proved to be infertile (while females are fully fertile).|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} species raised by Chinese turtle farmers is the Chinese {{softshell}} turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis), accounting for over 97% of all reported sales, {{both in terms}} of head count (124.8 million in the 684-farm sample) and weight. Large-scale production of this species appears to have been successful in satisfying China gourmets' demand for its meat, which has been reflected in the price drop: while in the mid-1990s, wild-caught softshelled turtles retailed for CNY 500 per Chinese pound or jin (500 g), and farm-raised ones at over CNY 200 / Chinese pound,by 1999 the price for farm-raised softshelled turtles dropped to CNY 60 per Chinese pound, and by 2009, to merely CNY 15-16 per Chinese pound. Other species bred and raised in large numbers (in excess of 10,000 per year, each) in China are the wattle-necked softshell turtle (Palea steindachneri), Chinese pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii), <b>yellow</b> <b>pond</b> <b>turtle</b> (Mauremys mutica), Chinese stripe-necked turtle (Ocadia sinensis) and red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans).|$|E

The hybrid offspring are perfectly fertile, which is not the case in Mauremys iversoni for example, another intergeneric hybrid, and have been bred in F2 already, all juveniles resembling their parents (and not the parental species) perfectly as well. Genetic studies verify its hybrid origin but scientists are unsure of the time of creation. According to Wink et al. 2001 it might well be a very ancient hybrid, while Parham et al. 2001 suppose that it is of rather recent origin.|$|E
