25|$|Cross a brook, and {{you lose}} the King of England; but you have some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>him</b> dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>him</b> once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the play {{has also been}} criticised for some hints of anti-Semitism, {{specifically}} [...] "the disparaging remarks made about moneylenders, who were often Jewish." [...] It {{is true that the}} moneylender Moses is portrayed in a comparatively positive light, but the way he is described (as a [...] "friendly Jew" [...] and an [...] "honest Israelite" [...] by Rowley in III.1) suggest that he is in some way to be considered an exception to Jews in general; also, his own usurious business practices as stated to Sir Peter are clearly less than exemplary (e.g., his statement [...] "If he appears not very anxious for the supply, you should require only forty or fifty per cent; but if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>him</b> in great distress, and want the moneys very bad, you may ask double" [...] ). It may be significant that in Johann Zoffany's portrait of Robert Baddeley as Moses, we find that [...] "Under his arm Moses holds a rolled parchment of the Surface family tree that is used as an auction hammer, and he seems to be ticking off pictures in the catalogue", although in the play Careless is the auctioneer in the relevant scene (IV.1) and Moses has a relatively minor role.|$|E
