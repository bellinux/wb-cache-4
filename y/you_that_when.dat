Tamar Anitai, also of MTV Buzzworthy summarized the performance saying it [...] "was all about her [...] "I-I'm-still-a-diva" [...] vocals, frenzied stage show, and adult-only innuendo...And then this happened." [...] She went on to comment also sarcastically, [...] "This is so just Christina Aguilera's way of saying she loves you! And that the diminutive diva still {{has a sense of}} humor....It's like a little knowing wink that assures <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> she's not changing diapers and doing mommy stuff, Mamaguilera's hanging out at dance party sex dungeons and wailing from the bottom of her light-up hoo-ha. She is DEFINITELY not the same girl who once bopped around on the Disney Channel in a Scrunchie." ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Newman and Alan Jones {{suggest that}} the mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle, Rex Stout and Agatha Christie were all obvious {{influences}} on Tenebrae, {{and there are many}} references to these authors throughout the film. One example is the use of a quote from Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's novel The Sign of Four (1890): [...] "How often have I said to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" [...] A variation of this quote is delivered many times in Tenebrae. Another reference is the dog attack: as something of a non sequitur, the scene is thought by Newman to be a likely nod to Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles (1901–1902). Neal is seen to be reading this novel in an early scene. The imagery in the beach flashback references the American mystery film Suddenly, Last Summer (1959), especially the scene of Eva Robin's wearing white while kneeling in the sand, which is a direct reference to Elizabeth Taylor in that film.|$|E

Smith Brothers want it never to be said that this charge was fixed up through influence. They {{challenge}} the fight but want protection against a conspiracy and a court chosen by their enemies.

I warrant <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> the humpbacked baron caught thee by the cowl, which he hath almost torn off, thou hadst {{been in a}} fair plight, had they not remembered an old friend and come in to the rescue. Why, man, I found them {{fastened}} on him myself; and there was odd staving and stickling to make them 'ware haunch!' Their mouths were full of the flex, for I pulled {{a piece of the}} garment from their jaws.

2500|$|Now that we {{are talking}} about {{literary}} subjects I ask you if you know a great writer, Rafael Barrett, with a free and bold spirit. With tears in my eyes and on my knees I beg <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> you have a national or two to spend, go straight to Mendesky's, or any other library- and ask for a copy of [...] "Looking the life" [...] of this author. I think that it was published in Montevideo. Is a great book, and reading it soothed me from the foolishness of Giusti, Soiza, O'Reilly and my cousin Alvarito Melián Lafinur.|$|E
2500|$|His biographer Silvanus P.

The papers had been full of the wonders of Röntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until Röntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper & seen the photographs, he wrote Röntgen a letter saying that [...] "I need not tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made" [...] He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896. (See also N rays.) ...|$|E
