2500|$|Usually a Presbyterian {{church will}} not have statues of saints, nor the ornate altar more typical of a Roman Catholic church. Instead, one will find a [...] "communion table," [...] usually {{on the same level}} as the congregation. [...] There may be a rail between the communion table and the [...] "Chancel" [...] behind it, which may contain a more {{decorative}} altar-type table, choir loft, or choir stalls, lectern and clergy area. [...] The altar is called the communion table and the altar area is called the Chancel by Presbyterians. In a Presbyterian (Reformed Church) there may be an altar cross, either on the communion table or on a table in the chancel. By using the [...] "empty" [...] cross, or cross of the resurrection, Presbyterians emphasize the resurrection and that Christ is not continually dying, but died once and is alive for all eternity. Some Presbyterian church buildings are often decorated with a cross that has a circle around the center, or Celtic cross. [...] This not only emphasized the resurrection, but also acknowledges historical aspects of Presbyterianism. [...] A baptismal font will be located either at the entrance or near the chancel area. Presbyterian architecture generally makes significant use of symbolism. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>also</b> find decorative and ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from the bible. Some Presbyterian churches will also have ornate statues of Christ or Graven Scenes from the Last Supper located behind the Chancel. St. Giles Cathedral ( [...] Church Of Scotland- The Mother Church of Presbyterians) does have a Crucifix next to one of the Pulpits that hangs alongside. The image of Christ is more of faint image and more modern design.|$|E
