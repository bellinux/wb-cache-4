2500|$|Messy Little Raindrops {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. A predominantly positive review came from Jon O'Brien of AllMusic who awarded it {{four out of}} five stars, saying that [...] "Messy Little Raindrops is a cohesive and adventurous follow-up that will undoubtedly continue [...] ascent into pop's premier league", and praising the songs [...] "Promise This", [...] "Amnesia" [...] and [...] "Happy Tears". Tom Hocknell of BBC Music was generally positive, labeling Messy Little Raindrops a [...] "competent and frequently enjoyable pop album." [...] Johnny Dee of Virgin Media noticed that with Messy Little Raindrops Cole is [...] "returning to base" [...] and described it as [...] "good, clean, family-friendly fun".
