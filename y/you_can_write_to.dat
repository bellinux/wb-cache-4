6000|$|The {{other man}} nodded. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I'm sorry, because after {{what you have}} told me I almost {{think we should have}} hit it tolerably well together. At any time you think I could be of service, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You'll soon {{be making}} friends," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>write</b> <b>to</b> me"; and with a queer smile he added: [...] "You're only just {{beginning}} life; you mustn't take these things to heart; you'll find plenty of people better able to advise and help you than ever I shall be!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then there's another matter. Managing my farm won't {{help you}} much, and I feel that I owe {{something}} to the settlement. If {{it looks as if}} the moneylender would be too strong for you, and you're short of funds, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> me.

Compared to your health and happiness, the loss of that house, even if it should burn up while you are away, would be as a penny thrown to a beggar." ...|$|E

Now, here is Sammy's money--for his {{travelling}} expenses and his other necessities; I have calculated that that will be enough for a four months' trip, and you wont want to stay longer than that. But if this runs out, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> <b>to</b> me.

50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} {{a new type}} of library was made available: Connection Libraries. These are {{programs}} in their own right that can execute independently as well as import and export data and functions to other programs in arrays of structure blocks. For example, the networking component of the operating system is available as a connection library, allowing other programs to use its services by exporting and importing functions. Upon linkage each client gets a dedicated structure block to keep state information in. A program that uses the network might import a network-write function and export a network-read function. Thus, if you open a network connection (e.g., using TCP), when data arrives for you to read, the networking component can directly call your function to consume it, without having to first copy the data to a buffer and do a context switch. Likewise, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> data <b>to</b> the network by directly calling a network-write function.|$|R
