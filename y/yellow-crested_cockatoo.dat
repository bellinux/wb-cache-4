40|$|Several {{bird species}} are sexually monomorphic. In this case, {{molecular}} approach is an efficient method for their sex determination. The sexes of monomorphic birds {{can be determined}} by PCR amplification of the CHD genes. CHD genes are preserved within avian Z and W sex chromosomes. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine sex of 21 individuals quails, pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoos</b> based on CHD genes using two pairs of primers: 2550 F- 2718 R and P 2 -P 8. Samples from Kampong chickens and ducks were used as controls. PCR products were screened by agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide. Results showed that 2550 F and 2718 R primers could be used to identify sex of Kampong chickens, quails, ducks, pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> Individuals showed double (ZW) and single (ZZ) bands were identified as females and males, respectively in Kampong chickens, quails, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos</b> and <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> Males and females in ducks and pigeons showed single band in different length of base pairs. P 2 and P 8 primers could be used to identify the sex of pigeons, hill myna, salmon-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> and <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoos.</b> All of those samples showed bouble (ZW) bands for females and single (ZZ) band for males...|$|R
500|$|In 1896, 56 {{species of}} birds were found, {{including}} the crested white-eye. Twelve additional species were found in 1981. Subsequent zoological surveys [...] found other bird species on the mountain. More than 90 bird species have been found on Mount Tambora. Local people hunt Yellow-crested cockatoos, Zoothera thrushes, hill mynas, green junglefowl, and rainbow lorikeets for the cagebird trade. Orange-footed scrubfowl are hunted for food.

50|$|The {{smallest}} of the <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> subspecies, it is endemic to Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia. The diet consists mainly of seeds, buds, fruits, nuts and herbaceous plants.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} 87 {{species of birds}} {{protected}} in this region, with 7 bird taxa endemic to the island of Sumba. These are Sumba <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> Sumba green pigeon, Sumba flycatcher, Sumba cicadabird, apricot-breasted sunbird and Sumba hornbill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> nests in tree cavities. The {{eggs are}} white {{and there are}} usually two in a clutch. The {{incubation}} is shared by both parents. The eggs are incubated for about 28 days and the chicks leave the nest about 75 days after hatching.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this survey}} was to know the {{abundance}} status of the <b>Yellow-crested</b> Small <b>Cockatoo</b> (Cacatua sulphurea parvula) and Yellow-headed Lorikeet (Trichoglossus euteles) in Alor, East Nusa Tenggara Province. There were four sites observation in the survey, namely: (i) Air Mancur preparatory Village (in and around of Tuti Adigae Natural Tourism Park, East Alor Sub-district), (ii) Tanglapui Village (Kampong Irawuri) (East Alor Sub-district), (iii) Probur Village (Kampong Wormanem) (Southwest Alor Sub-district), and (iv) Bota Village (Northwest Alor Sub-district). The survey was used by bird encounter rates per unit time method. The population of birds approached by abundance score value. Fifty species of birds or 64. 9 % of 77 species of birds that found in Alor recorded during field working. The yellow-headed lorikeet observed more abundant with five abundance score and the numbers per 10 hours observation were 58. 06.

However, the <b>yellow-crested</b> small <b>cockatoo</b> knows in the fields in direct observation nesting in the old nest site of Canarium trees...|$|R
50|$|There is an {{introduced}} {{population of}} these birds in Hong Kong. They {{are a common}} sight across the densely populated area {{on both sides of}} the harbour, easily spotted in the woods and public parks in the north and west of Hong Kong Island. The large group has apparently developed from a number of caged birds that have been released into the Hong Kong skies over many years. An often repeated story is that Hong Kong Governor Sir Mark Aitchison Young released the Government House's entire bird collection - including a large number of <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoos</b> - hours before surrendering Hong Kong to Japanese troops in December 1941.|$|R
50|$|The blue-eyed {{cockatoo}} is a large, approximately 50 cm long, mainly {{white cockatoo}} with an erectile yellow and white crest, a black beak, dark grey legs, {{and a light}} blue rim of featherless skin around each eye, that gives this species its name. The sexes are very similar in appearance. Some males have a dark brown iris and some females have a reddish-brown iris, but this small difference is not always reliable as a gender indicator. The blue-eyed cockatoo is easily mistaken for the <b>yellow-crested</b> and sulphur-crested <b>cockatoos,</b> but has a more rounded crest with more white to the frontal part, and a brighter blue eye-ring. The Blue-eyed cockatoo reaches full maturity after 4 years and lives an average of 50 years.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the three species of corellas found in Australia. However, corellas are smaller, lack the prominent yellow crest and have pale bills. In captivity, the sulphur-crested cockatoo is easily confused with the smaller <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> or the blue-eyed cockatoo with a differently shaped crest and a darker blue eye-ring.|$|E

A similar incident, with another New Zealand fur seal coming ashore, occurred in August 2014.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> is {{critically}} endangered. Numbers have declined dramatically due to illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. Between 1980 and 1992, over 100,000 of these birds were legally exported from Indonesia yet a German proposal submitted to CITES {{to move it}} to Appendix I was not approved. It has since been moved to Appendix I. The current population is estimated at fewer than 7,000 individuals and {{is thought to be}} declining in number.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is home to}} Babirusa, both {{species of}} {{endangered}} Anoa - miniature water buffaloes - and 155 bird species, of which 37 are endemic to Sulawesi.

50|$|Cacatua is a genus of {{cockatoos}} found {{from the}} Philippines and Wallacea {{east to the}} Solomon Islands and south to Australia. They have a primarily white plumage (in some species tinged pinkish or yellow), an expressive crest, and a black (subgenus Cacatua) or pale (subgenus Licmetis) bill. Today several species from this genus are considered threatened due {{to a combination of}} habitat loss and capture for the wild bird trade, with the blue-eyed cockatoo, Moluccan cockatoo and umbrella cockatoo considered Vulnerable, and the red-vented cockatoo and <b>yellow-crested</b> <b>cockatoo</b> considered Critically Endangered.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, 56 {{species of}} birds were found, {{including}} the crested white-eye. Twelve further species were found in 1981. Several other zoological surveys followed, and found other bird species on the mountain, resulting in over 90 bird species discovered on Mount Tambora. Yellow-crested cockatoos, Zoothera thrushes, hill mynas, green junglefowl and rainbow lorikeets are hunted for the cagebird trade by the local people. Orange-footed scrubfowl are hunted for food.
