5|$|Following Rhoda, Kavner had a guest {{appearance}} on Taxi and {{appeared in the}} 1985 comedy Bad Medicine {{as well as the}} 1987 film Surrender, both of which were box office failures. She appeared in the television movies Revenge of the Stepford Wives, No Other Love and A Fine Romance, and shot a television pilot. She also starred in several stage plays, including a play called It Had to be <b>You</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> dinner theater in Canada, Particular Friendships in New York City in 1981, and Two for the Seesaw, directed by Burt Reynolds. Woody Allen first saw Kavner one night while he was watching Rhoda in the 1970s. He thought that she was remarkable and later offered her a role in his 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters. Kavner agreed, and credits Allen and the film with rejuvenating her career.|$|E

Its {{foremost}} triumph is that it leaves you with a powerful emotion: Happiness!" [...] Indo-Asian News Service gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi! comes as close to being a modern masterpiece as cinematically possible. To miss {{it would be a}} crime. To embrace it is to serenade the sublime". Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis rated the film 4 out of 5 and remarked that movie [...] "engages <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> personal level", and further added that, [...] "Barfi cannot be missed. It demands patience, but the payoff is incredible".|$|E
500|$|The two {{modified}} {{cars were}} prepared for the Swedish Grand Prix at Anderstorp on 17 June 1978, for Niki Lauda and John Watson. When not in use, the fan was covered by a dustbin lid, but {{it soon became clear}} what the modified Brabham was intended to achieve: when the drivers blipped the throttle, the car could be seen to squat down on its suspension as the downforce increased. Lotus driver Mario Andretti said [...] "It is like a bloody great vacuum cleaner. It throws muck and rubbish at <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> hell of a rate". Murray says that this was untrue: [...] "The fan couldn't spit anything out the back because the fan e-flux [...] was only 55mph. Besides the radial fan would have sent any stones flying sideways". The legality of the cars was soon protested, but they were allowed to race. They qualified second and third behind championship leader Andretti. In the race, Watson spun off on the 19th lap. Once a back-marker dropped oil onto the track and with both major front-runners out the race, the remaining Brabham was in a class of its own, seemingly unaffected by the slippery surface. Lauda passed Andretti around the outside of one of the corners, who dropped out shortly afterwards due to a broken valve, and went on to win by over half a minute from Riccardo Patrese in an Arrows.|$|E

2500|$|On Metacritic, Fantasy Ride {{received}} {{a score of}} 60 out of 100, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". BBC Music states: [...] "When listing great pop stars of the 2000s, it's more than likely that Ciara will be unfairly forgotten. It's just as exciting to hear the slow jams as the club tracks, thanks to the detailed and often strange sounding backing tracks. She uses her silky vocals on softer tracks such as the Ne-Yo produced [...] "I Don't Remember" [...] or the delicate [...] "Never Ever" [...] to great effect. Only [...] "Like a Surgeon" [...] with its somewhat bizarre sex/hospital metaphors may leave <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> loss for words. Overall it is a record that manages to make you dance as much as retreat to the bedroom, Fantasy Ride is an album which could take Ciara to the much deserved next level. Slant Magazine also gave the album a positive review ending the review by calling the album [...] "Ciara's smoothest ride ever".|$|E
2500|$|The best {{alternative}} to a negotiated agreement, or BATNA is the alternative option a negotiator holds should the current negotiation fails and does not reach agreement. [...] The quality of a BATNA {{has the potential to}} improve a party's negotiation outcome. Understanding one's BATNA can empower an individual and allow him or her to set higher goals when moving forward. One of the best strategy while going into a negotiation is to ensure that you have a strong BATNA, and if not, have tools equipped that can help you made the other side's BATNA weak. One of the major mistakes made by new negotiators is to disclose their BATNA at first without having had any discussion with the other side. This can jeopardise your position in the negotiation, as your negotiation might have been weaker than the other sides, and such disclosure puts <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> weaker spot in the negotiation. The best strategy is to {{ask a lot of questions}} to develop, if not an exact, but a guess about the other sides BATNA to know your position in the negotiation.|$|E
