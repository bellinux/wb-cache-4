Shortly after the New Zealanders arrived in Egypt, he was commanding a squad practising on a rifle range when visited by the division's commander, Major General Bernard Freyberg, who asked him how the men were shooting. [...] "How would <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> bloody well shoot?", replied Hinton, [...] "not enough bloody rations, stinking heat and sand". [...] Freyberg asked him to repeat the comment, which he did word for word. Freyberg took note of Hinton's name and instructed him to carry on. There was a subsequent increase in rations, while Hinton was advised by his company commander {{on how best to}} speak to senior officers.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask our young men and women to go over and to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> defend this country? How can <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

"There's {{an incurable}} {{misunderstanding}} between the modern employer {{and the modern}} employed," [...] the chief labour spokesman said, speaking in a broad accent that completely hid from him and the bishop and every one {{the fact that he}} was by far the best-read man of the party. [...] "Disraeli called them the Two Nations, but that was long ago. Now it's a case of two species. Machinery has made them into different species. The employer lives away from his work-people, marries a wife foreign, out of a county family or suchlike, trains his children from their very birth in a different manner. Why, the growth curve is different for the two species. They haven't even a common speech between them. One looks east and the other looks west. How can <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> agree? Of course they won't agree. We've got to fight it out. They say we're their slaves for ever. Have you ever read Lady Bell's 'At the Works'? A well-intentioned woman, but she gives the whole thing away. We say, No! It's our sort and not your sort. We'll do without you. We'll get a little more education and then we'll do without you. We're pressing for all we can get, and when we've got that we'll take breath and press for more. We're the Morlocks. Coming up.

60|$|Our work went on merrily, nevertheless, and the Christopher Columbus, hauled up, lay {{helpless}} on {{her side}} like a great fish out of water. While she was in that state, there was a feast, or a ball, or an entertainment, or more properly all three together, given us in honour of the ship, and the ship's company, and the other visitors. At that assembly, I believe, I saw all the inhabitants then upon the Island, without any exception. I took no particular notice {{of more than a}} few, but I found it very agreeable in that little corner of the world to see the children, who were of all ages, and mostly very pretty--as they mostly are. There was one handsome elderly lady, with very dark eyes and gray hair, that I inquired about. I was told that her name was Mrs. Venning; and her married daughter, a fair slight thing, was pointed out to me by the name of Fanny Fisher. Quite a child she looked, with a little copy of herself holding to her dress; and her husband, just come back from the mine, exceeding proud of her. They were a good-looking set of people on the whole, but I didn't like them. I was out of sorts; in conversation with Charker, I found fault with all of them. I said of Mrs. Venning, she was proud; of Mrs. Fisher, she was a delicate little baby-fool. What did I think of this one? Why, he was a fine gentleman. What did I say to that one? Why, she was a fine lady. What could <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be (I asked Charker), nursed in that climate, with the tropical night shining for them, musical instruments playing to them, great trees bending over them, soft lamps lighting them, fire-flies sparkling in among them, bright flowers and birds brought into existence to please their eyes, delicious drinks to be had for the pouring out, delicious fruits to be got for the picking, and every one dancing and murmuring happily in the scented air, with the sea breaking low on the reef for a pleasant chorus.|$|E
60|$|Reflecting the Sun with a Mirror.--To {{attract the}} notice of a {{division}} of your party, five or even ten miles off, glitter a bit of looking-glass in the sun, throwing its flash towards where <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be. It is quite astonishing at how great a distance the gleam of the glass will catch the sharp eyes of a bushman who has learnt {{to know what it}} is. It is now a common signal in the North American prairies. (Sullivan.) It should be recollected that a passing flash has far less briliancy than one that dwells for an appreciable time on the retina of the observer; therefore the signaller should do all he can to steady his aim. I find the steadiest way of holding the mirror is to rest the hand firmly against the forehead, and to keep the eyes continually fixed upon the same distant object. The glare of the sun that is reflected from each point of the surface of a mirror forms a cone of light whose vertical angle is constant, and equal to that subtended by the sun. Hence when a flash is sent to a distant place, the size of the mirror is of no appreciable importance in affecting the size of the area over which the flash is visible. That area is the section of the fasciculus of cones that proceed from each point of the mirror, which, in the case we have supposed, differs immaterially from the cone reflected from a single point. Hence, if a man watches the play of the flash from his mirror upon a very near object, it will appear to him of the shape and size of the mirror; but as he retreats from the object, the edges of the flash become rounded, and very soon the flash appears a perfect circle, of precisely the same apparent diameter as the disc of the sun: it will, in short, look just like a very faint sun. The signaller has to cause this disc of light to cover the person whose notice he wishes to attract. I will proceed to show how he can do so; but in the mean time it will be evident that a pretty careful aim is requisite, or he will fail in his object. The steadiness of his aim must be just twice as accurate, neither more nor less, as would suffice to point a rifle at the sun when it was sufficiently obscured by a cloud to bear being looked at: for the object of the aim is of the same apparent size, but a movement of a mirror causes the ray reflected from it to move through a double angle.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} film music experts and composers, {{including}} Stephen Sondheim, have highly praised the theme.

What does it mean to shift from a practising professional (a lawyer â€“ a social worker) to a discipline-based academic? Or to move beyond a narrow discipline to become a scholar of teaching and learning? What dangers lurk in the swamp of managerialism? How can we escape from the towers of solitude and isolation that characterise debates around academic identity and become true barrier-breakers and boundary-blenders? The key, for these two travellers, lies in recognising the transformative potential of epistemological fusion...|$|R
