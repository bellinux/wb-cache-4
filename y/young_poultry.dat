6000|$|No eyelashes {{could be}} more {{beautiful}} than Hetty's; and now, while she walks with her pigeon-like stateliness along the room and looks down on her shoulders bordered by the old black lace, the dark fringe shows to perfection on her pink cheek. They are but dim ill-defined pictures that her narrow bit of an imagination can make of the future; but of every picture she is the central figure in fine clothes; Captain Donnithorne {{is very close to}} her, putting his arm round her, perhaps kissing her, and everybody else is admiring and envying her--especially Mary Burge, whose new print dress looks very contemptible by the side of Hetty's resplendent toilette. Does any sweet or sad memory mingle with this dream of the future--any loving thought of her second parents--of the children she had helped to tend--of any youthful companion, any pet animal, any relic of her own childhood even? Not one. There are some plants that have hardly any roots: you may tear them from their native nook of rock or wall, and just lay them over your ornamental flower-pot, and they blossom none the worse. Hetty could have cast all her past life behind her and never cared to be reminded of it again. I think she had no feeling at all towards the old house, and did not like the Jacob's Ladder and the long row of hollyhocks in the garden better than other flowers--perhaps not so well. It was wonderful how little she seemed to care about waiting on her uncle, who had been a good father to her--she hardly ever remembered to reach him his pipe at the right time without being told, unless a visitor happened to be there, who would have a better opportunity of seeing her as she walked across the hearth. Hetty did not understand how anybody could be very fond of middle-aged people. And as for those tiresome children, Marty and Tommy and Totty, they had been the very nuisance of her life--as bad as buzzing insects that will come teasing you on a hot day when you want to be quiet. Marty, the eldest, was a baby when she first came to the farm, for the children born before him had died, and so Hetty had had them all three, one after the other, toddling by her side in the meadow, or playing about her on wet days in the half-empty rooms of the large old house. The boys were out of hand now, but Totty was still a day-long plague, worse than either of the others had been, because there was more fuss made about her. And there was no end to the making and mending of clothes. Hetty would have been glad to hear that she should never see a child again; they were worse than the nasty little lambs that the shepherd was always bringing in to be taken special care of in lambing time; for the lambs WERE got rid of sooner or later. As for the young chickens and turkeys, Hetty would have hated the very word [...] "hatching," [...] if her aunt had not bribed her to attend to the <b>young</b> <b>poultry</b> by promising her the proceeds of one out of every brood. The round downy chicks peeping out from under their mother's wing never touched Hetty with any pleasure; that was not the sort of prettiness she cared about, but she did care about the prettiness of the new things she would buy for herself at Treddleston Fair with the money they fetched. And yet she looked so dimpled, so charming, as she stooped down to put the soaked bread under the hen-coop, that you must have been a very acute personage indeed to suspect her of that hardness. Molly, the housemaid, with a turn-up nose and a protuberant jaw, was really a tender-hearted girl, and, as Mrs. Poyser said, a jewel to look after the poultry; but her stolid face showed nothing of this maternal delight, any more than a brown earthenware pitcher will show the light of the lamp within it.|$|E

One hundred ninety-two one-day-old chicks that had been distributed randomly were used in twelve experimental treatments with four replications of four chicks each. The treatments consisted of vegetable diet (VG) for diets containing FV going after a certain age or the reverse, in which the birds began feeding VM on diet and then switched to VE diet. At 42 days of age, samples of pectoral muscle (Pectoralis major), keel and tibia were collected, with later determination of isotopic ratios (13 C/ 12 C and 15 N/ 14 N). The stable isotopes technique couldn't trace the use of VM in feeding broilers when this ingredient was part of broiler diets only in the first seven, 14 or 21 days of age.

40|$|Poultry {{are some}} of the most {{sensitive}} species to the toxic effects of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), and <b>younger</b> <b>poultry</b> are more sensitive to this mycotoxin. To elucidate the mechanisms for this age-related susceptibility, various enzyme activities relevant to AFB 1 were measured in liver microsomes prepared from male turkeys 9, 41 and 65 days of age. Hepatic microsomal o-dealkylation of methoxy- and pentoxyresorufin significantly increased, while that of ethoxyresorufin decreased with age. Microsomal AFB 1 activation to the reactive AFB 1 - 8, 9 -epoxide (AFBO) was most efficient in the youngest birds, with apparent Km and Vmax values of 168 and 19, 110 and 6, and 116 Î¼M and 10 nmol/mg/min for 9, 41 and 65 -day-old birds, respectivelly. The activity of hepatic cytosolic glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) was deficient in the youngest age group, but were higher in the older groups. There was also an age-related increase in the expression of GST isoforms Yc, Yc 2, as well as AFB 1 -aldehyde reductase (AFAR). However, livers from all ages lacked specific GST-mediated conjugation of AFBO, indicating that turkeys are deficient in this key AFB 1 -detoxification pathway.

Some events such as handling can be perceived negatively and it is of interest to understand how humans' behaviour could affect poultry's behaviours and especially its avoidance of humans. Our aim was to evaluate short- and long-lasting effects of a 3 -week procedure involving unpredictable repeated negative stimuli (URNS) applied during the post-juvenile period on quail's reactivity to humans. We compared the reactions of two sets of quail: URNS was applied to one set (treated quail) and the other set was left undisturbed (control quail). When two weeks old, treated quail were exposed {{to a variety of}} negative stimuli, either applied automatically or involving human presence. One and seven weeks after the termination of the procedure, the reactivity of control and treated quail to a passive human being was evaluated. Furthermore, the experimenter with her hand on a trough containing a mealworm assessed the propensity of quail of both groups to habituate to feed close to a human being. In the presence of a seated observer, treated quail were more inhibited and more alert than control quail. Likewise, seven weeks {{after the end of the}} URNS procedure, more treated than control quail adopted a fear posture. Moreover, whereas control quail spent as much time in the different areas of their cages, treated quail spent more time in the rear part of their cages. Finally, whereas control quail habituated gradually to feed near the experimenter's hand, treated quail did not. All these tests evidence negative short- and long-term effects on treated quail's reactivity to a passive human being and on their habituation to a human being when her presence is positively reinforced.

Introduction: At {{the present day}} {{one of the greatest}} problems confronting the old and especially the new breeder of poultry is the reason for the death of so many of our newly hatched chicks. In order for a breeder to successfully raise <b>young</b> <b>poultry,</b> he should in some measure be able to answer this question. To get. at the bottom of this problem we should begin with the parent stock. In the first place the parents should be strong, healthy and vigorous, and if possible allowed plenty of range. Food that is nitrogenous should predominate in the feeding, and the ratio of carbohydrates to proteids should be as 1 to 4. The exercise and green food problem can be solved by allowing plenty of range and pasture. It has been shown conclusively at the station here, that hens kept in small pens and not furnished with sufficient green or succulent food will not produce strong fertile eggs. If the eggs which are set with the intention of obtaining good chicks, are not strong and fertile to begin with, our success is doubtful. After securing the proper basis for the production of our <b>young</b> <b>poultry</b> we must look to our means of incubation. It is a conceded fact that where poultry is to be raised in any number, incubators have by far the preference. The kind of incubator to be used for hatching chicks something no one can tell, but from all indications shown here in the comparative uses of different incubators, the hot water machine has the preference. We cannot go into detail and tell just why this seems to be so, for that would involve an experiment along another line...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ardeid {{birds and}} pigs {{are known as}} major amplifying hosts for Japanese {{encephalitis}} virus, and ducklings and chickens have been considered to play at best a minor role in outbreaks because of their low or absent viremia. We hypothesized that viremia of sufficient magnitude would develop in young ducklings (Anas platyrhynchos) and chicks (Gallus gallus) for them to serve as reservoir hosts and thereby contribute to the transmission cycle. Infection was associated with reduced weight gain in both species, and ducklings infected at 10 days of age or less showed overt clinical signs of disease. The mean peak viremia in birds of both species decreased as the age at infection increased from 2 to 42 days, indicating the importance of age of infection on magnitude of viremia in birds from both species, and suggesting that <b>young</b> <b>poultry</b> may be amplifying hosts of importance in disease-endemic regions...|$|E

Rickets is {{described}} as a disease that affects <b>young</b> growing <b>poultry.</b> Poorly mineralized bones with thickened and irregular growth plates characterize it. The onset of rickets is characterized by a failure of mineralization of cartilage and bone. Other symptoms of rickets include reluctance to movement in affected birds. These birds will sit on their hocks and if startled they use their wings for balance. On necropsy, bones are soft and fragile and they have thickened growth plates. In this study 30 % of the chicks aged between 7 and 8 days from a broiler flock, started showing splay leg problems. Affected chicks were unable to support their weight on their legs, some showing paralysis. The bones were soft and rubbery. To try and identify the possible cause, bones from the affected chicks were analyzed for calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) to determine the Ca:P ratio. Blood serum was also analyzed for the mineral content. Ca and P were the main focus of the tests as the problem was suspected to be rickets. The feed was analyzed for protein, Ca and P. The bone analysis showed a Ca:P ratio of less than 2 : 1, while results of the blood serum showed an inverse Ca: P ratio. The analysis results of the feed as well as the bones showed an imbalance in the Ca:P ratio which according to literature and research done is a possible cause for rickets. These findings combined with the symptoms displayed by the affected birds, lead to the suggestion that the problem in this study was rickets...|$|R

Apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and coefficient of metabolisability of gross energy (CAME) were determined with young broilers; Digestible energy (DE) and coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD) of gross energy were determined with growing finishing pigs. Wheat was added {{at a rate of}} 750 and 900 g/kg diet for poultry and pigs, respectively, in a series of metabolism trials. AME values ranged from 8. 49 to 12. 45 MJ/kg DM and CAME from 0. 491 to 0. 702. DE values ranged from 14. 55 to 16. 07 MJ/kg DM and CTTAD from 0. 848 to 0. 890. There were significant differences between variety and site (together with interaction terms) in both, the physical and biological measurements, but not in a structured fashion. There were no significant relationships between the two physical measurements and any dietary energy value (either in terms of concentration or coefficient), confirming previous work.

40|$|Human {{consumption}} of bird meat in modern societies comes in two ways: as embryos -i. e., eggs- and as hatched individuals, either <b>young</b> or adults. <b>Poultry</b> provide nowadays {{about one-third of}} the animal proteins and fat in human diets, but the bird-human interface is possibly an ancient one. Hundreds of species are kept as pets and non-edible products, such as feathers or eggshells are used by traditional cultures in all continents as body ornaments, headdresses or jewelry. Regarding early humans, it has been proposed that Neanderthals decorated themselves with raptors and corvid feathers. It is also known that they consumed birds, including pigeons, according to cut marks in bone remains. Even if birds may be perceived as elusive prey due to their flight capabilities, they are forced to incubate their eggs in a fixed position, the nest, where the nestlings grow until they reach full size. This makes eggs, nestlings and brooding adults easy prey. Roosting birds are practically defenseless against stealth predators. And humans may become such when they learn to interpret cues left behind by the birds themselves. Birds share a common sensitive world with humans. Most birds are diurnal as we are, and they rely on visual and auditive cues for communication, that we may learn to interpret, or that we can even imitate. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Aspergillosis is a {{frequent}} fungal disease of <b>young</b> and adult <b>poultry</b> in our commercial flocks. Infection can occur after hatching by inhalation of Aspergillus conidia which can be present in contaminated hatcheries, or later, by spores from moldy litter, dust, faeces or feed. Spores {{from the surface of}} egg shell can penetrate inside of an egg. The main characteristic of aspergillosis is granulomatous inflammation of respiratory system, although generalized form is possible as well. Multiple yellow nodules can be seen as major patomorphological changes and they are usually localized in lungs, air sacs, and can also be found in spleen, brain, subcutis and eyes. Egg embryos are quite susceptible to infection by Aspergillus fumigatus during incubation. In this study, the history of a case on one local farm with mortality rate of 7. 2 % in the turkey flock is presented. At the same time, 28 day old 30 incubated hatching turkey eggs were sampled, that were unable to hatch. The aim of the present work was to determine the cause and to identify the agent of embryonic mortality. Total of the 30 eggs were opened, and 16 of them had thickened egg membranes in the area of air sac. Membrane thickening was visible and circumscript or diffuse presence of black-grey or grey-green fungal growth was observed. Only 3 samples air sacs were filled with developed stages of fungi. To evaluate histopathological lesions, changed egg membranes were processed by standard histological technique. Dominant microscopic finding was thickening of egg membranes as a consequence of fungal growth and many of them penetrated deep towards embryo. Most of the hyphae were growing vertically through membranes. On the outside surface of the membranes, the elements of fungi (conidial heads with phialids and spores on them), could be clearly observed. These changes were responsible for embryonic death, which {{on the basis of the}} size of dead embryos occurred between 7 th and 10 th day of incubation. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated and identified from the content of air sacs. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. III 46009 i br. TR 37015...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o efeito da idade e da linhagem de galinhas matrizes leves e semi pesadas sobre a qualidade do ovo, do pinto recÃ©m-eclodido e do rendimento da incubaÃ§Ã£o. Foram utilizados 3. 456 ovos de reprodutoras leves (Dekalb White) e semi pesadas (Bovans Goldline) em trÃªs diferentes idades (jovens, velhas e de mÃ©dia idade). O experimento foi dividido em duas etapas; na primeira se avaliou as caracterÃ­sticas dos ovos de uma amostra de 360 ovos (60 por tratamento). Na segunda etapa avaliou-se o desempenho da incubaÃ§Ã£o e a qualidade dos pintinhos numa amostra de 3. 096 ovos (516 por tratamento). Observou-se que a qualidade da casca diminuiu e o peso do ovo aumentou com a elevaÃ§Ã£o da idade das aves. As matrizes Dekalb White produziram ovos mais pesados na idade mÃ©dia e com melhor qualidade de casca em todas as idades. Com o aumento da idade da ave o percentual da gema aumentou e do albÃºmen diminui. Essa diminuiÃ§Ã£o ocorreu de maneira mais acentuada em ovos da linhagem Dekalb White. Ovos dessa mesma linhagem, de matrizes jovens e velhas apresentaram maior percentual de gema. O ph da gema e do albÃºmen aumentou com o envelhecimento das matrizes, sendo que na idade ve lha, o ovo da linhagem Dekalb White apresenta valores maiores para essas variÃ¡veis que os da linhagem Bovans Goldline. Quanto Ã  avaliaÃ§Ã£o da incubaÃ§Ã£o verificou-se que ovos de aves velhas da linhagem Bovans Goldline apresentaram maior percentual de perda de peso durante a incubaÃ§Ã£o do que aqueles provenientes de matrizes Dekalb White de mesma idade. O peso do pinto aumentou com o aumento da idade da matriz e pintinhos Dekalb White nasceram mais pesados que os Bovans Goldline. PorÃ©m, a relaÃ§Ã£o peso do pinto / peso do ovo foi maior para pintos Bovans Goldline de aves jovens e de mÃ©dia idade. A progÃªnie Dekalb White nÃ£o foi influenciada pela idade da reprodutora quanto a esse parÃ¢metro. O percentual de fÃªmeas nascidas em relaÃ§Ã£o aos ovos fÃ©rteis foi maior na linhagem Dekalb White. Sendo que matrizes jovens obtiveram valores menores para essa variÃ¡vel, independente de sua linhagem. As pintinhas Dekalb White, alÃ©m de apresentaram pesos mais uniformes, obtiveram maior percentual de saco vitelino do que as Bovans Goldline. A idade da matriz nÃ£o exerceu influÃªncia sobre essas variÃ¡veis. O percentual do coraÃ§Ã£o e dos pulmÃµes em relaÃ§Ã£o ao peso da pintinha nÃ£o foi influenciado pela idade nem pela linhagem das reprodutoras. This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of age and lineage of layers breeders light and semi heavy {{on the quality of}} the egg, the pinto newly eclodido and performance of incubation. 3, 456 eggs were used for breeding light (Dekalb White) and semi heavy (Bovans Goldline) in three different ages (young, old and middle age). The experiment was divided into two stages, at first we evaluate the characteristics of the eggs of a sample of 360 eggs (60 per treatment). In the second stage evaluated the performance of chicks hatching and quality of a sample of 3, 096 eggs (516 per treatment). It was observed that the quality of the shell fell and the weight of the egg increased with the increase of age of the birds. The layers breeders Dekalb White eggs produced heavier in the middle ages and with better quality of bark at all ages. With the increasing age of the bird has increased the percentage of yolk and albumen decreases. This decrease was more pronounced in a manner eggs line Dekalb White. Eggs of the same lineage, layers breeders young and old had a higher percentage of egg yolk. The pH of the yolk and albumen increased with the ageing of layers breeding, which in old age, the egg line Dekalb White shows higher values for these variables that line Bovans Goldline. As for the assessment of incubation found that birds' eggs old line Bovans Goldline had greater percentage of weight loss during the incubation than those from Dekalb White layers breeders of the same age. The weight of pinto increased with increasing age of the leyer breeding and Dekalb White chicks born heavier that the Bovans Goldline. However, the relationship of chicks weight / weight of the egg was higher for chicks Bovans Goldline <b>poultry</b> <b>young</b> and middle age. The progeny Dekalb White was not influenced by the age of reproductive on this parameter. The percentage of females born in respect of fertile eggs was greater in the lineage Dekalb White. Since young matrices obtained lower values for this variable, regardless of their lineage. The female chicks Dekalb White, and had weights more uniform, had a higher percentage of bag viteline than the Bovans Goldline. The age of the matrix no effect on these variables. The percentage of the heart and lungs in the weight of the female chicks were not influenced by age or the lineage of breeding...|$|R
