40|$|LL. M. (Labour Law) Commentators {{have warned}} that when men are given {{absolute}} {{control over their}} fellow men, there is the danger that what appeared pragmatically desirable may become morally intolerable. The current usage of polygraph testing by employers undoubtedly confirms this. In what follows, it will be argued {{that there is a}} serious shortcoming in South African law in that there is no legislative framework that governs and regulates the use of polygraph testing in the workplace. It is fairly likely that many South African employers will at some time be faced with dishonesty or criminal activities, such as fraud or theft, without accurately being able to identify where, how, and by whom such dishonesty was committed. If dishonesty and criminal activities are not properly managed, there may be adverse ramifications. As a result, many employers have opted to insert a clause in the employment offer and employment contract that relates to security obligations {{on the part of the}} employees or prospective employees. The clause would normally read as follows: “The company may request that you subject yourself to a polygraph test before commencement of employment or if an incident has occurred or and random testing during <b>your</b> <b>period</b> of employment with the Company. The employee hereby declares that he is aware of the company polygraph policy and accepts that this policy as a term and condition of his employment. The employee undertakes to comply with the said policy in all respects and acknowledges that he is bound thereby”. Magna Alloys & Research v Ellis introduced a significant change to the Courts’ approach to restraint of trade agreements by declining to follow earlier decisions based on an English precedent that an agreement in restraint of trade is prima facie invalid and unenforceable.
