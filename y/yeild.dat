[...] He ended, and the Son gave signal high [...] To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew [...] His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps [...] When God descended, and perhaps once more [...] To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast [...] Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs [...] Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, [...] By the waters of Life, where ere they sate [...] In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light [...] 80 [...] Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, [...] And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream [...] Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will. [...] O Sons, like one of us Man is become [...] To know both Good and Evil, since his taste [...] Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast [...] His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, [...] Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known [...] Good by it self, and Evil not at all. [...] He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, [...] 90 [...] My motions in him, longer then they move, [...] His heart I know, how variable and vain [...] Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand [...] Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, [...] And live for ever, dream at least to live [...] Forever, to remove him I decree, [...] And send him from the Garden forth to Till [...] The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. [...] Michael, this my behest have thou in charge, [...] Take to thee from among the Cherubim [...] 100 [...] Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend [...] Or in behalf of Man, or to invade [...] Vacant possession som new trouble raise: [...] Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God [...] Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, [...] From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce [...] To them and to thir Progenie from thence [...] Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint [...] At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, [...] For I behold them soft'nd and with tears [...] 110 [...] Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. [...] If patiently thy bidding they obey, [...] Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale [...] To Adam what shall come in future dayes, [...] As I shall thee enlighten, intermix [...] My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd; [...] So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: [...] And on the East side of the Garden place, [...] Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, [...] Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame [...] 120 [...] Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, [...] And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: [...] Least Paradise a receptacle prove [...] To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, [...] With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. [...] He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd [...] For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright [...] Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each [...] Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape [...] Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those [...] 130 [...] Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, [...] Charm'd with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed [...] Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile [...] To resalute the World with sacred Light [...] Leucothea wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd [...] The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve [...] Had ended now thir Orisons, and found, [...] Strength added from above, new hope to spring [...] Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; [...] Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. [...] 140 [...] Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all [...] The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends [...] But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n [...] So prevalent as to concerne the mind [...] Of God high blest, or to incline his will, [...] Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, [...] Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne [...] Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught [...] By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, [...] Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, [...] 150 [...] Methought I saw him placable and mild, [...] Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew [...] That I was heard with favour; peace returnd [...] Home to my brest, and to my memorie [...] His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; [...] Which then not minded in dismay, yet now [...] Assures me that the bitterness of death [...] Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, [...] Eve rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, [...] Mother of all things living, since by thee [...] 160 [...] Man is to live, and all things live for Man. [...] To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. [...] Ill worthie I such title should belong [...] To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind [...] A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach [...] Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: [...] But infinite in pardon was my Judge, [...] That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't [...] The sourse of life; next favourable thou, [...] Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, [...] 170 [...] Farr other name deserving. But the Field [...] To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, [...] Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, [...] All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins [...] Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, [...] I never from thy side henceforth to stray, [...] Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind [...] Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, [...] What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? [...] Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. [...] 180 [...] So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd Eve, but Fate [...] Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest [...] On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd [...] After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight [...] The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, [...] Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: [...] Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, [...] First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, [...] Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; [...] Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. [...] 190 [...] Adam observ'd, and with his Eye the chase [...] Pursuing, not unmov'd to Eve thus spake. [...] O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, [...] Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews [...] Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn [...] Us haply too secure of our discharge [...] From penaltie, because from death releast [...] Some days; how long, and what till then our life, [...] Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, [...] And thither must return and be no more. [...] 200 [...] Why else this double object in our sight [...] Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground [...] One way the self-same hour? why in the East [...] Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light [...] More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws [...] O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, [...] And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. [...] He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands [...] Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now [...] In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, [...] 210 [...] A glorious Apparition, had not doubt [...] And carnal fear that day dimm'd Adams eye. [...] Not that more glorious, when the Angels met [...] Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw [...] The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; [...] Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd [...] In Dothan, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, [...] Against the Syrian King, who to surprize [...] One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, [...] Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch [...] 220 [...] In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise [...] Possession of the Garden; hee alone, [...] To finde where Adam shelterd, took his way, [...] Not unperceav'd of Adam, who to Eve, [...] While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. [...] Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps [...] Of us will soon determin, or impose [...] New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie [...] From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill [...] One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate [...] 230 [...] None of the meanest, some great Potentate [...] Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie [...] Invests him coming; yet not terrible, [...] That I should fear, nor sociably mild, [...] As Raphael, that I should much confide, [...] But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, [...] With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. [...] He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, [...] Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man [...] Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes [...] 240 [...] A militarie Vest of purple flowd [...] Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine [...] Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero's old [...] In time of Truce; Iris had dipt the wooff; [...] His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime [...] In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side [...] As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, [...] Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. [...] Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State [...] Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. [...] 250 [...] Adam, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: [...] Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, [...] Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, [...] Defeated of his seisure many dayes [...] Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, [...] And one bad act with many deeds well done [...] Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd [...] Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; [...] But longer in this Paradise to dwell [...] Permits not; to remove thee I am come, [...] 260 [...] And send thee from the Garden forth to till [...] The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. [...] He added not, for Adam at the newes [...] Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, [...] That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen [...] Yet all had heard, with audible lament [...] Discover'd soon the place of her retire. [...] O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! [...] Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave [...] Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, [...] 270 [...] Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, [...] Quiet though sad, the respit of that day [...] That must be mortal to us both. O flours, [...] That never will in other Climate grow, [...] My early visitation, and my last [...] At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand [...] From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, [...] Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke [...] Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? [...] Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd [...] 280 [...] With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee [...] How shall I part, and whither wander down [...] Into a lower World, to this obscure [...] And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire [...] Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? [...] Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. [...] Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne [...] What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, [...] Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; [...] Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes [...] 290 [...] Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; [...] Where he abides, think there thy native soile. [...] Adam by this from the cold sudden damp [...] Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, [...] To Michael thus his humble words addressd. [...] Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd [...] Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem [...] Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould [...] Thy message, which might else in telling wound, [...] And in performing end us; what besides [...] 300 [...] Of sorrow and dejection and despair [...] Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, [...] Departure from this happy place, our sweet [...] Recess, and onely consolation left [...] Familiar to our eyes, all places else [...] Inhospitable appeer and desolate, [...] Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer [...] Incessant I could hope to change the will [...] Of him who all things can, I would not cease [...] To wearie him with my assiduous cries: [...] 310 [...] But prayer against his absolute Decree [...] No more availes then breath against the winde, [...] Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: [...] Therefore to his great bidding I submit. [...] This most afflicts me, that departing hence, [...] As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd [...] His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, [...] With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd [...] Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; [...] On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree [...] 320 [...] Stood visible, among these Pines his voice [...] I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: [...] So many grateful Altars I would reare [...] Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone [...] Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, [...] Or monument to Ages, and thereon [...] Offer sweet smelling Gumms & Fruits and Flours: [...] In yonder nether World where shall I seek [...] His bright appearances, or footstep trace? [...] For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd [...] 330 [...] To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now [...] Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts [...] Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. [...] To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. [...] Adam, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth [...] Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills [...] Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, [...] Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: [...] All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, [...] No despicable gift; surmise not then [...] 340 [...] His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd [...] Of Paradise or Eden: this had been [...] Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred [...] All generations, and had hither come [...] From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate [...] And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. [...] But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down [...] To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: [...] Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine [...] God is as here, and will be found alike [...] 350 [...] Present, and of his presence many a signe [...] Still following thee, still compassing thee round [...] With goodness and paternal Love, his Face [...] Express, and of his steps the track Divine. [...] Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, [...] Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent [...] To shew thee what shall come in future dayes [...] To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad [...] Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending [...] With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn [...] 360 [...] True patience, and to temper joy with fear [...] And pious sorrow, equally enur'd [...] By moderation either state to beare, [...] Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead [...] Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure [...] Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend [...] This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) [...] Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, [...] As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. [...] To whom thus Adam gratefully repli'd. [...] 370 [...] Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path [...] Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, [...] However chast'ning, to the evil turne [...] My obvious breast, arming to overcom [...] By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, [...] If so I may attain. So both ascend [...] In the Visions of God: It was a Hill [...] Of Paradise the highest, from whose top [...] The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken [...] Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. [...] 380 [...] Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, [...] Whereon for different cause the Tempter set [...] Our second Adam in the Wilderness, [...] To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. [...] His Eye might there command wherever stood [...] City of old or modern Fame, the Seat [...] Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls [...] Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can [...] And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, [...] To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence [...] 390 [...] To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul [...] Down to the golden Chersonese, or where [...] The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since [...] In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar [...] In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, [...] Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken [...] Th' Empire of Negus to his utmost Port [...] Ercoco and the less Maritine Kings [...] Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, [...] And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme [...] 400 [...] Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; [...] Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount [...] The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez, and Sus, [...] Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; [...] On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway [...] The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw [...] Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, [...] And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat [...] Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil'd [...] Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons [...] 410 [...] Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights [...] Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov'd [...] Which that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight [...] Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue [...] The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; [...] And from the Well of Life three drops instill'd. [...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I <b>yeild</b> it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall <b>yeild</b> up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid.

The condensed composite (c) -bosons formed in the excited channel create a superconducting state with an energy gap.

[...] 340 [...] Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need [...] With dangerous expedition to invade [...] Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, [...] Or ambush from the Deep.

This would surpass [...] 370 [...] Common revenge, and interrupt his joy [...] In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise [...] In his disturbance; when his darling Sons [...] Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse [...] Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss, [...] Faded so soon.

[...] O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, [...] 430 [...] With reason hath deep silence and demurr [...] Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way [...] And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light; [...] Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, [...] Outrageous to devour, immures us round [...] Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant [...] Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. [...] These past, if any pass, the void profound [...] Of unessential Night receives him next [...] Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being [...] 440 [...] Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. [...] If thence he scape into what ever world, [...] Or unknown Region, what remains him less [...] Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. [...] But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, [...] And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd [...] With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd [...] And judg'd of public moment, in the shape [...] Of difficulty or danger could deterre [...] Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume [...] 450 [...] These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, [...] Refusing to accept as great a share [...] Of hazard as of honour, due alike [...] To him who Reigns, and so much to him due [...] Of hazard more, as he above the rest [...] High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers, [...] Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, [...] While here shall be our home, what best may ease [...] The present misery, and render Hell [...] More tollerable; if there be cure or charm [...] 460 [...] To respite or deceive, or slack the pain [...] Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch [...] Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad [...] Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek [...] Deliverance for us all: this enterprize [...] None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose [...] The Monarch, and prevented all reply, [...] Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd [...] Others among the chief might offer now [...] (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; [...] 470 [...] And so refus'd might in opinion stand [...] His rivals, winning cheap the high repute [...] Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they [...] Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice [...] Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; [...] Thir rising all at once was as the sound [...] Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend [...] With awful reverence prone; and as a God [...] Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: [...] Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, [...] 480 [...] That for the general safety he despis'd [...] His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd [...] Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast [...] Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, [...] Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal. [...] Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark [...] Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: [...] As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds [...] Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread [...] Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element [...] 490 [...] Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; [...] If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet [...] Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, [...] The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds [...] Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. [...] O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd [...] Firm concord holds, men onely disagree [...] Of Creatures rational, though under hope [...] Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, [...] Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife [...] 500 [...] Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, [...] Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: [...] As if (which might induce us to accord) [...] Man had not hellish foes anow besides, [...] That {{day and night for}} his destruction waite. [...] The Stygian Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth [...] In order came the grand infernal Peers, [...] Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd [...] Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less [...] Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, [...] 510 [...] And God-like imitated State; him round [...] A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd [...] With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. [...] Then of thir Session ended they bid cry [...] With Trumpets regal sound the great result: [...] Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim [...] Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie [...] By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss [...] Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell [...] With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. [...] 520 [...] Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd [...] By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers [...] Disband, and wandring, each his several way [...] Pursues, as inclination or sad choice [...] Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find [...] Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain [...] The irksome hours, till his great Chief return. [...] Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime [...] Upon the wing, or in swift race contend, [...] As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; [...] 530 [...] Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal [...] With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. [...] As when to warn proud Cities warr appears [...] Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush [...] To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van [...] Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears [...] Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms [...] From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. [...] Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell [...] Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air [...] 540 [...] In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. [...] As when Alcides from Oealia Crown'd [...] With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore [...] Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, [...] And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw [...] Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, [...] Retreated in a silent valley, sing [...] With notes Angelical to many a Harp [...] Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall [...] By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate [...] 550 [...] Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. [...] Thir song was partial, but the harmony [...] (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) [...] Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment [...] The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet [...] (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) [...] Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, [...] In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high [...] Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate, [...] Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute, [...] 560 [...] And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. [...] Of good and evil much they argu'd then, [...] Of happiness and final misery, [...] Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, [...] Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: [...] Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm [...] Pain for a while or anguish, and excite [...] Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest [...] With stubborn patience as with triple steel. [...] Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, [...] 570 [...] On bold adventure to discover wide [...] That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps [...] Might <b>yeild</b> them easier habitation, bend [...] Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks [...] Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge [...] Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; [...] Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, [...] Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; [...] Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud [...] Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton [...] 580 [...] Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. [...] Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, [...] Lethe the River of Oblivion roules [...] Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, [...] Forthwith his former state and being forgets, [...] Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. [...] Beyond this flood a frozen Continent [...] Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms [...] Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land [...] Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems [...] 590 [...] Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, [...] A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog [...] Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, [...] Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air [...] Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. [...] Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, [...] At certain revolutions all the damn'd [...] Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change [...] Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, [...] From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice [...] 600 [...] Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine [...] Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, [...] Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. [...] They ferry over this Lethean Sound [...] Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, [...] And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach [...] The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose [...] In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, [...] All in one moment, and so neer the brink; [...] But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt [...] 610 [...] Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards [...] The Ford, and of it self the water flies [...] All taste of living wight, as once it fled [...] The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on [...] In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands [...] With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast [...] View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found [...] No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile [...] They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, [...] O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe, [...] 620 [...] Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, [...] A Universe of death, which God by curse [...] Created evil, for evil only good, [...] Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds, [...] Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, [...] Abominable, inutterable, and worse [...] Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, [...] Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. [...] Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, [...] Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, [...] 630 [...] Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell [...] Explores his solitary flight; som times [...] He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, [...] Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares [...] Up to the fiery concave touring high. [...] As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd [...] Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds [...] Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles [...] Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring [...] Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood [...] 640 [...] Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape [...] Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd [...] Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer [...] Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, [...] And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass [...] Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, [...] Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire, [...] Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat [...] On either side a formidable shape; [...] The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, [...] 650 [...] But ended foul in many a scaly fould [...] Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd [...] With mortal sting: about her middle round [...] A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd [...] With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung [...] A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, [...] If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, [...] And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd [...] Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these [...] Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts [...] 660 [...] Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: [...] Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd [...] In secret, riding through the Air she comes [...] Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance [...] With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon [...] Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, [...] If shape it might be call'd that shape had none [...] Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, [...] Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, [...] For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, [...] 670 [...] Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, [...] And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head [...] The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. [...] Satan was now at hand, and from his seat [...] The Monster moving onward came as fast, [...] With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. [...] Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, [...] Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, [...] Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd; [...] And with disdainful look thus first began. [...] 680 [...] Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, [...] That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance [...] Thy miscreated Front athwart my way [...] To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, [...] That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: [...] Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, [...] Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. [...] To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, [...] Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, [...] Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then [...] 690 [...] Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons [...] Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou [...] And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd [...] To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain? [...] And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, [...] Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn, [...] Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, [...] Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, [...] False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, [...] 700 [...] Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue [...] Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart [...] Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. [...] So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, [...] So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold [...] More dreadful and deform: on th' other side [...] Incenc't with indignation Satan stood [...] Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, [...] That fires the length of Ophiucus huge [...] In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair [...] 710 [...] Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head [...] Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands [...] No second stroke intend, and such a frown [...] Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds [...] With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on [...] Over the Caspian, then stand front to front [...] Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow [...] To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: [...] So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell [...] Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; [...] 720 [...] For never but once more was either like [...] To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds [...] Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, [...] Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat [...] Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, [...] Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. [...] O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, [...] Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, [...] Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart [...] Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; [...] 730 [...] For him who sits above and laughs the while [...] At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute [...] What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids, [...] His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. [...] She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest [...] Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: [...] So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange [...] Thou interposest, that my sudden hand [...] Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds [...] What it intends; till first I know of thee, [...] 740 [...] What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why [...] In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st [...] Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son? [...] I know thee not, nor ever saw till now [...] Sight more detestable then him and thee. [...] T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; [...] Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem [...] Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair [...] In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight [...] Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd [...] 750 [...] In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, [...] All on a sudden miserable pain [...] Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm [...] In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast [...] Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, [...] Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, [...] Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd [...] Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd [...] All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid [...] At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign [...] 760 [...] Portentous held me; but familiar grown, [...] I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won [...] The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft [...] Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing [...] Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st [...] With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd [...] A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, [...] And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind [...] (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe [...] Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout [...] 770 [...] Through all the Empyrean: down they fell [...] Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down [...] Into this Deep, and in the general fall [...] I also; at which time this powerful Key [...] Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep [...] These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass [...] Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat [...] Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb [...] Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown [...] Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. [...] 780 [...] At last this odious offspring whom thou seest [...] Thine own begotten, breaking violent way [...] Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain [...] Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew [...] Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie [...] Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart [...] Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; [...] Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd [...] From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. [...] I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, [...] 790 [...] Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, [...] Me overtook his mother all dismaid, [...] And in embraces forcible and foule [...] Ingendring with me, of that rape begot [...] These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry [...] Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd [...] And hourly born, with sorrow infinite [...] To me, for when they list into the womb [...] That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw [...] My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth [...] 800 [...] Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round, [...] That rest or intermission none I find. [...] Before mine eyes in opposition sits [...] Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, [...] And me his Parent would full soon devour [...] For want of other prey, but that he knows [...] His end with mine involvd; and knows that I [...] Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, [...] When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. [...] But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun [...] 810 [...] His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope [...] To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, [...] Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, [...] Save he who reigns above, none can resist. [...] She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore [...] Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. [...] Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, [...] And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge [...] Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys [...] Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change [...] 820 [...] Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know [...] I come no enemie, but to set free [...] From out this dark and dismal house of pain, [...] Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host [...] Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd [...] Fell with us from on high: from them I go [...] This uncouth errand sole, and one for all [...] My self expose, with lonely steps to tread [...] Th' unfounded deep, & through the void immense [...] To search with wandring quest a place foretold [...] 830 [...] Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now [...] Created vast and round, a place of bliss [...] In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't [...] A race of upstart Creatures, to supply [...] Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, [...] Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude [...] Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught [...] Then this more secret now design'd, I haste [...] To know, and this once known, shall soon return, [...] And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death [...] 840 [...] Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen [...] Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd [...] With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd [...] Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. [...] He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death [...] Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear [...] His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe [...] Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd [...] His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. [...] The key of this infernal Pit by due, [...] 850 [...] And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King [...] I keep, by him forbidden to unlock [...] These Adamantine Gates; against all force [...] Death ready stands to interpose his dart, [...] Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might. [...] But what ow I to his commands above [...] Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down [...] Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, [...] To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, [...] Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, [...] 860 [...] Here in perpetual agonie and pain, [...] With terrors and with clamors compasst round [...] Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: [...] Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou [...] My being gav'st me; whom should I obey [...] But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon [...] To that new world of light and bliss, among [...] The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign [...] At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems [...] Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. [...] 870 [...] Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, [...] Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; [...] And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, [...] Forthwith the huge Portcullis high up drew, [...] Which but her self not all the Stygian powers [...] Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns [...] Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar [...] Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease [...] Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie [...] With impetuous recoile and jarring sound [...] 880 [...] Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great [...] Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook [...] Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut [...] Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, [...] That with extended wings a Bannerd Host [...] Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through [...] With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; [...] So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth [...] Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. [...] Before thir eyes in sudden view appear [...] 890 [...] The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark [...] Illimitable Ocean without bound, [...] Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth, [...] And time and place are lost; where eldest Night [...] And Chaos, Ancestors of Nature, hold [...] Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise [...] Of endless warrs and by confusion stand. [...] For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce [...] Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring [...] Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag [...] 900 [...] Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns, [...] Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, [...] Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands [...] Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, [...] Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise [...] Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, [...] Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, [...] And by decision more imbroiles the fray [...] By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter [...] Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, [...] 910 [...] The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, [...] Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, [...] But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt [...] Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, [...] Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain [...] His dark materials to create more Worlds, [...] Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend [...] Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, [...] Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith [...] He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd [...] 920 [...] With noises loud and ruinous (to compare [...] Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, [...] With all her battering Engines bent to rase [...] Som Capital City, or less then if this frame [...] Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements [...] In mutinie had from her Axle torn [...] The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes [...] He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak [...] Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League [...] As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides [...] 930 [...] Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets [...] A vast vacuitie: all unawares [...] Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops [...] Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour [...] Down had been falling, had not by ill chance [...] The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud [...] Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him [...] As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, [...] Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, [...] Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, [...] 940 [...] Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, [...] Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. [...] As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness [...] With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, [...] Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth [...] Had from his wakeful custody purloind [...] The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend [...] Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, [...] With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way, [...] And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: [...] 950 [...] At length a universal hubbub wilde [...] Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd [...] Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare [...] With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, [...] Undaunted to meet there what ever power [...] Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss [...] Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask [...] Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes [...] Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne [...] Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread [...] 960 [...] Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd [...] Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, [...] The consort of his Reign; and by them stood [...] Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name [...] Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, [...] And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, [...] And Discord with a thousand various mouths. [...] T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers [...] And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, [...] Chaos and Ancient Night, I come no Spie, [...] 970 [...] With purpose to explore or to disturb [...] The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint [...] Wandring this darksome desart, as my way [...] Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, [...] Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek [...] What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds [...] Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place [...] From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King [...] Possesses lately, thither to arrive [...] I travel this profound, direct my course; [...] 980 [...] Directed, no mean recompence it brings [...] To your behoof, if I that Region lost, [...] All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce [...] To her original darkness and your sway [...] (Which is my present journey) and once more [...] Erect the Standerd there of Ancient Night; [...] Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. [...] Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old [...] With faultring speech and visage incompos'd [...] Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, [...] 990 [...] That mighty leading Angel, who of late [...] Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. [...] I saw and heard, for such a numerous host [...] Fled not in silence through the frighted deep [...] With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, [...] Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates [...] Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands [...] Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here [...] Keep residence; if all I can will serve, [...] That little which is left so to defend [...] 1000 [...] Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles [...] Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell [...] Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; [...] Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World [...] Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain [...] To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: [...] If that way be your walk, you have not farr; [...] So much the neerer danger; goe and speed; [...] Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. [...] He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, [...] 1010 [...] But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, [...] With fresh alacritie and force renew'd [...] Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire [...] Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock [...] Of fighting Elements, on all sides round [...] Environ'd wins his way; harder beset [...] And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd [...] Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: [...] Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd [...] Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. [...] 1020 [...] So he with difficulty and labour hard [...] Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; [...] But hee once past, soon after when man fell, [...] Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain [...] Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, [...] Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way [...] Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf [...] Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length [...] From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe [...] Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse [...] 1030 [...] With easie intercourse pass to and fro [...] To tempt or punish mortals, except whom [...] God and good Angels guard by special grace.

[...] And Eve first to her Husband thus began. [...] Adam, well may we labour still to dress [...] This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour. [...] Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands [...] Aid us, the work under our labour grows, [...] Luxurious by restraint; what we by day [...] Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, [...] 210 [...] One night or two with wanton growth derides [...] Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise [...] Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present, [...] Let us divide our labours, thou where choice [...] Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind [...] The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct [...] The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I [...] In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt [...] With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: [...] For while so near each other thus all day [...] 220 [...] Our task we choose, what wonder if no near [...] Looks intervene and smiles, or object new [...] Casual discourse draw on, which intermits [...] Our dayes work brought to little, though begun [...] Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd. [...] To whom mild answer Adam thus return'd. [...] Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond [...] Compare above all living Creatures deare, [...] Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd [...] How we might best fulfill the work which here [...] 230 [...] God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass [...] Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found [...] In woman, then to studie houshold good, [...] And good workes in her Husband to promote. [...] Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd [...] Labour, as to debarr us when we need [...] Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, [...] Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse [...] Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, [...] To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food, [...] 240 [...] Love not the lowest end of human life. [...] For not to irksom toile, but to delight [...] He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd. [...] These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt [...] Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide [...] As we need walk, till younger hands ere long [...] Assist us: But if much converse perhaps [...] Thee satiate, to short absence I could <b>yeild.</b> [...] For solitude somtimes is best societie, [...] And short retirement urges sweet returne. [...] 250 [...] But other doubt possesses me, least harm [...] Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst [...] What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe [...] Envying our happiness, and of his own [...] Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame [...] By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand [...] Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find [...] His wish and best advantage, us asunder, [...] Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each [...] To other speedie aide might lend at need; [...] 260 [...] Whether his first design be to withdraw [...] Our fealtie from God, or to disturb [...] Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss [...] Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more; [...] Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side [...] That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects. [...] The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, [...] Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, [...] Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. [...] To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, [...] 270 [...] As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, [...] With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd. [...] Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, [...] That such an enemie we have, who seeks [...] Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, [...] And from the parting Angel over-heard [...] As in a shadie nook I stood behind, [...] Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. [...] But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt [...] To God or thee, because we have a foe [...] 280 [...] May tempt it, I expected not to hear. [...] His violence thou fearst not, being such, [...] As wee, not capable of death or paine, [...] Can either not receave, or can repell. [...] His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs [...] Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love [...] Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't; [...] Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest, [...] Adam, misthought of her to thee so dear? [...] To whom with healing words Adam reply'd. [...] 290 [...] Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, [...] For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: [...] Not diffident of thee do I dissuade [...] Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid [...] Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe. [...] For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses [...] The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd [...] Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff [...] Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne [...] And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong, [...] 300 [...] Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, [...] If such affront I labour to avert [...] From thee alone, which on us both at once [...] The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, [...] Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light. [...] Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; [...] Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce [...] Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. [...] I from the influence of thy looks receave [...] Access in every Vertue, in thy sight [...] 310 [...] More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were [...] Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, [...] Shame to be overcome or over-reacht [...] Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite. [...] Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel [...] When I am present, and thy trial choose [...] With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd. [...] So spake domestick Adam in his care [...] And Matrimonial Love, but Eve, who thought [...] Less attributed to her Faith sincere, [...] 320 [...] Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. [...] If this be our condition, thus to dwell [...] In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe, [...] Suttle or violent, we not endu'd [...] Single with like defence, wherever met, [...] How are we happie, still in fear of harm? [...] But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe [...] Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem [...] Of our integritie: his foul esteeme [...] Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns [...] 330 [...] Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard [...] By us? who rather double honour gaine [...] From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within, [...] Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event. [...] And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid [...] Alone, without exterior help sustaind? [...] Let us not then suspect our happie State [...] Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, [...] As not secure to single or combin'd. [...] Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, [...] 340 [...] And Eden were no Eden thus expos'd. [...] To whom thus Adam fervently repli'd. [...] O Woman, best are all things as the will [...] Of God ordaind them, his creating hand [...] Nothing imperfet or deficient left [...] Of all that he Created, much less Man, [...] Or ought that might his happie State secure, [...] Secure from outward force; within himself [...] The danger lies, yet lies within his power: [...] Against his will he can receave no harme. [...] 350 [...] But God left free the Will, for what obeyes [...] Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, [...] But bid her well beware, and still erect, [...] Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd [...] She dictate false, and missinforme the Will [...] To do what God expresly hath forbid. [...] Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, [...] That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. [...] Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, [...] Since Reason not impossibly may meet [...] 360 [...] Some specious object by the Foe subornd, [...] And fall into deception unaware, [...] Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. [...] Seek not temptation then, which to avoide [...] Were better, and most likelie if from mee [...] Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought. [...] Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve [...] First thy obedience; th' other who can know, [...] Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? [...] But if thou think, trial unsought may finde [...] 370 [...] Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, [...] Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; [...] Go in thy native innocence, relie [...] On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, [...] For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. [...] So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve [...] Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd. [...] With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd [...] Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words [...] Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, [...] 380 [...] May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd, [...] The willinger I goe, nor much expect [...] A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; [...] So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. [...] Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand [...] Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light [...] Oread or Dryad, or of Delia's Traine, [...] Betook her to the Groves, but Delia's self [...] In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport, [...] Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, [...] 390 [...] But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude, [...] Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought, [...] To Pales, or Pomona, thus adornd, [...] Likest she seemd, Pomona when she fled [...] Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, [...] Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. [...] Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu'd [...] Delighted, but desiring more her stay. [...] Oft he to her his charge of quick returne, [...] Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd [...] 400 [...] To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, [...] And all things in best order to invite [...] Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. [...] O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless Eve, [...] Of thy presum'd return! event perverse! [...] Thou never from that houre in Paradise [...] Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose; [...] Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades [...] Waited with hellish rancor imminent [...] To intercept thy way, or send thee back [...] 410 [...] Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. [...] For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, [...] Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, [...] And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde [...] The onely two of Mankinde, but in them [...] The whole included Race, his purposd prey. [...] In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft [...] Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, [...] Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, [...] By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet [...] 420 [...] He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find [...] Eve separate, he wish'd, but not with hope [...] Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish, [...] Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, [...] Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, [...] Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round [...] About her glowd, oft stooping to support [...] Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay [...] Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, [...] Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies [...] 430 [...] Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, [...] Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, [...] From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. [...] Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers'd [...] Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, [...] Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen [...] Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours [...] Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: [...] Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd [...] Or of reviv'd Adonis, or renownd [...] 440 [...] Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, [...] Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King [...] Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. [...] Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more. [...] As one who long in populous City pent, [...] Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, [...] Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe [...] Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes [...] Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, [...] The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, [...] 450 [...] Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; [...] If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, [...] What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, [...] She most, and in her look summs all Delight. [...] Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold [...] This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve [...] Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme [...] Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, [...] Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire [...] Of gesture or lest action overawd [...] 460 [...] His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd [...] His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: [...] That space the Evil one abstracted stood [...] From his own evil, and for the time remaind [...] Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd, [...] Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; [...] But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, [...] Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight, [...] And tortures him now more, the more he sees [...] Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon [...] 470 [...] Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts [...] Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. [...] Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet [...] Compulsion thus transported to forget [...] What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope [...] Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste [...] Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, [...] Save what is in destroying, other joy [...] To me is lost. Then let me not let pass [...] Occasion which now smiles, behold alone [...] 480 [...] The Woman, opportune to all attempts, [...] Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, [...] Whose higher intellectual more I shun, [...] And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb [...] Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, [...] Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, [...] I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine [...] Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n. [...] Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, [...] Not terrible, though terrour be in Love [...] 490 [...] And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, [...] Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd, [...] The way which to her ruin now I tend. [...] So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd [...] In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve [...] Address'd his way, not with indented wave, [...] Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, [...] Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd [...] Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head [...] Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; [...] 500 [...] With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect [...] Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass [...] Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, [...] And lovely, never since of Serpent kind [...] Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang'd [...] Hermione and Cadmus, or the God [...] In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd [...] Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, [...] Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore [...] Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique [...] 510 [...] At first, as one who sought access, but feard [...] To interrupt, side-long he works his way. [...] As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought [...] Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind [...] Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; [...] So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine [...] Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, [...] To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound [...] Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd [...] To such disport before her through the Field, [...] 520 [...] From every Beast, more duteous at her call, [...] Then at Circean call the Herd disguis'd. [...] Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood; [...] But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd [...] His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck, [...] Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod. [...] His gentle dumb expression turnd at length [...] The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad [...] Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue [...] Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, [...] 530 [...] His fraudulent temptation thus began. [...] Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps [...] Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm [...] Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain, [...] Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze [...] Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard [...] Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd. [...] Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, [...] Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine [...] By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore [...] 540 [...] With ravishment beheld, there best beheld [...] Where universally admir'd; but here [...] In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, [...] Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne [...] Half what in thee is fair, one man except, [...] Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen [...] A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd [...] By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. [...] So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd; [...] Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, [...] 550 [...] Though at the voice much marveling; at length [...] Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake. [...] What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't [...] By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? [...] The first at lest of these I thought deni'd [...] To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day [...] Created mute to all articulat sound; [...] The latter I demurre, for in thir looks [...] Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. [...] Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field [...] 560 [...] I knew, but not with human voice endu'd; [...] Redouble then this miracle, and say, [...] How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how [...] To me so friendly grown above the rest [...] Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? [...] Say, for such wonder claims attention due. [...] To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd. [...] Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, [...] Easie to mee it is to tell thee all [...] What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: [...] 570 [...] I was at first as other Beasts that graze [...] The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, [...] As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd [...] Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: [...] Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd [...] A goodly Tree farr distant to behold [...] Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, [...] Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; [...] When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n, [...] Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense [...] 580 [...] Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats [...] Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, [...] Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. [...] To satisfie the sharp desire I had [...] Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd [...] Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, [...] Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent [...] Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene. [...] About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon, [...] For high from ground the branches would require [...] 590 [...] Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree [...] All other Beasts that saw, with like desire [...] Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. [...] Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung [...] Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill [...] I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour [...] At Feed or Fountain never had I found. [...] Sated at length, ere long I might perceave [...] Strange alteration in me, to degree [...] Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech [...] 600 [...] Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind. [...] Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep [...] I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind [...] Considerd all things visible in Heav'n, [...] Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; [...] But all that fair and good in thy Divine [...] Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray [...] United I beheld; no Fair to thine [...] Equivalent or second, which compel'd [...] Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come [...] 610 [...] And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd [...] Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. [...] So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and Eve [...] Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd. [...] Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt [...] The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd: [...] But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? [...] For many are the Trees of God that grow [...] In Paradise, and various, yet unknown [...] To us, in such abundance lies our choice, [...] 620 [...] As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, [...] Still hanging incorruptible, till men [...] Grow up to thir provision, and more hands [...] Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. [...] To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. [...] Empress, the way is readie, and not long, [...] Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, [...] Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past [...] Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept [...] My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. [...] 630 [...] Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld [...] In tangles, and make intricate seem strait, [...] To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy [...] Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire [...] Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night [...] Condenses, and the cold invirons round, [...] Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame, [...] Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends, [...] Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, [...] Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way [...] 640 [...] To Boggs and Mires, & oft through Pond or Poole, [...] There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr. [...] So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud [...] Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree [...] Of prohibition, root of all our woe; [...] Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. [...] Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither, [...] Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess, [...] The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, [...] Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. [...] 650 [...] But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; [...] God so commanded, and left that Command [...] Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live [...] Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. [...] To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd. [...] Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit [...] Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, [...] Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire? [...] To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit [...] Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, [...] 660 [...] But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst [...] The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate [...] Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. [...] She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold [...] The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love [...] To Man, and indignation at his wrong, [...] New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd, [...] Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act [...] Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin. [...] As when of old som Orator renound [...] 670 [...] In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence [...] Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, [...] Stood in himself collected, while each part, [...] Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, [...] Somtimes in highth began, as no delay [...] Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. [...] So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown [...] The Tempter all impassiond thus began. [...] O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, [...] Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power [...] 680 [...] Within me cleere, not onely to discerne [...] Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes [...] Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. [...] Queen of this Universe, doe not believe [...] Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: [...] How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life [...] To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, [...] Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live, [...] And life more perfet have attaind then Fate [...] Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. [...] 690 [...] Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast [...] Is open? or will God incense his ire [...] For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise [...] Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain [...] Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be, [...] Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade [...] To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; [...] Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil [...] Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? [...] God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; [...] 700 [...] Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid: [...] Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. [...] Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, [...] Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, [...] His worshippers; he knows that in the day [...] Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, [...] Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then [...] Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, [...] Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. [...] That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, [...] 710 [...] Internal Man, is but proportion meet, [...] I of brute human, yee of human Gods. [...] So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off [...] Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, [...] Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring [...] And what are Gods that Man may not become [...] As they, participating God-like food? [...] The Gods are first, and that advantage use [...] On our belief, that all from them proceeds, [...] I question it, for this fair Earth I see, [...] 720 [...] Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind, [...] Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd [...] Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, [...] That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains [...] Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies [...] Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know? [...] What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree [...] Impart against his will if all be his? [...] Or is it envie, and can envie dwell [...] In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more [...] 730 [...] Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. [...] Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. [...] He ended, and his words replete with guile [...] Into her heart too easie entrance won: [...] Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold [...] Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound [...] Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd [...] With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; [...] Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd [...] An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell [...] 740 [...] So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, [...] Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, [...] Sollicited her longing eye; yet first [...] Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd. [...] Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, [...] Though kept from Man, & worthy to be admir'd, [...] Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay [...] Gave elocution to the mute, and taught [...] The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: [...] Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, [...] 750 [...] Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree [...] Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; [...] Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding [...] Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good [...] By thee communicated, and our want: [...] For good unknown, sure is not had, or had [...] And yet unknown, is as not had at all. [...] In plain then, what forbids he but to know, [...] Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? [...] Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death [...] 760 [...] Bind us with after-bands, what profits then [...] Our inward freedom? In the day we eate [...] Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. [...] How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives, [...] And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes, [...] Irrational till then. For us alone [...] Was death invented? or to us deni'd [...] This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd? [...] For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first [...] Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy [...] 770 [...] The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect, [...] Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. [...] What fear I then, rather what know to feare [...] Under this ignorance of Good and Evil, [...] Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? [...] Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, [...] Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, [...] Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then [...] To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? [...] So saying, her rash hand in evil hour [...] 780 [...] Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: [...] Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat [...] Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, [...] That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk [...] The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve [...] Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else [...] Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, [...] In Fruit she never tasted, whether true [...] Or fansied so, through expectation high [...] Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. [...] 790 [...] Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint, [...] And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, [...] And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, [...] Thus to her self she pleasingly began. [...] O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees [...] In Paradise, of operation blest [...] To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd, [...] And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end [...] Created; but henceforth my early care, [...] Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise [...] 800 [...] Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease [...] Of thy full branches offer'd free to all; [...] Till dieted by thee I grow mature [...] In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; [...] Though others envie what they cannot give; [...] For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here [...] Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, [...] Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind [...] In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way, [...] And giv'st access, though secret she retire. [...] 810 [...] And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high, [...] High and remote to see from thence distinct [...] Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps [...] May have diverted from continual watch [...] Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies [...] About him. But to Adam in what sort [...] Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known [...] As yet my change, and give him to partake [...] Full happiness with mee, or rather not, [...] But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power [...] 820 [...] Without Copartner? so to add what wants [...] In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, [...] And render me more equal, and perhaps [...] A thing not undesireable, somtime [...] Superior; for inferior who is free? [...] This may be well: but what if God have seen, [...] And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, [...] And Adam wedded to another Eve, [...] Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; [...] A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve, [...] 830 [...] Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: [...] So dear I love him, that with him all deaths [...] I could endure; without him live no life. [...] So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, [...] But first low Reverence don, as to the power [...] That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd [...] Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd [...] From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while [...] Waiting desirous her return, had wove [...] Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne [...] 840 [...] Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown [...] As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. [...] Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new [...] Solace in her return, so long delay'd; [...] Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, [...] Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; [...] And forth to meet her went, the way she took [...] That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree [...] Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, [...] Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand [...] 850 [...] A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd, [...] New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd. [...] To him she hasted, in her face excuse [...] Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, [...] Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. [...] Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? [...] Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd [...] Thy presence, agonie of love till now [...] Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more [...] Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought, [...] 860 [...] The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange [...] Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: [...] This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree [...] Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown [...] Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect [...] To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; [...] And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise, [...] Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, [...] Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become, [...] Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth [...] 870 [...] Endu'd with human voice and human sense, [...] Reasoning to admiration, and with mee [...] Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I [...] Have also tasted, and have also found [...] Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, [...] Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, [...] And growing up to Godhead; which for thee [...] Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. [...] For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, [...] Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon. [...] 880 [...] Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot [...] May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love; [...] Least thou not tasting, different degree [...] Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce [...] Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. [...] Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; [...] But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. [...] On th' other side, Adam, soon as he heard [...] The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz'd, [...] Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill [...] 890 [...] Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd; [...] From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for Eve [...] Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed: [...] Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length [...] First to himself he inward silence broke. [...] O fairest of Creation, last and best [...] Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd [...] Whatever can to fight or thought be found, [...] Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! [...] How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, [...] 900 [...] Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote? [...] Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress [...] The strict forbiddance, how to violate [...] The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud [...] Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown, [...] And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee [...] Certain my resolution is to Die; [...] How can I live without thee, how forgoe [...] Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd, [...] To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? [...] 910 [...] Should God create another Eve, and I [...] Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee [...] Would never from my heart; no no, I feel [...] The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, [...] Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State [...] Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. [...] So having said, as one from sad dismay [...] Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd [...] Submitting to what seemd remediless, [...] Thus in calme mood his Words to Eve he turnd. [...] 920 [...] Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous Eve, [...] And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd [...] Had it bin onely coveting to Eye [...] That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, [...] Much more to taste it under banne to touch. [...] But past who can recall, or don undoe? [...] Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so [...] Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact [...] Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, [...] Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first [...] 930 [...] Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes; [...] Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives, [...] Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man [...] Higher degree of Life, inducement strong [...] To us, as likely tasting to attaine [...] Proportional ascent, which cannot be [...] But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. [...] Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, [...] Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy [...] Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high, [...] 940 [...] Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, [...] For us created, needs with us must faile, [...] Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, [...] Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, [...] Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power [...] Creation could repeate, yet would be loath [...] Us to abolish, least the Adversary [...] Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God [...] Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first [...] He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? [...] 950 [...] Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe. [...] However I with thee have fixt my Lot, [...] Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death [...] Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; [...] So forcible within my heart I feel [...] The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, [...] My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; [...] Our State cannot be severd, we are one, [...] One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. [...] So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli'd. [...] 960 [...] O glorious trial of exceeding Love, [...] Illustrious evidence, example high! [...] Ingaging me to emulate, but short [...] Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, [...] Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, [...] And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, [...] One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff [...] This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, [...] Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread [...] Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, [...] 970 [...] To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, [...] If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, [...] Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, [...] Direct, or by occasion hath presented [...] This happie trial of thy Love, which else [...] So eminently never had bin known. [...] Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue [...] This my attempt, I would sustain alone [...] The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die [...] Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact [...] 980 [...] Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd [...] Remarkably so late of thy so true, [...] So faithful Love unequald; but I feel [...] Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life [...] Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, [...] Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before [...] Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. [...] On my experience, Adam, freely taste, [...] And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. [...] So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy [...] 990 [...] Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love [...] Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr [...] Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. [...] In recompence (for such compliance bad [...] Such recompence best merits) from the bough [...] She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit [...] With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat [...] Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd, [...] But fondly overcome with Femal charm. [...] Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again [...] 1000 [...] In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, [...] Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops [...] Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin [...] Original; while Adam took no thought, [...] Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate [...] Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe [...] Him with her lov'd societie, that now [...] As with new Wine intoxicated both [...] They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel [...] Divinitie within them breeding wings [...] 1010 [...] Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit [...] Farr other operation first displaid, [...] Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve [...] Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him [...] As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: [...] Till Adam thus 'gan Eve to dalliance move. [...] Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, [...] And elegant, of Sapience no small part, [...] Since to each meaning savour we apply, [...] And Palate call judicious; I the praise [...] 1020 [...] <b>Yeild</b> thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd. [...] Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd [...] From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now [...] True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be [...] In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd, [...] For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. [...] But come, so well refresh't, now let us play, [...] As meet is, after such delicious Fare; [...] For never did thy Beautie since the day [...] I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd [...] 1030 [...] With all perfections, so enflame my sense [...] With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now [...] Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. [...] So said he, and forbore not glance or toy [...] Of amorous intent, well understood [...] Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. [...] Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank, [...] Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd [...] He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, [...] Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, [...] 1040 [...] And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. [...] There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport [...] Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, [...] The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep [...] Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. [...] Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, [...] That with exhilerating vapour bland [...] About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers [...] Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep [...] Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams [...] 1050 [...] Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose [...] As from unrest, and each the other viewing, [...] Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds [...] How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile [...] Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon, [...] Just confidence, and native righteousness, [...] And honour from about them, naked left [...] To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe [...] Uncover'd more. So rose the Danite strong [...] Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap [...] 1060 [...] Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak'd [...] Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare [...] Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face [...] Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute, [...] Till Adam, though not less then Eve abasht, [...] At length gave utterance to these words constraind. [...] O Eve, in evil hour thou didst give care [...] To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught [...] To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, [...] False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes [...] 1070 [...] Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know [...] Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got, [...] Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, [...] Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, [...] Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, [...] Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, [...] And in our Faces evident the signes [...] Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; [...] Even shame, the last of evils; of the first [...] Be sure then. How shall I behold the face [...] 1080 [...] Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy [...] And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes [...] Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze [...] Insufferably bright. O might I here [...] In solitude live savage, in some glad [...] Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable [...] To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad, [...] And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, [...] Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs [...] Hide me, where I may never see them more. [...] 1090 [...] But let us now, as in bad plight, devise [...] What best may for the present serve to hide [...] The Parts of each from other, that seem most [...] To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, [...] Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, [...] And girded on our loyns, may cover round [...] Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, [...] There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. [...] So counsel'd hee, and both together went [...] Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose [...] 1100 [...] The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd, [...] But such as at this day to Indians known [...] In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes [...] Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground [...] The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow [...] About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade [...] High overarch't, and echoing Walks between; [...] There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate [...] Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds [...] At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves [...] 1110 [...] They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, [...] And with what skill they had, together sowd, [...] To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide [...] Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike [...] To that first naked Glorie. Such of late [...] Columbus found th' American to girt [...] With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde [...] Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. [...] Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part [...] Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, [...] 1120 [...] They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares [...] Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within [...] Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, [...] Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore [...] Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once [...] And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: [...] For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will [...] Heard not her lore, both in subjection now [...] To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe [...] Usurping over sovran Reason claimd [...] 1130 [...] Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest, [...] Adam, estrang'd in look and alterd stile, [...] Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. [...] Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, & stai'd [...] With me, as I besought thee, when that strange [...] Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, [...] I know not whence possessd thee; we had then [...] Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild [...] Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable. [...] Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve [...] 1140 [...] The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek [...] Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. [...] To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus Eve. [...] What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, [...] Imput'st thou that to my default, or will [...] Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows [...] But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by, [...] Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there, [...] Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd [...] Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; [...] 1150 [...] No ground of enmitie between us known, [...] Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme. [...] Was I to have never parted from thy side? [...] As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. [...] Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head [...] Command me absolutely not to go, [...] Going into such danger as thou saidst? [...] Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, [...] Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. [...] Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, [...] 1160 [...] Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee. [...] To whom then first incenst Adam repli'd. [...] Is this the Love, is the recompence [...] Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest [...] Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, [...] Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss, [...] Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: [...] And am I now upbraided, as the cause [...] Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, [...] It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? [...] 1170 [...] I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold [...] The danger, and the lurking Enemie [...] That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, [...] And force upon free Will hath here no place. [...] But confidence then bore thee on, secure [...] Either to meet no danger, or to finde [...] Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps [...] I also err'd in overmuch admiring [...] What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought [...] No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue [...] 1180 [...] That errour now, which is become my crime, [...] And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall [...] Him who to worth in Women overtrusting [...] Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook, [...] And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, [...] Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. [...] Thus they in mutual accusation spent [...] The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning [...] And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.|$|E

What if that light [...] 140 [...] Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, [...] To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr [...] Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night [...] This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, [...] Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest [...] As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce [...] Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate [...] Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps [...] With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie [...] Communicating Male and Femal Light, [...] 150 [...] Which two great Sexes animate the World, [...] Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live. [...] For such vast room in Nature unpossest [...] By living Soule, desert and desolate, [...] Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute [...] Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr [...] Down to this habitable, which returnes [...] Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.

[...] To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli'd. [...] How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure [...] 180 [...] Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene, [...] And freed from intricacies, taught to live, [...] The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts [...] To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which [...] God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, [...] And not molest us, unless we our selves [...] Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine. [...] But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave [...] Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; [...] Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne, [...] 190 [...] That not to know at large of things remote [...] From use, obscure and suttle, but to know [...] That which before us lies in daily life, [...] Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, [...] Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, [...] And renders us in things that most concerne [...] Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek. [...] Therefore from this high pitch let us descend [...] A lower flight, and speak of things at hand [...] Useful, whence haply mention may arise [...] 200 [...] Of somthing not unseasonable to ask [...] By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd. [...] Thee I have heard relating what was don [...] Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate [...] My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; [...] And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest [...] How suttly to detaine thee I devise, [...] Inviting thee to hear while I relate, [...] Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: [...] For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n, [...] 210 [...] And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare [...] Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst [...] And hunger both, from labour, at the houre [...] Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, [...] Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine [...] Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. [...] To whom thus Raphael answer'd heav'nly meek. [...] Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, [...] Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee [...] Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd, [...] 220 [...] Inward and outward both, his image faire: [...] Speaking or mute all comliness and grace [...] Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes. [...] Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth [...] Then of our fellow servant, and inquire [...] Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: [...] For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set [...] On Man his equal Love: say therefore on; [...] For I that Day was absent, as befell, [...] Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, [...] 230 [...] Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; [...] Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had) [...] To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie, [...] Or enemie, while God was in his work, [...] Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, [...] Destruction with Creation might have mixt. [...] Not that they durst without his leave attempt, [...] But us he sends upon his high behests [...] For state, as Sovran King, and to enure [...] Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut [...] 240 [...] The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong; [...] But long ere our approaching heard within [...] Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, [...] Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage. [...] Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light [...] Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge. [...] But thy relation now; for I attend, [...] Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine. [...] So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. [...] For Man to tell how human Life began [...] 250 [...] Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? [...] Desire with thee still longer to converse [...] Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep [...] Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid [...] In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun [...] Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed. [...] Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd, [...] And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd [...] By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, [...] As thitherward endevoring, and upright [...] 260 [...] Stood on my feet; about me round I saw [...] Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, [...] And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, [...] Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew, [...] Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd, [...] With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd. [...] My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb [...] Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran [...] With supple joints, as lively vigour led: [...] But who I was, or where, or from what cause, [...] 270 [...] Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake, [...] My Tongue obey'd and readily could name [...] What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, [...] And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay, [...] Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, [...] And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, [...] Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? [...] Not of my self; by some great Maker then, [...] In goodness and in power praeeminent; [...] Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, [...] 280 [...] From whom I have that thus I move and live, [...] And feel that I am happier then I know. [...] While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither, [...] From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld [...] This happie Light, when answer none return'd, [...] On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours [...] Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep [...] First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd [...] My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought [...] I then was passing to my former state [...] 290 [...] Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: [...] When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, [...] Whose inward apparition gently mov'd [...] My Fancy to believe I yet had being, [...] And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, [...] And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, [...] First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd [...] First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide [...] To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd. [...] So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd, [...] 300 [...] And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire [...] Smooth sliding without step, last led me up [...] A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, [...] A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees [...] Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw [...] Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree [...] Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye [...] Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite [...] To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found [...] Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream [...] 310 [...] Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun [...] My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide [...] Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd, [...] Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw [...] In adoration at his feet I fell [...] Submiss: he rear'd me, & Whom thou soughtst I am, [...] Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest [...] Above, or round about thee or beneath. [...] This Paradise I give thee, count it thine [...] To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: [...] 320 [...] Of every Tree that in the Garden growes [...] Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: [...] But of the Tree whose operation brings [...] Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set [...] The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith, [...] Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life, [...] Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, [...] And shun the bitter consequence: for know, [...] The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command [...] Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; [...] 330 [...] From that day mortal, and this happie State [...] Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World [...] Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd [...] The rigid interdiction, which resounds [...] Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice [...] Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect [...] Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd. [...] Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth [...] To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords [...] Possess it, and all things that therein live, [...] 340 [...] Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. [...] In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold [...] After thir kindes; I bring them to receave [...] From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie [...] With low subjection; understand the same [...] Of Fish within thir watry residence, [...] Not hither summond, since they cannot change [...] Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. [...] As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold [...] Approaching two and two, These cowring low [...] 350 [...] With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing. [...] I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood [...] Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd [...] My sudden apprehension: but in these [...] I found not what me thought I wanted still; [...] And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd. [...] O by what Name, for thou above all these, [...] Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, [...] Surpassest farr my naming, how may I [...] Adore thee, Author of this Universe, [...] 360 [...] And all this good to man, for whose well being [...] So amply, and with hands so liberal [...] Thou hast provided all things: but with mee [...] I see not who partakes. In solitude [...] What happiness, who can enjoy alone, [...] Or all enjoying, what contentment find? [...] Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, [...] As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd. [...] What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth [...] With various living creatures, and the Aire [...] 370 [...] Replenisht, and all these at thy command [...] To come and play before thee, know'st thou not [...] Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, [...] And reason not contemptibly; with these [...] Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. [...] So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd [...] So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd, [...] And humble deprecation thus repli'd. [...] Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power, [...] My Maker, be propitious while I speak. [...] 380 [...] Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, [...] And these inferiour farr beneath me set? [...] Among unequals what societie [...] Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? [...] Which must be mutual, in proportion due [...] Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie [...] The one intense, the other still remiss [...] Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove [...] Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak [...] Such as I seek, fit to participate [...] 390 [...] All rational delight, wherein the brute [...] Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce [...] Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; [...] So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd; [...] Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle [...] So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; [...] Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. [...] Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd. [...] A nice and suttle happiness I see [...] Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice [...] 400 [...] Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste [...] No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. [...] What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, [...] Seem I to thee sufficiently possest [...] Of happiness, or not? who am alone [...] From all Eternitie, for none I know [...] Second to mee or like, equal much less. [...] How have I then with whom to hold converse [...] Save with the Creatures which I made, and those [...] To me inferiour, infinite descents [...] 410 [...] Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? [...] He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine [...] The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes [...] All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; [...] Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee [...] Is no deficience found; not so is Man, [...] But in degree, the cause of his desire [...] By conversation with his like to help, [...] Or solace his defects. No need that thou [...] Shouldst propagat, already infinite; [...] 420 [...] And through all numbers absolute, though One; [...] But Man by number is to manifest [...] His single imperfection, and beget [...] Like of his like, his Image multipli'd, [...] In unitie defective, which requires [...] Collateral love, and deerest amitie. [...] Thou in thy secresie although alone, [...] Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not [...] Social communication, yet so pleas'd, [...] Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt [...] 430 [...] Of Union or Communion, deifi'd; [...] I by conversing cannot these erect [...] From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. [...] Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd [...] Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd [...] This answer from the gratious voice Divine. [...] Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas'd, [...] And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, [...] Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self, [...] Expressing well the spirit within thee free, [...] 440 [...] My Image, not imparted to the Brute, [...] Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee [...] Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, [...] And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st, [...] Knew it not good for Man to be alone, [...] And no such companie as then thou saw'st [...] Intended thee, for trial onely brought, [...] To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet: [...] What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd, [...] Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, [...] 450 [...] Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire. [...] Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now [...] My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd, [...] Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth [...] In that celestial Colloquie sublime, [...] As with an object that excels the sense, [...] Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair [...] Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd [...] By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes. [...] Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell [...] 460 [...] Of Fancie my internal sight, by which [...] Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, [...] Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape [...] Still glorious before whom awake I stood; [...] Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took [...] From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, [...] And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, [...] But suddenly with flesh fill'd up & heal'd: [...] The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; [...] Under his forming hands a Creature grew, [...] 470 [...] Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire, [...] That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now [...] Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd [...] And in her looks, which from that time infus'd [...] Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, [...] And into all things from her Aire inspir'd [...] The spirit of love and amorous delight. [...] She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd [...] To find her, or for ever to deplore [...] Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: [...] 480 [...] When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, [...] Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd [...] With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow [...] To make her amiable: On she came, [...] Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen, [...] And guided by his voice, nor uninformd [...] Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: [...] Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye, [...] In every gesture dignitie and love. [...] I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. [...] 490 [...] This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd [...] Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, [...] Giver of all things faire, but fairest this [...] Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see [...] Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self [...] Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man [...] Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe [...] Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; [...] And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. [...] She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, [...] 500 [...] Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, [...] Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, [...] That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won, [...] Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd, [...] The more desirable, or to say all, [...] Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, [...] Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd; [...] I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew, [...] And with obsequious Majestie approv'd [...] My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre [...] 510 [...] I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n, [...] And happie Constellations on that houre [...] Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth [...] Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; [...] Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires [...] Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings [...] Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, [...] Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night [...] Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr [...] On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. [...] 520 [...] Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought [...] My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss [...] Which I enjoy, and must confess to find [...] In all things else delight indeed, but such [...] As us'd or not, works in the mind no change, [...] Nor vehement desire, these delicacies [...] I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, & Flours, [...] Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here [...] Farr otherwise, transported I behold, [...] Transported touch; here passion first I felt, [...] 530 [...] Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else [...] Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake [...] Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. [...] Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part [...] Not proof enough such Object to sustain, [...] Or from my side subducting, took perhaps [...] More then enough; at least on her bestow'd [...] Too much of Ornament, in outward shew [...] Elaborate, of inward less exact. [...] For well I understand in the prime end [...] 540 [...] Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind [...] And inward Faculties, which most excell, [...] In outward also her resembling less [...] His Image who made both, and less expressing [...] The character of that Dominion giv'n [...] O're other Creatures; yet when I approach [...] Her loveliness, so absolute she seems [...] And in her self compleat, so well to know [...] Her own, that what she wills to do or say, [...] Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; [...] 550 [...] All higher knowledge in her presence falls [...] Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her [...] Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes; [...] Authoritie and Reason on her waite, [...] As one intended first, not after made [...] Occasionally; and to consummate all, [...] Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat [...] Build in her loveliest, and create an awe [...] About her, as a guard Angelic plac't. [...] To whom the Angel with contracted brow. [...] 560 [...] Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; [...] Do thou but thine, and be not diffident [...] Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou [...] Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, [...] By attributing overmuch to things [...] Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st. [...] For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so, [...] An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well [...] Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, [...] Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; [...] 570 [...] Then value: Oft times nothing profits more [...] Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right [...] Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st, [...] The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, [...] And to realities <b>yeild</b> all her shows; [...] Made so adorn for thy delight the more, [...] So awful, that with honour thou maist love [...] Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. [...] But if the sense of touch whereby mankind [...] Is propagated seem such dear delight [...] 580 [...] Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't [...] To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be [...] To them made common & divulg'd, if aught [...] Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue [...] The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. [...] What higher in her societie thou findst [...] Attractive, human, rational, love still; [...] In loving thou dost well, in passion not, [...] Wherein true Love consists not; love refines [...] The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat [...] 590 [...] In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale [...] By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend, [...] Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause [...] Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. [...] To whom thus half abash't Adam repli'd. [...] Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught [...] In procreation common to all kindes [...] (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, [...] And with mysterious reverence I deem) [...] So much delights me, as those graceful acts, [...] 600 [...] Those thousand decencies that daily flow [...] From all her words and actions, mixt with Love [...] And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd [...] Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; [...] Harmonie to behold in wedded pair [...] More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. [...] Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose [...] What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, [...] Who meet with various objects, from the sense [...] Variously representing; yet still free [...] 610 [...] Approve the best, and follow what I approve. [...] To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist [...] Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide; [...] Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; [...] Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love [...] Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix [...] Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? [...] To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd [...] Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, [...] Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st [...] 620 [...] Us happie, and without Love no happiness. [...] Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st [...] (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy [...] In eminence, and obstacle find none [...] Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: [...] Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace, [...] Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure [...] Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need [...] As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. [...] But I can now no more; the parting Sun [...] 630 [...] Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles [...] Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. [...] Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all [...] Him whom to love is to obey, and keep [...] His great command; take heed least Passion sway [...] Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will [...] Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons [...] The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware. [...] I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, [...] And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall [...] 640 [...] Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. [...] Perfet within, no outward aid require; [...] And all temptation to transgress repel. [...] So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus [...] Follow'd with benediction. Since to part, [...] Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, [...] Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. [...] Gentle to me and affable hath been [...] Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever [...] With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind [...] 650 [...] Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

[...] Now had the Almighty Father from above, [...] From the pure Empyrean where he sits [...] High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye, [...] His own works and their works at once to view: [...] About him all the Sanctities of Heaven [...] 60 [...] Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd [...] Beatitude past utterance; on his right [...] The radiant image of his Glory sat, [...] His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld [...] Our two first Parents, yet the onely two [...] Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't, [...] Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, [...] Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love [...] In blissful solitude; he then survey'd [...] Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there [...] 70 [...] Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night [...] In the dun Air sublime, and ready now [...] To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet [...] On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd [...] Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament, [...] Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. [...] Him God beholding from his prospect high, [...] Wherein past, present, future he beholds, [...] Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. [...] Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage [...] 80 [...] Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds [...] Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains [...] Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss [...] Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems [...] On desperat revenge, that shall redound [...] Upon his own rebellious head. And now [...] Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way [...] Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light, [...] Directly towards the new created World, [...] And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay [...] 90 [...] If him by force he can destroy, or worse, [...] By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert; [...] For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes, [...] And easily transgress the sole Command, [...] Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall [...] Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? [...] Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee [...] All he could have; I made him just and right, [...] Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. [...] Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers [...] 100 [...] And Spirits, both them who stood & them who faild; [...] Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. [...] Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere [...] Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, [...] Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, [...] Not what they would? what praise could they receive? [...] What pleasure I from such obedience paid, [...] When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) [...] Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, [...] Made passive both, had servd necessitie, [...] 110 [...] Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd, [...] So were created, nor can justly accuse [...] Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate; [...] As if Predestination over-rul'd [...] Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree [...] Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed [...] Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, [...] Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, [...] Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown. [...] So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, [...] 120 [...] Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, [...] They trespass, Authors to themselves in all [...] Both what they judge and what they choose; for so [...] I formd them free, and free they must remain, [...] Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change [...] Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree [...] Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd [...] Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall. [...] The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, [...] Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd [...] 130 [...] By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, [...] The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, [...] Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, [...] But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. [...] Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd [...] All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect [...] Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd: [...] Beyond compare the Son of God was seen [...] Most glorious, in him all his Father shon [...] Substantially express'd, and in his face [...] 140 [...] Divine compassion visibly appeerd, [...] Love without end, and without measure Grace, [...] Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. [...] O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd [...] Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; [...] For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll [...] Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound [...] Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne [...] Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest. [...] For should Man finally be lost, should Man [...] 150 [...] Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son [...] Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd [...] With his own folly? that be from thee farr, [...] That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge [...] Of all things made, and judgest onely right. [...] Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain [...] His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill [...] His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, [...] Or proud return though to his heavier doom, [...] Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell [...] 160 [...] Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, [...] By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self [...] Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, [...] For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? [...] So should thy goodness and thy greatness both [...] Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence. [...] To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd. [...] O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, [...] Son of my bosom, Son who art alone [...] My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, [...] 170 [...] All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all [...] As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: [...] Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will, [...] Yet not of will in him, but grace in me [...] Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew [...] His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd [...] By sin to foul exorbitant desires; [...] Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand [...] On even ground against his mortal foe, [...] By me upheld, that he may know how frail [...] 180 [...] His fall'n condition is, and to me ow [...] All his deliv'rance, and to none but me. [...] Some I have chosen of peculiar grace [...] Elect above the rest; so is my will: [...] The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd [...] Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes [...] Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace [...] Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, [...] What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts [...] To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. [...] 190 [...] To prayer, repentance, and obedience due, [...] Though but endevord with sincere intent, [...] Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. [...] And I will place within them as a guide [...] My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, [...] Light after light well us'd they shall attain, [...] And to the end persisting, safe arrive. [...] This my long sufferance and my day of grace [...] They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; [...] But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more, [...] 200 [...] That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; [...] And none but such from mercy I exclude. [...] But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, [...] Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns [...] Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n, [...] Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, [...] To expiate his Treason hath naught left, [...] But to destruction sacred and devote, [...] He with his whole posteritie must die, [...] Die hee or Justice must; unless for him [...] 210 [...] Som other able, and as willing, pay [...] The rigid satisfaction, death for death. [...] Say Heav'nly Powers, where shall we find such love, [...] Which of ye will be mortal to redeem [...] Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save, [...] Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? [...] He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute, [...] And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf [...] Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, [...] Much less that durst upon his own head draw [...] 220 [...] The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. [...] And now without redemption all mankind [...] Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell [...] By doom severe, had not the Son of God, [...] In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, [...] His dearest mediation thus renewd. [...] Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; [...] And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, [...] The speediest of thy winged messengers, [...] To visit all thy creatures, and to all [...] 230 [...] Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought, [...] Happie for man, so coming; be her aide [...] Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; [...] Attonement for himself or offering meet, [...] Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: [...] Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life [...] I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; [...] Account mee man; I for his sake will leave [...] Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee [...] Freely put off, and for him lastly die [...] 240 [...] Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage; [...] Under his gloomie power I shall not long [...] Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess [...] Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, [...] Though now to Death I <b>yeild,</b> and am his due [...] All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, [...] Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave [...] His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule [...] For ever with corruption there to dwell; [...] But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue [...] 250 [...] My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; [...] Death his deaths wound shall then receive, & stoop [...] Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd. [...] I through the ample Air in Triumph high [...] Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show [...] The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight [...] Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, [...] While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes, [...] Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: [...] Then with the multitude of my redeemd [...] 260 [...] Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, [...] Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud [...] Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd, [...] And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more [...] Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire. [...] His words here ended, but his meek aspect [...] Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love [...] To mortal men, above which only shon [...] Filial obedience: as a sacrifice [...] Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will [...] 270 [...] Of his great Father. Admiration seis'd [...] All Heav'n, what this might mean, & whither tend [...] Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd: [...] O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace [...] Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou [...] My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear, [...] To me are all my works, nor Man the least [...] Though last created, that for him I spare [...] Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, [...] By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. [...] 280 [...] Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme, [...] Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne; [...] And be thy self Man among men on Earth, [...] Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, [...] By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room [...] The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. [...] As in him perish all men, so in thee [...] As from a second root shall be restor'd, [...] As many as are restor'd, without thee none. [...] His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit [...] 290 [...] Imputed shall absolve them who renounce [...] Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, [...] And live in thee transplanted, and from thee [...] Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, [...] Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die, [...] And dying rise, and rising with him raise [...] His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. [...] So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate, [...] Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, [...] So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate [...] 300 [...] So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes [...] In those who, when they may, accept not grace. [...] Nor shalt thou by descending to assume [...] Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne. [...] Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss [...] Equal to God, and equally enjoying [...] God-like fruition, quitted all to save [...] A World from utter loss, and hast been found [...] By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, [...] Found worthiest to be so by being Good, [...] 310 [...] Farr more then Great or High; because in thee [...] Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, [...] Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt [...] With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; [...] Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne [...] Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, [...] Anointed universal King; all Power [...] I give thee, reign for ever, and assume [...] Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream [...] Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: [...] 320 [...] All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide [...] In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; [...] When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n [...] Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send [...] The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime [...] Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes [...] The living, and forthwith the cited dead [...] Of all past Ages to the general Doom [...] Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. [...] Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge [...] 330 [...] Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink [...] Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, [...] Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while [...] The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring [...] New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell [...] And after all thir tribulations long [...] See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, [...] With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. [...] Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, [...] For regal Scepter then no more shall need, [...] 340 [...] God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, [...] Adore him, who to compass all this dies, [...] Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. [...] No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all [...] The multitude of Angels with a shout [...] Loud as from numbers without number, sweet [...] As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung [...] With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's fill'd [...] Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent [...] Towards either Throne they bow, & to the ground [...] 350 [...] With solemn adoration down they cast [...] Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, [...] Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once [...] In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life [...] Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence [...] To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows, [...] And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, [...] And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn [...] Rowls o're Elisian Flours her Amber stream; [...] With these that never fade the Spirits Elect [...] 360 [...] Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams, [...] Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright [...] Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon [...] Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd. [...] Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took, [...] Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side [...] Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet [...] Of charming symphonie they introduce [...] Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; [...] No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine [...] 370 [...] Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n. [...] Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, [...] Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, [...] Eternal King; thee Author of all being, [...] Fountain of Light, thy self invisible [...] Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st [...] Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st [...] The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud [...] Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, [...] Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, [...] 380 [...] Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim [...] Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. [...] Thee next they sang of all Creation first, [...] Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, [...] In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud [...] Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines, [...] Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee [...] Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, [...] Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests. [...] Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein [...] 390 [...] By thee created, and by thee threw down [...] Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day [...] Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, [...] Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook [...] Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks [...] Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid. [...] Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime [...] Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might, [...] To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, [...] Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n, [...] 400 [...] Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome [...] So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: [...] No sooner did thy dear and onely Son [...] Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man [...] So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd, [...] He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife [...] Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd, [...] Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat [...] Second to thee, offerd himself to die [...] For mans offence. O unexampl'd love, [...] 410 [...] Love no where to be found less then Divine! [...] Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name [...] Shall be the copious matter of my Song [...] Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise [...] Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. [...] Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear, [...] Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. [...] Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe [...] Of this round World, whose first convex divides [...] The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd [...] 420 [...] From Chaos and th' inroad of Darkness old, [...] Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off [...] It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent [...] Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night [...] Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms [...] Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; [...] Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n [...] Though distant farr som small reflection gaines [...] Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: [...] Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field. [...] 430 [...] As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, [...] Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, [...] Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey [...] To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids [...] On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs [...] Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; [...] But in his way lights on the barren plaines [...] Of Sericana, where Chineses drive [...] With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: [...] So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend [...] 440 [...] Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey, [...] Alone, for other Creature in this place [...] Living or liveless to be found was none, [...] None yet, but store hereafter from the earth [...] Up hither like Aereal vapours flew [...] Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin [...] With vanity had filld the works of men: [...] Both all things vain, and all who in vain things [...] Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, [...] Or happiness in this or th' other life; [...] 450 [...] All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits [...] Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, [...] Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find [...] Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; [...] All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, [...] Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, [...] Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain, [...] Till final dissolution, wander here, [...] Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; [...] Those argent Fields more likely habitants, [...] 460 [...] Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold [...] Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde: [...] Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born [...] First from the ancient World those Giants came [...] With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: [...] The builders next of Babel on the Plain [...] Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe [...] New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: [...] Others came single; hee who to be deemd [...] A God, leap'd fondly into Aetna flames, [...] 470 [...] Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy [...] Plato's Elysium, leap'd into the Sea, [...] Cleombrotus, and many more too long, [...] Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers [...] White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. [...] Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek [...] In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n; [...] And they who {{to be sure of}} Paradise [...] Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, [...] Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd; [...] 480 [...] They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, [...] And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs [...] The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd; [...] And now Saint Peter at Heav'ns Wicket seems [...] To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot [...] Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe [...] A violent cross wind from either Coast [...] Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry [...] Into the devious Air; then might ye see [...] Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost [...] 490 [...] And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, [...] Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, [...] The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft [...] Fly o're the backside of the World farr off [...] Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld [...] The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown [...] Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod; [...] All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd, [...] And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame [...] Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste [...] 500 [...] His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries [...] Ascending by degrees magnificent [...] Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, [...] At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd [...] The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate [...] With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold [...] Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes [...] The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth [...] By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. [...] The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw [...] 510 [...] Angels ascending and descending, bands [...] Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled [...] To Padan-aram in the field of Luz, [...] Dreaming by night under the open Skie, [...] And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n. [...] Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood [...] There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes [...] Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd [...] Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon [...] Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd, [...] 520 [...] Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake [...] Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. [...] The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare [...] The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate [...] His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. [...] Direct against which op'nd from beneath, [...] Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise, [...] A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide, [...] Wider by farr then that of after-times [...] Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, [...] 530 [...] Over the Promis'd Land to God so dear, [...] By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, [...] On high behests his Angels to and fro [...] Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard [...] From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood [...] To Beersaba, where the Holy Land [...] Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; [...] So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set [...] To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. [...] Satan from hence now on the lower stair [...] 540 [...] That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate [...] Looks down with wonder at the sudden view [...] Of all this World at once. As when a Scout [...] Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone [...] All night; at last by break of chearful dawne [...] Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, [...] Which to his eye discovers unaware [...] The goodly prospect of some forein land [...] First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis [...] With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, [...] 550 [...] Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. [...] Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen, [...] The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd [...] At sight of all this World beheld so faire. [...] Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood [...] So high above the circling Canopie [...] Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point [...] Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears [...] Andromeda farr off Atlantick Seas [...] Beyond th' Horizon; then from Pole to Pole [...] 560 [...] He views in bredth, and without longer pause [...] Down right into the Worlds first Region throws [...] His flight precipitant, and windes with ease [...] Through the pure marble Air his oblique way [...] Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon [...] Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, [...] Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, [...] Like those Hesperian Gardens fam'd of old, [...] Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, [...] Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there [...] 570 [...] He stayd not to enquire: above them all [...] The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven [...] Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends [...] Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe [...] By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, [...] Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie [...] Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, [...] That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, [...] Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move [...] Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute [...] 580 [...] Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp [...] Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd [...] By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms [...] The Univers, and to each inward part [...] With gentle penetration, though unseen, [...] Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: [...] So wondrously was set his Station bright. [...] There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps [...] Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe [...] Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw. [...] 590 [...] The place he found beyond expression bright, [...] Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; [...] Not all parts like, but all alike informd [...] Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; [...] If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; [...] If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, [...] Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon [...] In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides [...] Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, [...] That stone, or like to that which here below [...] 600 [...] Philosophers in vain so long have sought, [...] In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde [...] Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound [...] In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, [...] Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. [...] What wonder then if fields and regions here [...] Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run [...] Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch [...] Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote [...] Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt [...] 610 [...] Here in the dark so many precious things [...] Of colour glorious and effect so rare? [...] Here matter new to gaze the Devil met [...] Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands, [...] For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, [...] But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon [...] Culminate from th' Aequator, as they now [...] Shot upward still direct, whence no way round [...] Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, [...] No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray [...] 620 [...] To objects distant farr, whereby he soon [...] Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, [...] The same whom John saw also in the Sun: [...] His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; [...] Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar [...] Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind [...] Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings [...] Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd [...] Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. [...] Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope [...] 630 [...] To find who might direct his wandring flight [...] To Paradise the happie seat of Man, [...] His journies end and our beginning woe. [...] But first he casts to change his proper shape, [...] Which else might work him danger or delay: [...] And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, [...] Not of the prime, yet such as in his face [...] Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb [...] Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd; [...] Under a Coronet his flowing haire [...] 640 [...] In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore [...] Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold, [...] His habit fit for speed succinct, and held [...] Before his decent steps a Silver wand. [...] He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, [...] Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, [...] Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known [...] Th' Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav'n [...] Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne [...] Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes [...] 650 [...] That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth [...] Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, [...] O're Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; [...] Uriel, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand [...] In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright, [...] The first art wont his great authentic will [...] Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring, [...] Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; [...] And here art likeliest by supream decree [...] Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye [...] 660 [...] To visit oft this new Creation round; [...] Unspeakable desire to see, and know [...] All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, [...] His chief delight and favour, him for whom [...] All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, [...] Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim [...] Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell [...] In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man [...] His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, [...] But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; [...] 670 [...] That I may find him, and with secret gaze, [...] Or open admiration him behold [...] On whom the great Creator hath bestowd [...] Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; [...] That both in him and all things, as is meet, [...] The Universal Maker we may praise; [...] Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes [...] To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss [...] Created this new happie Race of Men [...] To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. [...] 680 [...] So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; [...] For neither Man nor Angel can discern [...] Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks [...] Invisible, except to God alone, [...] By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth: [...] And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps [...] At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie [...] Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill [...] Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd [...] Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held [...] 690 [...] The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n; [...] Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule [...] In his uprightness answer thus returnd. [...] Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know [...] The works of God, thereby to glorifie [...] The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess [...] That reaches blame, but rather merits praise [...] The more it seems excess, that led thee hither [...] From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, [...] To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps [...] 700 [...] Contented with report heare onely in heav'n: [...] For wonderful indeed are all his works, [...] Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all [...] Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; [...] But what created mind can comprehend [...] Thir number, or the wisdom infinite [...] That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. [...] I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, [...] This worlds material mould, came to a heap: [...] Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar [...] 710 [...] Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd; [...] Till at his second bidding darkness fled, [...] Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: [...] Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then [...] The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, [...] And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n [...] Flew upward, spirited with various forms, [...] That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs [...] Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; [...] Each had his place appointed, each his course, [...] 720 [...] The rest in circuit walles this Universe. [...] Look downward on that Globe whose hither side [...] With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; [...] That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light [...] His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere [...] Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon [...] (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide [...] Timely interposes, and her monthly round [...] Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n; [...] With borrowd light her countenance triform [...] 730 [...] Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth, [...] And in her pale dominion checks the night. [...] That spot to which I point is Paradise, [...] Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. [...] Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. [...] Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, [...] As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, [...] Where honour due and reverence none neglects, [...] Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, [...] Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success, [...] 740 [...] Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele, [...] Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.|$|E

Awake [...] My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, [...] Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, [...] Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field [...] 20 [...] Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring [...] Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, [...] What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, [...] How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee [...] Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. [...] Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye [...] On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. [...] O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, [...] My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see [...] Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, [...] 30 [...] Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, [...] If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, [...] Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, [...] But of offence and trouble, which my mind [...] Knew never till this irksom night; methought [...] Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk [...] With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, [...] Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, [...] The cool, the silent, save where silence yields [...] To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake [...] 40 [...] Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes [...] Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light [...] Shadowie sets {{off the face of}} things; in vain, [...] If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, [...] Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, [...] In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment [...] Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. [...] I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; [...] To find thee I directed then my walk; [...] And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways [...] 50 [...] That brought me on a sudden to the Tree [...] Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, [...] Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: [...] And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood [...] One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n [...] By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd [...] Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; [...] And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, [...] Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, [...] Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? [...] 60 [...] Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? [...] Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold [...] Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? [...] This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme [...] He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd [...] At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: [...] But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, [...] Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, [...] Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit [...] For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: [...] 70 [...] And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more [...] Communicated, more abundant growes, [...] The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? [...] Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve, [...] Partake thou also; happie though thou art, [...] Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: [...] Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods [...] Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, [...] But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes [...] Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see [...] 80 [...] What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. [...] So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, [...] Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part [...] Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell [...] So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, [...] Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds [...] With him I flew, and underneath beheld [...] The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide [...] And various: wondring at my flight and change [...] To this high exaltation; suddenly [...] 90 [...] My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, [...] And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd [...] To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night [...] Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. [...] Best Image of my self and dearer half, [...] The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep [...] Affects me equally; nor can I like [...] This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; [...] Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, [...] Created pure. But know that in the Soule [...] 100 [...] Are many lesser Faculties that serve [...] Reason as chief; among these Fansie next [...] Her office holds; of all external things, [...] Which the five watchful Senses represent, [...] She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, [...] Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames [...] All what we affirm or what deny, and call [...] Our knowledge or opinion; then retires [...] Into her private Cell when Nature rests. [...] Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes [...] 110 [...] To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, [...] Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, [...] Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. [...] Som such resemblances methinks I find [...] Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, [...] But with addition strange; yet be not sad. [...] Evil into the mind of God or Man [...] May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave [...] No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope [...] That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, [...] 120 [...] Waking thou never wilt consent to do. [...] Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks [...] That wont to be more chearful and serene [...] Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, [...] And let us to our fresh imployments rise [...] Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours [...] That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells [...] Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. [...] So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, [...] But silently a gentle tear let fall [...] 130 [...] From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; [...] Two other precious drops that ready stood, [...] Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell [...] Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse [...] And pious awe, that feard to have offended. [...] So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. [...] But first from under shadie arborous roof, [...] Soon as they forth were come to open sight [...] Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen [...] With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, [...] 140 [...] Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, [...] Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East [...] Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains, [...] Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began [...] Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid [...] In various style, for neither various style [...] Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise [...] Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung [...] Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence [...] Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, [...] 150 [...] More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp [...] To add more sweetness, and they thus began. [...] These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, [...] Almightie, thine this universal Frame, [...] Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! [...] Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens [...] To us invisible or dimly seen [...] In these thy lowest works, yet these declare [...] Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: [...] Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, [...] 160 [...] Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs [...] And choral symphonies, Day without Night, [...] Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, [...] On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll [...] Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. [...] Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, [...] If better thou belong not to the dawn, [...] Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn [...] With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare [...] While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. [...] 170 [...] Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, [...] Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise [...] In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, [...] And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. [...] Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st [...] With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, [...] And yee five other wandring Fires that move [...] In mystic Dance not without Song, resound [...] His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. [...] Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth [...] 180 [...] Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run [...] Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix [...] And nourish all things, let your ceasless change [...] Varie to our great Maker still new praise. [...] Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise [...] From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, [...] Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, [...] In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, [...] Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, [...] Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, [...] 190 [...] Rising or falling still advance his praise. [...] His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, [...] Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, [...] With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. [...] Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, [...] Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. [...] Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, [...] That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, [...] Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; [...] Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk [...] 200 [...] The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; [...] Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, [...] To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade [...] Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. [...] Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still [...] To give us onely good; and if the night [...] Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, [...] Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. [...] So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts [...] Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. [...] 210 [...] On to thir mornings rural work they haste [...] Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row [...] Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr [...] Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check [...] Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine [...] To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines [...] Her mariageable arms, and with her brings [...] Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn [...] His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld [...] With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd [...] 220 [...] Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd [...] To travel with Tobias, and secur'd [...] His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. [...] Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth [...] Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf [...] Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd [...] This night the human pair, how he designes [...] In them at once to ruin all mankind. [...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] <b>Yeild</b> Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise, [...] Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly [...] These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth [...] Impendent, raging into sudden flame [...] Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel [...] His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire. [...] 890 [...] Then who created thee lamenting learne, [...] When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. [...] So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, [...] Among the faithless, faithful only hee; [...] Among innumerable false, unmov'd, [...] Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd [...] His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; [...] Nor number, nor example with him wrought [...] To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind [...] Though single. From amidst them forth he passd, [...] 900 [...] Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind [...] Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught; [...] And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd [...] On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.|$|E

[...] These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep [...] Shall <b>yeild</b> us, pregnant with infernal flame, [...] Which into hallow Engins long and round [...] Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire [...] Dilated and infuriate shall send forth [...] From far with thundring noise among our foes [...] Such implements of mischief as shall dash [...] To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands [...] Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd [...] 490 [...] The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.

[...] Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, [...] Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit [...] This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud [...] He comes, and settl'd in his face I see [...] 540 [...] Sad resolution and secure: let each [...] His Adamantine coat gird well, and each [...] Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, [...] Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, [...] If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, [...] But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. [...] So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon [...] In order, quit of all impediment; [...] Instant without disturb they took Allarm, [...] And onward move Embattelld; when behold [...] 550 [...] Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe [...] Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube [...] Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd [...] On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, [...] To hide the fraud. At interview both stood [...] A while, but suddenly at head appeerd [...] Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. [...] Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; [...] That all may see who hate us, how we seek [...] Peace and composure, and with open brest [...] 560 [...] Stand readie to receive them, if they like [...] Our overture, and turn not back perverse; [...] But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, [...] Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge [...] Freely our part: yee who appointed stand [...] Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch [...] What we propound, and loud that all may hear.

[...] 570 [...] Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, [...] A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid [...] On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd [...] Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr [...] With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd) [...] Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes [...] With hideous orifice gap't on us wide, [...] Portending hollow truce; at each behind [...] A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed [...] Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, [...] 580 [...] Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd, [...] Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds [...] Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd [...] With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, [...] But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd, [...] From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar [...] Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, [...] And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule [...] Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail [...] Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host [...] 590 [...] Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote, [...] That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, [...] Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell [...] By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd; [...] The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might [...] Have easily as Spirits evaded swift [...] By quick contraction or remove; but now [...] Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout; [...] Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files. [...] What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse [...] 600 [...] Repeated, and indecent overthrow [...] Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd, [...] And to thir foes a laughter; for in view [...] Stood rankt of Seraphim another row [...] In posture to displode thir second tire [...] Of Thunder: back defeated to return [...] They worse abhorr'd. Satan beheld thir plight, [...] And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. [...] O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? [...] Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, [...] 610 [...] To entertain them fair with open Front [...] And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms [...] Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds, [...] Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, [...] As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd [...] Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps [...] For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose [...] If our proposals once again were heard [...] We should compel them to a quick result. [...] To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood. [...] 620 [...] Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, [...] Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, [...] Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, [...] And stumbl'd many, who receives them right, [...] Had need from head to foot well understand; [...] Not understood, this gift they have besides, [...] They shew us when our foes walk not upright. [...] So they among themselves in pleasant veine [...] Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond [...] All doubt of Victorie, eternal might [...] 630 [...] To match with thir inventions they presum'd [...] So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, [...] And all his Host derided, while they stood [...] A while in trouble; but they stood not long, [...] Rage prompted them at length, & found them arms [...] Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. [...] Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power [...] Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd) [...] Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills [...] (For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n [...] 640 [...] Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) [...] Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, [...] From thir foundations loosning to and fro [...] They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, [...] Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops [...] Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, [...] Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host, [...] When coming towards them so dread they saw [...] The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd, [...] Till on those cursed Engins triple-row [...] 650 [...] They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence [...] Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, [...] Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads [...] Main Promontories flung, which in the Air [...] Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd, [...] Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd [...] Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain [...] Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, [...] Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind [...] Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, [...] 660 [...] Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. [...] The rest in imitation to like Armes [...] Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; [...] So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills [...] Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, [...] That under ground they fought in dismal shade; [...] Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game [...] To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt [...] Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n [...] Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred, [...] 670 [...] Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits [...] Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure, [...] Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen [...] This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: [...] That his great purpose he might so fulfill, [...] To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd [...] Upon his enemies, and to declare [...] All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son [...] Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began. [...] Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd, [...] 680 [...] Son in whose face invisible is beheld [...] Visibly, what by Deitie I am, [...] And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, [...] Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, [...] Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n, [...] Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame [...] These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, [...] As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd; [...] For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, [...] Equal in their Creation they were form'd, [...] 690 [...] Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought [...] Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; [...] Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last [...] Endless, and no solution will be found: [...] Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do, [...] And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines, [...] With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes [...] Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine. [...] Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; [...] For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr [...] 700 [...] Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine [...] Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou [...] Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace [...] Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know [...] In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, [...] And this perverse Commotion governd thus, [...] To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir [...] Of all things, to be Heir and to be King [...] By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. [...] Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, [...] 710 [...] Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles [...] That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, [...] My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms [...] Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; [...] Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out [...] From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep: [...] There let them learn, as likes them, to despise [...] God and Messiah his anointed King. [...] He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct [...] Shon full, he all his Father full exprest [...] 720 [...] Ineffably into his face receiv'd, [...] And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. [...] O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones, [...] First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst [...] To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, [...] As is most just; this I my Glorie account, [...] My exaltation, and my whole delight, [...] That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will [...] Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. [...] Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, [...] 730 [...] And gladlier shall resign, when in the end [...] Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee [...] For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st: [...] But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on [...] Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, [...] Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, [...] Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, [...] To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down [...] To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm, [...] That from thy just obedience could revolt, [...] 740 [...] Whom to obey is happiness entire. [...] Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure [...] Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount [...] Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, [...] Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. [...] So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose [...] From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, [...] And the third sacred Morn began to shine [...] Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound [...] The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, [...] 750 [...] Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, [...] It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd [...] By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each [...] Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all [...] And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels [...] Of Beril, and careering Fires between; [...] Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, [...] Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure [...] Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. [...] Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd [...] 760 [...] Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, [...] Ascended, at his right hand Victorie [...] Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow [...] And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd, [...] And from about him fierce Effusion rowld [...] Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; [...] Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, [...] He onward came, farr off his coming shon, [...] And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) [...] Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: [...] 770 [...] Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime [...] On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd. [...] Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own [...] First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd, [...] When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz'd [...] Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n: [...] Under whose Conduct Michael soon reduc'd [...] His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing, [...] Under thir Head imbodied all in one. [...] Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd; [...] 780 [...] At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd [...] Each to his place, they heard his voice and went [...] Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd, [...] And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd. [...] This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd, [...] And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers [...] Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. [...] In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? [...] But to convince the proud what Signs availe, [...] Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent? [...] 790 [...] They hard'nd more by what might most reclame, [...] Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight [...] Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, [...] Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud [...] Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile [...] Against God and Messiah, or to fall [...] In universal ruin last, and now [...] To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, [...] Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God [...] To all his Host on either hand thus spake. [...] 800 [...] Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand [...] Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest; [...] Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God [...] Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, [...] And as ye have receivd, so have ye don [...] Invincibly; but of this cursed crew [...] The punishment to other hand belongs, [...] Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; [...] Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd [...] Nor multitude, stand onely and behold [...] 810 [...] Gods indignation on these Godless pourd [...] By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd, [...] Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, [...] Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream [...] Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, [...] Hath honourd me according to his will. [...] Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd; [...] That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee [...] In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, [...] Or I alone against them, since by strength [...] 820 [...] They measure all, of other excellence [...] Not emulous, nor care who them excells; [...] Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. [...] So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd [...] His count'nance too severe to be beheld [...] And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. [...] At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings [...] With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes [...] Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound [...] Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. [...] 830 [...] Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, [...] Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles [...] The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, [...] All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon [...] Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand [...] Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent [...] Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd [...] Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, [...] All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd; [...] O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode [...] 840 [...] Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, [...] That wish'd the Mountains now might be again [...] Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. [...] Nor less on either side tempestuous fell [...] His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure, [...] Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels, [...] Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, [...] One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye [...] Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire [...] Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength, [...] 850 [...] And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, [...] Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n. [...] Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd [...] His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant [...] Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n: [...] The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard [...] Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd [...] Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd [...] With terrors and with furies to the bounds [...] And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, [...] 860 [...] Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd [...] Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight [...] Strook them with horror backward, but far worse [...] Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw [...] Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth [...] Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. [...] Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw [...] Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled [...] Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep [...] Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. [...] 870 [...] Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, [...] And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall [...] Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout [...] Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last [...] Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd, [...] Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire [...] Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. [...] Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird [...] Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. [...] Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes [...] 880 [...] Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: [...] To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood [...] Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, [...] With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went, [...] Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, [...] Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, [...] Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n, [...] Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode [...] Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts [...] And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd [...] 890 [...] On high; who into Glorie him receav'd, [...] Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. [...] Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth [...] At thy request, and that thou maist beware [...] By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd [...] What might have else to human Race bin hid; [...] The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n [...] Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall [...] Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld [...] With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, [...] 900 [...] Who now is plotting how he may seduce [...] Thee also from obedience, that with him [...] Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake [...] His punishment, Eternal miserie; [...] Which would be all his solace and revenge, [...] As a despite don against the most High, [...] Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. [...] But list'n not to his Temptations, warne [...] Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard [...] By terrible Example the reward [...] 910 [...] Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, [...] Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.|$|E

The light curve of this nova shows strong post-outburst oscillations as {{were observed in}} V 1178 Sco and V 4361 Sgr. Accurate astrometry of the nova <b>yeilded</b> an upper limit of 21 mag for the nova precursor. In combination with the observed decline rate, We propose that the nova should have either a short orbital period or a high inclination.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{computer}} simulation of hypothetical criticality excursions involving significant quantities of fissionable materials, especially in fissile aqueous system. The need arises due to the requirements for the emergency planning of facilities where the fissionable materials are handled, processed, or stored; and the regulatory requirements associated with facility operation or conversion. It is proposed here that a data base of fission <b>yeilds</b> for critical experiments and known accidents (both aqueous and solid) should be generated by using existing or new computer codes. The success in compiling this data base would provide useful source-terms for criticality excursions, realistic estimates of emergency-response boundary, as well as a replacement for the ``rule-of-thumb`` or ``bounding`` method. 10 refs...|$|R
