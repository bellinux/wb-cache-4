5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard gameplay, the player {{will also have to}} defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pokémon are oppressed by humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E

5|$|Anne was {{recalled}} {{to marry}} her Irish cousin, James Butler, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> several {{years older than she}} and who was living at the English court, in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.|$|E

25|$|A keen {{controversy}} {{arose in}} France and England {{as to the}} merits of the two astronomers. There was much criticism of Airy in England. Adams was a diffident <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> naturally reluctant to publish a result that would establish or ruin his career. Airy and Challis were criticised, particularly by James Glaisher, as failing to exercise their proper role as mentors of a young talent. Challis was contrite but Airy defended his own behaviour, claiming that the search for a planet was not the role of the Greenwich Observatory. On the whole, Airy has been defended by his biographers. In France the claims made for an unknown Englishman were resented as detracting from the credit due to Le Verrier's achievement.|$|E
25|$|Shaftesbury's amiability of {{character}} {{seems to have}} been one of his principal characteristics. Like Locke he had a peculiar pleasure in bringing forward young men. Among these may be especially mentioned Michael Ainsworth, a native of Wimborne St Giles, the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> the recipient of the Letters addressed to a student at the university, and was maintained by Shaftesbury at University College, Oxford. The interest which Shaftesbury took in his studies, and the desire that he should be specially fitted for the profession which he had selected, that of a clergyman of the Church of England, are marked features of the letters. Other protegés were Crell, a young Pole, the two young Furlys and Harry Wilkinson, a boy who was sent into Furly's office at Rotterdam, and to whom several of the letters still extant in the Record Office are addressed.|$|E
25|$|The most {{impressive}} of the burials without a chamber {{is that of}} a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> buried with his horse, in Mound 17. The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side-by-side under the mound. The man's oak coffin contained his pattern welded sword on his right and his sword-belt, wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with garnet cloisonné cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a scabbard-buckle. By the man's head was a firesteel and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of millefiori glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small cauldron and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound bucket and some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a bridle, mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with interlace ornamentation. These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.|$|E

500|$|Psychiatric {{examinations}} {{and psychological}} tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors {{noted that the}} boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour. Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner {{and had to be}} put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of [...] "an obvious mental breakdown". Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. [...] "I think this young man is developing a mental illness of hypomanic nature," [...] he wrote in his report. In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as [...] "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".|$|E

Dean visits the doctor's office, and learns that he was conducting secret dream experiments for his study on sleep disorders. Dean tracks down Jeremy, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> part of the sleep study {{because he could not}} dream. While they talk, Jeremy offers Dean a beer, and he drinks it. Jeremy (G. Michael Gray) reveals that the experiment allowed him to dream by drinking a yellow tea, but the dreams scared him so much that he dropped out of the study. Sam, who has been busy conducting research, later tells Dean that a plant known as [...] "African Dream Root" [...] allegedly allows a person to enter and manipulate others' dreams; they believe someone killed the doctor in this manner and is now targeting Bobby. As a terrified Bobby hides in a closet within his dream, Dean suggests to Sam that they themselves use the dream root to save him.|$|E
500|$|The series {{starts with}} Shinya Kogami, an Enforcer under Akane's watch {{during her first}} mission. Akane Tsunemori is a new police Inspector at Unit One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. Akane is ashamed of {{shooting}} Kogami under her watch during her first mission when she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life.

500|$|It is {{uncertain}} when Fawkes returned to England, {{but he was}} back in London by late August, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. [...] More gunpowder was brought into the room, along with firewood to conceal it. [...] The final three conspirators were recruited in late 1605. [...] At Michaelmas, Catesby persuaded the staunchly Catholic Ambrose Rookwood to rent Clopton House near Stratford-upon-Avon. [...] Rookwood was a young man with recusant connections, whose stable of horses at Coldham Hall in Stanningfield, Suffolk was an important factor in his enlistment. [...] His parents, Robert Rookwood and Dorothea Drury, were wealthy landowners, and had educated their son at a Jesuit school near Calais. [...] Everard Digby was a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> generally well liked, and lived at Gayhurst House in Buckinghamshire. [...] He had been knighted by the King in April 1603, and was converted to Catholicism by Gerard. [...] Digby and his wife, Mary Mulshaw, had accompanied the priest on his pilgrimage, and the two men were reportedly close friends. [...] Digby was asked by Catesby to rent Coughton Court near Alcester. [...] Digby also promised £1,500 after Percy failed to pay the rent due for the properties he had taken in Westminster. [...] Finally, on 14October Catesby invited Francis Tresham into the conspiracy. [...] Tresham was the son of the Catholic Thomas Tresham, and a cousin to Robert Catesby—the two had been raised together. [...] He was also the heir to his father's large fortune, which had been depleted by recusant fines, expensive tastes, and by Francis and Catesby's involvement in the Essex revolt.|$|E
