5|$|Pugs {{can suffer}} from necrotizing meningo{{encephalitis}} (NME), {{also known as}} Pug dog encephalitis (PDE), an inflammation {{of the brain and}} meninges. NME also occurs in other small dogs, such as the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Maltese, and Chihuahua. There is no known cure for NME, which is believed to be an inherited disease. Dogs usually die or have to be put to sleep within a few months of onset, which, in those susceptible to this condition, is typically between six months and seven years of age.|$|E
5|$|Inside a large, modernist house, Gerald (Lawson) {{turns on}} Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 {{and sits down}} to soup brought by his housekeeper, Kim (Veheary). Through the windows behind him, burglars Eddie (Pemberton) and Ray (Shearsmith) are seen. Ray enters the house, then lets in Eddie while Gerald is using the toilet. Eddie is shocked {{to see that the}} pair have come to steal an almost {{completely}} white painting. Ray starts to dismantle the painting while Eddie keeps watch; he tries to guide a <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier</b> out of the patio window, but inadvertently lets in an Irish Wolfhound. As Ray releases the wolfhound, Eddie accidentally throws the terrier into the window, so Ray stuffs the dog into an umbrella stand.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} bus operators within Sheffield: First South Yorkshire, Stagecoach Yorkshire, TM Travel, Hulleys of Baslow, Powells, G Holmes and Sheffield Community Transport. First South Yorkshire, became {{by far the}} largest bus operator and in recent years implemented a series of fare rises and service cuts which saw bus ridership drop. Recent developments have seen Stagecoach Sheffield taking over <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Andrews and parent company Yorkshire Traction, thus forming one company and in the process expanding their bus services in the city. This has resulted in increased competition, and price drops on certain routes. A zero-fare bus service, the FreeBee (Operated by First South Yorkshire), operated a circular route around the city centre from the Sheffield Interchange. The FreeBee buses stopped in 2014 and is due to save £8 million.|$|E

25|$|The famous 1860s showdog Huddersfield Ben {{came from}} Paisley Terrier {{stock in the}} 1860s, and is {{considered}} by all authorities to be the founding sire of the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier</b> breed, although the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier</b> was not recognised as a separate breed until 1898. When the Paisley Terrier went into decline, the smaller and more popular Yorkshire variety superseded it. Through the Yorkshire, the Paisley Terrier is also the ancestor of several other modern breeds, notably the Australian Silky Terrier and the Biewer Terrier.|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier's</b> tail is docked to {{a medium}} length. [...] Opposition to this {{practice}} began {{very early in}} the history of the breed; Hugh Dalziel, writing about <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terriers</b> in 1878, declared that [...] "There is no reason for mutilating pet dogs, and perfect ears and tails should be bred, not clipped into shape with scissors." [...] American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel club still require the Yorkie’s tail be docked in order to compete at its events. The majority of the rest of the world has adopted a [...] "no docking/no cropping" [...] rule. Often, a <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier's</b> dewclaws, if any, are removed in the first few days of life, another controversial practice.|$|R
5000|$|Adult <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terriers</b> {{that have}} other coat colours than the above, or that have woolly or extra fine coats, are still <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terriers.</b> The only {{difference}} is that atypical <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terriers</b> should not intentionally be bred. In addition, care may be more difficult for [...] "woolly" [...] or [...] "cottony" [...] textured coats, or coats that are overly fine. One of the reasons given for not breeding [...] "off-coloured" [...] Yorkies is that the colour could be a potential indicator of a genetic defect that may affect the dog's health, a careful health screening can clarify if any health risks exist. Coats may vary in colour. For example, a grown Yorkie may have a silver/blue with light brown while another might have a black and creamy colour.|$|R

25|$|The Paisley Terrier was a {{breed of}} terrier type dog {{that is now}} extinct.

Stagecoach Yorkshire, Stagecoach in Chesterfield, Stagecoach in Mansfield, Veolia Transport (Operating for Travel South Yorkshire), Sheffield Community Transport, Hulleys of Baslow, Powell's Co, K Doyle also operating bus routes in the city.

25|$|Syringomyelia* is a {{condition}} where a fluid filled sac develops in the spinal cord. The most important cause in dogs is by a Chiari I malformation, which is when an underdeveloped occipital bone interferes with spinal fluid circulation and results in fluid accumulation in the cervical spinal cord. This is a congenital disease most commonly found in small breeds such as the Brussels Griffon and the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Other breeds known to be affected include the Bichon Frisé, Boston terrier, bull terrier, Chihuahua, French bulldog, Havanese, King Charles spaniel (the English toy spaniel), Maltese, miniature dachshunds, miniature and toy poodles, Papillon, Pomeranian, Pugs, Shih Tzu, Staffordshire bull terrier, and the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>terrier.</b> Signs may include ataxia, weakness, and neck pain.|$|E

500|$|The beagle has an even {{temper and}} gentle disposition. Described in several breed {{standards}} as [...] "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this {{depends on the}} individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier,</b> Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Number 1" [...] was {{directed}} by Dawn Shadforth and filmed in London, England in 2005. The video {{is set in a}} plastic surgery clinic where the staff and the patients, except Alison Goldfrapp, have a dog's head and a human body. The video's theme is a reference to the song's lyrics in which Goldfrapp sings [...] "I'm like a dog to get you". The video depicts the story of a white poodle who is being operated on by Great Dane and <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier</b> surgeons (the receptionist and attendant nurses are saluki). Scenes of Alison Goldfrapp acting like a dog and dancing with the clinic's staff are intercut throughout the video.|$|E
500|$|An {{inherited}} genetic {{problem that}} exists in the breed is globoid cell leukodystrophy. It is not breed-specific, and can appear in Cairn Terriers and other breeds including Beagles and Pomeranians. It is a neurological disease where the dog lacks an enzyme called galactosylceramidase. The symptoms are noticeable as the puppy develops, and can be identified by the age of 30 weeks. Affected dogs have tremors, muscle weakness, and trouble walking. Symptoms slowly increase until limb paralysis begins to occur. Due to it being a hereditary condition, owners should avoid breeding affected animals to eliminate it from the breed. Another genetic condition that affects the breed is [...] "white dog shaker syndrome". As this condition is most commonly found in Westies and Maltese, the condition was originally thought to be connected to the genes for white coats, but the same condition has since been found in other nonwhite breeds including the <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terrier</b> and the Dachshund. The condition typically develops over one to three days, resulting in tremors of the head and limbs, ataxia, and hypermetria. Affected males and females can be affected for different lengths of time, with symptoms in females lasting between four and six weeks, while males can be affected the rest of their lives.|$|E

50|$|In <b>Yorkshire</b> <b>Terriers</b> {{there can}} be severe {{mononuclear}} inflammation of the brainstem and periventricular cerebral white matter.
