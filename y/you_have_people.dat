The bottom line is we're just trying to {{give you a sense of}} what it was like to hang out around this person. That's really it. And the scenes were chosen strictly on the basis of, 'Yeah, what does that tell us about his character?'".|$|E
500|$|Air Force {{running back}} Leotis Palmer {{was having the}} best season of his career heading into the San Francisco Bowl. During the regular season, he {{accumulated}} 537rushing yards, four rushing touchdowns and 113passing yards for two touchdowns. Palmer and the Falcons had already clinched the season's rushing title, cementing their status as the No.1 rushing team in the country after West Virginia—the second-place team—failed to gain sufficient yardage in its final game to pass the Falcons. Despite finishing with the top-ranked rushing offense, none of Air Force's offensive linemen received postseason honors. [...] "It should give our players a lot of incentive for next year. Hopefully, if we repeat next year, maybe we'll get two or three on there. You certainly don't accumulate the number of yards we do unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> up front doing their job," [...] DeBerry said at the time.|$|E

[...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. I think about it all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “The Occasional-Oasis Supply Association,” {{said the}} Baroness; “it exists to meet cases exactly like yours, cases of backyards {{that are of}} no {{practical}} use for gardening purposes, but are required to blossom into decorative scenic backgrounds at stated intervals, when a luncheon or dinner-party is contemplated. Supposing, for instance, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> coming to lunch at one-thirty; you just ring up the Association at about ten o’clock the same morning, and say ‘lunch garden’. That is all the trouble you have to take. By twelve forty-five your yard is carpeted with a strip of velvety turf, with a hedge of lilac or red may, or whatever {{happens to be in}} season, as a background, one or two cherry trees in blossom, and clumps of heavily-flowered rhododendrons filling in the odd corners; in the foreground you have a blaze of carnations or Shirley poppies, or tiger lilies in full bloom. As soon as the lunch is over and your guests have departed the garden departs also, and all the cats in Christendom can sit in council in your yard without causing you a moment’s anxiety. If you have a bishop or an antiquary or something of that sort coming to lunch you just mention the fact when you are ordering the garden, and you get an old-world pleasaunce, with clipped yew hedges and a sun-dial and hollyhocks, and perhaps a mulberry tree, and borders of sweet-williams and Canterbury bells, and an old-fashioned beehive or two tucked away in a corner. Those are the ordinary lines of supply that the Oasis Association undertakes, but by paying a few guineas a year extra you are entitled to its emergency E.O.N. service.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The word [...] "facts" [...] is, in some ways, crucial. I {{have spoken}} with Jesuits and Plymouth Brethren, mathematicians and poets, dogmatic {{republicans}} and dear old gentlemen in bird's- eye neckcloths; and each understood the word [...] "facts" [...] in an occult sense of his own. Try as I might, I could get no nearer the principle of their division. What was essential to them, seemed to me trivial or untrue. We could come to no compromise as to what was, or what was not, important {{in the life of}} man. Turn as we pleased, we all stood back to back in a big ring, and saw another quarter of the heavens, with different mountain-tops along the sky-line and different constellations overhead. We had each of us some whimsy in the brain, which we believed more than anything else, and which discoloured all experience to its own shade. How would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> agree, when one is deaf and the other blind? Now this is where there should be community between man and wife. [...] They should be agreed on their catchword in [...] "FACTS OF RELIGION," [...] or [...] "FACTS OF SCIENCE," [...] or [...] "SOCIETY, MY DEAR"; for without such an agreement all intercourse is a painful strain upon the mind. [...] "About as much religion as my William likes," [...] in short, that is what is necessary to make a happy couple of any William and his spouse. For there are differences which no habit nor affection can reconcile, and the Bohemian must not intermarry with the Pharisee. Imagine Consuelo as Mrs. Samuel Budget, the wife of the successful merchant! The best of men and the best of women may sometimes live together all their lives, and, for want of some consent on fundamental questions, hold each other lost spirits to the end.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Sir,--I had a {{long letter}} leatly from Mr. Cromwell [Bruce] contining in chief tow Artickles by way of charge; the first {{complaining}} of my long silence--t'other for not keeping a due and regular correspondence [...] .What I beg you assure my mistress of, is, that had there been any new mode worth her notice invented since I gave her one exact patron of the last [the Elibank plot], I would not have neglected to have sent her due patrons. Please aquent my mistress that of leate they have comenced some new fashions in the head dresses, very little varying from the former one, yet they estime it is a masterpiece in its kind, for my part, I have but a slight idea of it, though they bost {{the people of the}} first rank of our country will use it. I would have wrot of this sooner, but my illness occasiond my not knowing anything of the matter till very leatly, and I was so very ill, that it was impossible for me to write, as you may see by Mr. Cromwell's letter. You may remember, dr. Papa, that I was always very desirous that my love intrigues should be secret from all mortalls but those agreed upon, and that my letters might be perus'd by non, but by my mistress and you, now if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>people</b> how [who] were, and a few that still are, at the helme, that don't act honourably, I can't be possitive, neither will I mention them at this distance, beeing myself a little credulous, as I have but one under architect's word for it. Were I to credit some of the managers, some of the fundation stones are pleacd upon a very sandy ground, but our little thin friend, the Embassador [Earl Marischal?], gives it little or no credit, it may be but a puff in hopes to create suspicion, and make one of each other mistrustfull. In consequence of all this the managers have derected our Northern friends [Lochgarry and the clans] to keep their posts. I can answer for such as regards me, and I beg least the Company [Jacobites] make banckrout that you proteck my parte of them. I am now pretty well recover'd of my leate illness, tho' I have been very much afraid of a relapse, having catch'd a violent cold at the Masquerad ball of Lundi Gras, beeing over perswaded to accompany our worthy friend Mr. Murray to that diversion, where I was greatly astonish'd to find Mr. STRANGE [Prince Charles] whom I imagin'd to be all this time in Germanie, for I took it for granted that he went for Berlin when I meet him at Furnes. I know not how long his stay was at Paris, for I was A LITTLE PICKT THAT HE DID NOT INQUIRE AFTER ME DURING MY ILLNESS. He left this early Tuesday morning, and our friend Mr. Murray gave him the convoie for some days, and yesterday he returnd to town. I am to dine with him this day, and you may be sure, we will not forget to drink a bumper to our British friends and your health and prosperity in particular.|$|E

5000|$|Largely about sex, {{politics}} and self-censorship, the show humanizes and dignifies the roles portrayed while remaining true to the roles.
