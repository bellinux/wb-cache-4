Look here, landlord, get an empty bottle and put half the whisky in, and then fill them both up with water. Cut that loaf of bread in halves; in that way we can get it in our pockets. That's right; now do the same with the cheese. You and I may not be together, Conway, so it's just as well to divide the commissariat; {{to say nothing of the}} convenience of carriage.

40|$|Jack {{was sitting}} at his kitchen table, eating a bowl of Cheerio’s, and reading {{the latest issue of}} [1] Science News when Diane came down for breakfast. Pouring herself a cup of coffee Diane asked “What’s so {{interesting}} that I don’t even get a “good morning ”?” “It’s this Science News article about M&M’s. ” Jack replied, “These guys at Princeton, Cornell, and North Carolina showed how M&M’s packed randomly actually pack together as well as ordered spheres. ” “M&M’s! ” exclaimed Diane., “Sounds like a good candidate for a Golden Fleece award. I bet these guy’s were using taxpayer money to buy those M&M’s! Boy, <b>that’s</b> <b>right</b> up there with that tequila fish study!” “Hold on a minute Diane. It also says here that this study has implications for materials science and other important things. ” “I’ll bet. ” said Diane. “Well anyway ” muttered Jack, “I think it’s kind of neat. Actually, look at this, it says here that they not only used real M&M’s, but also did computer simulations of M&M packing. ” “Huh, I wonder how they did that. ” said Diane, “I remember reading that Shrek used a lot of computer graphics and a lot of math. I wonder if that’s related. ” “Could be. ” said Jack, “In my Calc class we’ve been drawing these neat pictures with this thing called Maple. I’ll bet I could use that to draw an M&M. ” “Yea, that’s neat. ” replied Diane, “But, I bet they had to do more than that. I mean, how did they get the size right? How would you make your picture the same as a real M&M?” “Good question. They give some other references here [2, 3], I bet I could use the information in these articles to make my picture accurate. ” “Maybe. ” said Diane, “But I think you’d still need to measure a real M&M. But, if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> it <b>right,</b> <b>that</b> would be cool! You could figure out the volume of an M&M and then use that info to figure out how many M&M’s this jar could hold. ” “Hey, then we could win one of those bean-guessing contests! ” said Jack. “There’s a question for you, I wonder if jelly-beans pack better?” “Or Reese’s Pieces. ” said Diane. “Aren’t they the same shape as M&M’s? ” asked Jack. “Oh yeah. ” replied Diane. “Here’s another crazy idea. In my Calc class we looked at the curve you get when you intersect a cylinder and a sphere. It looked like the stitches on a baseball. I wonder what you’d get if you intersected an M&M with a cylinder?...|$|R
