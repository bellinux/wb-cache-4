500|$|In 2009, {{eighteen}} years after Bart's House of Weirdness [...] was released, 1UP.com editor Bob Mackey reviewed {{the game in}} 1UP's official Retro Gaming Blog. He praised the game for its graphics, but was critical of the gameplay. Mackey wrote that [...] "the graphics are far more impressive than any other Simpsons title at the time, outside of the arcade brawler. In fact, the graphics alone were responsible for my childlike [...] excitement over House of Weirdness; [...] they're pretty lush — even if they're not entirely faithful to the show. Bart's PC translation might be just a little off-model, but it's a gigantic leap over his duck-like visage seen on the NES." [...] He added, however, that the game [...] "is completely unintuitive, <b>your</b> <b>goals</b> aren't made clear, it's never certain if you're doing the right thing, and you're often locked into screens with no apparent way out but death." [...] Mackey also criticized the levels' structure that [...] "seems more generated than anything" [...] {{and the fact that}} the [...] "big, beautiful" [...] sprites sometimes do not move well.|$|E

[...] Author Grant McCracken stated, [...] "The term 'reinvention' is now often {{used to talk about}} the careers of American celebrities. But in Cher's case, it is particularly apt [...] is inclined to lock on to each new fashion wave [...] is swept violently down the diffusion stream and out of fashion. Only substantial re-creation permits her to return to stardom." [...] Her [...] "integrity" [...] and [...] "perseverance" [...] are highlighted in the Reaching <b>Your</b> <b>Goals</b> book series of illustrated inspirational stories for children, in which her life is detailed emphasizing the importance of self-actualization: [...] "For years, Cher worked hard to become a successful singer. Then she worked hard to become an actress. Even when she needed money, she turned down movie roles that weren't right for her. Her goal has always been to be a good actress, not just a rich and famous one." ...|$|E

To Homer, and to the Greeks in general, not the island, {{but the idea of}} Ithaca is important. Life is also a journey, and everyone has to face difficulties like Odysseus, when he returned from Troy. When you reach Ithaca, you have gained so much experience from the voyage, that it is not very important if you reached <b>your</b> <b>goals</b> (e.g. Odysseus returned all alone).
