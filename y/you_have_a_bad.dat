60|$|Aloysius. You cannot {{know much}} of him if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> opinion of him. He {{will be made}} a saint some day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Frank! Frank! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{habit of}} letting your tongue {{run away with}} you. Don't repeat that stupid {{nickname}} when you talk of my good friend, Richard Wardour." ...|$|E
6000|$|John {{drew his}} hand across his {{forehead}} slowly. [...] "Ethie darling," [...] he said, [...] "you are wandering, I'm afraid. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> fever. I don't know what you mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind that}} now, Tom," [...] {{answered}} Dick, taking {{him by the}} hand. [...] "How do <b>you</b> feel? <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> tumble, if you'll remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Tom, you've been--very sick," [...] {{answered}} Dick, slowly. [...] "How do {{you feel}} now? <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> tumble, and we were afraid <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been killed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> enough name among women," [...] the {{merchant}} said, with something approaching to a sneer. [...] "I have been grieved {{times out of}} number by your looseness in that respect. I should <b>have</b> thought that <b>you</b> might <b>have</b> made your experience of some use now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if he {{is coming}} I reckon you will be all right, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> case; and from what the roundsman told me the {{fighting}} didn't amount to much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There now! {{you have}} got it out of me; and I wish I had bit my tongue out first. I {{sometimes}} think--that I mayn't sin!--that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> angel in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The harm of it is, {{that her}} father would hate me if he found I {{suffered}} her to enter your house; and I am convinced <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> design in encouraging her to do so,' I replied.|$|E
60|$|MISS P.--Well, no; I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> temper, Mr. Milliken, a--Horace.|$|R
60|$|Paul Ruttledge. I'm afraid <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> {{opinion of}} me, Charlie. Well, maybe I earned it.|$|R
5000|$|Of his {{technical}} methods, Tichy has said, [...] "First of all, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> camera", and, [...] "If {{you want}} to be famous, you must do something more badly than anybody in the entire world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you can get}} rid of that objection," [...] she replied, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> ground. Croquet needs hazards just as much as golf does. The finest games I {{have ever}} seen were played on a bad ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Northmour," [...] I said, [...] "we {{all know}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper, and I am {{the last man}} to be irritated by words. For all that, I propose that you speak lower, for I am {{convinced}} {{that we are not}} alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{did not do}} well, O King of the Rain, last night," [...] he said, {{after an}} {{interchange}} of civilities, as becomes great gods. [...] "You have put out even the sacred flame on the holy hearth of the King of Fire. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> heart. Why do you use us so?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hope you}} don't dislike reading bad style like this {{as much as}} I do writing it: it hurts me when neither words nor clauses fall into their places, much as it would hurt you to sing when <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> cold and your voice deceived you and missed every other note. I do feel so {{inclined}} to break the pen and write no more; and here Ã propos begins my back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Heard Flockley, Koswell and Larkspur talking together. Koswell said he <b>had</b> fixed <b>you,</b> {{and that}} <b>you</b> were <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> half hour with the president." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a droll idee! Now, we think, here, that a lease is <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing; and {{the less}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> of <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing, the better." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{ten minutes}} Jo came running downstairs {{with a very}} red face and the general {{appearance}} {{of a person who}} had just passed through a trying ordeal of some sort. When she saw the young gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a nod. But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The drift is {{perfectly}} safe, Captain Niel. I crossed it myself {{about two hours}} ago. I know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> opinion of me, but I suppose you {{do not think that}} I would guide you to an unsafe drift?" [...] Then with another bow he rode on to speak to the two Boers, saying, as he went, [...] "Will you tell the Kafir to put the horses in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, he won't mind,' said Lady Windermere, 'that {{is what he}} is here for. All my lions, Lord Arthur, are {{performing}} lions, and jump through hoops whenever I ask them. But I must warn you beforehand that I shall tell Sybil everything. She is coming to lunch with me to-morrow, to talk about bonnets, and if Mr. Podgers finds out that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper, or a tendency to gout, or a wife living in Bayswater, I shall certainly let her know all about it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{he thinks}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> temper," [...] {{continued}} his wife. [...] "He thinks, perhaps, it's indigestion, caused by eating cheese for supper always." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-bye, then, George," [...] said Sir Lionel. [...] "I suppose I {{shall see}} you before I leave town. I must say, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> affair of this will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{useless to}} conceal it from me!" [...] he burst out, turning toward Penrose. [...] "I believe I am {{in some way}} answerable--though you all deny it--for the French boy's death. Why not? His voice is still in my ears, and the stain of his brother's blood is on me. I am under a spell! Do {{you believe in the}} witches--the merciless old women who made wax images of the people who injured them, and stuck pins in their mock likenesses, to {{register}} the slow wasting away of their victims day after day? People disbelieve it in these times, but it has never been disproved." [...] He stopped, looked at Penrose, and suddenly changed his tone. [...] "Arthur! what is the matter with <b>you?</b> <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night? Has anything happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my son; let {{me speak}} on to the end, {{and then you can}} say what you please. In me you have had a bad example on one side, and now, in poor Saul, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> example on the other side. Can you fancy no life between the two, which would fit your {{physical}} nature, which is larger than his, and your mental wants, which are higher than mine? Yes, they are, Harry. It is my duty to say this, but it would be unseemly that there should be any controversy between us on the subject." ...|$|E
6000|$|Felix {{advanced}} {{near the}} line, {{holding his hand}} up before him to command silence. As he did so, he was absolutely appalled himself at the perfect storm of execration and abuse which his appearance excited. The foremost natives, brandishing their clubs and stone-tipped spears, or shaking their fists by the line, poured forth upon his devoted head at once all the most frightful curses of the Polynesian vocabulary. [...] "Oh, evil god," [...] they cried aloud with angry faces, [...] "oh, wicked spirit! <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> heart. See what a wrong you have purposely done us. If your heart were not bad, would you treat us like this? If you are indeed a god, come out across the line, and let us try issues together. Don't skulk like a coward in your hut and within your taboo, but come out and fight us. We are not afraid, who are only men. Why {{are you afraid of}} us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{this reminds}} me <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> habit {{which is to be}} comminated in my theory of letters. Same page, two lines lower: [...] "But the vulture's track" [...] is surely as fine to the ear as [...] "But vulture's track," [...] and this latter version has a dreadful baldness. The reader goes on with a sense of impoverishment, of {{unnecessary}} sacrifice; he has been robbed by footpads, and goes scouting for his lost article! Again, in the second Epode, these fine verses would surely sound much finer if they began, [...] "As a hardy climber who has set his heart," [...] than with the jejune [...] "As hardy climber." [...] I do not know why you permit yourself this licence with grammar; you show, in so many pages, that you are superior to the paltry sense of rhythm which usually dictates it--as though some poetaster had been suffered to correct the poet's text. By the way, I confess to a heartfelt weakness for Auriculas.--Believe me the very grateful and characteristic pick-thank, but still sincere and affectionate, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have sat}} up too long," [...] he said, {{as he felt}} the clasp of her cold fingers. [...] "I am afraid <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night--I'm afraid <b>you</b> will not sleep." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it is so, Daddy. Of course it's so, and {{you know}} it. If I'm away they'll just pity <b>you</b> for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> daughter. And quite right too. I am <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, you do, my dear, and anyhow as he {{has been}} sent for he must come and see you; you need not trouble about going up to The Hold, it was three of the men there that found you and brought you down; I will send a note by them to Miss Carne telling her <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> fall, and that we will keep you here until to-morrow morning. I am sure you will not be fit to walk up that hill again to-day. Anyhow we will wait until the doctor comes and hear what he says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now for my message, {{which come}} to me from all these speerits. I [...] hear you have done very well in what they call examinations, and [...] have before you a shining future. But {{do not think that}} you will [...] be happy, my Godfrey, for you will not get that girl you want for [...] a long, long while, and then only for the {{shortest}} of time, just [...] enough to kiss and say, 'Oh! my pretty, how nice you are!' And [...] then au revoir to the world of speerits. Meanwhile, being a [...] little fool, you will go empty and hungry, since you are not one [...] of those who hate the woman, which, after all, is the best thing [...] in life for the man while he is young, like, so the spirits tell [...] me, does your dear papa. And oh! how plenty this woman fruit hang [...] on every tree, so why not pluck and eat before the time come, when [...] you cannot, because if you still have appetite those nice plums [...] turn your stomach? So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time before you, my Godfrey, [...] waiting for the big fat plum far away which you cannot see or [...] touch and much less taste, while the other nice plums fall into [...] different hands, or wither--wither, waiting to be eaten.|$|E
50|$|In Game 4, Albatross Overload, {{your score}} {{is the average}} of three flights. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> flight you can press 'q' to quit and start over, but your score will not be {{submitted}} to the High Score chart on the Yetisports web site.|$|E
5000|$|Glenn McGrath, a {{recently}} retired Australian cricketer who played alongside most of Pontings men, commented upon {{the decision to}} stand down Steve Bucknor by saying: I think it is sad and disappointing that {{it gets to the}} stage where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> game and they are calling for your head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are polite, aren't you? It's funny; I can't {{tell whether}} I'm {{glad to see}} <b>you.</b> I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> time, <b>you</b> know; and Mrs. Fiorsen was an angel. Why do you {{come to see me}} now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Any {{other human}} being but you," [...] she said, [...] "would find me disagreeable and rude--and {{would be quite}} right, too. I haven't asked after your health. You look paler than usual. <b>Have</b> <b>you,</b> too, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't say <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> job of it, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Grantly. [...] "But it's past eight, and {{you must}} be terribly in want of your dinner. Had you not better go up and dress?" ...|$|R
