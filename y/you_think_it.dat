Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E

The four initially {{wanted to make a}} story about a rock band, but decided that making programmes about bands have been [...] "done to death". To write the series, Cole was influenced by the works of David Lynch and the Coen brothers as inspiration to the kind of storytelling that is [...] "never quite what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is going to be".|$|E

Miyamoto later stated that [...] "it's what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is", alluding to the Tanooki Suit, a power-up originally from Super Mario Bros. 3. While no exact release date was announced, Miyamoto stated that he hoped to release the game during 2011. The game was showcased at Nintendo's press conference at E3 2011, where a 2011 release date was confirmed, along with the appearance of the Tanooki Suit. While the power-up allows Mario to float down gently, unlike Super Mario Bros. 3 he cannot fly.|$|E
500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was the first thing he did after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts. Writer Jeff Vlaming combined two additional concepts that he had developed; the first involved a lottery {{in a small town}} and the other concerned corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. When the initial script for [...] "Hell Money" [...] was submitted, Carter merged the three stories into one. Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> must be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode {{would be one of the}} rare entries where Scully's version of the events would be vindicated, but in the end Mulder, once again, put everything together.|$|E

500|$|According to Billboard, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is [...] "brimming {{with sexual}} innuendo". In the song, [...] "Madonna yearns {{for a man}} to open her lock with his key. And yes, that means exactly what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> does." [...] The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct {{position}} expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in the line [...] "If you gave me half a chance you'd see; My desire burning inside of me." [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute.

500|$|The {{match was}} the most {{discussed}} sports game ever on Twitter with over 35.6 million tweets, surpassing Super Bowl XLVIII, with 24.9million tweets during the game. At first incentive hashtags such as [...] "#PrayForBrazil" [...] were common, but once Germany built a 50 lead Brazilian users instead lent their frustration into self-deprecatory humor, comparing Germany's goals with the Volkswagen Gol car and stating the Brazilian team looked like [...] "11 Freds". Other Twitter users compared Germany's dominating performance to their military efforts during World War II and The Holocaust, for example, dubbing it the [...] "Goalocaust". Bung Moktar Radin, a member of parliament of Malaysia, came under heavy criticism from the Malaysian public and the German ambassador, Holger Michael, for posting such a comment. The President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, stated on Twitter following the match that [...] "like all Brazilians, I am deeply saddened by our loss". The Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yigal Palmor, mentioned the match when countering Brazil's claim that his country was using disproportionate force in the Gaza conflict, saying [...] "This is not football. In football, when a game ends in a draw, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is proportional, but when it finishes 7–1 it's disproportionate".|$|E
500|$|With the {{new season}} of the J.League commencing in March 1995, Wenger set about {{assembling}} his squad and backroom staff. He hired former Valenciennes manager Boro Primorac, whom he had befriended during the match-fixing scandal, as his assistant. Alexandre Torres joined Nagoya after Wenger identified the defender by watching Brazilian football on the television, and the manager brought in Franck Durix and his former player Passi. Nagoya finished bottom of the J.League the season before Wenger's arrival, and continued their poor form into the following campaign, losing several matches in a row. In response to the situation, Wenger altered his managerial style, becoming less amicable with his players and openly questioning their desire. To boost morale, he took his squad to Versailles for their mid-season break, where they went through a rigorous, but creative, training regime. Players were expected to make decisions for themselves on the pitch, instead of relying on the manager; Wenger {{was reported to have}} shouted to his players [...] "Don't look at me to ask me {{what to do with the}} ball!" [...] and [...] "Decide for yourself! Why don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> out?" [...] One player who greatly benefited from Wenger's guidance was Dragan Stojković, a midfielder whose disciplinary record improved considerably.|$|E

500|$|Tor Cardona of the {{magazine}} Grazia Daily praised the fact the perfume was announced a week after Beyoncé's fifth album, noting she was set for a [...] "world domination" [...] in 2014. Focusing on the scent, Cardona advised female readers to buy it {{and went on to}} state [...] "With hints of orchid, golden apricot and jasmine- we reckon this might just be 2014's hottest scent." [...] BET editor Dorkys Ramos described the scent as a mixture of [...] "sexy, floral" [...] notes. The Daily Telegraphs Katy Young called the gold symphony orchid used in the scent [...] "the queen of orchids". She also said that notes of cashmere musk and vetiver [...] "give the whole blend a grounding element" [...] before concluding [...] "the notes are not wrong". Charlie Gowans Eglinton of Elle, noted that the perfume promised to be [...] "almost as intoxicating as Bey herself" [...] with a [...] "sexy scent" [...] of musk according to reports she had read.

Online included Rise, calling it [...] "exactly what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> would be: vivacious, strong and bold" [...] and concluding [...] "it is certainly not a dainty spring scent". Cinya Burton of the same publication noted the fragrance was different than other floral perfumes during the season, deeming it [...] "plain fierce".|$|E
500|$|On March 17, 2012, Scott {{said that}} the film leaves many {{questions}} unanswered and that these could be answered in a sequel. He said, [...] "If we're lucky, there'll be a second part. It does leave you with some nice open questions." [...] Asked whether a sequel would be a direct prequel to Alien, Lindelof said: [...] "If we're fortunate enough to do a sequel... it will tangentialize even further away from the original Alien." [...] In June 2012, Lindelof said that while plot elements were deliberately left unresolved {{so that they could}} be answered in a sequel, he and Scott had thoroughly discussed what should be resolved so that Prometheus could stand alone, as a sequel was not guaranteed. Scott said that a sequel would follow Shaw to her next destination, [...] "because if it is paradise, paradise cannot be what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is. Paradise has a connotation of being extremely sinister and ominous." [...] Lindelof cast doubt on his participation, and said, [...] "if [...] wants me to be involved in something, that would be hard to say no to. At the same time, I do feel like [...] might benefit from a fresh voice or a fresh take or a fresh thought." [...] Scott said that an additional film would be required {{to bridge the gap between}} the Prometheus sequel and Alien. Scott later stated it would take an additional two sequels to bridge the gap to Alien.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reed {{followed}} Transformer {{with the}} darker Berlin. Berlin {{is a concept}} album about two junkies in love in the city.

Reed's late-1973 European tour, featuring dual lead guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, mixed his Berlin material with older numbers. Response to Berlin {{at the time of}} its release was decidedly negative, with Rolling Stone pronouncing it [...] "a disaster".
