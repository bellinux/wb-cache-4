5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> produce a blue tint. Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|NGC 2613 is {{a spiral}} galaxy of {{magnitude}} 10.5 which appears spindle-shaped {{as it is}} almost edge-on to observers on Earth. Henize 2-10 is a dwarf galaxy which lies some 30 million light-years away. It is notable for having a black hole around a million solar masses at its centre. Known as a starburst galaxy due to very high rates of star formation, it has a bluish colour due to the huge numbers of <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> within it.|$|E

5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was its apparent inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around <b>young</b> <b>stars.</b> The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the north}} of the {{constellation}} is the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, a dark molecular cloud with many embedded reflection nebulae, including NGC 6729, NGC 6726–7, and IC 4812. A star-forming region of around , it contains Herbig–Haro objects (protostars) and some very <b>young</b> <b>stars.</b> About 430 light years (130 parsecs) away, {{it is one of the}} closest star-forming regions to the Solar System. The related NGC 6726 and 6727, along with unrelated NGC 6729, were first recorded by Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt in 1865. The Coronet cluster, about 554 light years (170 parsecs) away at the edge of the Gould Belt, is also used in studying star and protoplanetary disk formation.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of our vision. The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E
5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less than a billion years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and <b>young</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mike Brown and {{his team}} favored the {{hypothesis}} that Sedna was lifted into its current orbit by a star from the Sun's birth cluster, arguing that Sedna's aphelion of about 1,000AU, which is relatively close compared to those of long-period comets, is not distant enough {{to be affected by}} passing stars at their current distances from the Sun. They propose that Sedna's orbit is best explained by the Sun having formed in an open cluster of several stars that gradually disassociated over time. That hypothesis has also been advanced by both Alessandro Morbidelli and Scott Jay Kenyon. Computer simulations by Julio A. Fernandez and Adrian Brunini suggest that multiple close passes by <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> in such a cluster would pull many objects into Sedna-like orbits. A study by Morbidelli and Levison suggested that the most likely explanation for Sedna's orbit was that it had been perturbed by a close (approximately 800AU) pass by another star in the first 100 million years or so of the Solar System's existence.|$|E
5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is actually in the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5|$|TY Pyxidis is an {{eclipsing binary}} star whose {{apparent}} magnitude ranges from 6.85 to 7.5 over 3.2 days. The two components are both of spectral type G5IV with a diameter 2.2 times, and mass 1.2 {{times that of the}} Sun, and revolve around each other every 3.2 days. The system is classified as a RS Canum Venaticorum variable, a binary system with prominent starspot activity, and lies 184 ± 5 light-years away. The system emits X-rays, and analysing the emission curve over time led researchers to conclude that there was a loop of material arcing between the two stars. RZ Pyxidis is another eclipsing binary system, made up of two <b>young</b> <b>stars</b> less than 200,000 years old. Both are hot blue-white stars of spectral type B7V and are around 2.5 {{times the size of the}} Sun. One is around five times as luminous as the Sun and the other around four times as luminous. The system is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable, the apparent magnitude varying from 8.83 to 9.72 over 0.66 days. XX Pyxidis is one of the more-studied members of a class of stars known as Delta Scuti variables—short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as standard candles and as subjects to study astroseismology. Astronomers made more sense of its pulsations when it became clear that it is also a binary star system. The main star is a white main sequence star of spectral type A4V that is around 1.85 ± 0.05 times as massive as the Sun. Its companion is most likely a red dwarf of spectral type M3V, around 0.3 times as massive as the Sun. The two are very close—possibly only 3 times the diameter of the Sun between them—and orbit each other every 1.15 days. The brighter star is deformed into an egg shape.|$|E
