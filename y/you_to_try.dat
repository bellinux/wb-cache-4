500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, {{but it was just}} an accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that then, we got everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and find a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E
2500|$|Marshall {{is known}} for his ability to break and dodge tackles. He led all NFL wide {{receivers}} in yards after first contact for the 2007 NFL season. Regarding Marshall's breakaway ability, cornerback Brandon Flowers said, [...] "Brandon Marshall is a defensive lineman playing wide receiver. He wants to inflict punishment on you. He wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to tackle him so he can shove you off of him and get more yards." [...] Cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha said Marshall is [...] "the toughest guy to bring down, one-on-one." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Ford {{graduated}} from Santa Monica High School, {{he began working}} in small theatre groups. While in high school, he took odd jobs, including working for Will Rogers, who taught him horsemanship. Ford later commented {{that his father had}} no objection to his growing interest in acting, but told him, [...] "It's all right for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to act, if you learn something else first. Be able to take a car apart and put it together. Be able to build a house, every bit of it. Then you'll always have something." [...] Ford heeded the advice and during the 1950s, when he was one of Hollywood's most popular actors, he regularly worked on plumbing, wiring, and air conditioning at home. At times, he worked as a roofer and installer of plate-glass windows.|$|E

2500|$|Oppewall {{said of her}} career, [...] "What I do for {{a living}} is not {{dissimilar}} from what an actor does. I have a different set of tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E
