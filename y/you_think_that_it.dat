2500|$|.....He told me 25 {{years ago}} that he would feel real trapped if he didn't know that he could commit suicide at any moment. I don't know if that is brave or stupid or what, but it was inevitable. I think that {{the truth of what}} rings through all his writing is that he meant what he said. If that is {{entertainment}} to you, well, that's OK. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> enlightened you, well, that's even better. If you wonder if he's gone to Heaven or Hell, rest assured he will check out them both, find out which one Richard Milhous Nixon went to— and go there. He could never stand being bored. But there must be Football too— and Peacocks..." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Countess," [...] he answered, [...] "it is {{very strange}} {{to me that you}} should so long have been ignorant of the truth. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for the sake of Theos I have planned for the {{overthrow}} of Ughtred of Tyrnaus? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for your brother's sake that I have smoothed his way to the throne? No! My reward has always been clear before me. I have looked for it always at your hands." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{right for}} those who have money to give {{expensive}} presents, supposing always, as you say, they are given from real affection?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> {{too big and}} heavy?" [...] cried Mrs Nobbs, with a shrieking giggle and {{clapping}} of her hands, as she ran back to have a distant view of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are incomprehensible," [...] she declared. [...] "Are you, by any chance, {{playing a}} part with me? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is worth while?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That reminds me," [...] said Dorothy, [...] "of {{the golden}} key I {{picked up on}} the shore. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would fit this key-hole, Billina?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{wonder at}} seeing me so early," [...] she murmured. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is worth while? Nothing ever seems so sweet as this first morning breeze." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{describes}} an unhappy woman, using characteristically surreal images such as [...] "Rain falls like Elvis tears" [...] and [...] "Just like a harpsichordist she moves". The apparently meaningless title {{appears in the}} song's chorus: [...] "Hobart paving, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>it's</b> time, / On this platform with the drizzle in my eyes?" [...] The title may derive from a construction firm called Hobart Paving Company Limited [...] {{in the town of}} Croydon, where two of the band members grew up.|$|R
60|$|At {{first sight}} <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> did not. At first sight you would fancy <b>that</b> <b>it</b> spoke of God {{in quite a}} {{different}} tone from the second lesson.|$|R
6000|$|... "She said {{also that}} I {{was to tell}} you, in case <b>you</b> should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has been befouled by her wearing of <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> she has had it {{carefully}} cleaned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would do," [...] says I. [...] "I own it {{troubles}} me. I {{would like}} it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would pain me, you are mistaken. It pains me {{more that}} you should think that I could not bear it. He was welcome to his wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What! {{when that}} man gets I don't {{know how many}} guineas from mamma every time he comes, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is for his {{interest}} that I should get well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} thee, my good Beatriz; {{but we should}} bethink us both of our last shrivings, and of the ghostly counsel that we then received. Such nattering {{discourse}} seemeth light, when we remember our manifold transgressions, and our many occasions for forgiveness. As for this marriage, I would have <b>thee</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has been contracted on my part, with the considerations and motives of a princess, and not through any light indulgence of my fancies. Thou knowest that I have never beheld Don Fernando, and that he hath never even looked upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't really mean, Easton," [...] Skinner said, [...] "that <b>you</b> seriously <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{might be}} done; that is, that the betting {{is not more}} than ten to one against it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> sir, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{should be}} so held, and so applied in actual life? For instance, should I honor my father, if I knew {{him to be a}} seducer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am a man," [...] he said, [...] "and {{things are}} known to me which a woman would {{scarcely}} discover. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is quite fair to send Lady Redford out motoring with Mrs. Mannering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, sir," [...] {{continued}} Mr Kennedy, [...] "don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would have}} been a polite piece of attention on your part to have asked my permission before you addressed my daughter on such a subject, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You used to {{have your}} own king and your own laws made at Edinburgh," [...] said he. [...] "Does it not fill you with rage and despair when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> all comes to you from London now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Miss O'Mahony, if {{you would}} {{sit down for a}} moment, I have a {{proposition}} to make to <b>you.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is one to which you may be induced to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it was up}} there. Come now, Watson, didn't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You {{need not}} fear to speak the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wilding {{took his}} friend affectionately by the arm. [...] "It is a whim of mine," [...] said he. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Nick, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is more than}} I can afford to indulge?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} of any use, sir, if I were to take a Savoyard servant? I find {{that many of them}} who come from places near the {{frontier}} speak French as well as their own language." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, your honour, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is necessary, {{of course}} it must be done; but {{would it not be}} as well to go to the shebeen first and to take {{possession}} of the room, and to get comfortably settled down in it before ye gives me away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be}} wise?" [...] she asked. [...] "Let {{me tell you}} something, Lumley. I have only known what fear was once in my life. I am afraid now. I am afraid of Wingrave. I have a fancy {{that he does not}} mean any good to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} true," [...] he answered, [...] "only I have already had more {{opportunities}} than most men. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> yourself <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is almost time I buckled to and started life more seriously?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can {{introduce}} you to some decent fellows, of course, and to some very charming ladies," [...] he said hesitatingly, [...] "but as to the club--I--well, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> yourself <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would scarcely be wise to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Ennia, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{foolish and}} wrong of you thus {{to go out}} {{unprotected}} at night to such a place as this, and, as I suppose, without the knowledge of your father and mother?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Mrs. Leith Fairfax," [...] he rejoined, {{echoing the}} cadence of her sentence. [...] "Educated {{as a mere}} mechanic, I am still a {{stranger}} to the elegancies of life. I usually depend on Marian for direction; but since <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be injudicious to appeal {{to her in the}} present instance----" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{has always}} been a demand upon the {{theological}} teacher that he should supply a cosmogony. It {{has always been}} an effective propagandist thing to say: [...] "OUR God made the whole universe. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be wise to abandon YOUR deity, who did not, as you admit, do anything of the sort?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is getting}} rather cold {{standing}} here?" [...] interrupted Pieter van de Werff {{before she could}} answer. [...] "Look, the sledge races are just beginning. Come, cousin, give me your hand," [...] and, taking Lysbeth by the arm, he skated off into the throng, followed at a distance by Dirk and the serving-maid, Greta.|$|E
2500|$|The title {{theme was}} {{initially}} released as a single. The track was an extended {{mix of the}} main title theme used {{in the first two}} seasons, and was released with an acoustic [...] "Diary Room" [...] mix and more trance influenced [...] "Eviction" [...] mix. It barely scraped in the top 50, but was re-released a few months later where it reached #12 on the ARIA charts in 2001 with a B-Side of The Sirens' hit [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>It's</b> Strange", which was also co-written by Big Brother 2001 housemates; the Diary Room mix; and an extended version of the Big Brother Uncut theme.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} dinna," [...] replied Babbie, in broad Scotch. [...] "Maybe, if you did, <b>you</b> would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> mair {{imprudent}} in me to stand here cracking clavers wi' the minister {{than for the}} minister to waste his time cracking wi' me." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “In {{the heat}} of the moment, you start coupling, aggregating, inheriting, and <b>you</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can cause <b>you</b> a problem in the future.
