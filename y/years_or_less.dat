5|$|The {{top of the}} {{peninsula}} is fairly flat, reaches an elevation of , and is capped by much younger sandstone and conglomerate deposits from the Pleistocene era, 1 million <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> in age. These flat-lying beds lie directly {{on top of the}} gently dipping Point Loma and Cabrillo formations. The gap in the sedimentary record, called an Angular unconformity, represents about 70 million years of non-deposition and/or erosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve this problem and current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E

5|$|Jack Finegan noted {{some early}} writers' {{reckoning}} of the regnal years of Augustus are the equivalent to 3/2 BC, or 2 BC or later {{for the birth}} of Jesus, including Irenaeus (3/2 BC), Clement of Alexandria (3/2 BC), Tertullian (3/2 BC), Julius Africanus (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Rome (3/2 BC), Hippolytus of Thebes (3/2 BC), Origen (3/2 BC), Eusebius of Caesarea (3/2 BC), Epiphanius of Salamis (3/2 BC), Cassiodorus Senator (3 BC), Paulus Orosius (2 BC), Dionysus Exiguus (1 BC), and Chronographer of the Year 354 (AD 1). Finegan places the death of Herod in 1 BC, and says if Jesus was born two <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> before Herod the Great died, the birth of Jesus would have been in 3 or 2 BC. Finegan also notes the Alogi reckoned Christ's birth with the equivalent of 4 BC or AD 9.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} suggest any labour {{by children}} aged 18 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses {{the wages of}} adults in developing countries {{as well as the}} developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less,</b> everywhere in the world.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is {{important}} to try to clarify the methodology of vertebroplasty such as amount of cement needed, how many needles to use and the significance of cement extravasation. This prospective study evaluated the potential of vertebroplasty to {{increase the likelihood of}} an adjacent vertebral compression fracture (VCF) 1 <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> after vertebroplasty, the correlation between the cement volumes injected and pain relief, and the consequences of cement extravasation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pain relief and the incidence of a subsequent fracture of adjacent verte-brae 1 <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> after vertebroplasty were evaluated in 357 patients (660 vertebrae) of mean age 77. 5 years with osteoporotic VCFs. The correlation between cement volume and pain relief was assessed with a Pearson correlation coefficient; factors potentially predictive of subsequent adjacent VCFs were explored by multiple logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Refracture of any vertebrae (adjacent or nonadjacent to the primary fracture) occurred in 18 % of the patients 1 <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> after vertebroplasty. Refracture of adjacent vertebrae occurred 1 <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> after vertebroplasty in 12 % of the patients. Neither cement volume nor extravasation of cement into the intravertebral disk {{was a significant predictor of}} adjacent VCFs. No correlation was found between cement volume and pain relief (r 0. 029). Extravasation of cement into the veins...|$|R

25|$|Illiteracy {{and lack}} of {{education}} have been present in Mexico for much of its history. In 1940, 58% of all Mexicans {{over the age of}} six were illiterate; in 1960, 38% were illiterate. The 1960 national census found that as to all Mexicans over the age of five, 43.7% had not completed one year of school, 50.7% had completed six <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less</b> of school, and only the remaining 5.6% had continued their education beyond six years of school.|$|E

25|$|Available {{evidence}} indicates that both bodies formed {{very early in the}} history of the Solar System, thereby retaining a record of events and processes from the time of the formation of the terrestrial planets. Radionuclide dating of pieces of meteorites thought to come from Vesta suggests that Vesta differentiated quickly, in three million <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>less.</b> Thermal evolution studies suggest that Ceres must have formed some time later, more than three million years after the formation of CAIs (the oldest known objects of Solar System origin).|$|E

EMBA students typically have a higher level of work experience, often 10 years or more, compared to other MBA students.

Colonoscopy can remove polyps as small as one millimetre or less. Once polyps are removed, they can be studied {{with the aid of}} a microscope to determine if they are precancerous or not.
