25|$|If, therefore, it {{is claimed}} that <b>your</b> <b>race</b> {{is doomed to}} {{economic}} inferiority, you may confidently look {{to the home of}} your ancestors and say, that you have set out to recover for the colored people the strength that was their own before they set foot on the shores of this continent. You may say that you go to work with bright hopes, and that you will not be discouraged by the slowness of your progress; for you have to recover not only what has been lost in transplanting the Negro race from its native soil to this continent, but you must reach higher levels than your ancestors ever had attained.|$|E
25|$|Ladies and Gentlemen I {{accept the}} flowers as a memento of {{reconciliation}} {{between the white}} and colored races of the southern states.

This day is a day that is proud to me, having occupied the position that I did for the past twelve years, and been misunderstood by <b>your</b> <b>race.</b> This is the first opportunity I have had during that time to say that I am your friend. I am here a representative of the southern people, one more slandered and maligned than any man in the nation.|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, <b>your</b> <b>race</b> is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of <b>your</b> <b>race,</b> these films are unlikely to teach you anything you don't already know." ...|$|E

He said to Wilson, [...] "We believe that you feel, with the progressive members of <b>your</b> <b>race,</b> that it is anomalous permanently to conserve within the nation groups of people whose civic condition by legislation is different from the normal standard of American life." [...] The outbreak of World War I impeded federal enactment of remedial Indian legislation.|$|E

Teammate Dawn Harper surged through to win gold. Jones was seen pounding the ground close to tears, trying to comprehend what had happened. [...] "You hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects <b>your</b> <b>race.</b> It's just a shame that it happened on the biggest race of my life."

2500|$|In January 1943, Cappon {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} as coach at Princeton {{in order to}} accept a commission with the U.S. Navy. [...] He was assigned to St. Mary's Pre-Flight School in Moraga, California. [...] Cappon missed the 1943–1944 through 1945–1946 basketball seasons while serving in the Navy. [...] Cappon was a lieutenant in the Naval Aviation fitness program, where he wrote training texts and directed athletics for the fleet airwing on the West Coast. [...] After returning to Princeton, Cappon was outspoken {{on the value of}} athletics as an equalizer in American society. [...] In a 1952 speech, Cappon said: [...] "There are some basic principles that we're gradually losing sight of in America, but we still have them in athletics. [...] When you come out for an athletic team, <b>your</b> <b>race,</b> creed or color makes no difference. [...] Nobody asks you who you know or how much money you've got. [...] The athletic field is one place where the merit system still takes precedence over the seniority system." ...|$|E
2500|$|The box of dust {{enabling}} travel between worlds {{originated in}} Atlantis. Both Lewis and his close friend J.R.R. Tolkien were {{fascinated by the}} Atlantis legend. The degeneration of Charn's rulers, Jadis' ancestors, from the early kind and wise to the later cruel and arrogant {{is reminiscent of the}} similar degeneration in Tolkien's Númenor, the fabled island kingdom that finally sank under the waves due to the sinfulness of its latter inhabitants. The world of Charn was destroyed when Jadis spoke The Deplorable Word, a form of knowledge ancient Charnian scholars feared for its destructive potential. A number of commentators believed Lewis was referring {{to the use of the}} atomic bomb, used less than a decade earlier. It is perhaps more likely that Lewis was echoing the mythical destruction of Atlantis by the forces of evil and arrogance. As noted by Alice Ward, the comparison with nuclear arms is made explicit in Aslan's last warning: [...] "You [...] are growing more like it [...] It is not certain that some wicked one of <b>your</b> <b>race</b> will not find out a secret as evil as The Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things".|$|E
