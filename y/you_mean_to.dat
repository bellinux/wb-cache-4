25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, that I believe will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E
500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E
500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing I could say to you, nothing I could ever do to make you see what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E

500|$|Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, {{was cast}} as Elsa. Menzel had {{formerly}} auditioned for Tangled, {{but did not}} get the part. However, Tangleds casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen. Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table read; after reading the entire script out loud, they sang [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings" [...] together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet. Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read. The songwriters were also present for the table read; Anderson-Lopez said [...] "Lasseter was in heaven" [...] upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, [...] "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel {{have to be in the}} movie!" [...] Lee said, [...] "They sung [...] it like sisters and what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> me nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang." [...] Between December 2012 and June 2013, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Prince Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} [...] "Let Me Talk to You" [...] as the {{background}} is surrounded by faulty fluorescent lighting, turning on and off in a programmed pattern. It also begins with Timberlake and Timbaland chanting [...] "hey" [...] to one another. The video proceeds with Timberlake dancing {{to the beat of}} the song. Timbaland then begins singing the first verse of the song, which then is proceeded by Timberlake. This is immediately followed with [...] "My Love" [...] playing; the first verse of the song, [...] "Ain't another woman that could take your spot my", plays. Timberlake comes floating toward the camera, down the faulty fluorescent tube. Once Timberlake stops floating, he begins singing the main verse of the song, which violins begin to float swirling gently around him, for [...] "If I wrote you a symphony / Just to say how much <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> me". The scene then changes with Timberlake and various dancers dancing accordingly in a choreographed style. When Timberlake begins the second verse, [...] "Now if I wrote you a love note / And made you smile at every word I wrote", pens and paper begin to float. This later exceeds with Timberlake singing [...] "This ring here represents my heart" [...] with a ring swirling into the camera. T.I. is then seen in the shot. T.I. begins rapping his lines in the song. After T.I. finishes his verse, Timberlake is then seen dancing with a female back-up dancer. Though, as they continue dancing, the female then leaves the shot, leaving Timberlake to dance {{to the end of the}} song. In the closing moments, the camera swirls around him, proving, conclusively, from every angle, that everyone has gone.|$|E
2500|$|The State of Nebraska then {{appealed to}} the U.S. Supreme Court. [...] The Supreme Court decided Wolff v. Rice, along with a {{landmark}} Fourth Amendment case, Stone v. Powell (July 6, 1976), 428 US 465. The Court held that Fourth Amendment claims {{would no longer be}} appealed through the federal courts on a writ of habeas corpus. Beginning with Stone v. Powell, state prisoners could only appeal Fourth Amendment claims to the U.S. Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari from the state's supreme court. Rice's appellate counsel, Father William Cunningham, a Jesuit priest, said to the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> tell my client, after all this time, that he has pursued the wrong legal avenue?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The second specimen, {{found in}} 1952 by Comoran {{fisherman}} Ahamadi Abdallah, {{was described as}} a different species, first as Malania hunti and later as Malania anjounae, after Daniel François Malan, the South African Prime Minister who had dispatched an SAAF Dakota at the behest of Professor Smith to fetch the specimen. It was later discovered that the lack of a first dorsal fin, at first thought to be significant, was caused by an injury early in the specimen's life. Ironically, Malan was a staunch creationist; when he was first shown the primitive creature, he exclaimed, with a twinkle, [...] "My, it is ugly. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> say we once looked like that?" [...] The specimen retrieved by Smith is on display at the SAIAB in Grahamstown, South Africa where he worked.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov sent {{a message}} to all of the great powers asking them to {{pressure}} Austria to extend the deadline of the ultimatum. Sazonov asked the Austrian government to back its claims of Serbian complicity in the killing of Franz Ferdinand by releasing the results of its official inquiry, which the Austrians refused to do as they lacked any conclusive as opposed to circumstantial evidence. Several times, the Austrians refused Russian requests to extend the deadline, despite warnings that an Austro-Serbian war could easily cause a world war. Sazonov told the Austrian ambassador [...] "I know what it is. <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> make war on Serbia...? You are setting fire to Europe... Why was Serbia given no chance to speak and why the form of an ultimatum? The fact is you mean war and you have burnt your bridges... One sees how peace-loving you are." ...|$|E
