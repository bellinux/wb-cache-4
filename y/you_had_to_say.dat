500|$|... "One Minute" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song with electropop influences, and begins with Clarkson singing, [...] "You're going crazy, running on empty / You can't {{make up your mind}} / You try to hide it, but <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it / Restless all this time." [...] It is composed in the key of A major and is set in time signature of common time, with a tempo of 124 beats per minute. Clarkson's vocal range spans over an octave, from A3 to D5. Critics have observed the influence of 1980s music on the song, while Talia Kraines of BBC Music compared it to pop rock songs released by singers Ashlee Simpson and Lindsay Lohan. A reviewer for Billboard commented on the song's structure, writing that [...] "One Minute" [...] consists of [...] "rapid-fire give-and-take verses".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{believe he}} lives somewhere in Westminster," [...] said Tanner, [...] "that's all I know about him; {{and if this}} be all <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{it might have been}} said in the coffee-room." ...|$|E

If it should appear, after all, that what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> does not concern me--and I don't {{know how it}} can, and don't expect that it will--you will allow me to cut you short with but little ceremony. <b>Say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> if <b>you</b> please." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They're here now," [...] she said. [...] "I thought they'd, like to {{hear what}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about their father. You {{remember}} Robert, don't you? I'm glad to say he's been recommended for the Military Cross." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Undoubtedly, he would," [...] agreed Goodwin calmly, as he rose leisurely to his feet. [...] "I'll {{be running}} {{over to the}} house now, old man. Mrs. Goodwin is alone. There was nothing {{important}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> was there?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Eugène," [...] she expostulated, [...] "we are too {{old friends}} to talk always in veiled phrases. There is {{something}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me. I am listening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait here!" [...] she cried. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} I am waiting for? Nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me indeed!--I should think so! What should <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{why could}} you not tell him {{yourself}} what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> He and I do not agree about certain things, and I {{do not like to}} carry messages to him. And you have seen him here on this sacre sea-coast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{thought you}} one whit like Madame Ginevra, I would not sit here {{waiting for your}} communications. I would get up, walk at my ease about the room, and {{anticipate}} all <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> by a round lecture. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you want}} with me, Maraton?" [...] he asked. [...] "They tell me--Selingman tells me--there was a word <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> before you press the levers.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{know all}} about spoons, for I {{used to be in}} the plating business. I only asked to see what you would say.

"Curse it all," [...] said John in a fury, [...] "if {{that was}} all <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you might have kept in bed," [...] and he brought down his lash on the wheelers and away they went with a bound, putting out the prophet's candle and nearly {{knocking}} the prophet himself backwards into the sluit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] rejoined Thousandacres, [...] "there is no use in riling the feelin's, {{by talking}} of that" [...] (meaning Tobit's sufferings, {{not at the}} stake, but at the post)--"a hint's {{as good as a}} description. You was taken afore a magistrate, was you--and he {{permitted}} you to prison--but he asked what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> for yourself, first? That was only fair, and I mean to act it all out here, accordin' to law. Come, young attorney, what have you got to say for yourself?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's another thing, Mr. Craig, that me and Mrs. Aleshine {{has been}} talkin' about. We haven't made up our minds about it, because we didn't {{think it was}} fair and {{right to do that}} before speakin' to you and hearin' what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> on one side or another of it. Mrs. Aleshine and me has had to bow our heads to afflictions, and to walk {{sometimes}} in roads we didn't want to; but we've remembered the ways in which we was brought up, and have kept in them as far as we've been able.

6000|$|The {{other day}} I {{was what you}} would call floored by a Jew. He passed me several times crying out for old clothes in the most nasal and {{extraordinary}} tone I ever heard. At last I was so provoked, that I said to him, [...] "Pray, why can't you say 'old clothes' in a plain way as I do now?" [...] The Jew stopped, and looking very gravely at me, said in a clear and even fine accent, [...] "Sir, I can say 'old clothes' as well as you can; but if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so ten times a minute, for an hour together, you would say Ogh Clo as I do now;" [...] and so he marched off. I was so confounded with the justice of his retort, that I followed and gave him a shilling, the only one I had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mind my {{staying for}} a little chat, do you?" [...] Richard {{continued}} pleasantly. [...] "You see, I am an American and I am kind of interested in the latter portion of what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I dare say you're quite right in some respects. We are a trifle too commercial and a trifle too cocksure. You see, things have always gone our way. All the same, we've got the stuff, you know. Just consider this. If I thought there was any real need for it, and I begin to think that perhaps there may be, I {{should be ready to}} present the United States with a Dreadnought to-morrow, and I don't know that I should need to spend very much less myself. And," [...] he went on, [...] "there are thirty or forty others who could and would do the same. Tidy little fleet we should soon have, you see, without a penny of taxation. Of course, I know we would need the men, but we've a grand reserve to draw upon in the West. They are not bothering about the navy in times of peace, but they'd stream into it fast enough if there were any real need." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "When {{we reached}} Sanpritchit {{and you were}} not there, I was utterly unable to {{understand}} the situation; but Mrs. Raynor's yacht was there, just {{on the point of}} sailing, and I considered it my duty, as your representative, to hasten on board, and to apprise the lady that you were on your way to see her. Of course she wanted to know why you were coming, and all that; and as you were not there to do it yourself, I told her the nature of your errand, and impressed upon her the importance of delaying her departure until she had seen you and had heard what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> She did not agree with me that the interview would be of importance to any one concerned, but she consented to wait for a time and see you. If you arrived, she agreed to meet you on shore; for she would not consent to your coming on board the yacht, where her daughter was. I went ashore, and waited there with great impatience until early in the afternoon, when a boy arrived, who said he had started to bring you to Sanpritchit, but that you had changed your mind, and he had conveyed you to a railroad station, where you had taken a western-bound train.|$|E
6000|$|To most affectionate {{inquiries}} as to {{your health}} and powers, I [...] gave a most satisfactory account, and the conversation then went [...] to {{the question as to}} the effect which your recent triumphant [...] progress in Midlothian and the North had produced upon your mind. [...] I frankly said that you had in my opinion not anticipated such a [...] marked expression of public feeling, and that it had doubtless [...] tended to lead your mind to the consideration of the position of [...] the party, and to the fact that public opinion might call upon you [...] to an extent which no one could have looked for. I then (with [...] anxiety to convey what I know to be your desire) most earnestly [...] impressed upon Lord Granville that you had upon every occasion [...] when the subject was alluded to, prefaced all <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with [...] the strongest expressions of loyalty to Hartington and himself. [...] That I felt convinced that nothing would induce you to encourage, [...] or to even listen to, any attempt which others might make to [...] disturb the existing state of things as to the leadership, unless [...] the wish was very clearly expressed to you by Hartington and [...] himself, and you would demand full proof that their interests and [...] that of the party strongly pointed to the reconsideration of your [...] own position. I need hardly say that, though I felt it my duty to [...] take care that I did not understate your feelings, it was not [...] necessary to reassure Granville upon that point.|$|E
60|$|A system {{occasionally}} {{employed by}} Arctic expeditions, {{of making a}} cache 10 feet true north (and not magnetic north) from the cairn or mark, deserves to be generally employed, at least with modifications. Let me therefore suggest, that persons who find a cairn built of a tree marked, so as to attract notice, and who are searching blindly in all directions for further clue, should invariably dig out and examine that particular spot. The notice deposited there may consist {{of no more than}} a single sentence, to indicate some distant point as the place where the longer letter is buried. I hope it will be understood, that the precaution of always burying a notice 10 feet true north of the cairn mark is proposed as additional to and not in the place of other contrivances for giving information. There will often arise some doubt as to the exact point in the circumference of the cairn or mark whence the 10 feet measurement should be made. This is due to the irregularity of the bases of all such marks. Therefore, when searching for letters, a short trench, running to the north, will frequently have to be dug, and not a mere hole. I should propose that the short notice be punched or pricked on a thin sheet of lead, made by pouring two or three melted bullets on a flat stone, and that the plate so made and inscribed should be rolled up and pushed into a hole bored or burnt through the head of a large tent peg. The peg could be driven deeply in the ground, quite out of sight, without disturbing the surrounding earth. It might even suffice to pick up a common stone and to scratch or paint upon it what <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and to leave it on the ground, with its written face downwards, at the place in question.|$|E
