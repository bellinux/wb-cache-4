5|$|In May 2007, <b>YouTube</b> {{launched}} its Partner Program, a {{system based on}} AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. <b>YouTube</b> typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the <b>YouTube</b> Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on <b>YouTube</b> (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no {{more than half of}} eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, {{due to a lack of}} interested advertisers. In 2013, <b>YouTube</b> introduced an option for channels with at least a thousand subscribers to require a paid subscription in order for viewers to watch videos. <b>YouTube</b> Play Buttons, a part of the <b>YouTube</b> Creator Rewards, are a recognition by <b>YouTube</b> of its most popular channels.

Focussing on <b>YouTube’s</b> visual rhetoric of the screen-frame and thumbnails, this article explores affinities with the mosaic and grid, two visual forms historically significant to cartographic production and organization. By contrasting <b>YouTube’s</b> interface to the strategies of other image-sharing platforms, it demonstrates the website’s emphasis on exploration through visual cues that eschew the linearity of film and video for a longitudinal-latitudinal structure. In so doing, it relates <b>YouTube’s</b> strategy to the branding of its parent company, Google, the idea of regenerative mash-ups, and relevant theories of the mosaic and grid drawn from geography, media studies, visual culture, and art history. It ends with a consideration of alternative means of display that engage the culture and content of on-line video sharing, embodied in artworks by Christopher Baker and Wreck and Salvage...|$|R

Video captions are made using speech recognition technology when uploaded. Such captioning is usually not perfectly accurate, so <b>YouTube</b> provides several options for manually entering the captions for greater accuracy.|$|E
