25|$|I {{am writing}} to ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the {{inclusion}} of my son, E. M. Grace– a splendid hitter and most excellent catch– in your England XI. I am sure he would play very well and do the team much credit. It may interest you to learn that I have another son, now twelve years of age, who will in time be a much better player than his brother because his back stroke is sounder, and he always plays with a straight bat.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{comprehensive}} {{success of the}} Battle of Megiddo, Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) at the War Office encouraged Allenby {{with the idea that}} the EEF could do anything: [...] "There is much talk here of the usual kind some saying you could go to Petrograd and some saying that all your force should now be transported to France, and some again {{who would like to see}} you march east to Baghdad!" [...] He continued: [...] "Your success being so complete, I should like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the possibility of a cavalry raid on Aleppo, to be supported by infantry or not as the situation developed and as opportunities offered."

2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E
