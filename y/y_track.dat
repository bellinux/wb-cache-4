40|$|Background In {{many parts}} of the world policy and {{research}} interventions to modify sedentary behavior of children and adolescents are now being developed. However, the evidence to inform these interventions (e. g. how sedentary behavior changes across childhood and adolescence) is limited. This study aimed to assess longitudinal changes in sedentary behavior, and examine the degree of tracking of sedentary behavior from age 7 y to 15 y. Methods Participants were part of the Gateshead Millennium Study cohort. Measures were made at age 7 y (n[*]=[*] 507), 9 y (n[*]=[*] 510), 12 y (n[*]=[*] 425) and 15 y (n[*]=[*] 310). Participants were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT 1 M and accelerometer epochs were defined as sedentary when recorded counts were ≤ 25 counts/ 15 s. Differences in sedentary time and sedentary fragmentation were examined using the Friedman test. Tracking was examined using Spearman’s correlation coefficients and trajectories over time were assessed using multilevel linear spline modelling. Results Median daily sedentary time increased from 51. 3 % of waking hours at 7 y to 74. 2 % at 15 y. Sedentary fragmentation decreased from 7 y to 15 y. The median number of breaks/hour decreased from 8. 6 to 4. 1 breaks/hour and the median bout duration at 50 % of the cumulative sedentary time increased from 2. 4 min to 6. 4 min from 7 y to 15 <b>y.</b> <b>Tracking</b> of sedentary time and sedentary fragmentation was moderate from 7 y to 15 y however, the rate of change differed with the steepest increases/decreases seen between 9 y and 12 y. Conclusion In this study, sedentary time was high and increased to almost 75 % of waking hours at 15 y. Sedentary behavior became substantially less fragmented as children grew older. The largest changes in sedentary time and sedentary fragmentation occurred between 9 y to 12 y, a period which spans the transition to secondary school. These results can be used to inform future interventions aiming to change sedentary behavior...|$|R
40|$|The Large Area Telescope (Fermi/LAT, {{hereafter}} LAT), {{the primary}} instrument on the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) mission, is an imaging, wide field-of-view (FoV), high-energy {gamma}-ray telescope, covering the energy range from below 20 MeV {{to more than}} 300 GeV. The LAT was built by an international collaboration with contributions from space agencies, high-energy particle physics institutes, and universities in France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. This paper describes the LAT, its preflight expected performance, and summarizes the key science objectives that will be addressed. On-orbit performance will be presented in detail in a subsequent paper. The LAT is a pair-conversion telescope with a precision tracker and calorimeter, each consisting of a 4 x 4 array of 16 modules, a segmented anticoincidence detector that covers the tracker array, and a programmable trigger and data acquisition system. Each tracker module has a vertical stack of 18 (x, <b>y)</b> <b>tracking</b> planes, including two layers (x and y) of single-sided silicon strip detectors and high-Z converter material (tungsten) per tray. Every calorimeter module has 96 CsI(Tl) crystals, arranged in an eight-layer hodoscopic configuration with a total depth of 8. 6 radiation lengths, giving both longitudinal and transverse information about the energy deposition pattern. The calorimeter's depth and segmentation enable the high-energy reach of the LAT and contribute significantly to background rejection. The aspect ratio of the tracker (height/width) is 0. 4, allowing a large FoV (2. 4 sr) and ensuring that most pair-conversion showers initiated in the tracker will pass into the calorimeter for energy measurement. Data obtained with the LAT are intended to (1) permit rapid notification of high-energy {gamma}-ray bursts and transients and facilitate monitoring of variable sources, (2) yield an extensive catalog of several thousand high-energy sources obtained from an all-sky survey, (3) measure spectra from 20 MeV to more than 50 GeV for several hundred sources, (4) localize point sources to 0. 3 - 2 arcmin, (5) map and obtain spectra of extended sources such as SNRs, molecular clouds, and nearby galaxies, (6) measure the diffuse isotropic {gamma}-ray background up to TeV energies, and (7) explore the discovery space for dark matter...|$|R

40|$|When {{debugging}} a distributed system, it {{is sometimes}} necessary to explain {{the absence of an}} event – for instance, why a certain route is not available, or why a certain packet did not arrive. Existing debuggers offer some support for explaining the presence of events, usually by providing the equivalent of a backtrace in conventional debuggers, but they are not very good at answering “Why not?” questions: there is simply no starting point for a possible backtrace. In this paper, we show that the concept of negative provenance can be used to explain the absence of events in distributed systems. Negative provenance relies on counterfactual reasoning to identify the conditions under which the missing event could have occurred. We define a formal model of negative provenance for distributed systems, and we present the design of a system called <b>Y!</b> that <b>tracks</b> both positive and negative provenance and can use them to answer diagnostic queries.

Likewise, it is crucial for tissue-engineered bone to establish a vascular network that temporally precedes new bone formation, and spatially originates from within the graft. In order to recapitulate physiological skeletal development, we have developed a complex bone graft to repair rat bone defects. We have demonstrated that endothelial cells and osteoblasts (identified by cell morphology, quantification of specific marker antigens, calcium deposition and capillary-like growth) were able to differentiate and expand from donor rat bone marrow mononuclear cell populations. The biocompatibilities of poly-ɛ-caprolactone (PCL) -hydroxyapatite (HA) composites used for graft fabrication were evaluated at different component ratios to identify the optimal and support of cellular viability and functions for endothelial cells and osteoblasts. Using point-injection and low-pressure techniques, seeded endothelial cells and osteoblasts were able to assemble into microvascular networks and form bony matrix in grafts. The exogenous origination of these cells and their contribution to the vascularization and osteogenesis was confirmed using sex-mismatch implantation and <b>Y</b> chromosome <b>tracking.</b> By pre-seeding with endothelial cells, the resulting vascularization was able to promote osteogenesis, prevent ischemic necrosis and improve the mechanical properties in engineered bone tissue.

We assume {{that there is a}} Lipschitz function Ξ:[u_min, u_max]→ R^n such that for every constant input u_ 0 ∈[u_min, u_max], Ξ(u_ 0) is an exponentially stable equilibrium point of P. We also assume that G(u) =g(Ξ(u)), which is the steady state input-output map of P, is strictly increasing. Denoting y_min=G(u_min) and y_max=G (u_max), we assume that the reference value r is in (y_min, y_max). Our aim is that <b>y</b> should <b>track</b> r, i. e., y→ r as t→∞, while the input of P is only allowed to be in [u_min, u_max]. For this, we introduce a variation of the integrator, called the saturating integrator, and connect it in feedback with P in the standard way, with gain k> 0. We show that for any small enough k, the closed-loop system is (locally) exponentially stable around an equilibrium point (Ξ(u_r),u_r), with a "large" region of attraction X_T⊂ R^n×[u_min, u_max]. When the state (x(t),u(t)) of the closed-loop system converges to (Ξ(u_r), u_r), then the tracking error r-y tends to zero. The compact set X_T can be made larger by choosing a larger parameter T> 0, but this may force us to use a smaller k, in which case the response of the system will be slower.

Focussing on the latter type (e. g., VIRS- 200) the noise is intrinsically non-stationary in the raw digital counts.

By inference, EPCs are also proposed to be important in the most important arterial disease, atherosclerosis, but the evidence for this theory is not clear. In the present study, we assessed the contribution of circulating EPCs to plaque endothelium in apolipoprotein E–deficient (apoE/) mice. Methods and Results—To investigate whether EPCs in the circulating blood are a source of plaque endothelial cells during atherogenesis, we examined plaques in lethally irradiated apoE/ mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells from enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgenic apoE/ mice and plaques induced in segments of common carotid artery transplanted from apoE/ mice into eGFPapoE/ mice. Among 4232 endothelial cells identified by a cell-type–specific marker (von Willebrand factor) and analyzed by high-resolution microscopy, we found only 1 eGFP. Using the <b>Y</b> chromosome to <b>track</b> cells after sex-mismatched transplants yielded similar results. To investigate whether circulating EPCs are involved in plaque reendothelialization after plaque disruption and superimposed thrombosis, we produced mechanical plaque disruptions in carotid bifurcation plaques in old lethally irradiated apoE/ mice reconstituted with eGFPapoE/ bone marrow cells and carotid bifurcation plaques transplanted from old apoE/ mice into eGFPapoE/ mice.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} work are to develop direct and indirect adaptive control strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems and to investigate {{the applicability of the}} proposed schemes to adaptive tracking control of a flexible-link manipulator. The first problem considered is indirect adaptive control of a fully as well as a partially input-output feedback linearizable n th order affine SISO nonlinear system represented in the state-space form. The objective is to make the output <b>y</b> (k) <b>track</b> a reference trajectory y m (k) {{despite the fact that the}} parameters of the system are unknown. Towards this end, a local diffeomorphism for the change of coordinates and a nonlinear feedback control law are obtained so that the nonlinear system is rendered input to output equivalent into a linear system. The resulting linear system is then used to solve the output tracking control problem using conventional linear control theory. A multi-output recursive-least-square (RLS) algorithm is employed to identify the unknown parameters. Using the Lyapunov technique it is shown that provided the zero dynamics is exponentially stable the adaptively controlled closed-loop system is stable. The second problem addressed is the direct adaptive tracking control problem of a class of SIS 0 discrete-time nonlinear systems represented in the input-output form. To solve the problem, the state-space model is first derived and the appropriate control input is obtained. By employing the projection algorithm as a parameter estimator, the closed-loop stability of the adaptively controlled system is addressed using Lyapunov technique. As an application, the indirect adaptive control strategy is employed to control a single link flexible manipulator. Towards this end, the discrete-time model of the manipulator and its zero dynamics are derived first. By using the output re-definition technique, the adaptive input-output linearization scheme is then applied. The regressor form of the link's dynamic equations is also developed for the multi-output RLS identification algorithm. The performance of the adaptively controlled closed-loop system is investigated through numerical simulations to show the advantages and the main features of the proposed strategy. Finally to evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, an experimental test-bed of a single-link flexible manipulator is used for implementation. The real-time controller and estimator are implemented on a TMS system board which uses a TMS 320 C 30 Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chip. The actual results are then compared with the simulation results to verify and validate the theoretical findings...|$|R

However, it is unclear if increased rodent or flea abundance predisposes prairie dogs to infection with <b>Y.</b> pestis. We <b>tracked</b> rodent and flea occurrence for 3 years at a number of prairie dog colony sites in Boulder County, Colorado, before, during, and after a local plague epizootic to see if high rodent or flea abundance was associated with plague-affected colonies when compared to colonies that escaped infection.

Further, we saw no significant before-plague/after-plague change in these metrics at either plague-positive or plague-negative sites.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} for extending the Cooperative Control Synthesis methodology {{to include a}} more accurate modeling of the pilot's controller dynamics. Cooperative Control Synthesis (CCS) is a methodology that addresses {{the problem of how}} to design control laws for piloted, high-order, multivariate systems and/or nonconventional dynamic con gurations in the absence of ying qualities speci cations. This is accomplished by emphasizing the parallel structure inherent in any pilot-controlled, augmented vehicle. The original CCS methodology is extended to include the modi ed optimal control model (MOCM), which is based upon the optimal control model of the human operator developed by Kleinman, Baron, and Levison in 1970. This model provides a modeling of the pilot's compensation dynamics that is more accurate than the simpli ed pilot dynamic representation currently in the CCS methodology. Inclusion of the MOCM into the CCS also enables the modeling of pilot-observation perception thresholds and pilot-observation attention allocation effects. This Extended Cooperative Control Synthesis (ECCS) allows for the direct calculation of pilot and system open- and closed-loop transfer functions in pole/zero form and is readily implemented in current software capable of analysis and design for dynamic systems. Example results based upon synthesizing an augmentation control law for an acceleration command system in a compensatory tracking task using the ECCS are compared with a similar synthesis performed by using the original CCS methodology. The ECCS is shown to provide augmentation control laws that yield more favorable, predicted closedloop <b>ying</b> qualities and <b>tracking</b> performance than those synthesized using the original CCS methodology...|$|R
40|$|In {{magnetic}} recording greater area) bit packing densities are achieved through increasing track density by reducing space between and {{width of the}} recording tracks, and/or reducing the wavelength of the recorded information. This leads to the requirement of higher precision tape transport mechanisms and dedicated coding circuitry. A TMS 320 10 digital signal processor is applied to a standard low-cost, low precision, multiple-track, compact cassette tape recording system. Advanced signal processing and coding techniques are employed to maximise recording density and {{to compensate for the}} mechanical deficiencies of this system. Parallel software encoding/decoding algorithms have been developed for several Run-Length Limited modulation codes. The results for a peak detection system show that Bi-Phase L code can be reliably employed up to a data rate of 5 kbits/second/track. Development of a second system employing a TMS 32025 and sampling detection permitted the utilisation of adaptive equalisation to slim the readback pulse. Application of conventional read equalisation techniques, that oppose inter-symbol interference, resulted in a 30 % increase in performance. Further investigation shows that greater linear recording densities can be achieved by employing Partial Response signalling and Maximum Likelihood Detection. Partial response signalling schemes use controlled inter-symbol interference to increase recording density at the expense of a multi-level read back waveform which results in an increased noise penalty. Maximum Likelihood Sequence detection employs soft decisions on the readback waveform to recover this loss. The associated modulation coding techniques required for optimised operation of such a system are discussed. Two-dimensional run-length-limited (d, ky) modulation codes provide a further means of increasing storage capacity in multi-track recording systems. For example the code rate of a single track run length-limited code with constraints (1, 3), such as Miller code, can be increased by over 25 % when using a 4 -track two-dimensional code with the same d constraint and with the k constraint satisfied across a number of parallel channels. The k constraint along an individual track, kx, can be increased without loss of clock synchronisation since the clocking information derived by frequent signal transitions can be sub-divided across a number of, <b>y,</b> parallel <b>tracks</b> in terms of a ky constraint. This permits more code words to be generated for a given (d, k) constraint in two dimensions than is possible in one dimension. This coding technique is furthered by development of a reverse enumeration scheme based on the trellis description of the (d, ky) constraints. The application of a two-dimensional code to a high linear density system employing extended class IV partial response signalling and maximum likelihood detection is proposed. Finally, additional coding constraints to improve spectral response and error performance are discussed. Hewlett Packard, Computer Peripherals Division (Bristol...|$|R

ABSTRACT There is {{an increasing}} demand for real-time tracking applications and systems locally as well as internationally. The satellite based Global Positioning System (GPS) is the ground technology for most of the commercial level systems. But high equipment cost, setup and the running cost incur deploying such GPS based tracking system, cause to discourage peoples' tracking interest. The project involves in developing a real-time vehicle movement monitoring system(vehicle movement monitor system) for companies to track their vehicles in the field. The proposed system comes as an unconventional cost-effective method for vehicle movement monitoring, using Global Systems for Mobile Communication (GSM) infrastructure and Location Based Services (LBS). This project involves in collecting the current position information (x, <b>y</b> coordinate) of <b>tracking</b> vehicles via location based service and plot them on a base map to pinpoint vehicle's ground location. / The main objective of this project is to deliver an alternative and cost-effective solution for the GPS based vehicle movement tracking, using minimal resources and available infrastructure.
