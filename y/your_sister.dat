500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that we all know, it could be about <b>your</b> <b>sister.</b> It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles Aaron from Spin {{noted that}} the album is a brave comment on the chilly, tragic {{detachment}} of sex under AIDS. Stylus Magazine commented that each song has its own energy. He also noted that [...] "Erotica was too sophisticated for a mainstream besotted with [...] and a college-radio claque eager to praise R.E.M.'s opaque dirges for the wisdom that Madonna's club fodder showed with less fuss and with a better rhythm section". Robert Christgau commented that [...] "The singer doesn't have great pipes, but because she's too hip to belt , she doesn't need them. She's in control, all understated presence and impersonal personality except when she's flashing some pink. [...] "Love <b>your</b> <b>sister,</b> love your brother" [...] thing, the lyrics are not stupid. I love the rap where the boast {{turns out to be}} a lie." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine recognized that [...] "Pettibone's beats might be time-stamped with the sound of a genre that ruled a decade of one-hitters before being replaced by commercialized hip-hop" [...] and classified Madonna's voice as [...] "nasal and remote". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly declared that Erotica may be the most joyless dance music of all time, while criticizing Madonna's [...] "soulless" [...] voice. Stephen Holden from The New York Times wrote that the album is far from Madonna's best album, as the hip-hop songs lack the [...] "musical breadth and confessional poignancy" [...] of Like a Prayer, the record that established Madonna as a mature pop songwriter.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing <b>your</b> <b>sister</b> is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights and the sky was completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{opening track}} is [...] "Survival". It is a [...] "sweetly funky number" [...] which tries to [...] "convey a loosely drawn {{narrative}} of the punishment she endured from the media and her feelings {{leading up to the}} release". It has a lyrical allusion to the singer's 1986 single [...] "Live to Tell", with double-tracked strong vocals and harmonies. In the song, Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds, in order to cater to the then musical trend. Containing multiple hooks, [...] "Survival"'s lyrics are about dualities like heaven/hell, up/down, angels/saints. [...] "Secret", the second song, begins with just the sound of Madonna's voice singing over a rhythmic, folksy guitar in descending chord sequence, before opening up to a sparse, retro rhythm section. A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark, accompanied by wah-wah ascending string line, supporting the descending guitar. Towards the end, an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance. Madonna's voice remains {{at the center of the}} song's production, as she sings lyrics such as [...] "happiness lies in your own hand". Throughout the song, Madonna also sings the lyrics [...] "My baby's got a secret", however she never discloses what the secret may be. During the next song, [...] "I'd Rather Be Your Lover", Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation: [...] "I could be <b>your</b> <b>sister,</b> I could be your mother, We could be friends, I'd even be your brother". Towards the middle of the song, an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello, who raps: [...] "Tell me what you want / Tell me what you need...". Madonna interrupts, with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello's rap part. A trip hop track, the song is musically comparable to the tracks on Portishead's 1994 album, Dummy, and also contains influences of new jack swing. It uses a sample from [...] "It's Your Thing" [...] performed by Lou Donaldson.|$|E

[...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, <b>your</b> <b>sister...</b> We didn't dare beat you up – <b>your</b> <b>sister</b> was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did you speak to her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{prospective}} memory; event-based and time based. [...] Event-based prospective memory is when an environmental cue prompts you to carry out a task. [...] An example is when seeing a friend reminds you to ask him a question. In contrast, time-based prospective memory occurs when you remember to carry out a task at a specific time. [...] An example of this is remembering to phone <b>your</b> <b>sister</b> on her birthday. [...] Time-based prospective memory is more difficult than event-based prospective memory because there is no environmental cue prompting one to remember to carry out the task at that specific time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1664, Henrietta {{gave birth}} at Fontainebleau to {{a son who}} was given the title Duke of Valois. Philippe wrote to his {{brother-in-law}} Charles II of England [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>sister</b> was this morning safely delivered of a fine boy. The child {{seems to be in}} excellent health". The child nonetheless died of convulsions in 1666, having been baptised Philippe Charles d'Orléans hours before death. The loss of the little Duke of Valois affected Henrietta greatly. Philippe, however, was anxious to maintain the allowance which his son had received from the king. This death only augmented the grief of a court still in mourning for the death of Queen Anne in January.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Inanna relents {{and changes}} her decree thereby {{restoring}} her husband Dumuzi to life; an arrangement {{is made by}} which Geshtinana will take Dumuzid's place in Kur for {{six months of the}} year: [...] "You (Dumuzi), half the year. <b>Your</b> <b>sister</b> (Geštinanna), half the year!" [...] This newly recovered final line upset Samuel Noah Kramer's former interpretation, as he allowed: [...] "my conclusion that Dumuzi dies and [...] "stays dead" [...] forever (cf e.g. Mythologies of the Ancient World p.10) was quite erroneous: Dumuzi according to the Sumerian mythographers rises from the dead annually and, after staying on earth for half the year, descends to the Nether World for the other half".|$|E
