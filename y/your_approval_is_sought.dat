50|$|By {{the time}} {{parliamentary}} <b>approval</b> <b>was</b> <b>sought,</b> {{the southern end}} had been cut back to Shillingstone, to reduce the cost, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 24 March 1796, giving the company powers to raise £150,000, with an additional £75,000 if required. However, with the social changes and inflation that was occurring at the time, less than £80,000 was raised. With this, the company decided {{to start with the}} branch to Frome, in order to capitalise on the lucrative markets in the coal fields and the clothing industry in Frome.|$|R
50|$|A {{bridge loan}} is often {{obtained}} by developers {{to carry a}} project while permit <b>approval</b> <b>is</b> <b>sought.</b> Because there <b>is</b> no guarantee the project will happen, the loan might be at a high interest rate and from a specialized lending source that will accept the risk. Once the project is fully entitled, it becomes eligible for loans from more conventional sources that are at lower-interest, for a longer term, and in a greater amount. A construction loan would then be obtained {{to take out the}} bridge loan and fund completion of the project.|$|R

50|$|On 25 January 2011 Federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Anthony Albanese {{announced}} {{his support for}} the state government’s preferred crossing of the Jordan River after the Independent review launched by the Federal government was finalised. The report's key findings stated that the alternative bridging options would increase the overall cost of the bypass by at least $127 million and delay its completion by up to 4 years while new planning and environmental <b>approvals</b> <b>were</b> <b>sought.</b> It also noted that changing the route of the bypass would add between $82 and $140 million to the overall cost of the project.|$|R
2500|$|The {{alternative}} route {{was on the}} south side of the Don Valley, to terminate at a basin on the site of the former orchards of Sheffield Castle. This would require two series of locks, one, at Tinsley to raise the level from the river and a second, at Carbrook, to gain the necessary height for a level flow into the city centre. It was suggested that a short branch, known as [...] "The Greenland Arm" [...] should be built to afford access to Tinsley Park Collieries. [...] Although the longer and more expensive option, the Duke's support meant that this route was the one for which parliamentary <b>approval</b> <b>was</b> <b>sought.</b>|$|R
