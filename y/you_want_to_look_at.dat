25|$|Maharlika – Members of the Tagalog warrior class {{known as}} maharlika {{had the same}} rights and {{responsibilities}} as the timawa, but {{in times of war}} they were bound to serve their datu in battle. They had to arm themselves at their own expense, but they did get to keep the loot they won – or stole, depending on which side of the transaction <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at.</b> Although they were partly related to the nobility, the maharlikas were technically less free than the timawas because they could not leave a datu’s service without first hosting a large public feast and paying the datu between 6 and 18 pesos in gold – a large sum in those days.|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them for, Francis? You {{certainly}} {{are the most}} curious fellow I ever met. You scoffed at me when I said I should like to go up Mount Etna, and now here you are, dragging me along this cliff, {{just to look at}} some rocks of no possible interest to any one." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He said, 'You're arresting me, huh? Say, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> where you're goin'; I {{cut some}} ice in this town. I made half the big {{politicians}} in New York!' That {{was what he}} said." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell them}} all--the first chance I get," [...] promised Dave. [...] "And I am {{sure they will}} be pleased. Why, Nat, I know you can turn over a new leaf, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Gus Plum, how mean he used to be, and what a bully! And look at him now. He's a first-rate fellow. You can do it if Plum can, can't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Wheeler {{waved his}} hand. [...] "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "you're like that other Englishman, but <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this thing from a {{business}} point of view. Now, as you know, the men who do the toughest work on this Pacific slope are usually the ones who get the least for it. Well, if you run the river down, you'll dry out the whole valley, and you'll have every man with a fancy for ranching jumping in, or some d---- land agency's dummies grabbing every rod of it. It's Crown land. Anybody can locate a ranch on it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{yesterday}} {{ordered a}} 'Fors' {{to be sent}} you containing in its close the most important piece of a religious character in the book--this I hope you will also allow to stay on your shelves. The two that I sent with this note contain so much that is saucy that I only send them in case <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the challenge {{referred to in the}} Letters to the Bishop of Manchester, see October, 1877, pp. 322, 323, and January 1875, p. 11. You can keep as long as you like, but please take care of them, as my index is not yet done. The next letter will come before the week end, but it's a difficult one.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you're skating, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out for air holes," [...] was John Barrow's caution. [...] "Fer {{where the}} river runs between the {{mountains}} it is mighty deep in spots, I can tell you that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll {{tell you}} what you might do. You might say that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left {{something}} here. He had Bertie's room, you know. You might say <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not you!' {{returned}} Fledgeby, with a cunning look. 'A telling {{move with}} a good many, I dare say, but it won't put ME off my guard. Not a bad notion though, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> indifferent in driving a bargain. Oh, you are a dodger!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{interrupted}} Nello. [...] "I {{know what}} you would say. It is the bella zazzera--the hyacinthine locks, you do not choose to part with; {{and there is no}} need. Just a little pruning--ecco!--and you will look not unlike the illustrious prince Pico di Mirandola in his prime. And here we are in good time in the Piazza San Giovanni, and at the door of my shop. But you are pausing, I see: naturally, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our wonder of the world, our Duomo, our Santa Maria del Fiore. Well, well, a mere glance; but I beseech you to leave a closer survey till you have been shaved: I am quivering with the inspiration of my art even to the very edge of my razor. Ah, then, come round this way." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vergil Gunch {{summed it}} up: [...] "Fact is, we're mighty {{lucky to be}} living among a bunch of city-folks, that {{recognize}} artistic things and business-punch equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers {{to the kind of}} life we're used to here. But, by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small American town is trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a lot of 'em don't put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads, telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street, count 'em, one, and nine hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in 1920, and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a first-class ladies' ready-to-wear shop-real perfection, in fact! You don't want to just look at what these small towns are, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what they're aiming to become, and they all got an ambition {{that in the long run}} is going to make 'em the finest spots on earth--they all want to be just like Zenith!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{knew where}} they was, a quid would be quite good enough for me, but I don't, and that's straight. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for them, I should try one of the doss houses. As likely there as anywhere." ...|$|R
25|$|Normally {{the last}} two letters would {{indicate}} where the car was initially registered. The letters I and Z are reserved for Ireland.

6000|$|... "And do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{like the}} portico of the Madeleine when it's draped for a funeral?" [...] her instructress mocked. [...] "Never, never. I don't believe you're various: that's {{not the way}} I see you. You're pure tragedy, with de grands éclats de voix in the great style, or you're nothing." ...|$|R
50|$|The words there, their, and they're are {{examples}} of three words that are of a singular pronunciation (in American English), have different spellings and vastly different meanings. These three words are commonly misused (or misspelled if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it that way) in American English.|$|E
5000|$|Current {{key people}} of Island Records include Island {{president}} Darcus Beese, OBE and MD Jon Turner. Partially {{due to the}} label's significant legacy, Island remains one of UMG's pre-eminent record labels. In a 50th anniversary documentary, Island Records artist Melissa Etheridge stated: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> world music, music of {{the last fifty years}} that changed the world, you {{need look no further than}} Island Records." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{finishing}} runner-up, Keselowski {{said his}} team [...] "hit the green-flag pit cycle perfectly {{to take advantage}} and {{what was going to}} give the lead to us and give us the prime opportunity to win the race. Unfortunately, that cloud came rolling in at the right or wrong time, how <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, to box us out and we ended up finishing second today. We needed about three more laps (before the fog), but it is what it is.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll let you off now," [...] he said. [...] "I know <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{around the}} tables and see if any of our friends of last night are to be found. I, too, have a little affair which I ought to have treated {{differently}} a few minutes ago. We'll meet later." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really! Now I see," [...] said he, [...] "you {{have the}} {{paternal}} line all correct, and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{up the line}} on the other side. That is very common; it is so seldom that one knows the line of ancestors on one's maternal side. Dork, then, {{was the name of}} your maternal grandfather." ...|$|R
500|$|At Fillmore East showcases the band's eclectic {{mixture of}} blues, rock, country, and jazz. [...] "Fusion {{is a term}} that came later, but if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a fusion album, it would be Fillmore East. Here was a rock 'n' roll band playing blues in the jazz vernacular. And they tore the place up," [...] said Dowd.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{affiliated}} with the New York Press and The Brooklyn Rail. [...] "Americans are extremely sophisticated in terms of narrative forms," [...] said Reed in an interview. [...] "We see it in commercials, we see it on TV, we see it in movies. But the narrative forms we're talking about are three acts, five acts, depending on how <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it. They're all based on a Christian model of sin, suffering, redemption; {{which is not a}} large model." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I would, I think, now {{still say}} that we {{maintain}} academic boycott insofar as, if for instance academics from here {{want to go to}} South Africa then <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> who is inviting them. Under whose auspices are they going? Are they going to institutions that have a good track record in their opposition to apartheid? But I would say that as things begin to ease up, this ought perhaps {{to be one of the}} first of the constraints that goes to give some of these people the reward." ...|$|E

5000|$|Doumbé {{turned down}} a three-year deal at Hibernian when he joined his former manager Bobby Williamson at Plymouth Argyle on a free {{transfer}} in May 2004. He enjoyed an impressive start to the 2004-05 season, and was soon linked with a move to Premier League side Everton. Days after being linked with a move away from Home Park, he was described by Williamson as being [...] "very committed and very brave, or foolish, whatever way <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it" [...] after he required 24 stitches in his head after challenging for the ball in a 2-1 defeat to Leicester City at the Walkers Stadium.|$|E
