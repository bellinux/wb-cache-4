25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high you go in the rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to <b>your</b> <b>total</b> for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to fighting with melee weapons (such as swords and maces) and ranged weapons (longbows and crossbows), Heroes can learn and use spells to empower their abilities, ward off damage, or harm foes. As players complete quests or defeat enemies, they gain general experience {{as well as}} experience based on whether they used melee attacks, ranged weapons, or magic; these bestow Strength, Skill, and Will experience, respectively. Experience can be spent at a platform in the Heroes Guild to level up attributes. General experience {{can be used to}} modify all groups of attributes. Strength experience can only be used to modify three attributes: Physique, Health, and Toughness. The same applies to Skill which can only modify Speed, Accuracy, and Guile. Will can be used to upgrade <b>your</b> <b>total</b> magic power or to learn and upgrade spells which are broken into three groups, Attack Spells, Surround Spells, and Physical Spells. The experience the main character gains can be multiplied during combat through the combat multiplier. As the character successfully hits an enemy, his combat multiplier increases.

What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to <b>your</b> <b>total</b> amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior.

[...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same."

6000|$|It was not {{necessary}} for you, my dear Sir, to explain yourself to me (in justification of your good wishes to your fellow-citizens) concerning <b>your</b> <b>total</b> alienation from {{the principles of the}} Catholics. I am more concerned in what we agree than in what we differ. You know the impossibility of our forming any judgment upon the opinions, religious, moral, or political, of those who in the largest sense are called Protestants,--at least, as these opinions and tenets form a qualification for holding any civil, judicial, military, or even ecclesiastical situation. I have no doubt of the orthodox opinion of many, both of the clergy and laity, professing the established religion in Ireland, and of many even amongst the Dissenters, relative to the great points of the Christian faith: but that orthodoxy concerns them only as individuals. As a qualification for employment, we all know that in Ireland it is {{not necessary}} that they should profess any religion at all: so that the war that we make is upon certain theological tenets, about which scholastic disputes are carried on æquo Marte, by controvertists, on their side, as able and as learned, and perhaps as well-intentioned, as those are who fight the battle on the other part. To them I would leave those controversies. I would turn my mind to what is more within its competence, and has been more my study, (though, for a man of the world, I have thought of those things,)--I mean, the moral, civil, and political good of the countries we belong to, and in which God has appointed your station and mine. Let every man be as pious as he pleases, and in the way that he pleases; but it is agreeable neither to piety nor to policy to give exclusively all manner of civil privileges and advantages to a negative religion, (such is the Protestant without a certain creed,) {{and at the same time}} to deny those privileges to men whom we know to agree to an iota in every one positive doctrine which all of us who profess the religion authoritatively taught in England hold ourselves, according to our faculties, bound to believe. The Catholics of Ireland (as I have said) have the whole of our positive religion: our difference is only a negation of certain tenets of theirs. If we strip ourselves of that part of Catholicism, we abjure Christianity. If we drive them from that holding, without engaging them in some other positive religion, (which you know by our qualifying laws we do not,) what do we better than to hold out to them terrors on the one side, and bounties on the other, in favor of that which, for anything we know to the contrary, may be pure atheism? ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. “Are {{you getting}} {{what you pay}} for? ” This Total Cost of Ownership model calculates the {{multiple}} variables that determine total cost. By using the tool when sourcing a requirement, the supply professional takes steps to mitigate risks that translate into increased cost. The tool applies weighted values to such elements as price, logistics, quality, risk, maintenance and repairs, and administrative and financing factors to determine a “total cost ” for the requirement. The tool provides a format to calculate the factors used in a Total Cost of Ownership decision. The weighted cost factors consider the importance and degree of risk involved in the purchase. Individuals should understand their own organization’s needs to define the amount of weight (risk) assigned to each variable. This model is also intended to inspire thought on how your organization can add/subtract elements to determine <b>your</b> own <b>Total</b> Cost of Ownership model. Introduction. For the Supply Chain profession, today’s roles and expectations are different when compared to past years. In the past, Purchasing personnel performed a relatively clerical role in an organization. Sourcing decisions were made by comparing {{not much more than}} the “unit price ” of the required product or service. As long as the lowest price was chosen...|$|R
