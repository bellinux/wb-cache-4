You will have a native shikari in the tree with you to point out the tiger, for it is twenty to one against your making him out for yourselves.

6000|$|In {{a minute}} or two the bow of the boat arrived {{at the end of the}} screen of bushes, and a low exclamation broke from the {{lieutenant}} and Harry simultaneously; they were looking out on to an almost circular pool some two hundred yards in diameter. In the center were moored six prahus. Two of them lay broadside on to the creek, the other four were in a line behind these, and it seemed that their broadsides were directed to the opposite side of the pool, for the other two boats were in the way of their firing at the creek. They were long, low vessels, rowing some twenty oars on each side. Each carried a number of small brass guns, and they were evidently full of men, for numbers could be seen on deck, and boats were passing to and fro between them and a small village at the edge of the pool. Having taken in all the details of the scene, the lieutenant passed the word for the mate to leave his own boat and join him. When he did so, he whispered to him: [...] "I thought it was as well that you should have a view of these fellows' position too, Morrison, as it would be of use to you if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> boat in to attack them." ...|$|E

When questioned after the game, he said, [...] "Even when you can't see the ball <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> stab it, I couldn't see {{the ball in the}} sun."
