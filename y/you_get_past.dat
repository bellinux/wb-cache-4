500|$|... "The List" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The List" [...] a B+, describing it as [...] "standard but well executed". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, had {{mixed feelings about}} it, ultimately rating it a B-. He felt that [...] "The List" [...] embodied a bland stand-alone X-Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script, with [...] "attempts at drama" [...] that had no depth, and [...] "sideplots [...] have so {{little effect on the}} main narrative as to be basically padding". Handlen however praised the cinematography and art direction, the performances of both Ken Foree and J.T. Walsh, and the final scene, but ultimately considered that [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the set-design and cinematography, you end up with some good lines and a few scary moments, and that's it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a two and {{half out of}} four stars saying, [...] "Who knew that the franchise's creators would {{eventually}} find a plot twist that made sense? Who knew they'd realize that Tobin Bell's righteous killer had current-events value? Given our cable-news climate, it's not beyond imagining that John Kramer could have his own populist TV show: 'Jigsaw's Death Panel'?". [...] Blake French of AMC Filmcritic gave the film {{three and a half}} out of five, writing, [...] "Director Kevin Greutert hasn't helmed a lot of films in the past, but he did edit all of the previous Saws. As it turns out, his mastered craft lends well to directing. He spins a taut, tight, concise web of terror and surprise. The best entry in the series since Saw II." [...] Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting gave the film seven out of ten and wrote [...] "Saw VI is faithful to the franchise and the twist/finale are 100% satisfying. Saw fans will walk out of the theater with their fists in the air with the feeling that they've reclaimed their beloved franchise." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle gave the film one and half out of five stars, saying [...] "Enshrouding the whole gooey mess in the already blood-spattered surgical garb of the ongoing health care debate is a crafty move on the screenwriters' part, but once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> that pseudo-ironic touch, this Saw is no more or less disturbing than any other in the series".|$|E
2500|$|Anime website GoBoiano listed [...] "Sharp Shooter Sinon" [...] {{as one of}} the {{positive}} aspects of Sword Art Online II, noting her intelligence and strength, as well as Kirito not knowing her outside of gaming allowing the two to bond in a way different to the other girls in the franchise. She also made a list of their [...] "14 Anime Marksmen That You Can't Hide From", where she ranked 14th, as well as the [...] "15 Anime Characters You Wish You Could Waifu", with author Aaron Magulick adding [...] "Sinon is calm and cool, but she'll snipe you right in the heart. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> her cold exterior, you'll find a loving person that'll protect you from afar. Which works when you're stuck in a gun-based mmo." [...] A Newtype character poll had Sinon placed first in female characters, notably edging out fellow Sword Art Online character Asuna. In a fan contest where respondents chose between 41 options for the next Sword Art Online figurine, Sinon placed fourth (Gun Gale Online version) and ninth (ALfheim Online version).|$|E
5000|$|Jay Reese {{reviewed}} Starweb in The Space Gamer No. 11. Reese {{concluded that}} [...] "If <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the early errors and discouragement, {{you will find}} that Starweb can be a fascinating game." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{a score of}} 65% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 146 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. The critical consensus states the film is a: [...] "A fun and stylish thriller if <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the contrivances.." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the only}} way for <b>you</b> to <b>get</b> <b>past.</b> Stand still. Nonsense--you are not too heavy! I'd carry you all four together. Now, Marian, attend," [...] he continued, [...] "and put your arms round my shoulders, so. Now! Hold on. That's well done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the janitor?" [...] I asked. For it {{was late}} at night, and my room at college is three flights up the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|Bessie {{became evident}} {{at the back}} of Mr. Polly's chair, {{struggling}} wildly to get past. Mr. Polly did his best to be helpful. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past?</b> Lemme sit forward a bit. Urr-oo! Right O." ...|$|E
60|$|But, however, I don't {{mention that}} as either {{for or against}} Mr. Pupkin. That sort of thing is merely the A B C of banking, as he himself told me when {{explaining}} why {{it was that he}} hesitated to divulge the exact standing of the Mariposa Carriage Company. Of course, once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the A B C you can learn a lot that is mighty interesting.|$|E
5000|$|However, Luke Hopewell from Gizmodo Australia {{wrote in}} reply: [...] "Yes it's heavy, but it's {{something}} <b>you</b> <b>get</b> used to. Sam {{said that the}} phone is too heavy to even contemplate living with, and that's almost true. If <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> {{the weight of the}} device, you're in for a treat. The weight is almost beneficial when it comes to taking photos, to be honest. It makes it easier to stabilise." ...|$|R
500|$|Also {{among the}} more {{positive}} reviews was Movie Freaks 365s Kyle Bell: [...] "Good ol' Roger gave it his best.... Whether <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the absurdity of the storyline, you can't really deny that it has stunning stunt work and lots of action. It's an entertaining movie {{that could have been}} better." ...|$|R
5000|$|Thedude35 from Bitch Stole My Remote gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was solid [...] "...if <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the amazing, game-changing stupidity shown by a main character" [...] meaning Elena's {{decision}} not to kill the traveler who was making the ritual and instead she run away.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kaffir {{sure to be}} here," [...] he said, [...] "but me and my men can creep through; but we {{must not}} call to you, incos; the Kaffirs would hear us and be on the watch. Safest plan {{for us to go}} through first, not go along paths, but through bush; then for you to gallop {{straight}} through; even if they close to path, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> before they time to stop you. I think that best way." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song {{received}} {{a considerable amount}} of airplay during the summer of 1978, prompting critic Robert Christgau to say, [...] "Hear David Jenkins sing 'once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the pain' fifty times in a day and the pain will be permanent", referring to the lyrics of the chorus.|$|E
5000|$|Daniels {{has been}} {{described}} as a pessimist. In 2010, Daniel Hannan wrote that Dalrymples work [...] "takes pessimism about human nature to a new level. Yet its tone is never patronising, shrill or hectoring. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the initial shock of reading about battered wives, petty crooks and junkies from a non-Left perspective, you find humanity and pathos".|$|E
6000|$|... "This way {{is blocked}} for the present, sir," [...] {{he said to}} Sabatini. [...] "If <b>you</b> want to <b>get</b> <b>past,</b> <b>you</b> had better {{take one of the}} {{turnings}} to the left." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{a mind to}} let you attempt it. If the {{soldiers}} don't arrive before morning, and Billings' crowd are coming through the old shaft as you say, we must have help soon, or give up the fight. There is a chance <b>you</b> will <b>get</b> <b>past</b> all right, and I'm certain we can expect no one to come unless we say {{it is impossible to}} hold out longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Even {{with our}} old games, you {{always had the}} first level, second level, third level, and so on. ALIEN HIGHWAY, the remix of HIGHWAY ENCOUNTER started us {{thinking}} that way, and with REVOLUTION I think {{the changes in the}} puzzle and landscapes are the main attraction. If someone picks up the game and can't <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the first level, then the game can be played on level one and the player still gets thirty new puzzles so you can still enjoy it, even if <b>you</b> never <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the first level!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{compared}} Ozark {{positively to}} Breaking Bad, {{both of which}} involve a seemingly normal protagonist suddenly immersed {{in a world of}} crime. According to Film Daily, [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the surface similarities, Ozark shines as something special and inventive, an intense crime opera where the scenery is as much the star as anyone in the cast." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dance Moms {{received}} heavy criticism {{upon its}} premiere in 2011. On Metacritic, {{the first season}} holds a score of 54 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews". Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the reality-TV grabbers, you realize that while there is some of that, more importantly there's a lot of Miller. It is great to watch her work. Linda Stasi ...|$|E
5000|$|Review {{aggregation}} website Rotten Tomatoes {{gives the}} film {{a score of}} 58% based on reviews from 146 critics. [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the anachronism," [...] according to the site, [...] "A Knight's Tale becomes a predictable, if spirited, Rocky on horseback." [...] On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 54 out of 100, sampled from 32 reviews, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews".|$|E
5000|$|In The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, {{academic}} Peter Dendle wrote, [...] "Good '50s fun abounds, {{with all}} the twisted gender ideology and antiseptic social ideals that that implies, packed in a tightly-wrought action film with strong (if entertainingly dated) conceptual support". [...] David Maine of PopMatters rated it 6 out of 10 stars and called it [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable, noir-ish SF chiller, if <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the dingbat wife and cutie-pie kid".|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} count five," [...] {{continued}} Julius, [...] "and I guess, if <b>you</b> let me <b>get</b> <b>past</b> four, <b>you</b> needn't worry any about Mr. Brown. Maybe he'll send some flowers to the funeral, but YOU won't smell them! Are you ready? I'll begin. One--two three--four----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Like as not <b>you</b> will be <b>getting</b> <b>past</b> your dancing days by {{the time}} that comes off, Nellie. I hope that, years before then, I shall have danced at your wedding--that is to say," [...] he said, imitating her, [...] "if you will send me an invitation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the SNES version, {{a critic}} for Next Generation found the {{gameplay}} {{to be too}} complicated, concluding that [...] "It's not bad really, but the idea isn't that intuitive, and once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the learning curve it lacks the addictive quality this kind of game needs." [...] GamePros The Axe Grinder similarly said that, while the game is fun and has good graphics and music, it lacks the addictive pull that an action puzzler needs to distinguish itself.|$|E
5000|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{was less}} enthusiastic, saying [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the sheer gall of Funny or Die putting {{together}} a 50-minute send-up of Donald Trump—starring a near-unrecognizable Johnny Depp, no less—the kick of Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie begins to quickly yield diminishing returns. For those shaking their heads in disbelief over the mogul/reality TV star's new-found career in politics, however, just soaking in Depp's mannerisms and dead-on impersonation, along with the various celebrity cameos, will probably be compensation enough." ...|$|E
5000|$|DVD Verdict {{stated that}} the film [...] "13 Eerie is a respectable entry into the zombie genre. If you find this one in the {{discount}} bin, snatch it up". DVD Talk stated that [...] "An unusual setup isn't enough to save 13 Eerie from falling into the pit of clichés created by its zombie and slasher forefathers. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the idea of watching something truly novel and settle in for another helping of the usual, you'll find a competently staged and acted production." ...|$|E
5000|$|You have to {{go through}} many hoops just to talk to a major celebrity. <b>You</b> have to <b>get</b> <b>past</b> three {{different}} sets of publicists: the publicist for the event, the publicist for the movie, and then the celebrity's personal publicist. They all have to approve you. Michael Musto ...|$|R
5000|$|Bill Gibron of DVD Talk, also {{awarding}} {{three stars}} out of five, considers the script [...] "silly" [...] and the film's atmosphere [...] "often wasted" [...] but praises {{the performances of}} Michael Gough and Candace Glendenning. He comments: [...] "... if <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the endless conversations, the lack of real suspense, the flawed feeling of familiarity and the dearth of any or all plot twists toward the end ... then - by all means - saddle up and strap in".|$|R
5000|$|John Fallon of Arrow in the Head {{called it}} [...] "a taut, clever thriller, {{directed}} with kinetic style and energy" [...] and [...] "one {{of the more}} entertaining serial killer movies on the block." [...] Fallon added, [...] "If <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the similarities with Seven, you will surely enjoy this razor sharp, nasty flick." [...] Chuck O'Leary of FulvueDrive-in.com said the film is [...] "a blatant rip-off of Seven, but pretty scary and unsettling in its own right." ...|$|R
5000|$|Maxim {{gave it a}} {{score of}} eight out of ten and said, [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> all the gamesmanship, you can {{concentrate}} on bitch-slapping Mother Nature by creating twisted beasts that would make Jack Hanna brown his khakis." [...] However, The Cincinnati Enquirer gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five and said that its gameplay [...] "doesn't match the title's ingenious premise." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave it a C, saying, [...] "If most real-time strategy titles are elaborate versions of rock-paper-scissors, Impossible Creatures is the world's most sophisticated game of rock." ...|$|E
5000|$|Slide To Play wrote [...] "Dice Soccer {{will have}} you rolling dice and cheering on {{cartoons}} at all hours, but a few glitches and a slow pace hold it back from being great." [...] Gamezebo said [...] "With a bunch of different unlockables (players and vanity items like jerseys) and different leagues of varying difficulties, not to mention tournaments, Dice Soccer really does offer a decent amount of content. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the goofy idea and put some time in, the game opens up and really presents a nice experience. [...] " ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, Dead or Alive 3 {{received}} mostly {{very positive}} reviews. In Japan, Famitsu scored the game a 37 out of 40. IGN {{stated that it}} [...] "represents the new standard of excellence that only the Xbox can deliver," [...] praising the game for its great attention to detail and its vast improvements on its predecessor. On the other hand, GameSpot's Greg Kasavin opined that [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> its graphics, you'll find that Dead or Alive 3 doesn't offer much of anything that hasn't been done in other 3D fighting games." ...|$|E
6000|$|She goes to {{the window}} and calls to the married couple. Captain Dering, in khaki, is a fine soldierly figure. Barbara, in her Red Gross uniform, is quiet and resourceful. An artful old boy greets them. 'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; <b>you</b> don't <b>get</b> <b>past</b> an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man.' He kisses Barbara and looks at his wife to make sure that she is admiring him, 'And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.' ...|$|R

50|$|Souvenirs from Niijima {{include the}} island {{specialty}} kusaya - a dried fish, usually mackerel scad (Decapterus macarellus), {{that has been}} soaked in a special brine. Kusaya, which means smells bad in Japanese, has an odor that is indeed 'quite' distinct. The village museum has a video on the making of kusaya. If <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the smell, <b>you</b> will be rewarded with a rich, delicious meal. Other souvenirs are milk senbei, the ashitaba plant, Niijima glass art, and a local Shōchū called Shima Jiman, island pride.|$|R
