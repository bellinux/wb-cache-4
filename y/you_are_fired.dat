2500|$|As {{part of the}} 2006 restoration, the Tower Bar was reconfigured {{to have a more}} turn of {{the century}} ambience. [...] After the Tower Bar opened in 2006, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that it had become one of the trendiest in Los Angeles: [...] "On a recent night at the intimate Tower Bar, Jennifer Aniston dines 10 feet away from Joaquin Phoenix and white-coated waiters weave between tables like players in a Broadway musical. A $155 bottle of Pinot Noir is uncorked here, chilled oysters delivered there and a bow given every now and then." [...] The New York Times also reported on the transformation of the hotel: [...] "The striped silk-and-walnut Tower Bar restaurant is already a retro clubhouse for the mature Hollywood set (think Brian Grazer and Barbara Walters), complete with $13 martinis and the octogenarian former Sinatra pianist Page Cavanaugh tickling the ivories. On a Friday night in mid-December, Anjelica Huston and Courtney Love swanned by to dine with a 30-something crowd far more sophisticated than the teenyboppers roaming Sunset Boulevard outside." [...] Other celebrities visiting the Tower Bar include Sean Penn, Victoria Beckham, Tom Cruise and Jennifer Lopez. [...] Dmitri Dmitrov, a 60-year-old Macedonian immigrant with Rudolph Valentino hair, is the Tower Bar's maître d’hôtel. [...] Dmitrov is a sphinxlike figure who knows everything and says nothing. [...] In the six years since Klein, following a suggestion from the designer Tom Ford, rescued Dmitrov from a fading career at drearily elegant places like a local Russian restaurant that featured a harpist, ice swans and a caviar menu, he has become a Hollywood institution. [...] In February 2007, the New York Post reported that the hotel's front desk manager was nearly fired when Lindsay Lohan tried to book three rooms. [...] Owner Jeff Klein was reportedly overheard yelling at the manager, [...] "If that piece of trailer trash so much as enters my driveway, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>fired.</b> She can't come here with all my chic guests, she'll ruin the place." [...] Also in 2007, Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs showed up with an entourage to attend a Golden Globes party, and was told his name was not on the list. When Combs was reported to have become [...] "verbally abusive," [...] owner Jeff Klein personally asked Combs to leave. [...] When Klein said he would call the police if Combs did not leave, the New York Post reported that Combs was heard shouting, [...] "Just try it - I'll {{spend the rest of my}} life hunting you down!"
