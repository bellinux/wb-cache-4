500|$|Percussionist Shawn Crahan {{said the}} band {{made an effort}} to pay more {{attention}} to detail than usual during the tour, noting, [...] "when you've got a microphone hanging onto <b>your</b> <b>every</b> note, you tend to give maybe 115 percent instead of 110 percent". The album begins with a staged vocal introduction which was recorded before a concert, informing the audience that the band would not be performing, in an effort to incite anger in the crowd. 9.0: Live includes tracks from the band's first three studio albums, and the banned track [...] "Purity" [...] which was removed from the band's debut album, Slipknot, due to copyright issues. It also contains tracks that are rarely played live, such as [...] "Iowa" [...] and [...] "Get This", as well as the only live performance of [...] "Skin Ticket".|$|E
500|$|... 1000 Forms of Fear is {{primarily}} an electropop album, with influences of hip hop and reggae. It opens with [...] "Chandelier", an electropop song {{that features a}} reggae-influenced beat. Lyrically, the track talks about [...] "the glitter and fatigue of a party girl's life." [...] The follow-up, [...] "Big Girls Cry", was compared to Alanis Morissette's [...] "Hands Clean". On [...] "Burn the Pages", Sia described a friend she wants to cheer up: [...] "You're twisted up like a slipknot / Tied by a juicehead who just took his T-shot." [...] "Eye of the Needle" [...] is a [...] "military-march" [...] piano ballad, while [...] "Hostage" [...] is a new wave pop and ska track that features Sia's voice [...] "cracking like a punk singer." [...] The sixth song, [...] "Straight for the Knife", is instrumented by strings and lyrically details a tempestuous relationship: [...] "But will someone find me swinging from the rafters / I’m hanging on <b>your</b> <b>every</b> word." ...|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, this is truly among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in <b>your</b> <b>every</b> dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
