6000|$|MISS D. Never mind that! You can't mend it. Help me {{with this}} hateful bodice, I've run the string so, and I've run the string so, and I can't make the fulness come right. Where would <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this?</b> (Waves lilies of the valley.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} have at length spoken,' she said, 'though I owe it is more coldly than I expected. MISS Lilias! DEIGN to take {{interest}}! In whom, dear Darsie, CAN I take interest but in you; and why do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> barrier of ceremony betwixt us, whom adverse circumstances have already separated for such a length of time?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're {{having a}} clear out," [...] said Cossar, [...] "If they don't set {{the place on}} fire they'll come here. Troops may not be here for an hour yet. Fifty per cent. Hooligans in the crowd, and the more {{furnished}} flats {{they go into the}} better they'll like it. Obviously.... They mean a clear out. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> skirt and bonnet on, Bensington, and clear out with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that, Constance; but <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>this</b> idea {{of going}} to London out of your head. I cannot consent to it--I shall never consent to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>YOU</b> who've <b>put</b> <b>this</b> {{into her}} head!" [...] she exclaimed, in a ferment of horror. [...] "She'd {{never thought of}} it herself. You've made her do it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The captain wants <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> on," [...] {{explained}} young Powell, and as {{she raised}} herself in her seat he dropped it on her shoulders. She wrapped herself up closely.|$|R
6000|$|But {{it was to}} T. Cholmondeley Frink that Babbitt {{most often}} turned. He caught Frink at the club every noon, and demanded, while Frink looked hunted and evasive, [...] "Say, Chum--you're a shark on this writing stuff--how would <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> sentence, see here in my manuscript--manuscript now where the deuce is that?--oh, yes, here. Would you say 'We ought not also to alone think?' or 'We ought also not to think alone?' or--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bessie's {{much the}} same, Miss Lesley," [...] she said, {{in answer to}} Marian's inquiry. [...] "The doctor you sent was here today and did all he could for her. He seemed quite hopeful. She don't {{complain}} or nothing--just lies there and moans. Sometimes she gets restless. It's {{very kind of you}} to come so often, Miss Lesley. Here, Magdalen, will <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> basket the lady's brought up there on the shelf?" ...|$|E
60|$|This Proclamation {{rendered}} Mr Inspector additionally studious, {{and caused}} him to stand meditating on river-stairs and causeways, and to go lurking about in boats, putting this and that together. But, according to the success with which <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> and that together, you get {{a woman and a}} fish apart, or a Mermaid in combination. And Mr Inspector could turn out nothing better than a Mermaid, which no Judge and Jury would believe in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doctor," [...] she said, [...] "I don't want <b>you</b> to <b>put</b> <b>this</b> {{visit in}} the family bill. I wish to--to attend to it myself. How much should I pay you?" [...] and she took out her little pocketbook.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{hope to see}} it for myself, for <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>this</b> {{notion of}} going to London out of your head. I am sure Miss Ray did not give the invitationâ€”-no, nor second it. Did she, Janet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you'll {{cool down}} and wait a little, Link, I'll {{tell you all}} about it. I'm sick as a horse. I guess I'll go home. <b>You</b> can <b>put</b> <b>this</b> up in the window and go home, too, if you want to." ...|$|R
60|$|MINNIE (turning, {{with the}} test tube in her hand). Now, what a {{question}} to ask, Dr. Jonathan! Was there ever a morning or afternoon that somebody didn't stray in here with their troubles? (Fiercely.) They don't think a scientist has a real job,--they don't understand, if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> across--(she holds up the test tube)--you'll {{save the lives of}} thousands of soldiers, and a few ordinary folks, too, I guess. But you won't let me tell anyone.|$|E
6000|$|But Mr. Ruskin proceeds, [...] "And our {{business}} as such." [...] Our business as such! Well, {{if we have}} in any satisfactory manner proved our first point--that is, the authority with which we act--we may fairly say to Mr. Ruskin, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> question, 'What is y{{our business}}?' to your lawyer or doctor?" [...] Does he ask the same question of the clergy of any other portion of the Catholic Church? We shall not wish to insult Mr. Ruskin by attempting {{to explain to him}} the duties of the priesthood, with which, doubtless, he is well acquainted.|$|E
6000|$|While thus conversing, Waverley {{heard in}} the court, before {{the windows of the}} parlour, a {{well-known}} voice. 'I aver to you, my worthy friend,' said the speaker, 'that it is a total dereliction of military discipline; and were you not as it were a tyro, your purpose would deserve strong reprobation. For a prisoner of war is on no account to be coerced with fetters, or debinded in ergastulo, as would have been the case had <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> gentleman into the pit of the peel-house at Balmawhapple. I grant, indeed, that such a prisoner may for security be coerced in carcere, that is, in a public prison.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The Game said Jackson {{started the}} {{conversation}} {{by talking about}} music and complimenting him on his records like [...] "Hate It or Love It" [...] and [...] "How We Do" [...] and, [...] " [...] said, 'I don't know how you're gonna feel about this, but I {{want to ask you}} something. I don't want you to judge me, but I don't really know everything that's going on between you and 50 [...] But I want to be the middleman behind <b>you</b> <b>putting</b> <b>this</b> situation to bed." [...] Jackson had wanted the two to meet, with him serving as a mediator, though according to Game, [...] "It never manifested." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only here, {{to please}} his mother. My dear, <b>you</b> must <b>put</b> <b>this</b> {{out of your}} head. Even if he were very different, we should never let you marry a first cousin, and he knows it. It was very wrong in him to have spoken to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, old rats then! D'ye think I don't {{know this}} shebang? Look here, Johnny, what are <b>you</b> <b>putting</b> on all <b>this</b> side for, eh? What's your little game? Where's Tappington?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Winton was staggered. With {{a glance}} at Gyp's {{vanishing}} figure, he said curtly to Markey, [...] "Where have <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> gentleman?" [...] But {{the use of the}} word [...] "this" [...] was the only trace he showed of his emotions. In that little journey across the hall he entertained many extravagant thoughts. Arrived at the study, he inclined his head courteously enough, waiting for Fiorsen to speak. The [...] "fiddler," [...] still in his fur-lined coat, was twisting a squash hat in his hands. In his own peculiar style he was impressive. But why couldn't he look you in the face; or, if he did, why did he seem about to eat you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, it {{all comes}} to the same thing." [...] He then became quite serious. [...] "Now, Captain, I would suggest that <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> whole matter as you see it, {{together}} with your recommendations, into the briefest, most telling form possible, {{and be ready to}} come before the committee to-morrow. Confer with the commissioner and be ready to meet the queries of the opposition. Brisbane is behind the cattlemen in this controversy, and he is a strong man. I agree entirely with you and Lawson that the Tetongs should remain where they are and be helped in the way you suggest. Be ready with computations of the cost of satisfying claims of the settlers, building ditches, etc. Come and see me again before you return. Good-morning," [...] and he bent to his desk with instant absorption.|$|E
60|$|You have {{probably}} observed that your baby-sister {{wants to do}} {{all sorts of things}} that your mother and her nurse want her not to do--to stand up at sitting-down time, and to sit down at stand-up time, for instance, or to wake up when she should fall asleep, or to crawl on the floor when she is wearing her best frock, and so on, and perhaps <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> down to naughtiness. But it is not; it simply means that she is doing as she has seen the fairies do; she begins by following their ways, and it takes about two years to get her into the human ways. Her fits of passion, which are awful to behold, and are usually called teething, are no such thing; they are her natural exasperation, because we don't understand her, though she is talking an intelligible language. She is talking fairy. The reason mothers and nurses know what her remarks mean, before other people know, as that 'Guch' means 'Give it to me at once,' while 'Wa' is 'Why do you wear such a funny hat?' is because, mixing so much with babies, they have picked up a little of the fairy language.|$|E

6000|$|... "MY DEAR BOY:" [...] (This opening {{seemed a}} little [...] curious to me, for I did not suppose the old [...] gentleman thought of me in that way.) [...] "I shall not [...] {{be able to see}} you again before you leave for [...] Willisville, so I write this note just to tell you [...] how entirely I am {{satisfied}} with the way in which [...] you performed the very difficult business I [...] intrusted to you--that of taking charge of my son [...] in his recent travels. The trip was not a very [...] long one, but I am sure it has been of great [...] service to him; and I also believe that a great [...] deal of the benefit he has received has been due [...] to you." [...] (I stopped here, and tried to think what [...] I had done for the boy. Besides the thrashing I [...] gave him in Nassau, I could not think of [...] anything.) [...] "I have been talking a great deal with [...] Sammy, in the last day or two, about his doings [...] while he was away, and although I cannot exactly [...] fix my mind on any particular action, on your [...] part, which proves what I say" [...] (he was in the same [...] predicament here in which I was myself), [...] "yet I [...] feel positively assured that your companionship [...] and influence have been of the greatest service to [...] him. Among other things, he really wants to go to [...] college. I am delighted at this. It was with much [...] sorrow that I gave up the idea of making him a [...] scholar: but, though he was a good boy, I saw that [...] it was useless to keep him at the academy at [...] Willisville, and so made up my mind to take him [...] into my office. But I know <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> college [...] idea into his head, though how, I cannot say, and [...] I am sure that it does not matter. Sammy tells me [...] that you never understood that he was to be [...] entirely in your charge; but since you brought him [...] out so well without knowing this, it does you more [...] credit. I am very grateful to you. If I find a [...] chance to do you a real service, I will do it.|$|E
60|$|There {{was once}} upon a time a poor boy who had neither father nor mother. In order to gain a living he looked after the sheep of a great Lord. Day and night he spent out in the open fields, and only when it was very wet and stormy did he take refuge in a little hut {{on the edge of a}} big forest. Now one night, when he was sitting on the grass beside his flocks, he heard not very far from him the sound as of some one crying. He rose up and {{followed}} the direction of the noise. To his dismay and astonishment he found a Giant lying at the entrance of the wood; he was about to run off as fast as his legs could carry him, when the Giant called out: 'Don't be afraid, I won't harm you. On the contrary, I will reward you handsomely if you will bind up my foot. I hurt it when I was trying to root up an oak-tree.' The Herd-boy took off his shirt, and bound up the Giant's wounded foot with it. Then the Giant rose up and said, 'Now come and I will reward you. We are going to celebrate a marriage to-day, and I promise you we shall have plenty of fun. Come and enjoy yourself, but in order that my brothers mayn't see <b>you,</b> <b>put</b> <b>this</b> band round your waist and then you'll be invisible.' With these words he handed the Herd-boy a belt, and walking on in front he led him to a fountain where hundreds of Giants and Giantesses were assembled preparing to hold a wedding. They danced and played different games till midnight; then one of the Giants tore up a plant by its roots, and all the Giants and Giantesses made themselves so thin that they disappeared into the earth through the hole made by the uprooting of the plant. The wounded Giant remained behind to the last and called out, 'Herd-boy, where are you?' 'Here I am, close to you,' was the reply. 'Touch me,' said the Giant, 'so that you too may come with us under ground.' The Herd-boy did as he was told, and before he could have believed it possible he found himself in a big hall, where even the walls were made of pure gold. Then to his astonishment he saw that the hall was furnished with the tables and chairs that belonged to his master. In a few minutes the company began to eat and drink.|$|E
5000|$|The {{emotion and}} anger showcased {{on the album}} has been admired by {{a large part of}} the hip-hop community, {{including}} other rappers.

6000|$|... "In {{my opinion}} <b>you</b> should <b>put</b> <b>this</b> Master Freshwater under arrest on the spot; send him below under {{the charge of}} a sentinel, and {{transfer}} the command of the cutter to me.

6000|$|... "But now {{you have}} met me," [...] he persisted, [...] "why shouldn't I spare you the journey? I could write and tell <b>you</b> every thing--without <b>putting</b> <b>you</b> to <b>this</b> fatigue and expense." ...|$|R

5000|$|Regarding the song, McGraw told Great American Country, [...] "I hope itâ€™s {{a record}} that you can put on and just sort of melt into. And thatâ€™s what the purpose was for it.
