500|$|On {{the other}} side, some look upon kings as {{answerable}} for every mistake or omission in government, and bound {{to comply with}} the most unreasonable demands of an unquiet faction; which was the case of those who persecuted the blessed Martyr of this day from his throne to the scaffold. Between these two extremes, it is easy, from what hath been said, to choose a middle; to be good and loyal subjects, yet, according to your power, faithful assertors of <b>your</b> <b>religion</b> and liberties; to avoid all broachers and preachers of newfangled doctrines in the Church; to be strict observers of the laws, which cannot be justly taken from you without your own consent: In short, 'to obey God and the King, and meddle not with those who are given to change.' ...|$|E

Calafia and Amadis trade blows until he disarms her and knocks her helmet off. Both Calafia and Radario {{surrender}} to the Christians. While being held prisoner, Calafia acknowledges the astonishing beauty of Leonorina, daughter of the Constantinople emperor and the intended bride of Esplandián, and resolves not to interfere with their union. She accepts Christianity as the one true faith, saying, [...] "I have seen the ordered order of <b>your</b> <b>religion,</b> and the great disorder of all others, I have seen that {{it is clear that}} the law which you follow must be the truth, while that which we follow is lying and falsehood." [...] She marries Talanque, a large and handsome knight who fought with her outside the city gate; similarly, her sister Liota marries Maneli, Talanque's companion in arms. The women return to California with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes, as a Christian nation.|$|E
500|$|In 632, {{at the end}} of {{the tenth}} year after {{migration}} to Medina, Muhammad completed his first true Islamic pilgrimage, setting precedence for the annual Great Pilgrimage, known as Hajj. [...] On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah Muhammad delivered his Farewell Sermon, at Mount Arafat east of Mecca. In this sermon, Muhammad advised his followers not to follow certain pre-Islamic customs. For instance, he said a white has no superiority over a black, nor a black has any superiority over a white except by piety and good action. He abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system and asked for old pledges to be returned as implications of the creation of the new Islamic community. Commenting on the vulnerability of women in his society, Muhammad asked his male followers to [...] "be good to women, for they are powerless captives (awan) in your households. You took them in God's trust, and legitimated your sexual relations with the Word of God, so come to your senses people, and hear my words ..." [...] He told them that they were entitled to discipline their wives but should do so with kindness. He addressed the issue of inheritance by forbidding false claims of paternity or of a client relationship to the deceased and forbade his followers to leave their wealth to a testamentary heir. He also upheld the sacredness of four lunar months in each year. According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: [...] "Today I have perfected <b>your</b> <b>religion,</b> and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" [...] (Quran [...] ). According to Shia tafsir, it refers to the appointment of Ali ibn Abi Talib at the pond of Khumm as Muhammad's successor, this occurring a few days later when Muslims were returning from Mecca to Medina.|$|E

His increasing employment of Hindus and Shia Muslims was deemed controversial at the time, with several of his fellow Sunni Muslim officials petitioning against it, which he rejected, and responded, [...] "What connection have earthly affairs with religion? And what right have administrative works to meddle with bigotry? 'For you is <b>your</b> <b>religion</b> and for me is mine.'" [...] He insisted on employment based on ability rather than religion.|$|E

2500|$|The September 11 {{attacks on}} the United States, and various other acts of Islamic {{terrorism}} over the 21st century, have resulted in many non-Muslims' indictment of Islam as a violent religion. In particular, the Qur'an's teachings on matters {{of war and peace}} have become topics of heated discussion in recent years. On the one hand, some critics claim that certain verses of the Qur'an sanction military action against unbelievers as a whole both during the lifetime of Muhammad and after. The Qur'an says, [...] "Fight in the name of <b>your</b> <b>religion</b> with those who fight against you." [...] On the other hand, other scholars argue that such verses of the Qur'an are interpreted out of context, and argue that when the verses are read in context it clearly appears that the Qur'an prohibits aggression, and allows fighting only in self-defense.|$|E
2500|$|Muawiyah I is a reviled {{figure in}} Shia Islam for several reasons. Firstly, {{because of his}} {{involvement}} in the Battle of Siffin against Ali ibn Abi Talib, whom the Shia Muslims believe was Muhammad's true successor; secondly, for the breaking of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali, after the death of Hasan ibn Ali, one of broken terms being appointing his son Yazid as his successor; thirdly, because they believe that he is responsible for the killing of Hasan ibn Ali by bribing his wife Ja'dah binte Ash'as to poison him whereas the Sunni texts do not say that his wife killed him; and fourthly because some Shia think that he distorted their interpretation of Islam to match his rule; whereas the Sunnis do not say that he distorted Islam, as he was a political leader at a certain time in history to whom Hassan and Hussein also gave their allegiance, whereas they say that Islam is based on the Quran and the teaching of Muhammad and its main center of learning was in Madina not in Syria and they say that Islam was completed at the time of Muhammad and use the verses [...] "This day I have perfected for you <b>your</b> <b>religion</b> and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion" [...] Quran 5:5. [...] "Indeed, it is I who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, I will be its guardian." [...] The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 15, Verse 9.
