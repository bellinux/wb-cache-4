500|$|The {{sources of}} dangers to the mills {{was not always}} clear. In June 1864, Enoch Steadman's Lawrenceville factory in Georgia inexplicably burned. This company worked {{exclusively}} [...] for Governor Joseph E. Brown, but Georgia quartermaster Ira Foster was forced to keep it under surveillance {{to ensure that the}} state received its goods. One of Steadman's employees [...] that Quartermaster Foster had 'parties watching <b>your</b> <b>concern</b> and he has expressed the belief that you are sneaking and that he says he will have goods or blood' ...|$|E
500|$|Late in September, a British convoy {{consisting}} of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, {{they were in}} urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. Nevertheless, Saumarez met {{with representatives of the}} Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied [...] "Vous avez, sans doute, oublié que des Français sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [...] ne vous regarde pointe. Quant à votre sommation, les soldats français ne sont point habitués à ce style" [...] ("You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of <b>your</b> <b>concern.</b> As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone"). Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siege. Saumarez, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for Gibraltar {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Kerry, you've stated <b>your</b> <b>concern</b> for {{the rising}} cost of health care. Yet you chose the vice presidential {{candidate}} who has made millions of dollars successfully suing medical professionals. How do you reconcile this with the voters? ...|$|E
2500|$|Denouncing the UDA, {{the trial}} judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, [...] "What appears before me today {{under the name}} of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising {{organisation}} of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation". During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court [...] "trial". Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, [...] "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When you heard what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. <b>Your</b> <b>concern</b> was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character."
