[...] Initially published quarterly, it was released in the months of December, March, June, and September. The newspaper was intended to replace a myriad of newsletters from individuals schools and departments in the university. An editorial in the first issue described its initial intended purpose as one that would [...] "keep <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on the 'times' at Pitt" [...] - from the changing face of the campus to the activities of the alumni, from the antics of the students to the deeper emotional involvements of education today." [...] By the 1970s, the University Times was being published bi-weekly, and by 1979, faced controversy when the university planned to end its publication because of [...] "apparent dissatisfaction about controversial stories" [...] when the paper ran articles about faculty disagreements with the administration and an article about a dispute between two deans. A unanimous 42-0 vote from the university faculty assembly requested the university rescind its plan to end the paper. The paper again faced controversy over the alleged censorship of a 1994 story on the first gay wedding to occur in the university's Heinz Memorial Chapel. However, Leon Haley, then publisher of the newspaper, defended the decision in saying that it was [...] "not university policy to write stories about events at Heinz Chapel. These events are personal and private." [...] Ken Hall, one of the men married in the ceremony, also stated that he [...] "didn't want any notoriety or controversy to mar the occasion." ...|$|E

40|$|Interfacial {{phenomena}} {{driven by}} heat or mass transfer are widespread {{in science and}} various branches of engineering. Research in this area has become quite active in recent years, attributable in part, at least, to the entry of physicists and their sophisticated experimental techniques into the field. Until now, however, the field has lacked a readable account of the recent developments. Interfacial Phenomena and Convection remedies this problem by furnishing a self-contained monograph that examines a rich variety of phenomena in which interfaces pay a crucial role. From a unified perspective that embraces physical chemistry, fluid mechanics, and applied mathematics, the authors study recent developments related to the Marangoni effect, including patterned convection and instabilities, oscillatory/wavy phenomena, and turbulent phenomena. They examine Bénard layers subjected to transverse and longitudinal thermal gradients and phenomena involving surface tension gradients as the driving forces, including falling films, drops, and liquid bridges. It {{is only in the}} past two or three decades that researchers have performed suitable, clear-cut experiments involving interfacial phenomena, and the stage is now set for a virtual explosion of the field. Interfacial Phenomena and Convection will bring <b>you</b> quickly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> on the advances realized and prepare you to both use the results and to make further advances. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{authors of}} this Mini-Hot-Topic {{collection}} of review manuscripts have provided an outstanding review of the development and current status of several of our most recently developed agents {{in the fight against}} atrial fibrillation (AF). They have also given the readers a glimpse into the difficulty of drug development and the contrasts that can exist with the same product in different geographies. For their efforts they have my deepest appreciation. It is my hope that these articles will assist {{those of you who are}} clinicians in your care of patients and those of you who are investigators in your appreciation of the drug development process and its hurdles. More specifically, this Mini-Hot-Topic symposium has reviewed for you: (1) the evidence supporting the new novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) as first-line therapy for preven-tion of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with “nonvalvular ” atrial fibrillation (NVAF); (2) the winding path taken by dronedarone in reaching its current place in our antiarrhythmic armamentarium – in which it still has a role; and (3) the contrasting decisions made with respect to the marketing of vernakalant in Europe versus the United States. Now, in this last manuscript of the collection, I will echo for emphasis some of their highlights and I will also bring <b>you</b> further <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with respect <b>to</b> a possible future role for dronedarone, as hinted at by the HARMONY trial...|$|R

40|$|In {{the primary}} care sector, {{diagnosis}} and initial management of orofacial pain are often performed by familydoctors and dentists. Knowledge of {{the different types of}} orofacial pain and headache disorders is therefor of great importance. The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD- 3) provides an overview of the different types of orofacial pain and will be discussed in this lecture. The main focus will be on trigeminal neuralgia and cluster headache and the current research in this field. Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) is defined as a disorder characterized by recurrent, unilateral, brief, electricshock-like pains, abrupt in onset and termination, limited to the distribution of one or more divisions of thetrigeminal nerve and triggered by innocuous stimuli. Unfortunately, most TN is idiopathic, and the aetiology isnot clear. The guidelines on pharmaceutical TN management published by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) recommend carbamazepine (CBZ; 200 – 1200 mg/day) or oxcarbazepine (OXC; 600 – 1800 mg/day) as first-line therapy. Both are antiepileptics with well known interactions with other drugs and safety problems. An overview of the currently available literature on the pharmaceutical management of TN patients is discussed. Cluster headache (CH) {{is one of the most}} painful primary headache disorders. It is characterized by daily or almost daily attacks of unilateral excruciating periorbital pain associated with ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, typically lasting between 15 and 180 minutes if untreated. Cluster headache is caused by the relaesement of neurotransmitters and vasodilators from the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPH). The SPG is a large extracranial parasympathetic ganglion located in the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF). The current treatments for CH attacks are injectable sumatriptan and oxygen inhalation. Both treatments have well known side effects and contraindications. A new technology of electrical stimulation of the SPG using a neurostimulation device is currently being investigated in the VU medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. After this lecture, you will be able to define the different types of orofacial pain and <b>you</b> are <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with the current research in these field...|$|R

When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, {{but on the other hand}} you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this unit}} is to enable you to work {{effectively}} in a computer hardware technical support role. It attempts to provide the underpinning knowledge required to understand the operation of a personal computer system’s hardware at subsystem level. In addition to the underpinning knowledge you will gain experience of installing, configuring, maintaining and fault-finding a range of computer system hardware. This unit is primarily intended for students who expect {{to work in an}} IT support role but would also be interesting and relevant to all students on an IT programme of study requiring a deeper, or more practical, understanding of computer hardware. This unit provides details of the current components and standards, which will inevitably change. Every attempt has been made to be as general as possible and to provide guidelines which will be applicable to forthcoming components. The skills and knowledge gained in this unit should be relevant in the future and give a good opportunity to keep abreast of the rapid changes in computer system hardware. Where possible, your tutor will point out advances in technology at the relevant parts of study and produce ‘inserts’ which can be added to your notes to keep the package <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date.</b> The unit contains internet link so that <b>you</b> can keep <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with the latest advances in hardware technology, in addition to this you may also be given internet links from your Lecturer that you can use <b>to</b> keep <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> with the latest advances. Outcomes There are four learning outcomes for this unit. Outcome 1 covers the majority of the underpinning knowledge and looks at the major subsystems of a modern personal computer. Outcome 2 is mostly practical and involves the installation and configuration of a range of computer system hardware components and peripherals. Outcome 3 is another mostly practical outcome which involves you performing routine maintenance, basic fault-finding and rectification at subsystem level. Outcome 4 looks at safe working practices that should be employed while working on a computer system, and also the identification of risks while working on a computer system. ...|$|R
