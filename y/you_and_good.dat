2500|$|A former brigade staff officer, then {{assigned}} to D Troop of the 10th Cavalry, First Lieutenant Jules Garesche Ord (son of General E.O.C. Ord), arrived and initiated an unusual discussion with his commander, Brigadier General Hamilton S. Hawkins, by asking, [...] "General, {{if you will}} order a charge, I will lead it." [...] Hawkins made no response. Ord again asked [...] "If you {{do not wish to}} order a charge, General, I should like to volunteer. We can't stay here, can we?" [...] "I would not ask any man to volunteer," [...] Hawkins stated. [...] "If you do not forbid it, I will start it," [...] returned Ord. Hawkins again remained silent. Ord finally asked [...] "I only ask you not to refuse permission." [...] Hawkins responded [...] "I will not ask for volunteers, I will not give permission and I will not refuse it," [...] he said.

6000|$|Nelson's heart, too, was at {{this time}} a-shore. [...] "To tell you," [...] he says, writing to Lady Hamilton, [...] "how dreary and uncomfortable the VANGUARD appears, is only telling {{you what it is}} to go from the pleasantest society to a solitary cell, or from the dearest friends to no friends. I am now {{perfectly}} the GREAT MAN--not a creature near me. From my heart I wish myself the little man again. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> Sir William have spoiled me for any place but with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say not so, mistress. I know men-at-arms {{too well}} to credit all they say, and I {{was on my}} way to inquire into the matter and learn the truth when these same Dacres fell on me; and that I lie here is due to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> Master Lambert. Many a woman whose face is ill favoured has learnt to keep up her power by unhallowed arts, and if it be so with her whom in my boyish prank I have marred, Heaven forgive her and me. If I can ever return I shall strive to trace her life or death, without which mayhap I could scarce win my true bride." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{be at all}} put out, miss, by the want of a hospitable {{look from}} Mrs. Snagsby there, because she's under a mistake altogether. She'll find that out sooner than will be {{agreeable}} to a lady of her generally correct manner of forming her thoughts, because I'm a-going {{to explain it to}} her." [...] Here, standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand, himself a pile of wet, he turned to Mrs. Snagsby. [...] "Now, the first thing that I say to you, as a married woman possessing what you may call charms, you know--'Believe Me, if All Those Endearing,' and cetrer--you're well acquainted with the song, because it's in vain for you to tell me that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> society are strangers--charms--attractions, mind you, that ought to give you confidence in yourself--is, that you've done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodnight to <b>you,</b> gentlemen, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> fortune!" [...] Lord Godolphin said. [...] "The lesson has {{not been}} lost, and I shall take good care, in future, {{to have a strong}} escort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have, madam, <b>you</b> have; <b>and</b> I {{shall not}} forget it. Thank <b>you,</b> neighbors, <b>and</b> <b>good</b> night," [...] said the man, {{as he left}} the barn, with the first smile on his face which it had worn for many days.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} father, [...] "I {{will show you}} a Mary, who will protect her <b>and</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> all <b>good</b> children. See how fairly she is represented, with her gown covered with golden stars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain," [...] {{said the}} former, [...] "I am well off, and I am bent upon this business. You may put the {{remuneration}} for your services at whatever figure you like in reason, and {{it shall be}} paid over to you before we start. Moreover, I will arrange {{in the event of}} anything untoward happening to us or to you, that your son shall be suitably provided for. You will see from this offer how necessary I think your presence. Also if by chance we should reach this place, and find diamonds, they shall belong to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>Good</b> equally. I do not want them. But of course that promise is worth nothing at all, though the same thing would apply to any ivory we might get. You may pretty well make your own terms with me, Mr. Quatermain; and of course I shall pay all expenses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cautiously {{skirting}} the fences, they at last {{pulled up a}} few feet from a dark wall. The stranger proceeded to assist them to alight. There was still some light from the reflected snow; and as he handed his fair companions to the ground, each was conscious of undergoing an intense though respectful scrutiny. He assisted them gravely to open the window, and then discreetly retired to the sleigh until the difficult and somewhat discomposing ingress was made. He then walked to the window. [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>good</b> night!" [...] whispered three voices. A single figure still lingered. The stranger leaned over the window sill. [...] "Will you permit me to light my cigar here? It might attract attention if I struck a match outside." [...] By the upspringing light he saw the figure of Kate very charmingly framed in by the window. The match burnt slowly out in his fingers. Kate smiled mischievously. The astute young woman had detected the pitiable subterfuge. For what else did she stand at the head of her class, and had doting parents paid three years' tuition? ...|$|E
