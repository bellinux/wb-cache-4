40|$|Lévy {{processes}} play {{an important}} role in the stochastic process theory. However, since samples are non-i. i. d., statistical learning results based on the i. i. d. scenarios cannot be utilized to study the risk bounds for Lévy processes. In this paper, we present risk bounds for non-i. i. d. samples drawn <b>from</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes in the PAC-learning framework. In particular, by using a concentration inequality for infinitely divisible distributions, we first prove that the function of risk error is Lipschitz continuous with a high probability, and then by using a specific concentration inequality for Lévy processes, we obtain the risk bounds for non-i. i. d. samples drawn <b>from</b> <b>Lévy</b> processes without Gaussian components. Based on the resulted risk bounds, we analyze the factors that affect the convergence of the risk bounds and then prove the convergence. ...|$|R
