6000|$|... "You {{have thrown}} me {{over in the}} most shameful manner," [...] said Charlotte. [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all about my little plan?" ...|$|E
60|$|O'FLAHERTY. She won't {{give him}} any credit for Home Rule, Sir. She says Redmond made him do it. She says <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> so.|$|E
60|$|EDGAR. Speak not so loudly; {{that must}} be your sister. <b>You</b> never <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> then, of what has past Between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of this, I suppose I may {{be allowed}} to see her," [...] he said, {{avoiding}} the direct proposition which Lady Desmond had made to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so you {{are going}} at last to marry our Linda. She is terrible. Ah! now she will {{understand}} better since <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> love her. She will not be so fierce." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ethel! {{what is all}} this? Mary {{has found}} Miss Bracy in floods of tears in the schoolroom, because she says <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she was ill-tempered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{that you}} two had had your little game of play, like two children, {{and that there}} must be an end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We needn't believe {{everything}} {{she said to}} realize that she suffered. But girls exaggerate their sufferings. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> not to think of it any more?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do," [...] he rejoined. [...] "The workhouse first, perhaps--and {{then the}} madhouse. What {{is there to}} {{surprise}} you in that? <b>You</b> yourself <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to her face she was mad. Good Heavens! how pale you are! What is the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} Mrs. Casaubon. She is not under any mistake about <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> because {{she came to}} see me and was very kind. You will have nothing to reproach me with now. I shall not have made any {{difference}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] {{interrupted}} the priest more gently. [...] "So; that will do." [...] He stopped, drew out his snuff-box, rapped the lid, {{and took a}} pinch of snuff slowly. [...] "We will not recur to that point. Then <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the story of your life?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But the india-rubber water-bottle?' I put in. 'You {{have been}} deceiving Mrs. Evelegh. It blackens silver. And <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> lies {{in order to}} extort money under false pretences.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{whole affair}} {{is not very}} likely. Our {{marriage}} is not likely; but {{it is going to}} happen, nevertheless. She knows this circumstance perfectly well. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} no room for me," [...] he said to Mrs. Jones, [...] "you must scold Lady Mab. She has told me that <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to invite me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I remember; <b>you</b> <b>told</b> {{us about}} <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> were {{children}} together. But what's {{the good of}} your being {{in love with her}} if she's married?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't 'ave let her in, only she's {{been three}} times, {{and she seemed}} that upset at not finding <b>you,</b> so I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she could wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why did {{you tell}} her? She could not but have spoken her mind when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her.</b> There must have been much between you when this was talked of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Miss Crabbe; she {{is new to}} the place,' said Cherry. 'Mr. Froggatt {{said she}} had only been once in the shop before. Tell Sister how <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about yourself, Stella.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Edgar. [...] "It {{would have}} been {{remarkable}} if you had done so. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> you couldn't rest until you got {{to work at the}} harvest?" ...|$|E

[...] "I thought {{probably}} <b>you</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that. <b>You</b> had it pat from having just been over it with me. When has she heard from him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, that I did! She wouldn't tell you. There'll be many a {{thing in}} life she won't tell you. I went to let her hear from my lips what I thought {{of her as a}} wife for <b>you.</b> I <b>told</b> <b>her</b> what I thought of a woman who plays the part of a wanton--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} Elsa {{all up and}} down, {{as if he was}} taking her measure, bowed again to the lady, and left the hall. After dinner the lady said kindly to Elsa, 'Kisika has begged me to let you stay with <b>her,</b> and <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> would like to live here. Is that so?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Otherwise {{there would}} be no pain in the case, and you would not see me going to his house now. What was Thomasin's answer when <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of your feelings?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Sue was his favorite, though," [...] Louise returned. [...] "Of {{course you}} must go, Matt. You couldn't do less! It's {{magnificent}} of you. Have <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> yet, {{that you would}} go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jane, look there!" [...] cried Venters, in despairing grief. [...] "Need <b>you</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her?</b> Where was {{all your}} {{kindness}} of heart? This girl {{has had a}} wretched, lonely life. And I'd {{found a way to}} make her happy. You've killed it. You've killed something sweet and pure and hopeful, just as sure as you breathe." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{moreover}} as if, thus unprecedentedly positive, {{his child}} {{had an effect}} upon him that Mr. Verver really felt as a new thing. [...] "Why then haven't <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me about <b>her</b> before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He rose, {{but only}} to his knees. [...] "But <b>you</b> have not <b>told</b> her!"

6000|$|Austin laughed. [...] "One would fancy that Las Palmas was dry {{and dusty}} enough for most people. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> there is nowhere she can stay? They haven't a hotel of any kind in the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so, life wouldn’t {{be worth}} living. [...] . Well, I am bound {{to say that}} I think <b>you</b> should have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> years ago.|$|R
6000|$|Molly laughed. [...] "That's the joke, sir, Miss Bat is {{cleaning}} house, and I'm sure {{it needs}} cleaning, {{for it is}} years since it was properly done. I thought <b>you</b> might have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> to." ...|$|R
