I got rid of everything, all right, but I didn't really sell a turnip. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> <b>those</b> society women stormed my wagon, crawled over the wheels and crowded me off to respectable distance, say [...] When I got back the wagon was swept as clean as a good housewife's parlor, and there in a bushel basket was a quart of silver." ...|$|E
2500|$|Filming for {{the series}} takes place in New York City, {{significantly}} in Harlem, where the series is set. Coker described the neighborhood as [...] "the {{only place in the}} city where <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little easier for us to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Sound stage work also takes place in New York. Manuel Billeter serves as director of photography {{for the series}}, after doing the same for Jessica Jones.|$|E
6000|$|Capt. G. (Aside.) It was a nursery-tea and she's {{ashamed of}} it. By Jove! She doesn't look half bad when she colors up like that. (Aloud, helping {{himself from the}} dish.) Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> new chocolates at Peliti's? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolly {{has been}} here a month or two. I think it's three months since she came, and I do like her. She's soft and womanly, and hasn't taken up those vile, filthy habits which almost all the girls have adopted. Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> Frenches with the things they have on their heads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} can talk very comfortably here," [...] he said, [...] "under these great trees. But I do so wish----Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> great borders at Hampton Court? The whole place is glowing, and in such {{sunshine}} as this----A taxi--will take us there under the hour. If you are free until half-past five." ...|$|R
2500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Harlem, {{including}} Lenox Avenue and areas where American Gangster was shot, the Mount Olivet Baptist Church, St. Nicholas Park, Jackie Robinson Park, Riverside Park, and the Riverside Drive viaduct; in Washington Heights, including at the United Palace; Cortlandt Alley in Chinatown; in areas of Queens for when Cage escapes Seagate Prison and puts on the classic Power Man costume; the Roosevelt Island steam plant and Queens Detention Facility for interiors of Seagate; the Music Hall of Williamsburg for the exterior of Harlem's Paradise; the former Fulton Correctional Facility in The Bronx for the Crispus Attucks Complex; and the Long Island City portion of Newtown Creek. It was important to Coker for the series to film in Harlem, [...] "the {{only place in the}} city where <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> wide boulevards. We really wanted to capture the color, the rhythm of the streets". For example, the production had the opportunity to film at a barbershop in Greenwich Village [...] "that would’ve been a little easier for us to shoot in", but Coker said [...] "the opportunity to film it in Harlem was irresistible. I didn’t want us to talk about Harlem and then not film in Harlem." [...] Soundstage filming for the series took place at Broadway Stages in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. For the church that Cage and Temple visit in Savannah, Georgia, an abandoned church in The Bronx was found that was being sold, and the production was able to [...] "graffiti up and sort of ruin" [...] it. They also had to spend two days carting snow from the site before filming, after a recent blizzard.|$|E

6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> {{wonderful}} Russian dancers?" [...] began Mrs. Elliot. But Helen saw {{her partner}} coming and rose {{as the moon}} rises. She was half round the room before they took their eyes off her, for they could not help admiring her, although they thought it a little odd that a woman of her age should enjoy dancing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Could <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> mighty muscles {{knotting}} {{under the}} brown skin--could <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> them force back those awful fangs--you too {{would have thought}} him invincible.|$|R
6000|$|... "MON DIEU! I {{shall see}} them in the dark forever--the eyes that <b>you</b> <b>see,</b> and <b>those</b> that <b>you</b> don't <b>see,</b> but feel--ah, they are the worst." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Look here, do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> {{soldiers}} {{lying down}} in a ditch?" [...] Percy asked, pointing to a line of Mobiles, not fifty yards in front.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bibb, my boy," [...] said he, slowly {{waving his}} hand, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> {{mountains}} and that sea and sky and sunshine?--they're mine, Bibbsy --all mine." ...|$|E

5000|$|Young's {{portrayal}} of JR propelled the character {{into one of}} the show's more popular and hated characters. Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>those</b> piercing blue eyes? When they're not flashing with anger, a glimpse of the troubled young man who was deeply wounded by the presumed death of his mother shows through. Like Babe, we could easily fall into the trap of thinking that a little tender loving care from us would fix him right up. Soaps In Depth magazine on JR being a love-to-hate fixture ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Beauteous hero! whether I bear thee most hatred or most love I cannot tell. Die thou must; yet I feel I {{should die}} with thee. Oh! that to-night could lead {{at the same}} time unto our {{marriage}} bed and funeral pyre. Must that white bosom bleed? and must those delicate limbs be hacked and handled by these bloody butchers? Is that justice? They lie, the traitors, when they call thee false to our God. Thou art thyself a god, and I could worship <b>thee!</b> <b>See</b> <b>those</b> beauteous lips; they move. Hark to the music!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> two logs? Well {{that one}} {{smouldering}} dismally {{away in the}} corner is what my life is now; the other blazing and singing is what I want my life to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! uncle," [...] exclaimed Pereira, [...] "did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> birds cross {{each other}} as I pulled? That was a lucky one for me, but I won't count the second if the Heer Allan objects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, you see,' said Mr Haredale, 'those walls. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> tottering gables. You see {{on every}} side where fire and smoke have raged. You see the {{destruction}} that has been wanton here. Do you not?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't puzzle {{your brain}} over that," [...] I {{answered}} gloomily, [...] "for I {{think there will}} soon be a few more skeletons in this beastly cave, that's all. Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> that <b>those</b> Abati will believe we are burned in the palace?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{tell you}} one thing shortly," [...] he replied. [...] "But here's another. Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>those</b> boats there, one on the house and two on the beds? Well, where is the boat Trent lowered when he lost the hands?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Dobble, hush! don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> one of <b>those</b> naval {{officers}} {{has turned}} round and heard you? My dear Clopper, {{it was a}} mere childish bagatelle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you {{can find}} all the {{satisfaction}} you want in talking to me," [...] the boy declared, gloomily.
