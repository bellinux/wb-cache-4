25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E

The Jordanaires sang harmony, {{as they had}} on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, [...] "You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> real Elvis is like tonight." [...] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order. The single pairing [...] "Don't Be Cruel" [...] with [...] "Hound Dog" [...] ruled {{the top of the}} charts for 11 weeks—a mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years. Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood during the first week of September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of [...] "Hound Dog," [...] contributed [...] "Love Me." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1954, {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Hurricane Hazel caused {{the destruction of}} bridges and buildings in the valley. As {{a consequence of the}} destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, {{was one of the few}} to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted [...] "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that's what it was." ...|$|E

500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E
500|$|Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was {{produced}} {{in the style of}} a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie [...] "Mary" [...] in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. [...] To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, [...] "In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell {{is going on in the}} film." [...] On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons {{for the success of}} his company is the {{extraordinary}} efforts taken to involve the public throughout many stages of a bridge’s development. [...] “One of the important activities to us is dealing with the public and designing bridges that the public wants,” said Figg. [...] “We’re convinced that the bridge tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> public thinks of itself.” (Zehyer 2002) [...] Often considered an advocate for public involvement in bridge design, Figg conducted public meetings during both the design and construction stages of major bridge projects. [...] During these meetings, Figg worked with the communities to help them arrive at decisions about the appearance of the bridge, while ensuring they stay within budget (ASCE 2002). [...] These ideals which were passed down to his daughter, Linda, should serve as lessons for anyone entering the engineering field.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{initially}} hesitant, Abrams {{warmed to}} the idea {{on the condition that}} the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof created the series' style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four-to-five-season run for the show. The novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by Babylon 5. Because ABC felt that Alias was too serialized, Lindelof and Abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self-contained: [...] "We promise ... that [...] requires NO knowledge of the episode(s) that preceded it ... there is no 'Ultimate Mystery' which requires solving." [...] While such statements contradicted their true plans, the ruse succeeded in persuading ABC to purchase the show. The game Myst, also set in a tropical island, was noted as an influence by Lindelof, as in its narrative, [...] "No one told <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> rules were. You just had to walk around and explore these environments and gradually a story was told." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{response}} to the album has been mixed, based on a score of 59 out of 100 from review aggregator site Metacritic. The Observers review of Echo gave the album three out of five stars, with reviewer Peter Robinson writing, [...] "Unusually for an X Factor graduate, there was actually something at risk if the second album didn't work, but Echo hits its target. A handful of upbeat numbers – including an unexpected foray into frothy high-speed electro – pull Leona {{back from the brink}} of boring." [...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News agreed, writing [...] "Echo has a sense of fun, and a youthful vim, rarely on display on Spirit. It's faster, harder and way catchier." [...] Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said Lewis's [...] "mezzo-soprano range allows her to take melodies from luxurious low notes to high-flying falsetto, gliding with elegant power and impressive control through all kinds of fluctuations and modulations. [...] The approach of the album's producers is to throw Leona at a song, with multi-tracked vocals shooting off in every direction, until you feel like you're listening to a room full of cloned divas fighting over who gets the top line. It's an exhausting yet strangely exhilarating experience." [...] Heats Karen Edwards awarded the album five stars out of five, saying [...] "From girlie pop to big ballads, this album will remind <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fuss is all about. Future X Factor winners take note: this is what real talent sounds like." ...|$|E
