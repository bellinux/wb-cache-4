500|$|According to Natalie Nichols of the Los Angeles Times, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] {{reference}} a state of romantic obsession. Beyoncé said that the song talks [...] "about how, when you are falling in love, you {{do things that are}} out of character and you do not really care because you are just open." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] has [...] "such a cauldron of energy," [...] that Beyoncé sounds [...] "loose and sexy," [...] gripped by emotions she [...] "can neither understand nor control." [...] The lyrics are composed in the traditional verse-chorus form. Jay Z opens the song with a brief spoken verse-rap, containing the lyrics: [...] "Yes! So crazy right now. Most incredibly, it's your girl, B. It's <b>your</b> <b>boy,</b> Young. You ready?" [...] After Beyoncé delivers the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] catchphrase, Jay Z continues the monologue. Beyoncé begins the first verse, followed with the whistle-backed chorus. She repeats the [...] "uh-oh, uh-oh" [...] phrase, leading to the second verse. The chorus follows, giving way to the second verse-rap which contains the lyrics: [...] "Jay Z in the range, crazy and deranged [...] I been inhaling the chain smokers, how you think I got the name 'Hova', I been real and the game's over". The song continues to the bridge, singing: [...] "I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, / I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care / 'Cuz your love's got the best of me, / And baby, you're making a fool of me, / You got me sprung and I don't care who sees." [...] She then sings the chorus again and the song fades out with the horns.|$|E
