25|$|In his speech, Alcibiades {{goes on to}} {{describe}} Socrates' virtues, his incomparable valor in battle, his immunity to cold or fear. On one occasion he even saved Alcibiades' life and then refused to accept honors for it (219e-221c). Socrates, he concludes, is unique in his ideas and accomplishments, unrivaled by any man from the past or present (221c). But be warned: Socrates may present himself as your lover, but {{before you know it}} <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> fallen in love with him.|$|E

25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor. It may be built into a hill to some degree, such that the full size {{of the house is}} not evident from the curb. However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For it to be a raised ranch, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to climb a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house. Among real estate agents, this term is commonly misused.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows that}} if one has to choose between {{receiving}} $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to cash the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in your savings account, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> $105 in one year.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

500|$|At Cambridge Inglis' {{students}} included Sir Frank Whittle (developer {{of the jet}} engine), James N. Goodier (mechanical {{engineer and}} academic), Sir Morien Morgan (called the [...] "Father of Concorde") and Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt (Conservative peer). [...] He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer Yury Lomonosov and lectured to biochemist Albert Chibnall. [...] Despite mentoring {{some of the best}} engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. [...] He once told a new intake class: [...] "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort". [...] Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming [...] "cramped by premature specialisation".|$|E
500|$|In another memo, Steinbeck {{noted that}} the pathos of Suzy being a prostitute had given much of the {{dramatic}} tension to the scene in which Doc rejects Suzy, and later, her rejection of him.

Perhaps laceration, prolapse and all the evils are, in fact, natural to labor and in fact normal... If you adopt this view, I have no ground to stand on, but, if you believe that a woman after delivery should be as healthy, as well as anatomically perfect as she was before, and that the child should be undamaged, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> to agree with me that labor is pathogenic, because experience has proved such ideal results exceedingly rare." ...|$|E
