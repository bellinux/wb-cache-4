The MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) gyroscopes are much less reliable than their laser or fibre-optic cousins. Nevertheless, the availability and low price of MEMS components make this a growing area of application in avionics for general aviation aeroplanes. This paper presents certain results of flight data analysis registered during the flight testing campaign of the new experimental lowpower single-engine turbo-propeller utility aeroplane I- 31 T. The research was focused on identification of oscillation modes, distinctive for the new aeroplane, such as engine precession or shimmy. The data came from a three-axis MEMS gyroscope and accelerometer recorder, placed near to the centre of gravity.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} the first ever racing vehicle yaw control system that utilises active dampers to provide a corrective yaw moment through the manipulation of tyre contact patch loads during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. The study has focused on the following three key areas, 1) The design of a magneto-rheological (MR) damper The damping requirements of a racing vehicle are investigated. A prototype magneto- rheological damper is proposed and evaluated using magnetic finite element techniques. The manufactured prototype is subsequently tested and benchmarked against a passive racing damper and a commercially available MR damper. Consideration is given to the current driver circuit required, the damper response time to increasing and decreasing demand signals and sealing and bearing requirements. 2) A novel yaw damping strategy utilising active MR dampers This work proposes a novel active damping strategy for vehicle <b>yaw</b> control. The <b>dampers</b> are used to control both the pitch and roll damping distribution during transient vehicle handling manoeuvres. It is shown that this approach improves the functionality of previous damper based yaw control that only considered roll damping distribution. 3) In-Vehicle implementation and track testing An in-vehicle damper control system is developed using hardware that has not previously been employed in this application. This study is the first to apply a damper based yaw control system to a racing vehicle. Track testing of the racing vehicle fitted with the damper control system is used to demonstrate the potential improvements achievable in the context of lap time, subjective driver feel and measured yaw error.

40|$|This report briefly {{describes}} the modal {{analysis of a}} 500 kW wind turbine carried out using finite element model. The wind turbine operates in turbulent windy atmosphere and experiences {{a wide range of}} dynamic loads. Flexible rotor blade and tower adopted requires design consideration {{to keep them out of}} resonance regime. The indigenously developed teetered two bladed downwind turbine has rotor of 45 m diameter placed at the top of 60 m tubular tower with four guy rope support. The modal analysis of the rotor, two blades and hub assembly, was performed with hinged boundary condition at the teeter axis. Modal frequencies of the parked rotor predicted would be used in conjunction with experimental data for validation of the FE model and that of spinning rotor for design. Tower modal frequencies were obtained using tapered beam elements for the tower and a lumped mass for the tower top mass. Guy rope stiffness was estimated using load elongation data obtained on a test specimen and the same was included as spring in the FE model. Campbell diagram were drawn for the rotor and the tower and the risk of resonance build-up by the potential excitations of rotor harmonics was explored. The Campbell diagrams indicated that the tower and rotor natural frequencies were well separated from the potential rotor excitations. Dynamic load monitored on the tower using strain gauge and the visible observation of rotor teeter at low wind speed during the run of prototype reinforces the results of the modal analysis. However dynamic loads during transients of wind turbine operation needs to be monitored and investigated for further improvement towards the smooth operation of the wind turbine as the first prototype was yet to be configured with <b>yaw</b> and teeter <b>dampers...</b>|$|R

50|$|Thirty-seven Class 165/1 Turbo trains {{were built}} in 1992 for the Thames line {{subdivision}} of Network SouthEast, numbered 165101-137. Like the Chiltern units, both 2-car and 3-car variants were built. Units 165101-117 were delivered as 3-car units, followed by the 2-car units 165118-137.

50|$|The units run on 25 kV AC {{overhead}} line supply via a Brecknell Willis High Speed pantograph, using four Brush TM2141B traction motors. With much shorter passenger journeys in mind, the Class 320 units lack the toilets of the Class 321 units and also began {{life with a}} lower speed capability (75 mph) due to the much closer spacing of stations on the North Clyde route. The lower design speed meant that <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> could be omitted from this class but during 2010, <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> were fitted across the class allowing them to travel at 90 mph. This meant that the units could be used on the sections of the Argyle Line route shared with the West Coast Main Line (and in theory, the Airdrie-Bathgate extension of the North Clyde Line and beyond), and also allows full-speed running in multiple with Class 318 stock, which has had 90 mph capability from the outset.

50|$|The bogies were a {{fabricated}} steel design, with coil spring primary suspension. The traction motors and gearboxes (one per axle) were mounted to the bogie frame {{and connected to}} the wheels by a flexibly coupled quill drive. Traction links were connected to the bogie frame at a height of 200 mm above rail. The locomotive superstructure is supported on coil springs on a central swing bolster, and the centre bogie allows 200 mm of lateral movement to negotiate small-radius curves. <b>Yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> are also fitted.|$|E
50|$|A {{stability}} augmentation system (SAS) {{is another}} type of automatic flight control system; however, instead of maintaining the aircraft on a predetermined attitude or flight path, the SAS will actuate the aircraft flight controls to dampen out aircraft buffeting regardless of the attitude or flight path. SAS can automatically stabilize the aircraft {{in one or more}} axes. The most common type of SAS is the yaw damper which is used to eliminate the Dutch roll tendency of swept-wing aircraft. Some <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> are integral to the autopilot system while others are stand-alone systems.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} 500 series trains, <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> are fitted between vehicles, and all cars feature {{semi-active}} suspension to ensure smooth ride characteristics at high speed.

5000|$|In June 1953, North American {{initiated}} {{an in-house}} study of advanced F-100 designs, leading to proposed interceptor (NAA 211: F-100BI denoting [...] "interceptor") and fighter-bomber (NAA 212: F-100B) variants.

The flight control system was upgraded {{by the addition of}} pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> usually {{consist of}} a yaw rate sensor (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses yaw rate sensor to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw rate sensor to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|E
5000|$|Dutch roll {{is a type}} of {{aircraft}} motion, consisting of an out-of-phase combination of [...] "tail-wagging" [...] and rocking from side to side. This yaw-roll coupling is one of the basic flight dynamic modes (others include phugoid, short period, and spiral divergence). This motion is normally well damped in most light aircraft, though some aircraft with well-damped Dutch roll modes can experience a degradation in damping as airspeed decreases and altitude increases. Dutch roll stability can be artificially increased by the installation of a yaw damper. Wings placed well above the center of gravity, sweepback (swept wings) and dihedral wings tend to increase the roll restoring force, and therefore increase the Dutch roll tendencies; this is why high-winged aircraft often are slightly anhedral, and transport-category swept-wing aircraft are equipped with <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the French National Railway started {{to receive their}} new {{powerful}} CC 7100 electric locomotives, and began to study and evaluate running at higher speeds. In 1954, the CC 7121 hauling a full train achieved a record 243 km/h during a test on standard track. The next year, two specially tuned electric locomotives, the CC 7107 and the prototype BB 9004, broke previous speed records, reaching respectively 320 km/h and 331 km/h, again on standard track. For the first time, 300 km/h was surpassed, allowing the idea of higher speed services to be developed and further engineering studies commenced. Especially, during the 1955 records, a dangerous hunting oscillation, the swaying of the bogies which leads to dynamic instability and potential derailment was discovered. This problem was solved by <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> which enabled safe running at high speeds today. Research was also made about [...] "current harnessing" [...] at high-speed by the pantographs, that was solved 20 years later by the ZÃ©bulon TGV's prototype.|$|E
50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as a yaw and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and a yaw and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing a yaw damper, in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the yaw damper becomes a safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual <b>yaw</b> <b>dampers</b> are required and a failed yaw damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{possibility}} of reduction of guiding forces magnitude in small-radius curves by means of active elements. These guiding forces characterize the lateral force interaction between the rail vehicle and the track and influence the wear of wheels and rails in curves.

However, in case of new railway vehicles with axleload of approximately 20 t and more it is problematic to meet the condition of maximum value of the quasistatic guiding force which acts on the outer wheel of the 1 st wheelset in small-radius curves.
