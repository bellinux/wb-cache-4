500|$|Standing [...] {{tall and}} {{weighing}} , Perry was small {{for a typical}} fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, but rather he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, {{and he had a}} knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> hole, you take it," [...] Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. [...] "If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. You run with instinct." [...] Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname [...] "The Jet". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Released in 2009, Allen's {{second major}} release, It's Not Me, It's <b>You,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> genre shift for her, having {{more of an}} electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae {{influences}} of the first one. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart, the Australian Albums Chart and the Canadian Albums Chart. The first single from it, [...] "The Fear", also debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, where it remained for four consecutive weeks. Other singles include [...] "Not Fair", another top 10 single in the UK, [...] "Fuck You", which became her third chart entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at 68, [...] "22" [...] and her more recent [...] "Who'd Have Known". Allen's first extended play, F.U.E.P., was released in March 2009 and her second, Paris Live Session, in November of the same year.|$|E

[...] "When <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He {{was the first and}} remains the greatest." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Orson Welles and John Houseman {{left the}} Federal Theatre Project {{to form their}} own {{independent}} repertory theatre company, the Mercury Theatre, Lloyd was invited to become a charter member. He played a memorable role in its first stage production, Caesar (1937), Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy Julius Caesar — streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force. In a scene that became the fulcrum of the show, Cinna the Poet (Lloyd) dies at the hands not of a mob but of a secret police force. Lloyd called it [...] "an extraordinary scene [...] gripped the audience {{in a way that}} the show stopped for about three minutes. The audience stopped it with applause. It showed the audience what fascism was; rather than an intellectual approach, <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> physical one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her second studio album, It's Not Me, It's <b>You,</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> genre shift, {{having more}} of an electropop feel, rather than the ska and reggae {{influences}} of the first one. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart and the Australian ARIA Charts and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles [...] "The Fear" [...] and [...] "Fuck You". This success saw her receive the Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist at the 2010 Brit Awards. Allen and Amy Winehouse were credited with starting a process that led to the [...] "year of the women" [...] media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of [...] "experimentalism and fearlessness" [...] nominated for the Mercury Prize.|$|E

The film was not commercially successful during its original release, but fared better during its second and third releases.|$|R

60|$|MRS TARLETON. Oh, you are tiresome. As if {{it mattered}} to anyone what <b>you</b> <b>saw.</b> Me! <b>A</b> married woman {{that might be}} your mother. [To Lina] And I'm sure youre not particular, if youll excuse my saying so.|$|R

60|$|LESLIE. That's it. And, of course, I {{tried to}} seize him. But the rascal was too quick. He was down and away in <b>an</b> instant. <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> thing so daring and adroit.|$|R

50|$|We're {{not doing}} a boffo comedy. We are not making fun of ourselves. One of the {{cardinal}} rules here is that every actor really believe {{what he is doing}} could actually happen... I hope to evoke all those feelings that audiences felt when they first saw Errol Flynn's movies, {{but at the same time}} I realise that if <b>you</b> <b>saw</b> <b>an</b> actual Errol Flynn movie today, marvelous as they were, you'd laugh. My job here is to keep the energy up, the motion moving forward, to maintain a level of joy.|$|R
500|$|Morgain said, [...] "The {{main thing}} they wanted about Death {{coming to get}} people is that <b>you</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> kind of a Michael Myers figure. [...] <b>You</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> killer. [...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane}} crash – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|R
