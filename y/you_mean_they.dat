60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY [with gentle emphasis]. I have a KNOWLEDGE of {{what the}} Roun Towers were, if that's what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>They</b> are the forefingers of the early Church, {{pointing}} us all to God.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our folks!" [...] exclaimed Fred. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>They</b> can't all go. Uncle Dick is {{just back}} from Texas, and {{somebody}} has got {{to look after the}} offices in New York." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Osborn grimly, [...] "I {{suspected}} {{something like}} this! <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> turned you out? Well, you are consistent in your habits. You left school in similar circumstances, you left Woolwich, and now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>they</b> {{have really}} {{come home to}} live here?" [...] demanded Julius, with {{singular}} indifference to the personal insinuations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>they</b> {{will demand}} nine hundred pounds?" [...] said Robarts, {{standing}} up and glaring angrily at the member of Parliament.|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{gazed at}} him in perplexity, then, with a dawning perception, 'Oh! surely <b>you</b> don't <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> did not approve of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Rosier {{gave her}} a sharp look. [...] "Do you mean that without my bibelots I'm nothing? Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> were {{the best thing about}} me? That's what they told me in Paris; oh they were very frank about it. But they hadn't seen HER!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She resolutely {{took him}} to her {{favorite}} white and green cottages and Georgian houses. He admitted that fanlights, and white shutters against rosy brick, were more homelike than a painty wooden box. He volunteered, [...] "I see how <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>They</b> make me think of these pictures of an old-fashioned Christmas. Oh, if you keep at it long enough you'll have Sam and me reading poetry and everything. Oh say, d' I {{tell you about this}} fierce green Jack Elder's had his machine painted?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{know nothing}} about other cases,” Mrs. Dolphin said, “I only know about this one. It so happens that I’ve been brought near it, and that an appeal {{has been made to}} me. The English are very romantic—the most romantic people in the world, if that’s what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>They</b> do the strangest things from the force of passion—even those of whom you would least expect it. They marry their cooks, they marry their coachmen, and their romances always have the most miserable end. I’m sure this one would be wretched. How can you pretend that such a flaming barbarian can be worked into any civilisation? What I see is a fine old race—one of the oldest and most honourable in England, people with every {{tradition}} of good conduct and high principle—and a dreadful disreputable vulgar little woman, who hasn’t an idea of what such things are, trying to force her way into it. I hate to see such things—I {{want to go to the}} rescue!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{understand}} what <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> mamma. <b>They</b> are, at any rate, {{as good as}} we are. Mr. Spalding stands quite as high as papa does." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{arrangement}} do you mean?" [...] I {{asked with}} a sinking heart, as the thought of Arthur's crushed hopes came to my mind. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>they</b> are engaged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In Hebrew! And why in Hebrew?' 'They {{follow the}} laws of Moses, this tribe.' 'Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>they</b> are Jews?' 'The Arabs are only Jews upon horseback,' said Baroni. 'This tribe, I find, call {{themselves}} Rechabites.' ...|$|R
50|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> have {{deliberately}} shut {{their eyes}} to your infamous practices? - They have had to shut {{their eyes to}} more than me.|$|E
5000|$|Now, {{the illness}} du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll {{tell you what}} autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, [...] "Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a [...] Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot." ...|$|E
5000|$|On August 22, 2003, U.S. District Judge Denny Chin denied Fox's {{request for}} an {{injunction}} to block the publication of Franken's book, characterizing the network's claim as [...] "wholly without merit, both factually and legally." [...] During the judge's questioning, spectators in the court's gallery frequently laughed at Fox's case. Franken later joked, [...] "Usually when you say someone was literally laughed out of court, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> were figuratively laughed out of court, but Fox was literally laughed out of court." [...] Three days later, Fox filed to dismiss its lawsuit.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> If <b>they</b> pushed {{steadily}} {{on up the}} valley, they have gone a good distance, but if they stopped to catch beaver or prospect for gold {{they may not have}} got far away. Hadn't we better be pushing on, chief?" ...|$|R
6000|$|GUINNESS. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> the kitchen. <b>They</b> won't {{have him}} there. Do you expect {{servants}} to keep company with thieves and all sorts? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove--Maude, do {{you hear}} that?--if that is right, they brought their own misfortunes upon themselves. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to say <b>they</b> never audited you?' ...|$|R
5000|$|However, it {{had been}} raining for 23 days, and roads and railroads were being washed out. The train moved very slowly, often stopping. The theater {{management}} telegraphed that the venue was completely sold out for the evening performance and wanted regular updates to assure the public that the production was on its way. The troupe kept up the telegrams, but eventually even these lines gave out. By that evening, the troupe was still far {{from the city and}} gave up hope of doing any performance that night. The train finally arrived in Seattle at 11:30 pm. There was a lively crowd waiting for them at the train station, and the manager of the Metropolitan Theatre came up to Cornell and informed her that the audience was still waiting. McClintic asked, [...] "how many?" [...] "The entire house," [...] was the reply, [...] "Twelve hundred people." [...] Cornell was shocked and asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> want a performance at this hour?" [...] "They're expecting it," [...] the manager replied.|$|E
5000|$|Ray Liotta told an {{interviewer}} some anecdotes about filming in the morgue:Q. Since you spend {{a fair amount of}} time in the morgue in Unforgettable, do you have any crazy coroner's tales to relate?A. The morgue in L.A. was horrible, scary. The smell is just unbelievable. A couple of people who work there wanted to take pictures. So they took photos with bodies behind me.Q. <b>You</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> took photos of you, Ray Liotta, the movie star, in the city morgue?A. Yeah, that happened to me in two other rather strange places. For Unlawful Entry, these cops were looking for a body part. I was on-call with them, and so sure enough, they took a photograph of me with the body bag in the background. With Article 99, I played a surgeon. I did some research on open-heart surgery, and the nurses were [...] "Oh, yeah, you're Shoeless Joe from Field of Dreams. Can we take a picture?" [...] So there was this patient, her chest wide open, and they're taking pictures of me.|$|E

6000|$|On one occasion, old Jolyon being present, Soames recollected {{a little}} unpleasantness. His uncle had looked up sharply and said: [...] "Don't talk nonsense, Hemmings! <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> that what <b>they</b> do know isn't worth knowing!" [...] Old Jolyon detested humbug.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Miles," [...] Marble answered, in {{a thoughtful}} manner; [...] "we {{must be on}} our guard. Do <b>you</b> think <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> to come below?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Zoe," [...] {{he whispered}} hoarsely, [...] "don't you understand? If they can't {{get what they}} want from Laverick, they'll visit it upon me. They're desperate, I tell <b>you.</b> <b>They</b> <b>mean</b> {{mischief}} all the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "General Washington!" [...] echoed Bunker, angrily {{staring at}} the Senor. [...] "What's this stuff?

6000|$|March {{could not}} help smiling a little at the words, which came fast enough now in the hoarse staccato of Dryfoos's passion. [...] "I don't know whom <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by <b>they,</b> {{generally}} speaking; but I {{had the impression that}} poor old Lindau had once done his best to save the country. I don't always like his way of talking, but I know that {{he is one of the}} truest and kindest souls in the world; and he is no more an atheist than I am. He is my friend, and I can't allow him to be misunderstood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Consideration!' exclaimed Lady Monteagle. 'If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>they</b> {{are people}} of rank, and good blood, and good property, they are {{certainly}} people of consideration; but they are Goths, Vandals, Huns, Calmucks, Canadian savages! They have no fashion, no style, no ton, no influence in the world. It is impossible that a greater misfortune could have befallen your beauty than having such an aunt. Why, no man who has the slightest regard for his reputation would be seen in her company. She is a regular quiz, and you cannot imagine how everybody was laughing at you the other night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If by that <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> 'wrong,' <b>they</b> didn't. It was {{the only}} clew they had to the child; but on the {{following}} day it was learned you had been seen with George, and then his name appeared in the advertisement. After that, some of the newsboys from around City Hall Square brought word that Dan Fernald was with you, and a reward was also offered for knowledge of his whereabouts. You see, Josey dear, if Mr. Raymond--that is the name of Essie's father--could find either of you three boys, he was reasonably certain of getting news regarding his baby." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When I {{was growing}} {{up here in the}} wild west, if a young man got a girl {{pregnant}} out of wedlock, they got married, and the whole darned neighborhood was involved in that wedding. I <b>mean,</b> <b>you</b> just didn't allow that sort of thing to happen, <b>you</b> know? I <b>mean,</b> <b>they</b> wanted that child to be brought up in a home with two parents, you know, that whole story. And so I happen to believe that can happen again." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Warners are as charming as ever. They go shortly to {{the devil}} for a year--(which is but a poetical way of saying {{they are going to}} afflict {{themselves}} with the unsurpassable--(bad word) of travel for a spell.) I believe <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> to go and see <b>you,</b> first-so <b>they</b> <b>mean</b> to start from heaven to the other place; not from earth. How is that? ...|$|R
60|$|Our bright-eyed lads {{are taught}} insane constructions in Greek and Latin from morning till night, {{and they come}} for their holidays, in many cases, without the merest {{foundation}} of a batting style. Ask them what a Yorker is, and they will say: 'A man from York, though I presume <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> a Yorkshireman.' <b>They</b> will read Herodotus without a dictionary for pleasure, but ask them to translate the childishly simple sentence: 'Trott was soon in his timber-yard with a length 'un that whipped across from the off,' and they'll shrink abashed and swear they have not skill at that, as Gilbert says.|$|R

[...] and Father John turned round to walk back with young Macdermot {{the way he was}} going, [...] "what better respect could I have? If Captain Ussher were not a proper young man in general, your father and you, Thady, wouldn't be letting him be so much with Feemy; and, now we're on it, if <b>you</b> did not <b>mean</b> it to be a match, and if <b>you</b> did not <b>mean</b> <b>they</b> should marry, why have you let him be so much at Ballycloran, seeing your father doesn't meddle much in {{anything}} now?" ...|$|R
