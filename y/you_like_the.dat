5|$|The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular {{method to}} measure {{implicit}} self-esteem, surpassed {{only by the}} Implicit Association Test. The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task. There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all {{the letters of the}} alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> letters or how attractive you find them), in the rating scales (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).|$|E

[...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes {{you feel as if}} <b>you,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E

500|$|Kneale's next {{television}} series was {{a departure from}} his usual style—Kinvig, his sole attempt at writing a sitcom, produced by London Weekend Television and broadcast on ITV {{in the autumn of}} 1981. Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale was keen to stress that there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts, and some of the press reaction to Kinvig was positive. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of the Hitch-Hiker's Guide but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale's relaxed wit.

[...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the television special as a [...] "dream or a hallucination." [...] The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman wrote, [...] "It was all inoffensive, silly and knowing, and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer's next career: as America's in-house eccentric, fearless enough to satirize the country's traditions but canny enough to know that while you can deface as many Irving Berlin songs as <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> turkey is non-negotiable." [...] In contrast, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was critically panned by Jen Carlson of Gothamist, who felt that it was a [...] "very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release." ...|$|E

Bradley Stern from MuuMuse found similarities in the video with those of singer Björk's video for [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] (1995) and Kylie Minogue's [...] "Come into My World" [...] (2002) with the [...] "walk-talk and walk-crawl" [...] formula in it. He added that the video is [...] "self-aware, thoroughly modern, cheeky, sarcastic, glamorous and entirely camp {{all at the same}} time". Chris Wilman from TheWrap noted similarities to Madonna's own [...] "Material Girl" [...] (1985) video with the scenes showing her being carried off by the footballers, adding that [...] "everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to." ...|$|E

500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. She felt as a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of whether or not <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give Me All Your Luvin" [...] {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed reviews from music crtitcs. Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's {{doing in this}} song {{is so much more}} impossibly fun than we could have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on August 7, 1987, in United States to 944 theatres. Warner Bros. did not arrange for an advance screening, as they believed that Madonna's appeal would draw moviegoers {{to come to the}} film. A pre-release celebration was held on August 6, 1987, at Times Square in New York, where Madonna arrived to promote the film. A crowd of almost 10,000 people assembled to watch Madonna. As an introduction to the day, the radio jockeys from New York's WHTZ radio station played Madonna's popular songs in the Square, atop a platform created for the event. The police closed off 43rd and 44th streets, but allowing the traffic to pass through Broadway and Seventh Avenue of Manhattan. Around 6 PM, limousines started to arrive at the Square, with celebrities and the actors of the film entering the fanfare. Madonna arrived in a low-cut, low-backed sequined evening gown and the short hair she had adopted for the film. Although she was late by about an hour, the crowd number continued increasing. Asking her fans good-naturedly to [...] "Shut up, so I can talk", Madonna thanked everybody for coming to the opening of Who's That Girl. She talked about her experience of arriving in Times Square eight years before, and said, [...] "I was completely awestruck. Ten years later, I see all of you who have come to see me, and I'm completely awestruck. Thank you, and I hope <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> movie." [...] Saying this Madonna departed from the platform, and walked to the National Theatre. Joseph A. Cincotti from The New York Times noted that most of the crowd were in their [...] late teenage years and early 20's. Some held up signs and photographs but he noticed the Madonna wannabes were absent, the adolescent girls who had imitated Madonna's early lace-and-leather look. This was a result of Madonna's more mature image from True Blue.|$|E
