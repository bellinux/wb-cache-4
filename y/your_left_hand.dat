2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking blankly at me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>hand</b> to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} topological {{variants of}} mereological essentialism, {{the thesis that}} an object cannot have different parts than the ones it has. In particular, we examine de dicto and de re versions of two theses: (i) that an object cannot change its external connections (e. g., adjacent objects cannot be separated), and (ii) that an object cannot change its topological genus (e. g., a doughnut cannot turn into a sphere). Stronger forms of structural essentialism, such as morphological essentialism (an object cannot change shape) and locative essentialism (an object cannot change position) are also examined 1.

40|$|Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture (now, a theorem of Perelman) aims {{to answer}} the question: How could you {{describe}} possible shapes of our universe? Here we will be assuming (although, some people think otherwise) that our space is 3 dimensional (it has three directions: width, depth and height), compact (you cannot travel infinitely far away from a given point in space), closed (does not have a boundary), connected (you can get from any point to any point) and orientable (if you travel along a path {{and return to the}} point of departure, <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and right <b>hand</b> will not get switched). In order to understand the answer to this question, we first look at the 2 dimensional case for guidance. If our universe were a 2 d surface S, we could describe its shape by combining copies of three basic building blocks: •The disk D 2 (given by the inequality x 2 � y 2 ≤ 1). •The annulus A 2, also known as the cylinder (disk with one hole). •The pair of pants P...|$|R

60|$|Swimming with Horses.--In {{crossing}} a deep river, with a horse or other large animal, drive him in: or even lead him along a steep bank, and push him sideways, suddenly into the water: having fairly started him, jump in yourself, seize his tail, {{and let him}} tow you across. If he turns his head {{with the intention of}} changing his course, splash water in his face with <b>your</b> right or <b>left</b> <b>hand,</b> as the case may be, holding the tail with one hand and splashing with the other; and you will, in this way, direct him just as you like. This is by far the best way of swimming a horse: all others are objectionable and even dangerous with animals new to the work,--such as to swim alongside the horse, with one hand on his shoulder; or, worst of all, to retain your seat on his back. If this last method be persisted in, at least let the rider take his feet out of the stirrups, before entering the water.|$|R
25|$|Stick heights are {{not only}} {{important}} for visual reasons but they also strongly affect the sound quality. To get a uniform and consistent sound, one must play with even stick heights {{on the right and}} <b>left</b> <b>hand.</b> To practice playing with accurate stick heights, set up your drum or pad in front of a mirror. Start with a simple exercise and watch to see if <b>your</b> <b>left</b> heights are even with your right. If you have access to a video camera, you can record yourself and watch it later. It is easier to watch your heights and critique your performance when you are not focusing on playing.|$|R
