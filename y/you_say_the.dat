From {{the first week of}} transmissions, children's television series The Channel 4 Club was produced, with children's television program Stopwatch beginning in 1979. English-language educational programme <b>You</b> <b>Say</b> <b>the</b> Word began in 1971, catering to non-English-speaking immigrants. Long-running entertainment program Variety Italian Style premiered in 1974, with Malcom Elliott initially hosting the short-lived Tonight Show in 1981 being replaced by John Tingle a year later. To commemorate WIN Television's 21st year of broadcasting, a one-and-half-hour retrospective montage special was produced in 1983.

In contrast to Inhofe, Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, did not criticize Gore's efforts or the movie, which he planned to see. Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, said [...] "Because (Gore) was a former vice president and presidential nominee, he brings a lot of visibility to (the issue)," [...] Alexander said. [...] "On the other hand it may be seen as political by some, and they may be less eager {{to be a part of}} it." [...] Alexander also criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film. [...] "Maybe it needs a sequel: 'An Inconvenient Truth 2: Nuclear Power.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Guardian also {{quoted a}} U.S. {{official}} explaining the anticipated difficulty {{of finding a}} country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil. A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial, and that [...] "it's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden's body". On a similar note, Mohammed al-Qubaisi, Dubai's grand mufti, stated: [...] "They can say they buried him at sea, but they cannot say they did it according to Islam. If the family does not want him, it's really simple in Islam: you dig up a grave anywhere, even on a remote island, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> prayers and that's it. Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances. This {{is not one of}} them." [...] Khalid Latif, an imam who serves as a chaplain {{and the director of the}} Islamic Center of New York University, argued that the sea burial was respectful.|$|E
500|$|... "Cop Killer" [...] was {{replaced}} by a new version of [...] "Freedom of Speech," [...] a song from Ice-T's 1989 solo album The Iceberg/Freedom of Speech...Just Watch What <b>You</b> <b>Say.</b> <b>The</b> song was re-edited and remixed to give it a more rock-oriented sound, using a looped sample from the Jimi Hendrix song [...] "Foxy Lady." [...] Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a single. Ice-T left Warner Bros. Records the following year because of disputes over his solo album Home Invasion, taking Body Count with him. The studio version of [...] "Cop Killer" [...] has not been re-released, although a live version of the song appears on Body Count's 2005 release Live in L.A. According to Ernie C, the controversy over the song [...] "still lingers for us, even now. I'll try to book clubs and the guy I'm talking to will mention it and I'll think to myself 'Man, that was 17 years ago.' But I meet a lot of bands who ask me about it, too, and I'm real respected by other artists for it. But it's a love/hate thing. Ice gets it too, even though he plays a cop on TV now on Law & Order SVU." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it has to be done sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work. [...] really loved the music we were doing, and it showed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Enduring {{questions}} remained after [...] "La Noche Triste" [...] (the Sad Night) {{that have}} taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>the</b> government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that that was the thing that provoked the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax.

2500|$|On July 14, 1958, the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq {{was overthrown}} by a {{military}} coup d'état. Fearing {{that he would be}} next, Lebanese president Camille Chamoun appealed for American military aid within 48 hours to settle domestic unrest in his own country, invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine, which stated that the United States would intervene upon request to stabilize countries threatened by international communism. Holloway, who happened to be serving on a Selection Board in Washington at the time, promptly met with Chief of Naval Operations Arleigh A. Burke, who warned that a deployment order was imminent but that commitments in East Asia precluded any reinforcements from the Seventh Fleet. Retorted Holloway, [...] "I don't need any help. I can take over all of the Lebanon if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> word." [...] As one of Burke's few remaining peers in the Navy, Holloway took the opportunity to tease the CNO. [...] "But I've already had another proposition....From some Britisher. He thinks, if there's action, I should go up and take the port of Tripoli to protect their oil installations there." [...] The famously mercurial Burke cursed him out.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variant of}} {{redundancy}} theory is the disquotational theory {{which uses a}} modified form of Tarski's schema: To say that '"P" [...] is true' {{is to say that}} P. [...] A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams in his book What is Truth?. [...] Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. [...] They argue that sentences like [...] "That's true", when said in response to [...] "It's raining", are prosentences, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. [...] In the same way that it means the same as my dog in the sentence My dog was hungry, so I fed it, That's true is supposed to mean the same as It's raining—if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> latter and I then say the former. [...] These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is not a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion [...] "P" [...] may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as [...] "that's true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{enjoyed being}} {{president}} {{and was still}} relatively youthful, but felt that {{a limited number of}} terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. He personally favored Secretary of State Elihu Root as his successor, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor Charles Evans Hughes loomed as potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies. Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote the following to Taft: [...] "Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> word!" [...] Just weeks later he branded as [...] "false and malicious"; the charge was that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft. At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for [...] "four years more" [...] of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.|$|E
