50|$|The goal of Transformation-Associated Recombination (TAR) {{technology}} in synthetic genomics is to combine DNA contigs {{by means of}} homologous recombination performed by the <b>Yeast</b> <b>Artificial</b> <b>Chromosome</b> (YAC). Of importance is the CEN element within the YAC vector, which corresponds to the yeast centromere. This sequence gives the vector the ability to behave in a chromosomal manner, thereby allowing it to perform homologous recombination.First, Gap Repair Cloning is performed to generate regions of homology flanking the DNA contigs. Gap Repair Cloning is a particular form of the Polymerase Chain Reaction in which specialized primers with extensions beyond the sequence of the DNA target are utilized. Then, the DNA cassettes {{are exposed to the}} YAC vector, which drives the process of homologous recombination, thereby connecting the DNA cassettes. Polymerase Cycling Assembly and TAR technology were used together to construct the 600 kb Mycoplasma genitalium genome in 2008, the first synthetic organism ever created. Similar steps were taken in synthesizing the larger Mycoplasma mycoides genome a few years later.|$|E

40|$|Myosin is an {{important}} structural and enzymatic component of skeletal muscle. Multiple myosin isoforms are encoded by a multigene family and are expressed in different developmental stages and fiber types. In humans and mice, skeletal myosin heavy chain (MYH) genes are clustered on a single chromosome (17 p and 11, respectively). Since the structural organization of the gene cluster may affect its expression as well as shed light on MYH genetic alterations, a physical map of the human MYH gene cluster was constructed. Nine <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes</b> containing MYH genes were isolated and used to construct a contiguous set (contig) of overlapping <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> This contig encompasses a genetic marker mapped to 17 p 13. 1.

40|$|Human {{chromosomes}} 6 and 21 {{are both}} necessary to confer sensitivity to human interferon gamma (Hu-IFN-gamma), {{as measured by}} the induction of human HLA class I antigen. Human chromosome 6 encodes the receptor for Hu-IFN-gamma, and human chromosome 21 encodes accessory factors for generating biological activity through the Hu-IFN-gamma receptor. A small region of human chromosome 21 that is responsible for encoding such factors was localized with hamster-human somatic cell hybrids carrying an irradiation-reduced fragment of human chromosome 21. The cell line with the minimum chromosome 21 -specific DNA is Chinese hamster ovary 3 x 1 S. To localize the genes further, 10 different <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> clones from six different loci {{in the vicinity of the}} 3 x 1 S region were fused to a human-hamster hybrid cell line (designated 16 - 9) that contains human chromosome 6 q (supplying the Hu-IFN-gamma receptor) and the human HLA-B 7 gene. These transformed 16 - 9 cells were assayed for induction of class I HLA antigens upon treatment with Hu-IFN-gamma. Here we report that a 540 -kb <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> encodes the necessary species-specific factor(s) and can substitute for human chromosome 21 to reconstitute the Hu-IFN-gamma-receptor-mediated induction of class I HLA antigens.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a strategy for the rapid enrichment and identification of cDNAs encoded by large genomic regions. The basis of this "direct selection" scheme is the hybridization of an entire library of cDNAs to an immobilized genomic clone. Nonspecific hybrids are eliminated and selected cDNAs are eluted. These molecules are then amplified and are either cloned or subjected to further selection/amplification cycles. This scheme was tested using a 550 -kilobase <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> clone that contains the EPO gene. Using this clone and a fetal kidney cDNA library, we have achieved a 1000 -fold enrichment of EPO cDNAs in one cycle of enrichment. More significantly, we have further investigated one of the "anonymous" cDNAs that was selectively enriched. We confirmed that this cDNA was encoded by the <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Its frequency in the starting library was 1 in 1 x 10 (5) cDNAs and after selection comprised 2 % of the selected library. DNA sequence analysis of this cDNA and of the <b>yeast</b> <b>artificial</b> <b>chromosome</b> clone revealed that this gene encodes the beta 2 subunit of the human guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins. Restriction mapping and hybridization data position this gene (GNB 2) to within 30 - 70 kilobases of the EPO gene. The selective isolation and mapping of GNB 2 confirms the feasibility of this direct selection strategy and suggests {{that it will be}} useful for the rapid isolation of cDNAs, including disease-related genes, across extensive portions of the human genome...|$|E

This stability and accuracy makes HACs preferable to other methods such as viral vectors, YACs and BACs.
