But the way our season is going, I'll be taking {{anything}} at the moment." [...] Second-place finisher Power said {{it was still a}} good finish for him in terms of scoring points. Tony Cotman, the circuit's design consultant, announced in February 2011 that the track would be improved and lengthened for that year. He stated that the layout of the track be moved to.the Eastern runway of the City Centre Airport in an attempt to create more excitement.

With his second-place finish, Power extended his points lead in the standings to 50 over Franchitti and 71 ahead of Dixon. Briscoe and Hunter-Reay retained fourth and fifth positions.|$|E

5000|$|When he {{came into}} {{possession}} of Yukos, a conglomerate consisting of over 20 firms, {{most of them were}} “in terrible condition”, and he enjoyed the job of turning them into well-functioning units. According to Gellin, Khodorkovsky was “the most reticent among the oligarchs”, choosing not to “buy yachts or villas on the Côte d’Azur” or to become a fixture of “the Moscow playboy scene”. To be sure, he did buy “a gated compound of seven houses on 50 forested acres about half an hour outside Moscow” in the late 1990s, calling it Apple Orchard and housing Yukos's leading executives, who lived together as “one large happy family”. His social life consisted mostly of “Barbecuing for fellow Yukos managers”. At nights he would stay up and “read until two”. He later wrote that during this period “I saw business as a game....It was a game in which <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> but losing was also an option. It was a game in which {{hundreds of thousands of people}} came to work in the morning to play with me.” ...|$|R

[...] He also made clear his determination to win the yūshō, as [...] "unless I win a championship I can't move up to yokozuna." [...] However, for a significant period {{he was not able to}} challenge for the championship as an ōzeki, his best score never being higher than 11–4. This changed in January 2012, when after he recorded 13 straight wins and his nearest challenger yokozuna Hakuhō suffered three losses in four bouts, he took the championship with two days left to spare. [...] This made him the ninth foreigner, and the second from Europe after Kotoōshū, to win a top division championship. [...] He finished on 14–1, denied a perfect record by Hakuhō on the final day. He was told he had to win the next tournament or be in contention until the final day to earn a shot at yokozuna promotion, but Baruto told reporters the day after celebrating his victory, [...] "If I can wrestle at the spring basho like I did at the New Year meet, results will follow. Once you win one tournament, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a second, a third, a 10th and a 30th." [...] At the Osaka tournament in March he stood at 9–1 after ten days, but lost four of his last five matches to finish on a disappointing 10–5, putting any hopes for yokozuna promotion back to square one. Baruto had been suffering from a fever during the tournament and said afterwards that talk of yokozuna was just [...] "journalistic chatter... that wasn't my goal in this tournament." ...|$|E

By the 1930s {{he was making}} most of his court appearances in the senior courts such as the High Court of Justice; in 1932 he was advised by his clerk {{that he should not}} be seen in the County Courts, and that he should leave this work for lesser members of the chambers. In 1929 he helped edit several chapters of Smith's Leading Cases (13th ed.) and in 1932 acted as a supervising editor for the 9th edition of Bullen & Leake's Precedents for Pleadings in the King's Bench Division. In 1932 he moved to his own set of chambers in Brick Court, and by 1936 he was earning over £3,000 a year. A notable case was L'Estrange v F Graucob Ltd [...] 2 KB 394, where he successfully argued an exemption clause was incorporated because a contract was signed. This was counter to his work as a judge, where he tried to minimise their impact, but he said that 'If you are an advocate <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your client <b>to</b> <b>win.</b> If you are a judge you don't care who wins exactly.

In fact, he has only been shortlisted once and that was for Time's Arrow, which was not one of his strongest books. That really is suspicious.
