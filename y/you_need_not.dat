5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend, Francis Preston Blair. When he did return to Washington, {{it was with the}} intent of leaving for Tennessee to re-establish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he {{remained}} after word came that General Ulysses S. Grant had captured the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, presaging the end of the war. Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behavior, that [...] "I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} scene from Summer in which the young Damon sits thinking by a stream on a hot summer's day. The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon can see her. Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the [...] "delicate refinement" [...] of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves {{a note on the}} riverbank reading [...] "Bathe on, my fair,/ Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye/ Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt;/ To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot/ And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading [...] "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,/ By fortune too much favoured, but by love,/ Alas! not favoured less, be still as now/ Discreet: the time may come <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> fly." ...|$|E

2500|$|The rather {{traditional}} British marine artist Sir Norman Wilkinson {{was during}} World War I {{the inventor of}} dazzle camouflage, by which ships were boldly painted in patterns, achieving results not dissimilar to Vorticism, inspiring the naval ditty: [...] "Captain Schmidt at the periscope / <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>not</b> fall or faint / For itâ€™s not the vision of drug or dope / But only the dazzle paint".
