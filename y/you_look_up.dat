25|$|In 1974, author Stephen Cosgrove's children's book Wheedle on the Needle {{postulated}} a furry creature {{called a}} Wheedle {{who lived on}} top of the Space Needle and caused its light to flash. Its closing quatrain is: There's a Wheedle on the Needle/ I know just what you're thinking/ But if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> late at night/ You'll see his red nose blinking. The Wheedle has since become a fixture of Seattle. It even became the mascot of the Seattle SuperSonics National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise, who played in nearby KeyArena (originally known as the Seattle Center Coliseum). The SuperSonics moved to Oklahoma City on July 3, 2008.|$|E

The album was released later that year. Reviews were positive, with Blas, of Global Domination, who praised the album {{for being so}} brutal, claiming that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> the word 'Brutal' in the dictionary right now, you'd see Devourment's logo {{right next to the}} definition". He praised the vocals, but said that the drums, in places, let the album down due to them being too fast. Dan Staige, of Metal Review, said that the instruments were [...] "remarkably balanced and crisp", and his only criticism was that the [...] "ultra heavy breakdowns" [...] "may sound a little monotonous", but that [...] "you will still bang your head".|$|E
500|$|Trautmann {{excelled at}} shot-stopping, {{particularly}} penalties, saving 60% {{of those he}} faced {{over the course of}} his career. The Manchester United manager Matt Busby mentioned Trautmann's anticipation in his pre-match team talks: [...] "Don't stop to think where you're going to hit it with Trautmann. Hit it first and think afterwards. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> and work it out he will read your thoughts and stop it." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by the Manchester City forward Neil Young, who recalled that [...] "the only way to beat him with a shot in training was to mis-hit it". As a former handball player, Trautmann was adept at throwing the ball long distances, an attribute he used to start attacking moves, particularly after witnessing the Hungarian goalkeeper Gyula Grosics use such tactics to good effect in Hungary's 6–3 victory over England in 1953.|$|E
