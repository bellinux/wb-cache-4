Three estimates using annual data for three different time periods (1960 - 2013, 1971 - 2013, 1980 - 2013) are provided; in addition, as a de facto modest test of robustness, one additional estimate using quarterly data for the period 1960. 1 through 2013. 4 is also provided.

25|$|The {{important}} caveat about quicksort is {{that its}} worst-case performance is O(n2); while this is rare, in naive implementations (choosing the first or last element as pivot) this occurs for sorted data, which is a common case. The most complex issue in quicksort is thus choosing a good pivot element, as consistently poor choices of pivots can result in drastically slower O(n2) performance, but good choice of pivots <b>yields</b> <b>O(n</b> log n) performance, which is asymptotically optimal. For example, if at each step the median is chosen as the pivot then the algorithm works in O(nlogn). Finding the median, such as by the median of medians selection algorithm is however an O(n) operation on unsorted lists and therefore exacts significant overhead with sorting. In practice choosing a random pivot almost certainly yields O(nlogn) performance.|$|E
25|$|Baltic amber <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> dry {{distillation}} succinic acid, {{the proportion}} varying from about 3% to 8%, and being greatest {{in the pale}} opaque or bony varieties. The aromatic and irritating fumes emitted by burning amber are mainly due to this acid. Baltic amber is distinguished by its yield of succinic acid, hence the name succinite. Succinite has a hardness between 2 and 3, which is rather {{greater than that of}} many other fossil resins. Its specific gravity varies from 1.05 to 1.10. It can be distinguished from other ambers via IR spectroscopy due to a specific carbonyl absorption peak. IR spectroscopy can detect the relative age of an amber sample. Succinic acid may not be an original component of amber, but rather a degradation product of abietic acid.|$|E

25|$|Environmental devastation in Uzbekistan is best {{exemplified}} by the catastrophe of the Aral Sea. Because of diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya for cotton cultivation and other purposes, what once was the world's fourth largest inland sea has shrunk in {{the past thirty years}} to only about one-third of its 1960 volume and less than half its 1960 geographical size. The desiccation and salinization of the lake have caused extensive storms of salt and dust from the sea's dried bottom, wreaking havoc on the region's agriculture and ecosystems and on the population's health. Desertification has led to the large-scale loss of plant and animal life, loss of arable land, changed climatic conditions, depleted <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> the cultivated land that remains, and destruction of historical and cultural monuments.

The {{objective of this}} thesis is to assess the effects of foliage application of magnesium sulfate and urea for potatoes, that are intended for processing into starch production. There were two sorts of potatoes with different vegetation period under study, an early variety called as Bernard and semi-late variety called as Ornella. The foliage fertilizers were applied in three different variants. In the first variant the sorts of potatoes were fertilized by solution of magnesium sulfate, in the second variant by solution of urea and in the third variant the solution of magnesium sulfate and urea was used. The assessment of the experiment consists of <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> tubers, contain of the starch, <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> starch, the average amount of tubers per tuft, the average weight of tubers and profitability of used foliage fertilizers.

In US data there is indeed a strikingly high time series correlation between the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> nominal bonds and the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> equities.

Contrary to some of the extant literature, we show that this effect is consistent with modern asset pricing theory incorporating uncertainty about real growth prospects and habit-based risk aversion. In the US, high expected inflation has tended to coincide with periods of heightened uncertainty about real economic growth and unusually high risk aversion, both of which rationally raise equity yields.

6000|$|The two last {{sentences}} of this extract give admirable expression to one feature of Wordsworth's interpretation of Nature. In the deepest poetry, {{as in the}} loftiest music,--in Wordsworth's lyrics as in Beethoven's sonatas--it is by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they exhaustively express that their truth and power are known. [...] "In what he leaves unsaid," [...] wrote Schiller, [...] "I discover the master of style." [...] It depends, no doubt, upon {{the vision of the}} [...] "inward eye," [...] and the reproductive power of the idealising mind, whether the result is a travesty of Nature, or the embodiment of a truth higher than Nature <b>yields.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, it is equally certain that the identification of localities casts a sudden light in many instances upon obscure passages in a poem, and is by far the best commentary that can be given. It is much to be able to compare the actual scene, with the ideal creation suggested by it; as the latter was both Wordsworth's reading of the text of Nature, and his interpretation of it. In his seventy-third year, he said, looking back on his 'Evening Walk', that there was not an image in the poem which he had not observed, and that he [...] "recollected the time and place where most of them were noted." [...] In the Fenwick notes, we constantly find him saying, [...] "the fact occurred strictly as recorded," [...] "the fact was as mentioned in the poem"; and the fact very often involved the accessories of place.|$|E
