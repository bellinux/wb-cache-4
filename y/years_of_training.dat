5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced instrument that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E

5|$|The {{plot of the}} Naruto manga series, {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Masashi Kishimoto, is divided in two; the second part is known as Part II. The series is about the eponymous character Naruto Uzumaki who wants recognition and respect from the fellow villagers, and to become the Hokage, the leader of Konohagakure. Part II, set two-and-a-half years after the conclusion of Part I, follows the return of the ninja Uzumaki to Konohagakure from two-and-a-half <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> As he returns, he continues his goal of convincing his best friend Sasuke Uchiha to return with him and his other friends back to Konohagakure.|$|E
5|$|After his {{two and a}} half <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> Naruto {{returns to}} Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands {{to the point where he}} begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in his path.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers rather quickly, mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the experiences of trainees taking part in an extended (four-year) general practice training programme introduced in the South Eastern region of the Republic of Ireland to replace the previous traditional (three-year) programme. In a qualitative design, eight homogeneous focus groups were held to determine the value <b>of</b> the additional <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> The first cohort of trainees was interviewed towards the start and at the end <b>of</b> their fourth <b>year.</b> Trainees finishing the following year were also interviewed, as were graduates from the final three-year programme. GP trainers and the four members of the programme directing team comprised two further independent focus groups. Trainees reported that the integration of hospital posts and general practice attachments over the four years was particularly beneficial. The exposure to a variety of different general practices and the opportunity to take part in specialty clinics were considered extremely useful. The fourth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> was felt to be less pressurised than previous years. Professional and personal development was enhanced; improved readiness to practise and confidence were noted. Perceived disadvantages <b>of</b> extended <b>training</b> included a lack of acknowledgment for doctors in their fourth year and excessive emphasis placed on research during the final <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> The addition <b>of</b> an extra <b>year</b> <b>of</b> vocational <b>training</b> improves professional and personal development and changes the learning experience for doctors. Doctors felt more confident and ready to enter independent practice at the end <b>of</b> the fourth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>training...</b>|$|R
