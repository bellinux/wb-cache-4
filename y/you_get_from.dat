500|$|Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser of Dragon {{praised the}} designers' {{attention}} to detail, and cited the game's humor {{as a high}} point. Although {{they believed that the}} game was too expensive, they summarized it as [...] "a highly enjoyable graphic adventure replete with interesting puzzles, a fantastic Roland soundtrack, superb VGA graphics, smooth-scrolling animation, and some of the funniest lines ever seen on your computer screen." [...] Duncan MacDonald of Zero praised the graphics and found the game [...] "quite amusing". His favorite aspect was the fine-tuned difficulty level, which he believed was [...] "just right". He ended his review, [...] "At last an adventure game that's enjoyable rather than frustrating." [...] Paul Glancey of Computer and Video Games consider the game superior to Lucasfilm's earlier adventure titles, and wrote that, [...] "Usually the entertainment <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> an adventure is derived solely from solving puzzles, but the hilarious characters and situations, and the movie-like presentation ... make playing this more like taking part in a comedy film, so it's much more enjoyable." [...] He considered the puzzles to be [...] "brilliantly conceived" [...] and found the game's controls accessible. He summarized it as [...] "utterly enthralling".|$|E
500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to our sense of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E

500|$|The {{violence}} {{that was much}} criticized in 1969 remains controversial. Peckinpah noted it was allegoric of the American war in Vietnam, the violence of which was nightly televised to American homes at supper time. He tried showing the gun violence commonplace to the historic western frontier period, rebelling against sanitized, bloodless television Westerns and films glamorizing gunfights and murder: [...] "The point {{of the film is}} to take this façade of movie violence and open it up, get people involved in it so that they are starting to go in the Hollywood television predictable reaction syndrome, and then twist it so that it's not fun anymore, just a wave of sickness in the gut ... it's ugly, brutalizing, and bloody awful; it's not fun and games and cowboys and Indians. It's a terrible, ugly thing, and yet there's a certain response that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> it, an excitement, because we're all violent people." [...] Peckinpah used violence as a catharsis, believing his audience would be purged of violence by witnessing it explicitly on screen. He later admitted to being mistaken, that the audience came to enjoy rather than be horrified by his films' violence, something that troubled him.|$|E
500|$|Cacophonous being {{a secular}} label {{releasing}} material by {{a band that}} held Christian beliefs generated some interest in the metal scene. In an interview with Art for the Ears Webzine, published on December 12, 1998, Armoth said: [...] "We sent the CD and a short biography. They just wanted to sign us because of the music. And that's exactly {{what we wanted to}} do."

What kind of experiences did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> that?" [...] The band replied: [...] "Pretty bad, actually. I can not say they did anything else than released the album. No money, no royalties, nothing." [...] The interviewer also asked: [...] "Did the record company set any demands concerning your image?" [...] Antestor replied: [...] "Nothing like that. They just said that it is not recommendable for us to proclaim exactly everywhere that we are a Christian band, and they censored the words 'Lord' and 'Jesus' from our lyrics. We ourselves removed a few texts because {{we did not want to}} provoke unnecessarily." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{planned to}} release Chrono Trigger in late 1994, but release was pushed {{back to the}} {{following}} year. Early alpha versions of Chrono Trigger were demonstrated at the 1994 and 1995 V-Jump festivals in Japan. A few {{months prior to the}} game's release, Square shipped a beta version to magazine reviewers and game stores for review. An unfinished build of the game dated November 17, 1994, it contains unused music tracks, locations, and other features changed or removed from the final release—such as a dungeon named [...] "Singing Mountain" [...] and its eponymous tune. Some names also differed; the character Soysaw (Slash in the US version) was known as Wiener, while Mayonnay (Flea in the US version) was named Ketchappa. The ROM image for this early version was eventually uploaded to the internet, prompting fans to explore and document the game's differences, including two unused world map NPC character sprites and presumed additional sprites for certain non-player characters. Around the game's release, Yuji Horii commented that Chrono Trigger [...] "went beyond [...] expectations", and Hironobu Sakaguchi congratulated the game's graphic artists and field designers. Sakaguchi intended to perfect the [...] "sense of dancing <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> exploring Toriyama's worlds" [...] in the event that they would make a sequel.|$|E

Jim Farber of New York Daily News commented that [...] "Despite such spicy bits, the core of Britney's concert suffered from the familiarity and cheesiness of all teen road shows these days. The sparklers, explosions and mandatory flying dancers conformed to the corniness of theme park entertainment". [...] The ticket prices were set at $32 in North America. The reported dates averaged $507,786 in grosses and 15,841 in attendance. Susanne Ault of Billboard also reported {{that many of the}} shows sold out in one day. The tour had a total gross of $40.5million. It became the tenth highest-grossing tour of the year in North America, as well as the second highest grossing tour by a solo artist, only behind Tina Turner's Twenty Four Seven Tour.

500|$|Mega Man Battle Network was {{developed}} by Capcom Production Studio 2 amidst the success of Nintendo's portable RPG franchise Pokémon. Rather than extend upon the traditional action-platform formula for the Mega Man series as they had done with the 3D Mega Man Legends, Capcom followed Nintendo's example on the latter's then-newest handheld console, the GBA. While creating Battle Network, director Masahiro Yasuma found difficulty in blending action attributes with [...] "the kind of fun <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> a Pokémon game" [...] {{in order to make}} it enjoyable, new, and fresh. Yasuma recalled that production was further challenged because no effective precursor of its type had been made before. Producer Keiji Inafune stated that the development team wanted to add a [...] "real world" [...] feel to the Mega Man series by placing the protagonist of Battle Network in a location where the internet is prevalent. With the release of the portable GBA, the team felt that they should target modern gamers, specifically children, as an audience for the new series. The developers thought such a theme would be both successful and relevant because these younger gamers grew up with and utilized such technology on a daily basis. To ensure the game's popularity, Capcom marketed Battle Network alongside an afternoon anime adaptation, emphasized head-to-head matches between players, and provided fans with exclusive content via special events.|$|E

"Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> the corner store" [...] with the same sense of mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work.

500|$|Moffat and Vertue became {{interested}} in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 film Atonement. The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. [...] "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, [...] "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, [...] "There's a great charge <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> playing him, because {{of the volume of}} words in your head and the speed of thought—you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is {{one step ahead of the}} audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." [...] Piers Wenger, head of drama at BBC Cymru Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as [...] "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like [...] "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that [...] "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". Moffat turned the character [...] "more Victorian" [...] in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's [...] "beautiful voice" [...] to make it sound like [...] "he's giving a lecture".|$|E
500|$|Ghost in the Shell {{gained an}} {{aggregate}} rating of 78.50% at GameRankings, {{which would be}} a mostly positive metascore. AllGame praised the graphics, sound and gameplay; the review stated, [...] "Even with plenty of eye candy and strong audio, a game is nothing without actually being fun to play and as you've probably guessed, Ghost in the Shell supplies the fun, whether you're familiar with the license or not." [...] GameSpot rated the game as good, eulogizing the controls as [...] "simple... most people will take to them like a fish to water" [...] and praising the animation sequences. GameFan reviewers cited the game's unique wall-scaling mechanics and noted how it lives up to the name of the Ghost in the Shell series. IGN said that the game was great, faithful to its manga counterpart, stating that [...] "the techno music, including tracks from artists like Derrick May and Hardfloor, is superb," [...] but adding that [...] "the levels aren't incredibly difficult, and don't really encourage replay." [...] Super GamePower reviewed the game short after the movie was released in Brazil, stating that the opening animation was better than the drawing of the film. In Russia, Velikij Drakon lauded the orientation system, the game graphics and the overall design, highlighting the unlockable animation scenes. NowGamer praised the gameplay mechanics but criticized the option to unlock, stating, [...] "The tremendous feeling of agility <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>from</b> Ghost In The Shell and the slick weapons is where the fun comes from. But it's a tough game and playing for more scenes of new footage will not be compelling enough for a country in which anime is a cult industry and not a national fixation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, the {{incident}} has caused some debates {{because it is}} rare that a Christian black metal band gets signed to a secular label.
