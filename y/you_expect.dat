Higgins saw on 20/20 about young Japanese girls who would lure older businessmen to a location {{with the promise of}} meaningful conversation, only to assault and mug the men with a gang of other girls. This led him to wonder, [...] "What if the person <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> to be the predator is not who <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> it to be? What if it's the other person?" [...] He then hired writer Brian Nelson to flesh out the idea. Due to the controversial nature of the work, the budget was kept under $1 million so that the production company would not ask to change anything.|$|E

The Malay press, mostly owned by UMNO, also ran articles condemning the questioning of the social contract. Lim responded: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> non-Malays to pour their hearts and souls into the country, and to one day die for it if you keep harping on this?

It is a curious, a novel thing; in a sense a study in aphasia - one of those weird plots <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> a Thanhouser picture to unfold." [...] The film likely had a wide national release as evidenced by numerous advertisements, including theaters in Maryland, Indiana, and Kansas. Some advertisements for The Restoration were not specific and may refer to D. W. Griffith's 1909 The Restoration. These advertisements are noted in Oregon, Washington, and North Carolina.|$|E

[...] The video plays out in a post-apocalyptic world. It begins with the band's three members waking up from sleeping {{in the middle of}} a street, appearing to be homeless. The men then walk way in the woods while shots of homeless people are interspersed. Several people are seen carrying torches in the woods and are soon joined by the band.
