500|$|Gaven {{has had a}} {{prominent}} career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told TheaterWeek in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that [...] "the nature {{of rock and roll}} is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and do it at the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of losing the impact." [...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano." [...] Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a sound technician at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that [...] "We always turn off the mikes when you sing" [...] because she did not need amplification.|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

"Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of people forgetting about you; that's the sad thing about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor." [...] In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, [...] "Go Big and Go Home" [...] included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series.|$|E

[...] "You ran her {{on to the}} rocks, Dick--which was unseamanlike in <b>the</b> extreme--at least <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> dear aground on {{a fallen}} tree and, sitting down beside it, asked it to become Mrs Darvall, and the amiable creature agreed, eh?" ...|$|R

2500|$|As an alumnus of a Quaker-affiliated college, {{he avoided}} {{military}} service during the Vietnam War by registering {{as a religious}} conscientious objector. Notwithstanding his father's vocation, Barry decided [...] "early on" [...] {{that he was an}} atheist. He said, [...] "The problem with writing about religion is that <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the visual}} look of Nicholas' wealthy lifestyle, Fincher and the film's cinematographer Harris Savides wanted a [...] "rich and supple" [...] feel and took {{references}} from films like The Godfather which featured visually appealing locations with ominous intentions lurking under the surface. According to Fincher, once Nicholas left his protective world, he and Savides would let fluorescents, neon signs and other {{lights in the}} background be overexposed to let [...] "things get a bit wilder out in the real world". For The Game, Fincher employed a Technicolor printing process known as ENR which lent a smoother look to the night sequences. The challenge for him was how much deception could the audience take and [...] "will they go for 45 minutes of red herrings?" [...] To this end, he tried to stage scenes as simply as possible and use a single camera because [...] "with multiple cameras, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of boring people with coverage".|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{is it that}} {{dares to}} {{countermand}} my orders? Is it not enough that <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> ship into danger, but you must interfere to keep her there? If another word----" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{ought to}} have more attendants, Beth," [...] said Louise, {{approaching}} her cousin. [...] "Won't <b>you</b> <b>run</b> into <b>the</b> house and see if Martha can't spare {{one or two more}} maids?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Certainly. You {{ought not}} to let your garden get out of order; and, if you do it, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of all {{accidents}} that may prevent your working during the three days.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but I'd rather 'ave that {{uncertainty}} than see <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of bein' drownded in a light'ouse," [...] said Mrs Potter, glancing uneasily at the window, which rattled violently as {{the fury}} of the gale increased.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Jackson don't {{get back}} in time next summer," [...] Mrs. Durgin said, {{in one of the}} talks she had with the girl, [...] "I guess I shall have to let Jeff and <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> house alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Thorn agreed. [...] "But the {{important}} thing is you saw this and didn't lose your nerve. Anyhow, if you had lost it, I couldn't have blamed you; I blame myself for my confounded thoughtlessness that let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk.

6000|$|... 'My love, {{that story}} won't do. If Mrs. Manston was burnt, Cytherea, whom you love better than me, {{could have been}} {{compelled}} to live with you as your lawful wife.

6000|$|So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine {{reflected}} an instant, with knitted brows--she {{found it}} needful {{to smooth the}} way for an intrusion.

60|$|This {{question}} of realism, let it then be clearly understood, regards {{not in the}} least degree the fundamental truth, but only the technical method, of a work of art. Be as ideal or as abstract as you please, you will be none the less veracious; but if you be weak, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of being tedious and inexpressive; and if you be very strong and honest, you may chance upon a masterpiece.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{it is with}} Dippy today, {{and last}} night <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> from <b>the</b> voice of a crazy Loon who isn't crazy at all, but likes to make people think he is," [...] {{concluded}} Grandfather Frog.|$|R

6000|$|Klaus fell {{in beside}} him. Tasso walked behind, her pistol held alertly. [...] "Major, I've {{been meaning to}} ask you something," [...] Klaus said. [...] "How did <b>you</b> <b>run</b> across <b>the</b> David? The one that was tagging you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be candid," [...] {{answered}} Wyllard. [...] "For one thing, {{you held}} on when I was slipping off the trestle {{that day in}} British Columbia. For another, you'll make nothing of your own holding, and if <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> Range as {{it ought to be}} run it will put a good many dollars into your pocket, besides relieving me of a big anxiety. If you're to marry Miss Ismay, I'd sooner she was made reasonably comfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{when he was}} got {{up to the top}} of the hill, {{there came}} two men running amain: the name of the one was Timorous, and of the other Mistrust; to whom Christian said, [...] "Sirs, what's the matter? <b>You</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> wrong way."

60|$|If {{the wind}} should blow when the cold is intense, no man dare face it-- {{he would be}} certain to be frost-bitten. The {{parts of the body}} that are most easily frozen are the ears, the chin, the cheek-bones, the nose, the heels, fingers, and toes. The {{freezing}} of any part begins with a pricking sensation. When this occurs at the point of your nose, it is time to give earnest attention to that feature, else <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> risk of having it shortened. The best way to recover it is to rub it well, and to keep carefully away from the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] {{he whispered}} swiftly into her ear, {{speaking}} in English, [...] "I {{have come to}} rescue you. Go through with this farce, it means nothing. Then, if I bid <b>you,</b> <b>run</b> for <b>the</b> drawbridge into the slave-camp." ...|$|R
