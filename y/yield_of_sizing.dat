40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to increase the production <b>of</b> seed potato <b>size</b> 31 - 60 grams by applying gibberellic acid (GA 3). Seeds that passed their dormancy period were dipped in gibberellic acid solutions (10, 15 and 20 mg/L) for 15 minutes a day before planting. Control seeds were dipped in water. Seeds were then air dried for 24 hours. Seeds were planted in plots with length, width and height of 150 x 100 x 30 cm respectively with planting space 20 cm and planting depth 15 cm. The design was randomized block with four replications. The results showed that gibberellic acid enhanced shoot emergence. Gibberellic acid increased stem number, tuber number and yield per plant.
