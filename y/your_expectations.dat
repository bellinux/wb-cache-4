Richard Schickel of Time magazine disregarded the request and revealed Rusty's innocence in his review. He wrote, [...] "Carolyn's murderer has an excellent motive both for killing her... But {{it is hard to}} accept the possibility that the real perpetrator would leave his escape from the trap entirely to chance." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel surmised, [...] "It's not that Warner Bros. is actually concerned that reviewers will tip the solution to the murder mystery. It's that the studio wants to further the impression that the movie is full of surprises." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "Even if you think you know what the solution is, the performances are so clever and the screenplay... is so subtle that it could well turn out that <b>your</b> <b>expectations</b> are wrong." ...|$|E

[...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after she asked if Darryl could swim. A variety of reviewers found the cold-opening, featuring Jim pranking Dwight by placing meatballs in his desk in an attempt to make Stanley laugh, funny.|$|E

[...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put <b>your</b> <b>expectations</b> aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E

Eglee explained that he and Cameron began {{with the idea that}} they could do a [...] "hip hop youth ensemble thing", noting that [...] "hip hop had become the dominant influence in the country [...] in the world" [...] and that they saw an opportunity to give the future of Dark Angel the soundtrack of contemporary American popular culture. In the soundtrack's liner notes, Eglee writes:Reminiscent of another time and place... that part of the Bronx in the late 1970s known as Fort Apache: a place that for white America, defined lack and limitation, violence and hopelessness. What white Americans couldn't see or hear then was the beautiful thing being birthed there, which, years later, would {{come to be known as}} Hip Hop.... This album remembers the foundations of Hip Hop as it contemplates its future. [...] Randy Gerston said that because of the near future setting of the series, he avoided any major hit songs as these would not sound futuristic. This gave them the opportunity to discover new talent instead. The album features predominately female hip hop and neo soul artists whose lyrics typically [...] "focus on the expression of female agency and power – particularly with regard to sexuality." [...] It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier of AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars. He noted the lack of major artists on the album and commented that it [...] "seems to be a female-orientated soundtrack, perhaps because of the show's female lead character". Birchmeier said many of the songs were [...] "quite impressive" [...] and that it [...] "exceeds <b>your</b> <b>expectations</b> for a television show soundtrack".|$|E

About 2001, Nolan said: [...] "The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of <b>your</b> <b>expectations</b> while watching a film. So you can't make any film in a vacuum. We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend 2001 doesn't exist when you're making Interstellar." [...] He also said that Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979) influenced Interstellars production design: [...] "Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used—as used and as real as {{the world we live}} in." [...] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced [...] "elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water".
