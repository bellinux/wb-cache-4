500|$|On Saturday night, the {{alphabetical}} {{roll call}} of the states to present nominees was conducted. The first candidate for the Republican nomination emerged when the Michigan delegation was in roll call. James F. Joy, the seventy-year-old president of the Michigan Central Railroad, gave the speech nominating Blaine. Joy was not a practiced public speaker, and he stumbled and rushed through his nomination speech, [...] "because we are all now impatient for the voting." [...] Joy ended his speech by nominating [...] "James S. Blaine" [...] for the Republican ticket. Promptly, a number of delegates <b>yelled</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "G! G. Blaine, you fool!" [...] The delegates from the next state in the roll call, Minnesota, nominated Senator William Windom as their [...] "favorite son" [...] candidate. Nine states later, Roscoe Conkling of New York {{stepped up to the}} podium to present his nomination for Ulysses S. Grant.|$|E
2500|$|As Smithsonian {{magazine}} stated, [...] "Violent confrontations were {{a recurring}} theme in Cobb's life." [...] He {{is thought to have}} committed several violent assaults during his playing time. [...] Reported victims of his sudden uncontrollable rages through the years included a black groundskeeper who attempted to shake Cobb's hand, along with his wife, though this story (see above) is now considered dubious at best; as well as a handicapped fan. [...] As he attacked the handicapped man, [...] "someone screamed for Cobb to stop, pointing out that the man had no hands. [...] 'I don't care if he has no feet!' Cobb <b>yelled</b> <b>back,</b> stomping [...] until park police pulled him off." [...] Cobb reported in his autobiography that the handicapped man incurred Cobb's ire by speaking on his mother's [...] "color and morals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jones {{was almost}} back on schedule, running at about [...] toward Vaughan, and {{traveling}} through a [...] left-hand curve that blocked his view. Webb's {{view from the}} left side of the train was better, and he was first to see the red lights of the caboose on the main line. [...] "Oh my Lord, there's something on the main line!" [...] he yelled to Jones. Jones quickly <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> [...] "Jump Sim, jump!" [...] to Webb, who crouched down and jumped from the train, about [...] before impact, and was knocked unconscious by his fall. The last thing Webb heard as he jumped was the long, piercing scream of the whistle as Jones warned anyone still in the freight train looming ahead. He was only two minutes behind schedule.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{just the}} voice of an {{ordinary}} Canadian <b>yelling</b> <b>back</b> at the radio - [...] "You dont speak for me." ...|$|R

50|$|The story {{takes place}} {{primarily}} on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona. Tuba City, Window Rock, Arizona, Phoenix, and Flagstaff are real places there. Chee resides in Shiprock, New Mexico, part of the Reservation. The specific location of the murders is called <b>Yells</b> <b>Back</b> Butte near Black Mesa.|$|R
50|$|Acting Lieutenant Jim Chee finds {{one of his}} {{officers}} nearly dead, with the perpetrator {{standing next to him}} in <b>Yells</b> <b>Back</b> Butte. Retired Lt.

6000|$|... "It's a tidal wave!" [...] <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> Captain Marshall. [...] "There {{has been}} another earthquake, and, most likely, {{some of the}} volcanoes in this {{vicinity}} have become active." ...|$|E
6000|$|Grief put out {{his hand}} and shook. [...] "She's paying for herself!" [...] he <b>yelled</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "The wind's {{shifting}} around to the southward, and we ought to lie easier!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold tight; they're {{bound to}} stop soon, they can't keep this up!" [...] <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> Dave, {{and even as}} he spoke the horses, blowing heavily, slackened up, came to a walk, and then stopped short.|$|E
50|$|Robert, the publisher, calls {{wanting to}} speak to Max about the {{newspaper}}’s future, the newspaper which he feels is falling apart. Robert is yelling and screaming how much he needs to make important decisions with Max’s input. After Paulie in return <b>yells</b> <b>back</b> that Robert is not to disturb Max during this time (not mentioning Max’s troubles in school), she abruptly hangs up on him.|$|R
5000|$|He also faced {{discrimination}} on the field. Swift writes that taunting from the bench was common in Bender's era and that the opposition or the fans often made war whoops or yelled taunts such as [...] "Nig!" [...] or [...] "Back to the reservation!" [...] Bender usually remained calm, sometimes smiling at the insults. After an inning {{in which he had}} pitched particularly well, he might <b>yell</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "Foreigners! Foreigners!" ...|$|R
50|$|Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer {{plan to go}} to the movies, but Jerry {{takes out}} a little time to look at nine years of memories. During the opening scene, Jerry breaks the fourth wall by talking {{directly}} to the audience, while Kramer and George, down the hall {{on their way to the}} movies, are still entirely in character and keep interrupting Jerry by <b>yelling</b> <b>back</b> at him, worried that they'll miss the previews.|$|R
60|$|Montmorency set up {{a furious}} barking, I shrieked, Harris roared; George waved his hat, and <b>yelled</b> <b>back.</b> The lock-keeper rushed out with a drag, under the {{impression}} that somebody had fallen into the lock, and appeared annoyed at finding that no one had.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are bound}} {{to get out and}} you can't stop us!" [...] <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> Gasper Pold, and started to mount the iron ladder with a long wrench. This {{instrument}} he placed under a corner of the hatch and began to pry the wooden barrier upward.|$|E
6000|$|The {{very first}} day we entered the South Pacific we had an adventure. It {{turned out to be}} quite the most {{exciting}} adventure I had ever encountered. It fell about this way. About eight bells of the forenoon watch I heard a hail from the deck, and presently the footsteps of the entire ship's company, from the amount of noise I heard at the ladder. Some one <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> to those who had not yet reached the level of the deck: [...] "It's the raider, the German raider Geier!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep off there!--keep back!" [...] Shorty <b>yelled,</b> falling <b>back</b> on English after futile {{attempts}} {{with the}} little Indian he did know.|$|R
50|$|In a later scene, Xander, Anya {{and their}} two now-teenage kids eat at a {{restaurant}} while the teens fight and Anya bitterly notes Xander's drinking.

Xander, shocked by the visions, is warned by the old man not to marry Anya.|$|R
60|$|A <b>yell</b> came <b>back,</b> {{but what}} was said those above could not make out. Sam's face went white, and he looked inquiringly at Jack Wumble.|$|R
6000|$|... "Through {{my glasses}} I saw {{the slope of}} a hill {{interspersed}} with rare trees and perfectly free from undergrowth. A long decaying building on the summit was half buried in the high grass; the large holes in the peaked roof gaped black from afar; the jungle and the woods made a background. There was no enclosure or fence of any kind; {{but there had been}} one apparently, for near the house half-a-dozen slim posts remained in a row, roughly trimmed, and with their upper ends ornamented with round carved balls. The rails, or whatever there had been between, had disappeared. Of course the forest surrounded all that. The river-bank was clear, and on the waterside I saw a white man under a hat like a cart-wheel beckoning persistently with his whole arm. Examining {{the edge of the forest}} above and below, I was almost certain I could see movements--human forms gliding here and there. I steamed past prudently, then stopped the engines and let her drift down. The man on the shore began to shout, urging us to land. 'We have been attacked,' screamed the manager. 'I know--I know. It's all right,' <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> the other, as cheerful as you please. 'Come along. It's all right. I am glad.' ...|$|E
60|$|For {{another two}} hours I limped forward {{with pain and}} grief--by now I was leaning on Hans' shoulder--up an endless, uncultivated rise clothed with {{euphorbias}} and fern-like cycads. At length we reached its top and found ourselves within a rifle shot of a fenced native village. I suppose that its inhabitants had been warned of our coming by runners from the huts I have mentioned. At any rate the moment we appeared the men, {{to the number of}} thirty or more, poured out of the south gate armed with spears and other weapons and proceeded to ring us round and behave in a very threatening manner. I noticed at once that, although most of them were comparatively light in colour, some of these men partook of the negro characteristics of the Black Kendah from whom we had escaped, to such an extent indeed that this blood was clearly predominant in them. Still, it was also clear that they were deadly foes of this people, for when I shouted out to them that we were the friends of Harût and those who worshipped the Child, they <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> that we were liars. No friends of the Child, they said, came from the country of the Black Kendah, who worshipped the devil Jana. I tried to explain that least of all men in the world did we worship Jana, who had been hunting us for hours, but they would not listen.|$|E
6000|$|Hours passed. They were {{sheltered}} by {{the heavy}} inclination {{of the ship}} from the wind that rushed in one long unbroken moan above their heads, but cold rain showers fell at times into the uneasy calm of their refuge. Under the torment of that new infliction a pair of shoulders would writhe a little. Teeth chattered. The sky was clearing, and bright sunshine gleamed over the ship. After every burst of battering seas, vivid and fleeting rainbows arched over the drifting hull in the flick of sprays. The gale was ending in a clear blow, which gleamed and cut like a knife. Between two bearded shellbacks Charley, fastened with somebody's long muffler to a deck ring-bolt, wept quietly, with rare tears wrung out by bewilderment, cold, hunger, and general misery. One of his neighbours punched him in the ribs asking roughly:--"What's the matter with your cheek? In fine weather there's no holding you, youngster." [...] Turning about with prudence he worked himself out of his coat and threw it over the boy. The other man closed up, muttering:--"'Twill make a bloomin' man of you, sonny." [...] They flung their arms over and pressed against him. Charley drew his feet up and his eyelids dropped. Sighs were heard, as men, perceiving {{that they were not}} to be [...] "drowned in a hurry," [...] tried easier positions. Mr. Creighton, who had hurt his leg, lay amongst us with compressed lips. Some fellows belonging to his watch set about securing him better. Without a word or a glance he lifted his arms one after another to facilitate the operation, and not a muscle moved in his stern, young face. They asked him with solicitude:--"Easier now, sir?" [...] He answered with a curt:--"That'll do." [...] He was a hard young officer, but many of his watch used to say they liked him well enough because he had [...] "such a gentlemanly way of damning us up and down the deck." [...] Others unable to discern such fine shades of refinement, respected him for his smartness. For {{the first time since the}} ship had gone on her beam ends Captain Allistoun gave a short glance down at his men. He was almost upright--one foot against the side of the skylight, one knee on the deck; and with the end of the vang round his waist swung back and forth with his gaze fixed ahead, watchful, like a man looking out for a sign. Before his eyes the ship, with half her deck below water, rose and fell on heavy seas that rushed from under her flashing in the cold sunshine. We began to think she was wonderfully buoyant--considering. Confident voices were heard shouting:--"She'll do, boys!" [...] Belfast exclaimed with fervour:--"I would giv' a month's pay for a draw at a pipe!" [...] One or two, passing dry tongues on their salt lips, muttered something about a [...] "drink of water." [...] The cook, as if inspired, scrambled up with his breast against the poop water-cask and looked in. There was a little at the bottom. He yelled, waving his arms, and two men began to crawl backwards and forwards with the mug. We had a good mouthful all round. The master shook his head impatiently, refusing. When it came to Charley one of his neighbours shouted:--"That bloom-in' boy's asleep." [...] He slept as though he had been dosed with narcotics. They let him be. Singleton held to the wheel with one hand while he drank, bending down to shelter his lips from the wind. Wamibo had to be poked and yelled at before he saw the mug held before his eyes. Knowles said sagaciously:--"It's better'n a tot o' rum." [...] Mr. Baker grunted:--"Thank ye." [...] Mr. Creighton drank and nodded. Donkin gulped greedily, glaring over the rim. Belfast made us laugh when with grimacing mouth he shouted:--"Pass it this way. We're all taytottlers here." [...] The master, presented with the mug again by a crouching man, who screamed up at him:--"We all had a drink, captain," [...] groped for it without ceasing to look ahead, and handed it back stiffly as though he could not spare half a glance away from the ship. Faces brightened. We shouted to the cook:--"Well done, doctor!" [...] He sat to leeward, propped by the water-cask and <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> abundantly, but the seas were breaking in thunder just then, and we only caught snatches that sounded like: [...] "Providence" [...] and [...] "born again." [...] He was at his old game of preaching. We made friendly but derisive gestures at him, and from below he lifted one arm, holding on with the other, moved his lips; he beamed up to us, straining his voice--earnest, and ducking his head before the sprays.|$|E
5000|$|The cover {{depicts the}} opening intro {{as well as}} the first track, in which Slim Shady awakens Eminem and orders him {{to look in the mirror}} to see that he is [...] "nothing without him". Eminem resists and screams in the {{background}} while Slim Shady <b>yells</b> <b>back</b> and laughs at Eminem's horror. By the second track, Eminem and Slim Shady become the same person. Eminem is also ordered by [...] "Slim Shady" [...] to look into the mirror, and the sound of glass breaking is heard, alluding once again to the cover.|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Weingarten of The Village Voice {{remarked that}} [...] "If 2009's I Blame You was a stripped-down, bratty MC5 tantrum, then {{follow-up}} Moody, Standard and Poor {{is a more}} focused Wipers implosion. With surf licks and lo-fi bristle poking through their hooks, it's a gritty blast with a sunny center." [...] Joe Gross of Spin commented that [...] "There's certainly nothing fashion-forward on their second album, and thank goodness. These indie lifers rededicate themselves {{to the sound of}} Froberg's gritty <b>yell,</b> <b>backed</b> by a no-bullshit rhythm section, and interlocking, almost clean guitars. The songs are powerfully wiry and declamatory".|$|R
50|$|Szasz's {{heckling}} visibly rattled {{players on}} multiple occasions. He once heckled the Mariners' Bret Boone so viciously that when Boone struck out, he threw down his batting helmet and started <b>yelling</b> <b>back</b> at Szasz. In another instance, outfielder José Guillén offered Szasz an autographed baseball bat {{if he would}} stop heckling him in a game. Szasz says he didn't heckle with profanity, nor did he insult a player about a personal thing such as weight or height. He says he tried to only heckle a player on their baseball ability. Although rare, Szasz also heckled opposing pitchers.|$|R
5000|$|Francis Ford Coppola {{had some}} {{characters}} in The Godfather use untranslated profanity. For instance, when Sonny Corleone {{found out that}} Paulie Gatto had sold out his father to the Barzinis, he called Gatto [...] "that stronz'". Also, when Connie Corleone learned Carlo Rizzi was cheating on her, Carlo snapped, [...] "Hey, vaffancul', eh?", Connie <b>yelled</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "I'll vaffancul' you!".|$|E
5000|$|Chester also {{occasionally}} {{accompanied the}} Dodgers on short road trips. In Philadelphia, {{one of her}} counterparts for the Phillies started to yell at and berate Dixie Walker, calling him a has-been. [...] "Youre all through!" [...] yelled the Phillies fan. Chester quieted him with one comment. [...] "Oh, yeah?" [...] she <b>yelled</b> <b>back.</b> [...] "Look where he is, and look where you are!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The Mellow Notes - Four Barber Shop singers {{that all}} fell for Carey. She was not {{interested}} in them. But when they offered to take her to dinner, she accepted. But during the time when they were singing and dragging her out the door to come to dinner, they were singing [...] "We promise this date will really be tops!". So she <b>yelled</b> <b>back</b> to the twins (singing); [...] "If I'm not back by 10, call the cops!!!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Teams {{play one}} at a time on an {{inflatable}} soccer setup. The child is the penalty kicker while the adult is the goalkeeper (dressed up with [...] "comedy boots" [...] and [...] "comedy gloves" [...] as Lisa put it). The child scores 10 points per goal in a 45-second time limit. Dave would blow a whistle to start and end this game (in addition to the horn), and prior to the start, in the style of Bob the Builder, would always yell, [...] "CAN HE/SHE KICK IT?" [...] The audience would <b>yell</b> <b>back,</b> [...] "YES, HE/SHE CAN!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ryan {{had been}} criticizing Gilbride's [...] "run and shoot", {{referring}} {{to it as}} the [...] "chuck and duck." [...] Ryan thought that last-minute defensive stands lost him two players to injuries when the offense could have simply run the clock out. At {{the end of the first}} half in the game against the Jets, Gilbride called a pass play, and when Cody Carlson fumbled the snap, Ryan started yelling at Gilbride, who then started walking towards Ryan, <b>yelling</b> <b>back.</b> When they were at arm's length, [...] "Ryan ... attempted to punch Gilbride in the jaw" [...] before linebacker Keith McCants and several other Oilers players separated them.|$|R
5000|$|A lone witness {{staying at}} the hotel was interviewed by The Washington Post disputing the {{official}} police statement. In describing the assault, she claimed that Caricofe [...] "didn't <b>yell</b> <b>back</b> or attack but refused to lay down and kept running around". There were at least ten police officers on top of Caricofe, who put [...] "something resembling a dog collar" [...] around his neck just before the wrestler lost consciousness, and did not perform CPR after he had stopped breathing. Jay Hancock, then public information officer for the Ocean City Police Department, subsequently wrote a rebuttal defending the actions of his department and also criticized {{the credibility of the}} witness who chose to speak out anonymously.|$|R
