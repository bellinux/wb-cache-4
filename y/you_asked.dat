5|$|Little {{was seen}} of Katsura {{for the next}} few years. She made 30 {{exhibition}} appearances in 1958, and went on a one-week exhibition engagement the following year with Harold Worst, but did not compete in any professional tournaments. In 1959, she made two television appearances on ABC's <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> for It, and one on the CBS primetime television hit What's My Line?. Katsura returned to competition in 1961, playing a challenge match for the World Three-Cushion title against Worst, then reigning world champion, and was defeated by him. Katsura disappeared from the sport thereafter, only making a brief impromptu appearance in 1976. She moved back to Japan in about 1990 and died in 1995.|$|E
25|$|In addition, she {{was given}} overdue tribute in 1958, on This is Your Life with Ralph Edwards. It brought a tearful reunion with Helen's old friend, actress Fifi D'Orsay, and a lifelong fan who once sent her money when she was down on her luck. Renewed {{interest}} in Helen brought her a one-record contract with MGM Records and appearances on I've Got a Secret and <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> for It. She sang {{on all of these}} TV shows.|$|E

500|$|On March 1, 1959, Katsura {{appeared}} on CBS' popular primetime television show, What's My Line? The show {{was in the}} format of a guessing game, in which a panel attempted to determine the line (occupation), {{or in the case}} of a famous [...] "mystery guest", the identity of the contestant. After she signed in using Japanese characters on a chalk board, show officials listed Katsura's occupation for the audience as [...] "Professional Billiard Player (World's Women's Champion)". Panelist Arlene Francis was successful in guessing Katsura's occupation, though she admitted that she had read about her but said she had never seen her picture. Later that month Katsura made a guest appearance on ABC's <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> For It, going behind the scenes of westerns to show how television productions set up and filmed a covered wagon rolling over and crashing on cue. She appeared again on <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> For It in a November 25, 1960 broadcast, this time operating in her bailiwick, demonstrating trick shots for the camera.|$|E

500|$|In the US three {{publishers}} {{turned the}} book down before Macmillan Publishing Co offered Fleming a deal. Casino Royale was published on 23 March 1954 in the US, but sales were poor, totalling only 4,000 copies {{across the entire}} US {{during the course of}} the year. When the novel was released as a US paperback in 1955, it was re-titled by publisher American Popular Library; Fleming's suggestions for a new title, The Double-O Agent and The Deadly Gamble, were disregarded in favour of <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> for It, but this marketing ploy failed to raise the interest. The Popular Library version also changed Bond's name, calling him [...] "Jimmy Bond".|$|E

500|$|Ramirez {{talked about}} how the second season would be {{different}} from the first, saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering [...] "if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes" [...] and because of the positive fan reaction to that ("we got a loud answer of 'yes'"), approached the second season with the mindset, [...] "you wanted grounded and wanted dark, here’s Elektra and Punisher. <b>You</b> <b>asked</b> for it." [...] Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to [...] "peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world.

500|$|Initially Vic Flick, who {{had played}} lead guitar on Monty Norman's {{original}} 007 theme, and Eric Clapton were asked to write and perform the theme song to Licence to Kill and they produced a theme to match Dalton's gritty performance, but the producers turned it down and instead Gladys Knight's song and performance was chosen. The song (one of the longest to ever {{be used in a}} Bond film) was based on the [...] "horn line" [...] from Goldfinger, seen as an homage to the film of the same name, which required royalty payments to the original writers. The song gave Knight her first British top-ten hit since 1977. The end credits feature the Top 10 R hit [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> Me To", sung by Patti LaBelle.|$|E

[...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit.

Ted's affable maternal grandfather, John F. [...] "Honey Fitz" [...] Fitzgerald, was a former mayor of Boston, a congressman, and an early political and personal influence. Ted spent his four high school years at Milton Academy prep school in Massachusetts, where he received B and C grades and finished 36th {{in a class of}} 56 when he graduated in 1950. Ted did well at high school football there, playing on the varsity his last two years; the school's headmaster later described his play as: [...] "absolutely fearless ... he would have tackled an express train to New York if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> ... he loved contact sports". He also played on the tennis team and was in the drama, debate, and glee clubs.|$|E
500|$|... "See You Again" [...] is a pop rock {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and ten seconds. The songs {{contains}} numerous influences from electronic, new wave, and techno music. The song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time and has a fast tempo of 138 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor and Cyrus' vocals span one octave, from G3 to A4. Throughout the song, Cyrus' edgy and sultry vocal performance maintains in the contralto range. The lyrics of [...] "See You Again" [...] are about a teenage romance. In verses, Cyrus discusses her sentiments and perceptions about her love interest, such as believing the couple had previously encountered in a previous incarnation. [...] "See You Again"'s refrains detail previous scenes of an encounter between the couple: [...] "The last time I freaked out / I just kept looking down / I st-st-stuttered when <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> me what I’m thinking ‘bout."

500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that accused the character's bodies of being lifeless, despite the game's use of motion capture, Brendan McNamara, the game's director and writer, stated {{in an interview}} with Eurogamer, [...] "People were saying people were dead from the neck down. That's because we had all this animation in the neck and all this animation in the face, but the clothes don't move. Once you get to the level that people can actually see that level of realism, then people expect to see clothes moving {{and the rest of the}} body moving in a way we can't replicate in video games." [...] In the same interview McNamara also responded to queries about why Phelps sometimes responds with particularly aggressive lines of dialogue during interrogation scenes. [...] "It's funny. A lot of people say Aaron turns into a psycho. When we originally wrote the game the questions <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> were coax, force and lie. It was actually force because it was a more aggressive answer. That's the way we recorded it. But when the game came out it was truth, doubt or lie. Everyone always says Aaron on the second question is a psycho. So that's not his fault." ...|$|E

In 1991, Dion sang with Peabo Bryson in the song [...] "Beauty and the Beast". It became her second top ten Billboard Hot 100 single, first top ten entry in the United Kingdom, and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well the Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Her following single from Celine Dion, [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Asked</b> Me To" [...] peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the chart in Canada.

500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if <b>you</b> <b>asked.</b> I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character." ...|$|E
