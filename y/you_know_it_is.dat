William Coddington rose, asserting, [...] "I do not see any clear witness against her, and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," [...] ending with, [...] "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law {{of the country that}} she hath broke, and {{therefore}} deserve no censure." [...] The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. [...] Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. [...] Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. [...] Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, [...] "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." [...] Winthrop responded, [...] "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of Silent Hill 2 {{began in}} June 1999, {{directly}} {{after the completion}} of its predecessor. The game was created by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. The story was conceived by CGI director Takayoshi Sato, who based it on Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and Punishment (1866), with individual members of the team collaborating on the actual scenario. The main writing was done by Hiroyuki Owaku and Sato who provided the dialog for the female characters. Silent Hill 2s budget has been estimated at US$7–10 million by Sato, in contrast with the previous installment's estimated cost of US$3–5 million. The decision to produce a sequel to Silent Hill was partly a financial one, as it had been commercially successful, and partly a creative one, as the team had faced difficulties while working on the original game. The team was given a small window to settle on a platform. As it was unable to gather information on the then-unannounced GameCube and Xbox consoles, they began production of the game for the PlayStation 2. Producer Akihiro Imamura stated that the decision was also influenced by [...] "a wish from the business section that we move rapidly on the PS2. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> currently the market focus". Imamura read all comments about the original game and kept them in mind while working on Silent Hill 2. He estimated that a total of fifty people worked on the game: while the creative team from the first game remained, they had to bring in thirty people from Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Developed at the same time, the PlayStation 2 version of Silent Hill 2 and its Xbox port debuted at the March 2001 Tokyo Game Show to positive reactions.|$|E
