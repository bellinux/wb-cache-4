Christmas tree, Christmas ham, herring and candle lights are {{just as important as the}} advent candlestick. The advent candlestick help <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> Christmas <b>feeling</b> during <b>the</b> countdown. In this report the work with a new advent candlestick concept can be followed step by step. A lot of information was needed in the beginning. By doing some research, surveys and interviews the ground was established for further work. After studying Sagaforms design and already existing products the idea generation could take place. With a lot of different methods and two workshops groups many ideas were generated. For evaluation of the solutions they were shown for two focus groups and sent in a survey to potential customers, also Sagaform have had their say about the ideas. The four winning solutions were taken to the weighting to later pick out a winning concept that was taken for further development. In further development, the selected concept was improved. Some parts were removed and others added. In order to easily change the details of construction, a CAD model was created. It became very easy to quickly change the size and configuration to adapt the model after the stipulated requirements and fire regulations that exists. While making the concept better, materials were also up for consideration. By thinking about the materials while developing, the dimensions could be adjusted after it. When the solution began to feel ready, simulated materials were put on the CAD-model to be able to see how the final advent candlestick would look like. To get a better sense of shape and size of the candlestick a physical model was created. The final solution consists of a round base with a bar in the middle. The bar holds four candle holders which can be rotated to any position. It allows the customer to change the appearance of the candlestick until the customer is satisfied. Finally, recommendations, which included some requests for packaging, were documented. Validerat; 20120614 (anonymous...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first section}} of the novel, [...] "Ancestry", {{sets the tone for}} the rest of the story. We see the ancestral ground work for the {{development}} of Oliver's mental conflict, his dedication to duty. In section seven of Ancestry, Harriet Alden stares down on baby Oliver and describes the portraits of four generations of family, consisting of clergymen, lawyers, merchants, and physicians. It seems as if we are being predisposed to Oliver’s inevitable struggle. Oliver's relationship to duty goes back to his grandfather Nathaniel Alden who seems to only do things out of a sense of duty. It is stated in the opening scene [...] "If he Alden went out at all it was to perform some duty, such as to ascertain the state of his financial affairs." [...] Peter is more inclined to be a free spirit and involve himself with pleasurable things. This gets him into trouble with his older sibling and is the catalyst for Peter’s adventures around the world. It is also important to note how Nathaniel feels about interacting with others. He sees this as nothing more than mere gossip, and the pleasantries of conversation are nothing more than staged mechanical mannerisms. We see this when both Peter and Nathaniel attend one of the Unitarian Church services. When Nathaniel is interacting with <b>the</b> others, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> distinct <b>feeling</b> that he only does so out of duty. Piety is another form of duty for our dearly drab Nathaniel. He enjoys his Sunday ritual of going to church because, “if acquaintances met there they could decently ignore each other, or at most pass with a mute bow.” This confirms Nathaniel’s anti-social personality, being that he rarely ever leaves his home in the first place. Even art for Nathaniel is a duty he declares for those who can afford it. He believes one ought to encourage art in a new country regardless of the quality. He possesses countless works of art which he generously donates to museums then keeps the letters of gratitude to, “refute any possible insinuation that he was a miser”, which his murdered father was accused of being. Nathaniel is undoubtedly incapable of any raw emotion and relies on his sense of duty and tradition to serve as sufficient emotional constructs. When the conundrum was proposed by Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, why couldn’t Nathaniel Alden open the blinds or light the gas in his house, he suggests, because he might see the pictures. This cleverly states what Nathaniel truly is, a fraudulent being.|$|R
40|$|Someone {{who told}} me he was a friend asked me {{to talk to you about}} "any single {{important}} aspect of air cargo" and the booby trap I suddenly stumbled into was the difficulty of sticking to a single subject from the many delectable debates currently raging in the airline industry. I would be delighted to loose a torrent of thoughts on a pallet load of air cargo topics such as a participant's critique of air cargo deregulation, a swimmer's eye-view of the cargo wave of the future, and a dirty-picture candid-camera snapshot of the love-hate relationship of those strange bedfellows, cargo wholesalers and retailers. [...] It also would be fun to turn over rocks in the snake-infested field of air cargo marketing, and bounce around among the various rubbery definitions of market elasticity. But, unfortunately, time won't permit the pleasure of serving up a melange of these tidbits, because each ought to be stewed separately in its own juice over a slow fire and presented to you with the proper condiments in order to be savored fully, in justice to it, and to you. So, I'm forced to select a single subject in spite of the great temptation to wander these various enticing realms, mixing metaphors as I go. The single subject I've selected is intermodal air-surface movement of cargo. The major question involved is whether it is economically efficient to utilize special 8 x 8 x 20 -ft intermodal containers in the airplane and over the road. You may say, "how dull can <b>you</b> <b>get!</b> ", because this may sound to you like a pretty dull subject. But, I trust you'll find such is not the case. This subject involves plenty of controversy and strong opinions. Furthermore, it will give you a real live air cargo problem that is still being worked out in the field, to which you can apply your own judgment. The inputs to its economic analysis, such as labor, fuel costs, and customer perceptions, are constantly changing and assuming differing proportions in the equation, so your analysis and recommendation can be just as valid and effective as one being done by someone who gets paid for doing it. If <b>you</b> begin to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> that I'm about to present you with a "case history", eschew the thought.

60|$|XXIV. I {{believe the}} right {{question}} to ask, respecting all ornament, is simply this: Was it done with enjoyment--was the carver happy while he was about it? It may be the hardest work possible, and the harder because so much pleasure was taken in it; {{but it must have}} been happy too, or it will not be living. How much of the stone mason's toil this condition would exclude I hardly venture to consider, but the condition is absolute. There is a Gothic church lately built near Rouen, vile enough, indeed, in its general composition, but excessively rich in detail; many of the details are designed with taste, and all evidently by a man who has studied old work closely. But it is all as dead as leaves in December; there is not one tender touch, not one warm stroke, on the whole façade. The men who did it hated it, and were thankful when it was done. And so long as they do so they are merely loading your walls with shapes of clay: the garlands of everlastings in Père la Chaise are more cheerful ornaments. <b>You</b> cannot <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> by paying for it--money will not buy life. I am not sure even that <b>you</b> can <b>get</b> it by watching or waiting for it. It is true that here and there a workman may be found who has it in him, but he does not rest contented in the inferior work--he struggles forward into an Academician; and from the mass of available handicraftsmen the power is gone--how recoverable I know not: this only I know, that all expense devoted to sculptural ornament, in the present condition of that power, comes literally under the head of Sacrifice for the sacrifice's sake, or worse. I believe the only manner of rich ornament that is open to us is the geometrical color-mosaic, and that much might result from our strenuously taking up this mode of design. But, at all events, one thing we have in our power--the doing without machine ornament and cast-iron work. All the stamped metals, and artificial stones, and imitation woods and bronzes, over the invention of which we hear daily exultation--all the short, and cheap, and easy ways of doing that whose difficulty is its honor--are just so many new obstacles in our already encumbered road. They will not make one of us happier or wiser--they will extend neither the pride of judgment nor the privilege of enjoyment. They will only make us shallower in our understandings, colder in our hearts, and feebler in our wits. And most justly. For we are not sent into this world to do any thing into which we cannot put our hearts. We have certain work to do for our bread, and that is to be done strenuously; other work to do for our delight, and that is to be done heartily: neither is to be done by halves or shifts, but with a will; and what is not worth this effort is not to be done at all. Perhaps all {{that we have to do}} is meant for nothing more than an exercise of the heart and of the will, and is useless in itself; but, at all events, the little use it has may well be spared if it is not worth putting our hands and our strength to. It does not become our immortality to take an ease inconsistent with its authority, nor to suffer any instruments with which it can dispense, to come between it and the things it rules: and he who would form the creations of his own mind by any other instrument than his own hand, would, also, if he might, give grinding organs to Heaven's angels, to make their music easier. There is dreaming enough, and earthiness enough, and sensuality enough in human existence without our turning the few glowing moments of it into mechanism; and since our life must at the best be but a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away, let it at least appear as a cloud in the height of Heaven, not as the thick darkness that broods over the blast of the Furnace, and rolling of the Wheel.|$|R
