30|$|A Breast Cancer Outcomes {{model was}} {{developed}} at the ONCOTYROL research center to evaluate personalized test-treatment strategies in Austria. The goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a new 21 -gene assay (ODX) when {{used in conjunction with}} the Adjuvant! Online (AO) decision aid to support personalized decisions about use of adjuvant chemotherapy in early-stage breast cancer patients in Austria. We applied a validated discrete-event-simulation model to a hypothetical cohort of 50  years old women over a lifetime horizon. The test-treatment strategies of interest were defined using three-letter acronyms. The first (second, third) letter indicates whether patients with a low (intermediate, high) risk according to AO were tested using ODX (<b>Y</b> <b>yes,</b> N no). The main outcomes were life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs and cost effectiveness. Robustness of the results was tested in sensitivity analyses. Results were compared to a Canadian analysis conducted by the Toronto Health Economics and Technology Assessment Collaborative (THETA). Five of eight strategies were dominated (i.e., more costly and less effective: NNY, NYN, YNN, YNY, YYN). The base-case analysis shows that YYY (ODX provided to all patients) is the most effective strategy and is cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 15, 700 EUR per QALY gained. These results are sensitive to changes in the probabilities of distant recurrence, age and costs of chemotherapy. The results of the base-case analysis were comparable to the THETA results. Based on our analyses, using ODX in addition to AO is effective and cost effective in all women in Austria. The development of future genetic tests may require alternative or additional test-treatment strategies to be evaluated.|$|E

40|$|A yellow-eyed mutant was {{discovered}} in a strain of Heliothis virescens, the tobacco budworm, that already exhibited a mutation for yellow scale, y. We investigated the inheritance of these visible mutations as candidate markers for transgenesis. Yellow eye was controlled by a single, recessive, autosomal factor, {{the same type of}} inheritance previously known for y. Presence of the recombinant mutants with yellow scales and wild type eyes in test crosses indicated independent segregation of genes for these traits. The recombinant class with wild type scales and yellow eyes was completely absent and there was a corresponding increase of the double mutant parental class having yellow scales and yellow eyes. These results indicated that a single factor for yellow eye also controlled yellow scales independently of y. This gene was named yes, for yellow eye and scale. We hypothesize that yes controls both eye and scale color through a deficiency in transport of pigment precursors in both the ommochrome and melanin pathways. The unlinked gene y likely controls an enzyme affecting the melanin pathway only.

40|$|Assume {{that voters}} must choose between voting <b>yes</b> (<b>Y)</b> and voting no (N) on three propositions on a referendum. If the winning {{combination}} is NYY on the first, second, and third propositions, respectively, {{the paradox of}} multiple elections is that NYY can receive the fewest votes of the 23 = 8 combinations. Several variants of this paradox are illustrated, and necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence, related to the "incoherence" of support, are given. The paradox is shown, via an isomorphism, to be a generalization of the well-known paradox of voting. One real-life example of the paradox involving voting on propositions in California, in which not a single voter voted on the winning side of all the propositions, is given. Several empirical examples of variants of the paradox that manifested themselves in federal elections - one of which led to divided government - and legislative votes in the US House of Representatives, are also analyzed. Possible normative implications of the paradox, such as allowing voters to vote directly for combinations using approval voting or the Borda count, are discussed. ...|$|R

Esta pesquisa teve como objetivo compreender a historicidade dos Ava-Guarani (Nhandeva) da Terra Indigena de Oco'y (PR), suas formas de organizacao social, politica e religiosa. Esse grupo indigena apresenta uma trajetoria de deslocamentos estimulados por visitas a parentes, por uma disciplina religiosa que proclama a busca da Terra-Sem-Mal (lugar cosmologico ao mesmo tempo que geografico), mas tambem como consequencia do contato com a sociedade ocidental, como no caso da construcao da Usina Hidreletrica de Itaipu, que provocou o deslocamento da area onde habitava, alagada com a construcao dessa usina. Objetivou assim reconstituir a visao que estes indigenas tem de sua historia (tanto os referentes aos deslocamentos, como os de suas formas vida social no passado), feito a partir da "memoria nativa" acessada atraves do levantamento de genealogias, de conversas / entrevistas com os Ava-Guarani desta area indigenas, especialmente com as pessoas mais antigas (aquelas que tem uma memoria viva dos acontecimentos) e com as liderancas indigenas. A questao teorica inicial voltava-se para as formas de organizacao politica desse grupo indigena, tendo como premissa a constatacao de Pierre e Helene Clastres (1974 e 1978) de uma tensao estrutural entre as esferas politica e religiosa - tida como tipica da sociedade Tupi-Guarani. e a questao de que se ela se revela em Oco. y e, se sim, a observacao de como esta se articula com os novos contextos vividos por este povo indigena. Entretanto, a perspectiva de futuro dos Ava-Gaurani observada durante o trabalho de campo fez com que este trabalho questionasse a {{literatura}} etnologica sobre os Guarani que afirma que eles tem uma temporalidade ciclica e que sao pessimistas em relacao ao futuro, em funcao de sua perspectiva cataclismica (Nimunendaju, 1914; Metraux, 1967). Os Ava-Guarani de Oco. y diferenciam-se deste modelo etnologico na medida em que apresentam projetos para o futuro que provam que eles nao esperam resignadamente o proximo cataclismo. Eles afirmam que a terra ira queimar, mas nao por um designo divino e sim devido as devastacoes provocadas pelos ¡°brancos¡± que deixam a terra sem protecao. A conclusao desta tese gira em torno da constatacao da co-existencia de diversas temporalidades, especialmente representadas pelas especificacoes e inter-relacoes das esferas da religiosidade e da polica. This {{research had}} as objective {{to understand the}} historicity of Ava-Guarani (Nhandeva) from Indigenous Land of Oco. y (PR), their manners of social, political and religious organization. This indigenous group presents a trajectory of dislocations stimulated by visits to relatives, by a religious discipline that proclaim the search of ¡°Terra-sem-Mal¡± (cosmological place {{in the same time}} that geographical place) but also as consequence of contact with the western society, {{as in the case of}} building of Hydroelectric Power Plant of Itaipu, that provoked the dislocation of the area where they lived, flooded with the building of this Hydroelectric Power Plant. Thus, it had as objective reconstitute the sight that these indigenous has of their history (as those regarding for the dislocations as also those of their manner of social life in the past) done since the ¡°native memory¡± accessed through of the genealogy. s survey, of the talk / interview with the Ava-Guarani of this indigenous area, specially with the oldest peoples (those that has a live memory of events) and with the indigenous leadership. The initial theoretical question faced the manners of political organization of this indigenous group, having as premise the thesis of Pierre and Helene Clastres (1974 and 1975) of a structural tension between the political and religious spheres. had as typical of Tupi-Guarani society. and the question of if it reveal itself in Oco. <b>y</b> and, if <b>yes,</b> the observation of how this articulate itself with the news contexts lived by this indigenous people. In the meantime, the Ava Guarani. s perspective of future observed during the fieldwork did with that this work asked the ethnological literature about the Guarani that state they has a cyclical temporality and that they are pessimists in relation to future, in function if their cataclysmic perspective (Nimuendaju, 1914 e Metraux, 1967). The Ava-Guarani of Oco. y, because they differentiate themselves of this ethnological model when present projects for the future. This prove that they don. t wait resigned the next cataclysm. They state that the Earth will burn, but not by a divine designation and yes due to the devastation provoked by the ¡°whites¡± that leave the Earth without protection. The conclusion of this thesis to revolve around the statement of co-existence of different temporalities, specially represented by of specifications and inter-relation of political and religious spheres...|$|R
