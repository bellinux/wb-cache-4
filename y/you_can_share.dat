500|$|Brooks {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} motivation after the Olympics. He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis Pursley, but his stay was brief. The inaugural director Don Talbot, a former head coach of the Australian swimming team, expelled him for indiscipline. He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100m freestyle without training, but his time of 52.61s was substantially slower than his personal best. Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas. He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system, particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches. He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers, saying that [...] "In Australia, after a race they want to lock you in your room. In America, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>share</b> a beer after the meet with the coach." [...] The shortcourse pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks, as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns, which came twice as often in comparison to longcourse (50m) pools. He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year, but decided to extend his stay by a year, having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States. In both years, he won the 50m and 100m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference, and was fourth in the 100m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships. He also came second in the 100m freestyle at the AACC Championships to Rowdy Gaines, who {{went on to win the}} event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|The Princess {{began her}} work with AIDS victims in the 1980s. In 1989, she opened Landmark Aids Centre in South London. She was not averse to making {{physical}} contact with AIDS patients, though it was still unknown whether the disease could be spread that way. Diana was the first British royal figure to contact AIDS patients. In 1987, she held hands with an AIDS patient {{in one of her}} early efforts to de-stigmatise the condition. Diana noted: [...] "HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it. What's more, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>share</b> their homes, their workplaces, and their playgrounds and toys." [...] To Diana's disappointment, the Queen did not support this type of charity work, suggesting she get involved in [...] "something more pleasant". In October 1990, Diana opened Grandma's House, a home for young AIDS victims in Washington, D.C. She was also a patron of the National AIDS Trust. In 1991, she famously hugged one victim during a visit to the AIDS ward of the Middlesex Hospital, which she had opened in 1987 as the first hospital unit dedicated to this cause in the UK. As the patron of Turning Point, a health and social care organisation, Diana visited its project in London for people with HIV/AIDS in 1992. She later established and led fundraising campaigns for AIDS research.|$|E

6000|$|Banishing care, Prince Almas {{walked on}} through the garden, when {{suddenly}} a window opened and a girl, who was lovely {{enough to make the}} moon writhe with jealousy, put out her head. She lost her heart to the good looks of the prince, and sent her nurse to fetch him so that she might learn where he came from and how he had got into her private garden where even lions and wolves did not venture. The nurse went, and was struck with amazement at the sun-like radiance of his face; she salaamed and said: 'O youth! welcome! the lady of the garden calls you; come!' He went with her and into a palace which was like a house in Paradise, and saw seated on the royal carpets of the throne a girl whose brilliance shamed the shining sun. He salaamed; she rose, took him by the hand and placed him near her. 'O young man! who are you? Where do you come from? How did you get into this garden?' He told her his story from beginning to end, and Lady Latifa [9] replied: 'This is folly! It will make you a vagabond of the earth, and lead you to destruction. Come, cease such talk! No one can go to the Caucasus. Stay with me and be thankful, for here is a throne which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>share</b> with me, and in my society you can enjoy my wealth. I will do whatever you wish; I will bring here King Qulmus and his daughter, and you can deal with them as you will.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Preceded by {{the same}} distant flutter of unseen skirts in the passage which he had first noticed on {{entering}} the drawing-room, and which evidently did not proceed from his companion, whose self-composed cerements would have repressed any such indecorous agitation, Mr. Bly stepped timidly into the room. It was a very pretty apartment, suggesting the same touches of tasteful refinement in its furniture and appointments, and withal so feminine in its neatness and regularity, that, conscious of his frontier habits and experience, he felt at once repulsively incongruous. [...] "I cannot expect, Mr. Bly," [...] said Mrs. Brooks resignedly, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>share</b> my son's extreme sensitiveness to disorder and irregularity; but I must beg you to avoid {{as much as possible}} disturbing the arrangement of the book-shelves, which, you observe, comprise his books of serious reference, the Biblical commentaries, and the sermons which were his habitual study. I must beg you to exercise the same care in reference to the valuable offerings from his Sabbath-school scholars which are upon the mantel. The embroidered book-marker, the gift of the young ladies of his Bible-class in Dr. Stout's church, is also, you perceive, kept for ornament and affectionate remembrance. The harmonium--even if you are not yourself given to sacred song--I trust you will not find in your way, nor object to my daughter continuing her practice during your daily absence. Thank you.
