500|$|Benfica began March with a {{visit to}} Estádio José Gomes, home of Estrela da Amadora. The local team scored first through Paulo Machado in the first half, but Benfica scored two goals in the second half; the latter in the 91st minute. On 8 March, Benfica played the return trip of the Champions League against Liverpool. The Rafael Benítez-led side needed to recoup a 1–0 {{disadvantage}} but Benfica won the match. A long-range shot from Simão in the 36th minute and a volley from Miccoli in the 89th minute put Benfica into the quarter-finals {{for the first time}} in 11 years, eliminating the reigning Champions League title holders in the process. Koeman was thrilled with the win, saying, [...] "This is why football is so nice—you can win against a bigger team, and anything is possible if <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> it". Four days later, on the same day they were drawn with Barcelona in the Champions League, Benfica hosted Naval at home. They failed to break Naval's resistance despite several attempts from Simão and dropped two points in a 0–0 draw. The draw threatened the hopes for a title renewal, as Porto and Sporting had distance themselves in the first two spots. On 15 March, Benfica suffered another setback at home. In the quarter-finals of the Taça de Portugal against Vitória de Guimarães, Benfica was surprised by the visitors and lost 1–0; the match's only goal was scored by Dário Monteiro. On 19 March, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Arcos to play Rio Ave. As with Estrela da Amadora, Benfica only secured the win in overtime, when Mantorras beat Mora with a 93rd-minute goal. Simão later told the press Benfica were still in the title race. Almost a week later, on the 25 March, Benfica hosted the fourth-place team Braga. The home team scored in their second attempt through Nuno Gomes and retained their slim lead until the end. Koeman was happy Benfica resolved the game so early, because in three days they met Barcelona. In the final game of March, Benfica faced Barcelona for the Champions League. Both goalkeepers were instrumental in securing a goalless draw; Moretto had the most work. Koeman was satisfied with the stalemate, predicting the second leg would be similar.|$|E

2500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter {{gave the}} game a 9/10. While calling the game [...] "the most stable Souls game to date", he praised the game's {{emphasis}} on melee combat and raw skill, {{as well as}} the game's interesting NPCs, sidequests and interactions. He criticized the game's less-inspiring setting and environment design, limited competitive multiplayer, low replay value, {{as well as the}} occasional blocked area in the game, which he stated [...] "feel less sprawling and less replayable" [...] than previous FromSoftware games. He summarized the review by saying that [...] "Bloodborne is an interesting mix of everything FromSoftware has learned throughout its storied developmental career. FromSoftware {{is still one of the}} only developers left that makes <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> your satisfaction, and Bloodborne is damn satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created has sort of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable {{at the center of the}} story. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E

During that time, he published research suggested U.S. employment depended on foreign exports. Later in life, he recounted that the Labor Department was his only option as Washington, D.C. was still segregated: [...] "if you were Jewish, <b>you</b> could <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Department of Labor and, if you were Catholic, <b>you</b> could <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Department of Commerce." ...|$|R

But though you are a social rather than a {{political}} organisation, you cannot escape politics. You do not call yourselves Radicals, but <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Radicalism. What is Radicalism? It is a desire to get a chance. This is an aspiration inherent in the human breast. It is felt most keenly by the poor.|$|E

"They sweep {{crossings}} {{and they}} beg for alms," [...] Sabatini replied, [...] "because they are weak or foolish and because I am strong. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> twenty-eight shillings a week {{because you are}} foolish.

6000|$|... "Say no more," [...] he said. [...] "I will {{correct the}} habit. I have been {{studying}} the principles of Socialism somewhat deeply of late, and I {{came to the conclusion}} that I must join the cause. It looked good to me. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the equal distribution of property, and start in by swiping all you can and sitting on it. A noble scheme. Me for it.

5000|$|According to Carpenter, {{during his}} {{termination}} hearing at Sandia, Bruce Held, Sandia's chief of counterintelligence, yelled [...] "you're lucky {{you have such}} understanding management... if <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> me, I would decapitate you! There would at least be blood all over the office!" [...] During the subsequent court case, Held testified that he did use the word [...] "decapitate" [...] and, while he did not recall using the word [...] "blood," [...] would not contest it. He also apologized.|$|R

6000|$|Courthorne laughed. [...] "There's {{nothing to}} be gained by pretending to {{misunderstand}} you, but it wouldn't pay me to be resentful when I'm graciously willing to let <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> me. Still, I have been inclined to wonder how you were getting on with my estimable relatives and connections. One of them has, I hear, unbent a trifle towards you, but I would like to warn you not to presume on any small courtesy shown you by the younger Miss Barrington." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "La Fleur," [...] said Miss Panney, [...] "your {{feelings}} are highly honorable to you, {{but you are}} not going about this business in the right way. I have heard of the Drane family, and know what sort of people they are. They would not have <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> them for nothing, and perhaps buy with your own money the food you cook. What should be done is to help them to help themselves. If Miss Drane wishes a position as teacher, one should be got for her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am with you, Comrade Jackson. You won't mind my {{calling you}} Comrade, will you? I've just become a socialist. It's a great scheme. You {{ought to be}} one. <b>You</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the equal {{distribution}} of property, and start by collaring all you can and sitting on it. We must stick together. We are companions in misfortune. Lost lambs. Sheep that have gone astray. Divided, we fall, together we may worry through. Have you seen Professor Radium yet? I should say Mr. Outwood. What {{do you think of}} him?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Now to my certain knowledge, {{there was}} not a brick kiln within fifty miles of that spot, and of all {{unlikely}} places to find one would have been this sandy peninsula, given up to the summer residences of a few wealthy people. Yet I could not help admiring the assumption of the scamp, who knew this fact as well as myself. But I said, [...] "I can give <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a day or two;" [...] and, bidding him gather up his sick wife's apparel, led the way across the downs to my cottage. At first I think the offer took him by surprise, and gave him some consternation, but he presently recovered his spirits, and almost instantly his speech. [...] "Ah, worruk, is it? God be praised! it's meself that's ready and willin'. 'Though maybe me hand is spoilt wid brickmakin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that, Adam; I know <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> {{him as well}} as if {{you were}} working for yourself. But you would have more power than you have now, and could turn the {{business}} to better account perhaps. The old man must give up his business sometime, and he has no son; I suppose he'll want a son-in-law who can take to it. But he has rather grasping fingers of his own, I fancy. I daresay he wants a man who can put some money into the business. If I were not as poor as a rat, I would gladly invest some money in that way, for the sake of having you settled on the estate. I'm sure I should profit by it in the end. And perhaps I shall be better off in a year or two. I shall have a larger allowance now I'm of age; and when I've paid off a debt or two, I shall be able to look about me." ...|$|E
60|$|Well, wise work is, briefly, {{work with}} God. Foolish work is work against God. And work done with God, which He will help, may be briefly {{described}} as 'Putting in Order'--that is, enforcing God's law of order, spiritual and material, over men and things. The {{first thing you}} have to do, essentially; the real 'good work' is, with respect to men, to enforce justice, and with respect to things, to enforce tidiness, and fruitfulness. And against these two great human deeds, justice and order, there are perpetually two great demons contending,--the devil of iniquity, or inequity, and the devil of disorder, or of death; for death is only consummation of disorder. You have to fight these two fiends daily. So far as you don't fight against the fiend of iniquity, <b>you</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> him. You 'work iniquity,' and the judgment upon you, for all your 'Lord, Lord's,' will be 'Depart from me, ye that work iniquity.' And so far as you do not resist the fiend of disorder, you work disorder, and you yourself do the work of Death, which is sin, and has for its wages, Death himself.|$|E

5000|$|Interviewed in 2004 {{about the}} missed {{kick in the}} 1974 Ohio State game, Lantry recalled: [...] "I was numb. That was the final play of my college career right there. Everything <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for,</b> those glorious years of competition, my teammates. ... If we had won that game, we would have played in the Rose Bowl. We could have shot {{to the top of}} the AP and UPI rankings. Who knows? That was like the World Series: bases loaded, bottom of the ninth, two outs, a 3-2 count. It was on my foot, but it didn't happen." ...|$|R
