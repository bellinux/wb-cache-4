[...] At the ESPYs, a video was also shown that included scenes of Scott from a clinic room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and other scenes from Scott's life fighting cancer.

[...] Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Call it 'civil war' or call it brand extension; call it a 'cinematic universe' or a corporate behemoth—the latest Marvel extravaganza furthers the studio's cross-pollination of action franchises in a way that's sure to satisfy devotees." [...] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "This is the cinematic superhero showdown you've dreamt of since childhood, precisely because that's everything—and all—it wants to be." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian called it, [...] "a huge aspartame rush of a film: a giant irresistible snack, not nutritious, but very tasty." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "Kudos to co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo and the team of writers for juggling {{more than a dozen}} comic-book characters and nearly that many plot lines, and only occasionally getting us (and by us I mean me) lost in the geek weeds." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> breathe Marvel, {{this is one of the}} MCU's stronger offerings. If you are a spy coming in from the cold, the answer is not so clear." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Captain America: Civil War does not in any way transcend the conventions of the genre. On the contrary: It succeeds because it doesn't really try." ...|$|E

His long-time co-writer Charles McKeown commented, [...] "the theme of imagination, and the {{importance}} of imagination, to how <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> how you think and so on... that's very much a Terry theme." [...] Most of Gilliam's movies include plotlines that seem to occur partly or completely in the characters' imaginations, raising questions about the definition of identity and sanity. He often shows his opposition to bureaucracy and authoritarian regimes. He also distinguishes [...] "higher" [...] and [...] "lower" [...] layers of society, with a disturbing and ironic style. His movies usually feature a fight or struggle against a great power which may be an emotional situation, a human-made idol, or even the person himself, and the situations do not always end happily. There is often a dark, paranoid atmosphere and unusual characters who used to be normal members of society. His scripts feature black comedy and often end with a dark tragicomic twist.|$|E

2500|$|Both [...] "Not Ready to Make Nice" [...] {{and second}} single [...] "Everybody Knows" [...] were largely ignored by U.S. country radio {{and failed to}} {{penetrate}} the top 35 of the Hot Country Songs chart. [...] In June 2006, Emily Robison noted {{the lack of support}} from other country music performers: [...] "A lot of artists cashed in on being against what we said or what we stood for because that was promoting their career, which was a horrible thing to do. ... A lot of pandering started going on, and you'd see soldiers and the American flag in every video. It became a sickening display of ultra-patriotism." [...] Maines commented, [...] "The entire country may disagree with me, but I don't understand the necessity for patriotism. Why {{do you have to be}} a patriot? About what? This land is our land? Why? You can like where <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> like your life, but as for loving the whole country ... I don't see why people care about patriotism." [...] In Europe, however, the two singles were well received by country radio, peaking at Nos. 13 and 11 respectively and remaining on the European Country Charts for more than 20 weeks each.|$|E
2500|$|Director Terry Gilliam and screenwriter Charles McKeown {{wrote the}} script for The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, their first {{collaboration}} since The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988). When he was approached with the basic concept by Gilliam, McKeown thought of the central character of Parnassus [...] "as a semi-eastern medicine man evolved", and in retrospect he further said about the script's sensibilities, [...] "t is about the theme of imagination, {{and the importance of}} imagination, to how <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> how you think and so on. And that's very much a Terry theme. [...] I like the idea of storytelling being the thing that sustains the universe." [...] Gilliam described the premise as a [...] "fun and humorous story about the consequences of our personal choices in life", and explained his goal for the film: [...] "It's autobiographical. I'm trying to bring a bit of fantasticality to London, an antidote to modern lives. I loved this idea of an ancient travelling show offering the kind of storytelling and wonder that we used to get, to people who are just into shoot-em-up action films." [...] Gilliam and McKeown based the character of Tony on former British prime minister Tony Blair, who [...] "would say the most insane things and probably he'd believe them himself".|$|E
