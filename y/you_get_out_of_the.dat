500|$|Despite being {{promoted}} as the show's heart and moral conscience, {{the flaws in}} Gwen's own morality are explored throughout the series; a press release noted that she is both selfless and selfish. The first series sees Gwen embark on a brief affair with colleague Owen Harper. Executive producer Russell T Davies explains that the episode [...] "Countrycide" [...] was deliberately structured {{in order to make}} the affair seem inevitable as Gwen struggles to cope with Torchwood life. For Davies, the dalliance is a [...] "human" [...] one, told in an adult manner characterised by [...] "lust and anger and hurt and the joy <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial stages of having an affair". Myles commented that Gwen's compromised morality, as demonstrated by her affair was suitably challenging for a science fiction audience, and served to demonstrate that none of the Torchwood team were [...] "safe" [...] from temptation. Writer Stephen James Walker argues that Gwen's moral ambiguity made her a more compelling character. Since she was introduced as an audience surrogate, Walker claimed it would have been an easy trap to make her a [...] "one-dimensional paragon of virtue". Instead, the writers made Gwen more [...] "realistic" [...] by giving her [...] "distinct human failings", which Walker felt made her [...] "arguably the most complex and interesting of the five regulars". He identified these failures as her [...] "tendency towards egotism", [...] "self-righteousness", and [...] "selfishness", evident in her [...] "highly questionable treatment" [...] of boyfriend Rhys Williams. Walker cited her affair with Owen as an example, as well as the scene in [...] "Combat" [...] where she confesses this betrayal to Rhys after dosing him with the amnesia drug Retcon so he won't remember.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will sign}} it. I {{will take the}} risk. But you must {{tell me all about}} it, right afterward, so that you can be arrested before <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house in case there should be {{anything}} criminal about this." ...|$|E

60|$|Yes. All {{this valley}} is very rich, and very {{sheltered}} too, and very warm; for the soft south-western air sweeps up {{it from the}} Bristol Channel; so the slopes are covered with fruit-orchards, {{as you will see}} as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> station.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{not very}} exacting, am I? I don't often {{ask you to}} do {{anything}} that's a bother. Won't <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your horrid engagement--just this once?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Should you growl {{very much}} if I {{introduced}} you to Emily Grey? You {{see it is}} a matter of justice and truth to tell her now, after having contradicted her so flatly. I will wait to let <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way first if you like, but I think that would be unkind to her; and if you ever do dance, I wish you would dance with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you go out}} first, Master Aylmer," [...] the {{silversmith}} said. [...] "I have no fear {{of anyone}} watching behind, for {{it is not likely}} that any of them know of this entrance to my house; still, it is as well to make certain. When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lane you had best stay there until the others have passed on, then you can follow them. We will wait for a few minutes after they have gone, and lock the door behind us. You have not forgotten where you are to find us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{can tell}} you all about her. She is Miss Eva Langton, and lives at the White House. You follow the street till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town where there is a pond at this end of the common, and just a little {{the other side of the}} pond there are big trees, and behind the trees a white gate. That's the gate of the White House, only you can't see it because the trees are in the way. Are you going to call on her?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{you would}}n't have insulted her. But you would the next girl who came along. Gene, you are hopeless. Now, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here and don't ever come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why! Whye-e! Is {{this really}} you, Chatterer?" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "However did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> your prison? I'm glad, ever and ever so glad, {{that you got}} away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I won't tell you, John. Before I go I will whisper {{it in your}} ear, {{and give}} you the means of finding them, but not till then. No, I will write it down {{on a piece of}} paper, and slip it into your hand. As soon as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room you glance at it, and then put the piece of paper into your mouth, chew it up and swallow it. I tell you I dare not even whisper it; but {{whatever}} you do, take no steps in the matter until your son comes of age." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{felt she}} must see at this {{juncture}} how wonderful I found her, and even that that impression--one's whole consciousness of her personal victory--was a force that, in the last resort, was all on her side. [...] "It was quite worth your while, this sitting up to this hour, to show a fellow how you bloom when other women are fagged. If that was really, with the truth that we're so pulling about laid bare, what you did most want to show, why, then, you've splendidly triumphed, and I congratulate and thank you. No," [...] I quickly went on, [...] "I daresay, to do you justice, the interpretation of my tropes and figures isn't 'ever' perfectly simple. You doubtless have driven me into a corner with my dangerous explosive, and my only fair course must be therefore to sit on it till <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room. I'm sitting on it now; and I think you'll find {{you can get out}} as soon as you've told me this. Was the moment your change of view dawned upon you the moment of our exchanging a while ago, in the drawing-room, our few words?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he {{answered}} quietly, [...] "the fact that I expected {{you to look}} at it in that way {{was one of the things}} that influenced me. A self-respecting girl with any delicacy of feeling would naturally resent it; but I'm not sure yet that it's altogether an insult I'm offering you. Let me own that I've been here some little time, and that I've spent a good deal of it in watching you." [...] He raised his hand as he saw the indignation in her eyes. [...] "Give me a minute or two, and then if you think it justified you can be angry. I want to say just this. We live in a pretty primitive fashion on our hundred-and-sixty-acre holdings out on the prairie, and conventions don't count for much with us. What is more to the purpose, we are forced to make some irregular venture of this kind if we think of marrying. Now, I have a comparatively decent place about two hundred miles from here, and my wife would not have to work as hard as you would certainly have to do in a hotel or store. That's to begin with. To go on, I don't think I've ever been unkind to any one or any thing, and, though it must seem a horrible piece of assurance, I said the day I saw <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train that you were the girl for me. I would do what I could, everything I could, to make things smooth for you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sometime in 1947, {{after working}} with Ory {{on the soundtrack}} for the RKO film, Crossfire, clarinetist Barney Bigard asked him, [...] "How much {{royalties}} do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 'Muskrat Ramble'?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Genie laughed. [...] "Think {{how much}} more novelty <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{roasting}} me like that than telling Terry he's got 'bats in his belfry' ten or twelve times a day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{offer is}} a very fair one, Rover. <b>You</b> have <b>gotten</b> {{yourself}} in a bad fix, and you can consider yourself lucky if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it with a whole skin." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{regard to}} theology, {{as you are}} aware, {{it has been the}} study of the deepest heads that have come into the world--what is the nature of this stupendous universe, and what its {{relations}} to all things, as known to man, and as only known to the awful Author of it. In fact, the members of the Church keep theology in a lively condition (laughter), {{for the benefit of the}} whole population, which is the great object of our Universities. I consider it is the same now intrinsically, though very much forgotten, from many causes, and not so successful as might be wished at all. (A laugh.) It remains, however, a very curious truth, what has been said by observant people, that the main use of the Universities in the present age is that, after you have done with all your classes, the next thing is a collection of books, a great library of good books, which you proceed to study and to read. What the Universities have mainly done--what I have found the University did for me, was that it taught me to read in various languages and various sciences, so that I could go into the books that treated of these things, and try anything I wanted to make myself master of gradually, as I found it suit me. Whatever you may think of all that, the clearest and most imperative duty lies on every one of you to be assiduous in your reading; and learn to be good readers, which is, perhaps, a more difficult thing than you imagine. Learn to be discriminative in your reading--to read all kinds of things that you have an interest in, and that you find to be really fit for what you are engaged in. Of course, at the present time, in a great deal of the reading incumbent on you you must be guided by the books recommended to you by your professors for assistance towards the prelections. And then, when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University, and go into studies of your own, you will find it very important that you have selected a field, a province in which you can study and work.|$|E
