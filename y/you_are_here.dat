25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>here.</b> If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

2500|$|... "Beware of Darkness" [...] is a ballad {{containing}} dense imagery. The song marks {{a return}} to the spiritual concerns of Harrison's songs with the Beatles such as [...] "Within You Without You". The lyrics of [...] "Beware of Darkness" [...] reflect the philosophy of the Radha Krishna Temple, with which Harrison was involved, in which spiritual concerns must always override material things. In the verses, the listener is warned against various influences that may corrupt him or her. Among the potential corrupting influences are con men ("soft shoe shufflers"), politicians ("greedy leaders") and pop idols of little substance ("falling swingers"). In addition, the lyrics warn against negative thoughts ("thoughts that linger"), since these corrupting influences and negative thoughts can lead to maya, or illusion, which distracts people from the true purpose of life. The middle eight delivers the message that this [...] "can hurt you", and that [...] "that is not what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> for." ...|$|E

2500|$|Behind Godfrey's on-air warmth was a {{volatile}} and controlling personality. [...] He insisted that his [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] attend dance and singing classes, believing all should be versatile performers {{regardless of whether}} they possessed the aptitude for those disciplines. In meetings with the cast and his staff, he could be abusive and intimidating. CBS historian Robert Metz, in CBS: Reflections in a Bloodshot Eye, quoted Godfrey as having once told cast and staffers, [...] "Remember that many of <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> over the bodies I have personally slain. I have done it before and I can do it again." [...] He also demanded, though there was no contractual requirement, that his cast members refrain from hiring personal managers or booking agents. [...] He insisted his staff could handle all that. [...] Given the rise of the [...] "Little Godfreys" [...] from total obscurity due to their exposure on Godfrey's programs, no one was inclined to challenge him. [...] Despite his ability to bring in profits, CBS executives who respected Godfrey professionally disliked him personally, since he often baited them on and off the air, occasionally by name. This included CBS chairman William S. Paley.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>here</b> because you are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E
