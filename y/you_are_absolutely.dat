6000|$|... 'Good gracious, Edmund!' said Mrs Sparkler more fretfully still, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> putting mignonette up your nose! Pray don't!' ...|$|E
6000|$|Nasmyth let {{her hand}} go. [...] "Now," [...] he asserted, [...] "I think I cannot fail. Still, {{it must be}} remembered that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> free." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said his}} father, [...] "you have more actual {{strength}} than a bird, but not more {{in proportion to}} your size. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> stronger, but not relatively." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, darling, darling, and I've {{always told}} you, so carefully, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> free. I {{just wanted you}} to come around when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> tired and wanted to talk to me, or when you could enjoy our parties--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Spare me, please," [...] she begged. [...] "Those {{were such}} terrible days--so dull, too! I {{remember}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> quite {{one of the}} brightest spots. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> different from every one I had ever met before, and you interested me immensely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> heartless," [...] she said, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{perfectly}} consistent, {{why did you}} {{not make}} me suffer? You had a great chance! A little feigned affection, {{and then a few}} truths. You could have dragged me down a little way into the pit of broken hearts! Why didn't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this the}} bully bit his lip. [...] "We won't talk about that, Dick Rover. Do {{you realize that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> in my power? How do you like it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Assuming {{even that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> right," [...] said Bishop Likeman, [...] "aren't you still rather in the {{position}} of a man who insists upon Swedish exercises and a strengthening dietary on a raft?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought I {{recognised}} the mark," [...] {{the other}} replied. [...] "A most outrageous mistake! I am very glad {{that it came}} under my notice. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> free from the censor, Sir Alfred." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{taught me}} to hope," [...] said he, [...] "as I had {{scarcely}} ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>absolutely,</b> irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly." ...|$|R
60|$|Don't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> uneasy, I say once again. <b>You</b> may <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> {{certain that}} there is no cause for it. We are splendidly housed here, and in great comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{sounds good}} to me. Now if the story had been of a hundred millions, or some such crazy sum, I wouldn't look {{at it for a}} moment. We'll sail to-morrow, but under one consideration. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> under my orders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sit down,' said Cleopatra, listlessly {{waving her}} fan, 'a long way off. Don't come too near me, for I am frightfully faint and {{sensitive}} this morning, and you {{smell of the}} Sun. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> tropical.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When {{you tell}} me that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> in want of money to pay your own bills, and that he has not hesitated to take yours from you! Why does he not repay you what he has borrowed?' ...|$|E
60|$|There never was, is not, {{and never}} would have been any {{question}} of being bound between us. I refuse to trade on any such thing. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> free. Our engagement is at an end by mutual consent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy, do {{you want}} {{something}} thrown at <b>you?</b> It <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> essential that we should without delay map out a plan of campaign." ...|$|R
60|$|When {{the morning}} came, your {{language}} and conduct showed that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> ignorant {{of what you}} had said and done overnight. At the same time, Miss Verinder's language and conduct showed that she was resolved to say nothing (in mercy to you) on her side. If Mr. Godfrey Ablewhite chose to keep the Diamond, he might do so with perfect impunity. The Moonstone stood between him and ruin. He put the Moonstone into his pocket.|$|R
6000|$|Jack. [Astounded.] Well [...] . surely. You {{know that}} I love you, and you {{led me to}} believe, Miss Fairfax, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not <b>absolutely</b> {{indifferent}} to me.|$|R
60|$|HUNTINGDON. Look here! It's {{not as if}} George wasn't quite {{a decent}} chap. And it's no use {{blinking}} things; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> dependent on him. At home they've got {{every bit as much}} as they can do to keep going.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{you have}} {{actually}} more strength than a bird,--a robin, for instance; you could hold {{him so that}} he could not get away; and you could lift more than he could too. But then you are a great deal larger, and you are not as much stronger than he is, as you are larger. If you are a hundred times as heavy as he, you are not a hundred times as strong. That's what I mean by saying that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> stronger, but not relatively. That is, you are not as many times stronger, as you are larger and heavier. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> stronger, but not relatively; that is, in proportion to your size and weight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{messages}} {{every five}} minutes," [...] he whispered in her ear, [...] "and I am venturing upon a bold stroke. There is still {{something about the}} affair, though, which I cannot understand. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> sure that Guillot has not moved?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do!" [...] she declared, [...] "and I will know. For years <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> a {{man with}} a shell upon your heart. Every good impulse, every kind thought seemed {{withered}} up. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> cold, absolutely passionless! I have worn myself out trying to call you back to your own, to set the blood flowing once more in your veins, to break for one moment the barriers which you had set up against Nature herself. Some day, I felt that it must come--and it has! Who has done it, Wingrave? It is not--Emily?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, but I {{must get}} to London undiscovered, and, for certain reasons, with which I need not trouble <b>you,</b> that <b>is</b> <b>absolutely</b> the only {{possible}} way. You remember, at Oxford, I made up fairly well for female parts.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly you will; and I {{wish you}} now {{to listen to}} me, that you may know what it <b>is</b> that <b>you</b> will then have to do. In the first place <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> asked, I presume, by one gentleman whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> willingly eloping with Captain Ussher?" [...] Feemy shuddered as the name was pronounced. [...] "And of course you must answer that truly--that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing so. Then another gentleman will ask <b>you</b> whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> walking off with him when the blow was struck which killed Captain Ussher; and, Feemy, you must also answer that truly. Now the {{question}} <b>is,</b> can <b>you</b> remember what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing when the blow was struck? Tell me now, Feemy, can you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, take my advice: fight {{your own}} battles, but never {{interfere}} to fight other people's, unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> {{convinced that they}} are in the right. If you are, stick by them {{as long as you have}} a leg to stand upon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{difficult}} situation, Bellamy," [...] he said. [...] "You are asking {{a great deal}} when you suggest that we should interfere in the slightest manner with the course of justice. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> convinced, I suppose, that this man Laverick {{had nothing to do}} with the murder?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{am going}} back where I belong--to {{the world which}} I should [...] never have quitted. Everything {{has been a great}} mistake. Please [...] {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> and entirely free in every [...] way. I only trust that I may live long enough to atone in some [...] measure for my folly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a rummy thing," [...] he observed, [...] "but {{your father}} said almost exactly {{that to me}} only yesterday. Only I don't fancy he meant the same as <b>you.</b> To <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> frank, his exact {{expression}} was that he thanked God {{there was only one}} of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{our friend}} here had traced {{you to the}} barge and found out her destination, {{and if you had}} come ten minutes later you would have found that we had all just started for Rotterdam. I was only waiting for Chester and Malcolm to return to set out. I am sorry, Mark, that you have lost your diamonds; not so much because they are gone, for I can well {{understand}} <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> thoroughly glad to be rid of such dangerous articles, but because they have carried them off in our teeth, after we have been specially retained to protect you. I certainly thought that with such a bodyguard <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>absolutely</b> safe from any number of Hindoos." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{means that}} those papers are yours {{to do what}} you like with. I drafted the second one so that <b>you</b> should <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> secure against any further attempt at blackmail. As a matter of fact, though, Walter is on his last legs. I doubt whether he will live to land in Australia." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} not given any cheques since this was made up," [...] he said calmly, [...] "you have a credit balance of {{thirteen}} thousand, one hundred and eighteen pounds, nine shillings and fourpence. It is very foolish of you to keep so much money on current account. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> losing about eight pounds a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What perception!" [...] Sogrange murmured. [...] "My dear Baron, {{sometimes}} you amaze me. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> right. I have some pieces and I {{am convinced that}} they would form a puzzle the solution {{of which would be}} interesting to us, but how or where they fit in, I frankly don't know. You have the facts so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I entreat you, madam, to {{do nothing}} rash," [...] said Sir Andrew, as Marguerite {{prepared}} in her turn to ascend the rickety flight of steps. [...] "Remember this place is infested with spies. Do not, I beg of you, reveal yourself to Sir Percy, unless <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>absolutely</b> certain that you are alone with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely. For instance, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to become}} <b>absolutely</b> discredited, I think that <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> effectually {{out of my}} way. Your people do not forgive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{principal}} point {{with me is}} that which I first asked him about, can he be faithful? I may have to ride on dangerous missions for the general. I may have to enter an enemy's town to obtain information. There is another thing, being of the general's staff, and sometimes quartered {{in the same house}} with him and chatting freely with his other aides-de-camp, secrets might be picked up by a sharp pair of ears that if repeated would do grievous harm to the cause of the duchess, as you can well understand. Now, the question, Paolo, <b>is,</b> can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>absolutely</b> trusted; can <b>you,</b> as to all matters <b>you</b> may hear, <b>be</b> as one who is deaf and dumb?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the moment}} when you entered the inn to {{the moment when}} <b>you</b> left it, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>absolutely</b> {{innocent}} of the slightest intention to marry Miss Silvester?" ...|$|R
