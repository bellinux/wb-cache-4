500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler {{wrote of the}} episode, [...] ""Book of the Stranger" [...] handed us two very lovely, {{satisfying}} moments with the Stark/Snow reunion at Castle Black (and the subsequent vow to defeat Ramsay and rescue Rickon) and Daenerys's conquering of Vaes Dothrak. Both were huge, forward-moving story elements that harkened back to Season 1 and gave viewers something to root for and grab onto as the show itself heads into its final arcs." [...] Fowler also noted, [...] "As a reader of the books with no more books to read, Season 6 {{has been a very}} interesting experience," [...] giving the episode a 9.2 out of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the scenes at Castle Black and in Vaes Dothrak, writing [...] "Game of Thrones lived up to its billing as A Song of Ice and Fire on Sunday, as there was plenty of action in both of the signature halves of the story." [...] Brandon Nowalk of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "Now that is how <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> table. [...] "Book Of The Stranger" [...] doesn't just check off plot points. In fact, there aren't a lot of plot points to check off. It's an episode of introductions, reunions, and wall-to-wall scheming," [...] giving the episode an A. Eliana Dockterman of Time wrote about the strong female storylines in the episode, stating [...] "The creators of Game of Thrones have been touting the sixth season of the show as the year when women finally wreak vengeance. The fourth episode, [...] "Book of the Stranger," [...] suggests that they will hold true to their word." ...|$|E

As a performer, notes Homans, she [...] "excelled in the hard-edged, technically demanding roles that Ulanova eschewed, including Raymonda, the black swan in Swan Lake, and Kitri in Don Quixote." [...] In her performances, Plisetskaya was [...] "unpretentious, refreshing, direct. She {{did not hold}} back." [...] Ulanova added that Plisetskaya's [...] "artistic temperament, bubbling optimism of youth reveal themselves in this ballet with full force." [...] World-famous impresario Sol Hurok said that Plisetskaya was the only ballerina after Pavlova who gave him [...] "a shock of electricity" [...] when she came on stage. Rudolf Nureyev watched her debut as Kitri in Don Quixote and told her afterwards, [...] "I sobbed from happiness. <b>You</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> stage on fire." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where <b>you</b> <b>set</b> <b>the</b> tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
