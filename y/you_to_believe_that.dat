500|$|After {{returning}} to her cage, Kate and Sawyer have an argument, and she climbs out of her cage and breaks open Sawyer's, saying {{if he does not}} want Jack to save his life, he is going to save his own. Sawyer then tells her that they cannot run because they are on another island, something he did not tell her [...] "because I wanted <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we had a damn chance." [...] Kate and Sawyer then have sex, unknowingly {{in full view of the}} cameras. At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor. Ben appears behind him, and after a brief exchange Jack decides to do the surgery, but wants Ben to keep his promise to let Jack off the island.|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

'Remember, therefore, O my Mansoul, that {{thou art}} beloved of me: as I have, therefore, taught <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> watch, to fight, to pray, {{and to make}} war against my foes; so now I command <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> my love is {{constant}} <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b> O my Mansoul, how have I set my heart, my love upon thee! Watch. Behold, I lay none other burden upon thee, than what thou hast already. Hold fast, till I come.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Kenneth Rogoff, IMF Director of research, called Stiglitz's {{analysis}} [...] "at best highly controversial, at worst, snake oil" [...] {{and stated}} that [...] "The Stiglitzian prescription (for third world nations in a debt crisis) is to raise the profile of fiscal deficits, that is, to issue more debt and to print more money. <b>You</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> if a distressed government issues more currency, its citizens will suddenly think it more valuable. <b>You</b> seem <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> when investors are no longer willing to hold a government's debt, all {{that needs to be}} done is to increase the supply and it will sell like hot cakes." ...|$|R
2500|$|When the Indiana and Ohio state troops under {{command of}} Gen. George B. McClellan invaded West Virginia on May 26, 1861, Gen. McClellan issued a {{proclamation}} [...] "To the Union Men of Western Virginia" [...] {{in which he}} stated [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference, but we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand, crush any attempt at insurrection on their part." [...] Writing in his journal on January 3, 1862 in Fayetteville Col. Rutherford B. Hayes noted, [...] "Nobody in this army thinks of giving to the Rebels their fugitive slaves. Union men might perhaps be differently dealt with-probably would be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but I feel that the search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

"Morella {{made love}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in England, Señora Betty--did he not?--and won your heart {{as he has}} won that of many another woman, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> came <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he was {{carrying}} <b>you</b> off <b>to</b> marry <b>you,</b> and not your cousin?" ...|$|R

And last, but trust me, not least, I will help <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> your wife loves you and is happy in her home. We need such help, Marchbanks: we need it greatly and always. There are so many things to make us doubt, if once we let our understanding be troubled. Even at home, we sit as if in camp, encompassed by a hostile army of doubts. Will you play the traitor and let them in on me? ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the film}} Thurman plays an excitable New Jersey {{woman in the}} 1980s searching for romance.
