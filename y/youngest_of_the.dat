5|$|The <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flows on Axial Seamount {{are aligned}} along the two rift zones, {{followed}} by flows inside the summit caldera; the oldest appear to originate from directly around the caldera, {{where most of}} the basalt is completely covered in accumulated sediment. This suggests a bilateral growth pattern, a trend also found in Hawaiian volcanics and other well-known seamounts, for instance Jasper Seamount.|$|E
5|$|Watt {{suggested}} {{that all three}} were brothers, John the first-born, William the second-born, and Walter the <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three. He further {{suggested that}} the family was probably closely connected to Margaret de Abernethy, heiress of the old lay abbots and lords of Abernethy. Margaret had patronage over both the church of Abernethy and, as probable owner of the barony of Inverarity, the church there.|$|E

5|$|Andrew was the <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{four sons}} of András Báthory and Margit Majláth. His {{father was the}} marshal of the court of Isabella Jagiellon and her son, John Sigismund Zápolya. Isabella and John Sigismund ruled the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary as vassals of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. The date of Andrew's birth is uncertain, because his actual age was kept secret in the early 1580s to promote {{his career in the}} Roman Catholic Church. He was most {{probably}} born in late 1562 or early 1563, according to historian Ildikó Horn. His father died around that time, implying that Andrew was a posthumous son.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, which are layers of {{sedimentary}} rocks which unconformably overlies 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. This group contains both the Rove and Gunflint Iron formations. The Rove Formation is the <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many Animikie layers; it consists of gently tilted fine-grained sediments. It is composed of greywackes and black shale, and contains lower concentrations of iron and taconite than the underlying Gunflint Iron Formation does.|$|E
5|$|Gemini was a {{step forward}} for NASA's manned space program: the Gemini capsule was larger and more {{advanced}} than Mercury, capable of supporting two men {{for up to a}} two-week mission. Because of the longer mission durations, Mission Control began to be manned in shifts. In 1964, Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors. Aged only twenty-eight, Lunney was the <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four.|$|E

5|$|Lilian Faithfull {{was born}} in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in 1865. Her father, Francis Faithfull, was a clerk at the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Her mother, Edith Lloyd, stayed home with eight {{children}} while also writing a History of England and magazine articles. Lilian was the second <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six girls and two boys. She lived in an upper-middle class country house in Hertfordshire and was educated at The Grange in Hoddesdon (the only girl at the time), and later at home by her mother and governesses. Emily Faithfull, an early women's rights activist, was her cousin. Both of Faithfull's parents were opinionated about issues such as femininity and social class, but were not radicals.|$|E
5|$|Louie Broady Nunn {{was born}} in Park, Kentucky– a small {{community}} {{on the border of}} Barren and Metcalfe counties– on March 8, 1924. His given name, Louie, honored a deceased friend of his father's; his middle name, Broady, was a surname in his mother's family. Louie was the <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four sons born to Waller Harrison and Mary (Roberts) Nunn; their youngest child, Virginia, was their only daughter. The Nunns were farmers and operated a general store, though Waller suffered from a congenital heart condition and severe arthritis and was limited to light chores. The eldest brother, Lee Roy, became an influential campaigner and fundraiser for the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Loa {{is one of}} five subaerial volcanoes {{that make}} up the island of Hawaiʻi, created by the Hawaii hotspot. The oldest volcano on the island, Kohala, is more than a million years old, and Kīlauea, the youngest, is {{believed}} to be between 300,000 and 600,000 years of age. Lōʻihi Seamount on the island's flank is even younger, but has yet to breach the surface. At 1 million to 700,000 years of age, Mauna Loa is the second <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five volcanoes on the island, making it the third youngest volcano in the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain, a chain of shield volcanoes and seamounts extending from Hawaii to the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench in Russia.|$|E

All appointments became effective on 22 June 1934, and Waite, at age 49, was the second <b>youngest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intake; only Vincent Ward was younger.
