500|$|In 2015, she {{released}} an autobiography, titled Swimming Toward the Gold Lining: How Jessica Hardy turned her wounds into wisdom, in 2015. The book [...] "covers her journey from trials to triumph, from wounds to wisdom, and from setbacks to comebacks. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> name, but you won’t know her true story until you’ve read [...] book." ...|$|E
500|$|Bennion {{praised the}} {{performances}} of Smith and Riley, but said that Smith was [...] "undoubtedly" [...] {{the star of the}} show. Vicki Power, writing for the Daily Telegraph, agreed that Smith was the star, calling her [...] "brilliant", while Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, said that Smith offered [...] "another multi-faceted, stunning performance as the troubled Christine". Chater said that Smith's role was [...] "superbly performed, as always", and Billen said that Smith offered [...] "tragic depth" [...] to her character. Wilson commended Smith's [...] "arresting performance", saying that [...] "No one does girl-next-door naturalism better – she has the actor's elixir of making you think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>her,</b> just by a smile or an inflection." [...] Dessau commended the writers for allowing other actors to play the lead roles, praising {{the performances of}} Ridley and, especially, Smith.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{also noted}} {{about the death}} of King Tommen Baratheon, [...] "Meanwhile, while the {{explosion}} is happening, Tommen is alone. This fragile, malleable, devastated child, basically, is sitting there without anybody to comfort him, and if she had been there, he wouldn't have gone out that window. She failed him, and she alone failed him here." [...] Benioff continued about portraying the mindset of Cersei Lannister, saying [...] "I think the idea of Cersei without her children is a pretty terrifying prospect. It was the one thing that really humanized her, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>her</b> love for her kids. And as much of a monster as she could sometimes be, she was a mother who truly really did love her children, and now those children are gone, and all she's got is power." [...] In a subsequent interview after the episode airing, Weiss stated that Cersei's mindset following the ramifications of this episode will {{play an important role in}} the story for the next season.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to P.G. Tait, James Clerk Maxwell wrote about Katherine's {{contribution}} to measurements of gaseous viscosity associated with his paper [...] "On the Dynamical Theory of Gases", saying that Katherine [...] "did all the real work of the kinetic theory" [...] {{and that she was}} now [...] "...engaged in other researches. When she is done I will let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>her</b> answer to your inquiry [...] ". Some of the more arduous work performed by Katherine in these experiments involved keeping a fire continuously stoked for hours on end for the purpose of producing steam from a kettle.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Middle East {{correspondent}} Octavia Nasr {{was fired}} after a tweet saying she was [...] "Sad to hear of the passing of Sayyed Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah... One of Hezbollah's giants I respect a lot." [...] Parisa Khosravi, {{senior vice president of}} CNN International, said she spoke with Nasr and [...] "we have decided that she will be leaving the company." [...] His reason for her removal was given as [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>her</b> tweet over the weekend created a wide reaction. As she has stated in her blog on CNN.com, she fully accepts that she should not have made such a simplistic comment without any context whatsoever. However, at this point, we believe that her credibility in her position as senior editor for Middle Eastern affairs has been compromised going forward." ...|$|E
