2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I felt quite light, as though I was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and I am ashamed". Though Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't <b>you?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|E

6000|$|... ‘But,’ resumes Neville, ‘I am {{accountable}} for mentioning it to <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, on the supposition {{that you could}} not fail to be highly proud of it.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sweet tantalizer, what's the use? It {{comes to}} this sole simple thing: That at one time I had never seen <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> didn't love you; that then <b>I</b> saw <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> love <b>you.</b> <b>Is</b> that enough?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But I have behaved so ill to you,' cried Sophy, as if bent on {{repelling}} the proffered affection. 'I {{would not}} like <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not like <b>you.</b> Never! <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have gone against you every way I could.' ...|$|R

6000|$|But all {{the recent}} events are like that. They are {{practical}} jokes. The jokes {{do not need}} to be made: they only need to be pointed out. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not talk and act as the Isaacs brothers talked and acted, by their own most favourable account of themselves; and even their account of themselves was by no means favourable. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not talk of meeting our own born brother [...] "at a family function" [...] as if he were some infinitely distant cousin whom we only met at Christmas. You and I, when we suddenly feel inclined for a chat with the same brother about his dinner and the Coal Strike, do not generally select either wireless telegraphy or the Atlantic Cable as the most obvious and economical channel for that outburst of belated chattiness. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not talk, if it is proposed to start a railway between Catsville and Dogtown, as if the putting up of a station at Dogtown could have no kind of economic effect on the putting up of a station at Catsville. <b>You</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think it candid to say that when we are at one end of a telephone we have no sort of connection with the other end. These things have got into the region of farce; and should be dealt with farcically, not even ferociously.|$|E

6000|$|... "I--I {{might have}} known," [...] she answered, [...] "I {{might have known}} what he was. I had heard you talk of him. I had seen him in <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know. Do you {{remember}} that day {{when we were in}} the summer-house together at Glencoe, long ago? When you had come back from seeing him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} need fear doing so. You have seen an insect go through strange metamorphoses, and yet remain the same individual; why should not <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so likewise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] she said, with {{a glance}} of blended admiration and pity, [...] "they tell me time was when gold was {{not good enough for}} <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think it could be." ...|$|E
60|$|And I do lift my aching arms to <b>you,</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> lift my anguished, avid breast, And I do weep {{for very}} pain of you, And fling {{myself at the}} doors of sleep, for rest.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's not a fair question,' says I, 'after {{what you}} have said; however, lest you should think I wait only for a recantation of it, I shall answer you plainly, No, not I; my {{business}} is of another kind with <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect <b>you</b> would have turned my serious application to you, in my own distracted case, into a comedy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All be fair in war, my beauty," [...] {{replied the}} Earl. [...] "Egad," [...] he continued, [...] "methinks {{all would be}} fair in hell were they like unto you. It has been some years since <b>I</b> have seen <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know the old fox Richard de Tany kept such a package as this hid in his grimy old castle." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{day after}} the US presidential {{election}} many of us woke to an unexpected election outcome: and the deep irony is not that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect it but that governments, pollsters and political experts {{all over the world}} did not expect it. As with Brexit, we woke to find a world surprised and unprepared for what would come next - but knowing that the world order had changed...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} should have a talk," [...] the wub said. [...] "I'd like to discuss this with you, Captain, if I might. I can see that <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not agree on some basic issues." ...|$|E
6000|$|Winston's {{face was}} grim. [...] "I'm afraid {{it would not}} suit me {{to do as much}} just now," [...] he said. [...] "Still, between <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> <b>do</b> you believe it likely that I would fly at that kind of game?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can I explain it, but {{it would}} be so. I shall always be very glad to see <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> feel {{that we ought to be}} friends,--because I took such a liberty with you. But in this matter I cannot help you." ...|$|E

6000|$|Her eyes, {{large and}} very dark, almost black, {{gazed at him}} appealingly, as she said: [...] "Pardon me for a little deception. I am your {{relation}} only in a spiritual sense--I share your sorrow, and in other ways I am related to you. I was eager to see <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not send in my name {{for the reason that}} it would have repelled <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> might have refused to meet me." ...|$|R

"Kicking {{off with}} a deliciously angry grunt that plays on loop (UHH!!!) the Shellback-produced track finds Lloyd ruing the day she ever stepped out on her man…who’s now being made all the happier by some other chick: 'Remember {{all the things that}} <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> first? <b>And</b> now you’re doing them with her?!'

6000|$|... 'Oh, Miss Wilfer, this {{is hardly}} charitable. I ask you nothing but what your own {{emphasis}} suggests. However, I waive even that question.
