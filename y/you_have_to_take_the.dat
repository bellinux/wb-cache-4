500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities. Beyoncé noted that the album displayed [...] "sides of [...] {{that only a few}} people had seen", adding that [...] "all of us want happiness... sometimes <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> insecurities to get to the secure place. And all of those things I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E

For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's what was so great about that program." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the campaign trail after her debate preparation, Palin stepped up her attacks on the Democratic candidate for President, Senator Barack Obama. At a fundraising event, Palin explained her new aggressiveness, saying, [...] "There does {{come a time when}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> gloves off and that time is right now." [...] In a campaign appearance on October 4, Palin accused Obama of regarding America as [...] "so imperfect that he's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country." [...] The accusation referred to Obama's contacts with Bill Ayers, a founder of the 1960s radical group called the Weathermen, and a New York Times article describing such contacts. The Obama campaign called the allegation a [...] "smear", citing newspaper commentaries critical of Palin's attack. Obama has condemned the Weathermen's violent actions. The criticism of Obama based on his purported relationship with Ayers was subsequently carried on by McCain himself.|$|E

2500|$|... "Tumble and Fall", {{the third}} track on Pushing the Senses, {{was chosen as}} its lead single, because their European label Play it Again Sam (PIAS), were getting more {{involved}} with the band, believing the song would be a crossover to make them successful in Europe after touring with Coldplay in 2003. The single became the band's most successful single release since [...] "Buck Rogers", reaching the top five in the UK. Grant claimed that [...] "Tumble and Fall" [...] is a love song, but can be interpreted in any way. In an interview with Feederweb, Grant said of the song: [...] "Again {{this is about the}} ups and downs of life. Its about life in general and how you deal with it. It covers the journey of life and how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> ups with the downs. I wasn’t going to record this song. It took me a long time to finish it, to be happy with it, because the song went through various stages. I wasn’t sure if we really needed a tune like that on the album. But I decided to go to the studio to record an acoustic version just to see what happened and that’s how the song started. It was a completely one take vocal, live with the acoustic guitar and we built everything else around it. It is an acoustic track that grew into what it is now. So that was the only song that we recorded like that on the album, so it is a bit different for that reason and is probably why it has an organic feel to it".|$|E

That's only one of a heap of improvements. Another is that my Casino's scheduled to be a home from home, a place you can be real cosy in. You'll look around you, and the only thing you'll miss will be mother's face. Yes, sir, there's no need for a gambling Casino to look and feel and smell like the reading-room at the British Museum.
