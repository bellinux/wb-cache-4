500|$|Such {{educational}} comics {{have been}} criticised for ignoring the special relevance the subject has to the LGBT community, with homosexuality marginalized {{in favour of}} depicting HIV {{as a threat to}} conventional heterosexual relationships. This has been blamed on the continuing perception that comics are for young people, and as such should be [...] "universalised" [...] rather than targeting specific groups, and hence are heteronormative, failing to provide characters that LGBT-identfying <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> identify with. Other educational comic books such as the Swiss Jo (1991) also exclude explicit reference to homosexuality (as well as drug-taking and prostitution), in spite of their target audience being older.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} of the game was led by Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who was stated by Capcom to be aiming to [...] "deliver the most impressive Resident Evil title ever {{both in terms of}} scope and production values". Capcom also asserted that the game was meant to take an approach to [...] "evolve" [...] the series. The staff wanted to give the game a new setting with Sasaki wishing to place it in China. While the country of Edonia was not modelled from any country in Europe, it was given an Eastern European theme. According to Famitsu, the character of Jake Muller was designed to be [...] "someone today’s <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> empathize with". The game had a development staff of more than 600, making it Capcom's largest production to date. The decision to bring back zombies into Resident Evil 6 was made by Kobayashi, who felt that they were a popular component for the franchise, as well as complying per fans' requests. Hirabayashi admitted that the game had radically changed {{at the end of the}} development cycle, due to the new concepts it introduced to the series. On 21 August 2012, Resident Evil 6 went gold and initiated its online service.|$|E
500|$|Another {{major theme}} of Austen {{scholarship}} has concerned {{the question of}} the Bildungsroman (novel of education). D.D Devlin in Jane Austen and Education (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways [...] Bildungsroman, where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book The Way of the World [...] called Pride and Prejudice a [...] "classic" [...] Bildungsroman, where Elizabeth Bennet's [...] "prejudice" [...] against Mr. Darcy is really [...] "distrust" [...] and that she [...] "shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an excess of criticism, as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust a priori. Moretti argued that in a typical Bildungsroman of the early 19th century was concerned with [...] "everyday life", which represented [...] "an unchallenged stability of social relationships" [...] in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book The Historicity of Romantic Discourse argued that all of Austen's books were Bildungsroman, where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly [...] "internal" [...] as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their [...] "self". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel Joseph Andrews, where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her [...] "prejudice" [...] against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an [...] "external" [...] to [...] "internal" [...] conflict.|$|E
40|$|Objectives. In this research, we {{investigate}} whether social comparison with <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> result {{in either a}} stereotype-based threat or boost in older people’s performance. Methods. Study 1 used nationally representative data to establish domains of performance in which older people are either stereotypically disadvantaged or advantaged relative to <b>younger</b> <b>people.</b> Study 2 was an experiment to test how a potentially threatening versus control versus enhancing comparison with <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> would affect performance in negatively and positively stereotyped task domains. Results. As predicted, compared with the control condition, stereotype threat caused performance decrements in both task domains. This effect was partially mediated by anxiety. Moreover, the enhancing social comparison boosted performance, but only on a crossword task, a task on which older people’s abilities are favorably stereotyped. Discussion. The research demonstrates that a threatening comparison can result in underperformance by older people both in negatively and positively self-stereotyped task domains. It also demonstrates that social comparison with <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> enhance older <b>people’s</b> performance in a positively stereotyped task domain. The implications for creating circumstances likely to enable older people to achieve their full potential are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The {{impact of}} [...] "benevolent" [...] and [...] "hostile" [...] {{prejudice}} {{tends to be}} different. The warmth felt towards older or <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> and the knowledge that many {{have no access to}} paid employment means there is often public acceptance that they are deserving of preferential treatment—for example, less expensive movie and bus fares. But the perception of incompetence means older and <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> <b>can</b> be seen as [...] "not up to the job" [...] or [...] "a menace on the roads," [...] when there is little or exaggerated evidence to support this.
