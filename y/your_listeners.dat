6000|$|And {{throwing}} in your discourse this word free, [...] Just to fill up, and as by accident, [...] Look round among <b>your</b> <b>listeners,</b> and see [...] If {{it has had}} at all the effect you meant; [...] Beat a retreat if it fails, carelessly [...] Talking of this and that; but in the event [...] Some one is taken with it, never fear, [...] Push boldly forward, for the road is clear.|$|E
6000|$|In {{after years}} I was {{appalled at the}} audacity of that schedule, and I think I had the grace to be scared at the time, but I swung into it recklessly. Tickets had been taken {{by some of the}} best known men among the teachers, and I was assured by Mrs. Payne that we would have the most {{distinguished}} audience that ever graced Hyde Park. [...] "Among <b>your</b> <b>listeners</b> will be the literary editors of several Boston papers, two celebrated painters, and several well-known professors of oratory," [...] she said, and like Lieutenant Napoleon called upon to demonstrate his powers, I graved with large and ruthless fist, and approached my opening date with palpitating but determined heart.|$|E

I {{can show you}} a dozen {{sensible}} ones who would discuss dress reform and charity with you and enjoy Greek tragedy if you did the chorus for them as you did for me," [...] said Rose consolingly, for Steve would only jeer.|$|R
60|$|There are but two {{subjects}} {{upon which}} one may discourse {{with a free}} imagination, and {{without the possibility of}} being controverted. You may talk of your dreams; and you may tell what you heard a parrot say. Both Morpheus and the bird are incompetent witnesses; and <b>your</b> <b>listener</b> dare not attack your recital. The baseless fabric of a vision, then, shall furnish my theme--chosen with apologies and regrets instead of the more limited field of pretty Polly's small talk.|$|R

The cry of the widow and the {{children}} lingers too long in your ears. Remember some of your earlier sermons {{at the beginning of}} the war. Remember how wonderfully you spoke one morning at St. Paul's upon the spirituality to be developed by suffering, by sacrifice. `The hand which chastises also purifies.' Wasn't that what you said? You probably didn't know that I was one of <b>your</b> <b>listeners,</b> even--I myself, in those days, scarcely looked upon the war as I do now. I remember crawling in at the side door of the Cathedral and sitting unrecognised on a hard chair. It was a great congregation, and I was far away in the background, but I heard. I remember the rustle, too, the little moaning, indrawn breath of emotion when the people rose to their feet. Take heart, Bishop. I will remind you once more of your own words `These are the days of purification.'" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{interview}} between Captain Daggett and the Widow White lasted {{more than}} an hour. In that time the former had gleaned all the information the latter could give, and they parted on the best terms in the world. It {{is true that the}} captain gave the widow nothing--he had acquitted his conscience on this score, by re-paying the deacon the money the last had advanced--but he listened in the most exemplary manner to all she had to say; and, with a certain class of vehement talkers, the most favoured being in the world is <b>your</b> good <b>listener.</b> Interest had given the stranger an air of great attention, and the delighted woman had poured out her torrent of words in a way that gratified, in the highest degree, her intense desire to be imparting information. When they separated, it was with an understanding that letters, on the same interesting subject, should pass between them.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately, the new {{distributors}} of Music of <b>Your</b> Life wanted <b>listeners</b> in the 25 to 54 age group (the most desired audience for advertisers), while the music {{had been designed}} for listeners over 50. Ham, who had wanted to retire, had to take over once again. He realized that as Americans aged, perhaps advertisers would {{take an interest in}} the older audience once again. Ham redesigned the music, since someone 50 years old in the 1990s would be of a different generation than the 50-year-old he targeted in 1978. Ham then secured a distribution deal with Jones Radio Networks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} are!" [...] he of the Easy Chair exclaimed; {{but he could}} not help a {{forgiving}} laugh. [...] "In a way you are right. The world belongs to youth, and so it ought to be the best thing for itself in it. Youth is a very curious thing, and in that it is like spring, especially like the spring we have just been having, to our cost. It is the only period of life, as spring is the only season of the year, that has too much time on its hands. Yet {{it does not seem to}} waste time, as age does, as winter does; it keeps doing something all the while. The things it does are apparently very futile and superfluous, some of them, but in the end something has been accomplished. After a March of whimsical suns and snows, an April of quite fantastical frosts and thaws, and a May, at least partially, of cold mists and parching winds, the flowers, which the florists have been forcing for the purpose, are blooming in the park; the grass is green wherever it has not had the roots trodden out of it, and a filmy foliage, like the soft foulard tissues which the young girls are wearing, drips from the trees. You can say it is all very painty, the verdure; too painty; but you cannot reject the picture because of this little mannerism of the painter. To be sure, you miss the sheeted snows and the dreamy weft of leafless twigs against the hard, blue sky. Still, now it has come, you cannot deny that the spring is pretty, or that the fashionable colors which it has introduced are charming. It is said that these are so charming that a woman of the worst taste cannot choose amiss among them. In spite of her taste, her hat comes out a harmonic miracle; her gown, against all her endeavors, flows in an exquisite symphony of the tender audacities of tint with which nature mixes her palette; little notes of chiffon, of tulle, of feather, blow all about her. This is rather a medley of metaphors, to which several arts contribute, but you get my meaning?" [...] In making this appeal, he of the Easy Chair saw in the fixed eye of the poet that remoteness of regard which denotes that <b>your</b> <b>listener</b> has been hearing very little of what you have been saying.|$|R

50|$|It’s {{important}} to not underestimate <b>your</b> <b>listeners,</b> {{the worst thing}} a band or musician {{can do is to}} think that their audience is less capable off themselves, because than you always write to the lowest common denominator and that is how you write shit music. But if you consider your audience to be highly intelligent, and highly capable of taking to musical journeys, than you’re always trying to write something above yourself and reach further. I think that’s really important. Expect the unexpected.|$|E
5000|$|During a June 2017 guest {{appearance}} on the Alex Jones Show, Mr. Steele said, [...] "This may strike <b>your</b> <b>listeners</b> as way out, but we actually {{believe that there is}} a colony on Mars. It is populated by children who were kidnapped and sent into space on a 20 year ride so that once they get to Mars they have no alternative but to be slaves on the Mars colony." [...] Subsequently, a NASA spokesman issued a denial stating that, [...] "There are no humans on Mars." ...|$|E
5000|$|Johnson's book People in Quandaries: The Semantics of Personal Adjustment (1946; {{still in}} print from the Institute of General Semantics) is an {{excellent}} introduction to general semantics applied to psychotherapy. In 1956 his <b>Your</b> Most Enchanted <b>Listener</b> was published; in 1972, his Living With Change: The Semantics of Coping, a collection of selected portions of transcriptions of hundreds of his talks, organized by Dorothy Moeller, provided further general semantic insights. He also published many articles in his lifetime, in journals, including ETC: A Review of General Semantics. 1 Neil Postman acknowledges the influence of People in Quandaries in his own excellent general semantics book Crazy Talk, Stupid Talk (1976, Delacorte, New York): ...|$|R
5000|$|Part of the Audience Engine's {{philosophy}} is {{to retain the}} listener's or reader's attention on the station website, rather than redirect them to external social media. [...] "Community based radio stations have {{to start thinking about}} online platforms that don’t effectively abandon discussion and networking to Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or LinkedIn, {{and the rest of the}} usual suspects," [...] said Matthew Lasar at Radio Survivor. [...] "Once <b>your</b> <b>listeners</b> and/or website readers are off to Twitter/Facebook-land, they’re all but gone. They’re not commenting on your podcast or stream or blog post in your house. They’re far far away, helping Mark Zuckerberg bring in that advertisement and audience data cash." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rubato, Philipp wrote, {{does not}} mean playing out of time, but rather, [...] "any ritenuto {{that we may be}} impelled to make, must be {{compensated}} by a corresponding accelerando and also the opposite, the bass keeping exactly the time." [...] Although Philipp abhorred distortions in interpreting pieces, he believed that [...] "even when all the interpretive signs are exactly observed, there remains ample scope for self expression and liberty. You must be living and feeling the drama or the poem or the piece you play, in all its inflections and shades of emotion. What you do not feel yourself, <b>your</b> <b>listeners</b> will not get. You must be fully absorbed in the interpretation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gingrey gained notoriety {{when he ran}} {{afoul of}} {{conservative}} radio host Rush Limbaugh in January 2009 when he criticized an editorial comment wherein Limbaugh accused the Republican leadership of appeasing popular President Barack Obama. Limbaugh stated on his radio program that [...] "He (Obama) is obviously more frightened of me (Limbaugh) than he is of Mitch McConnell. He's more frightened of me, than he is of say, John Boehner, which doesn't say much about our party." [...] Gingrey then came {{to the defense of}} the Republican leaders, saying that Limbaugh should [...] "back off" [...] and further commenting [...] "I think that our leadership, Mitch McConnell and John Boehner, are taking the right approach. I mean, it's easy if you're Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or even sometimes Newt Gingrich to stand back and throw bricks. You don't have to try to do what's best for your people or your party." [...] Gingrey's office was immediately flooded with complaints from Limbaugh's followers, and he promptly arranged to appear as a guest on the Limbaugh show and apologized, saying, [...] "Rush, thank you so much. I thank you for the opportunity, of course this is not exactly the way to I wanted to come on. … Mainly, I want to express to you and all <b>your</b> <b>listeners</b> my very sincere regret for those comments I made yesterday to Politico. … I clearly ended up putting my foot in my mouth with some of those comments, and I just wanted to tell you, Rush, and all the 'conservative giants' who help us so much to maintain our base and grow it and get back this majority that I regret those stupid comments." ...|$|E
