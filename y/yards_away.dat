5|$|One {{weakness}} in Virginia Tech's offense {{was in the}} kicking game, controlled by placekicker Atle Larsen. During the regular season, Larsen was successful on just 12 of 20 field goal attempts, and his longest successful kick was from just 44 <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves. Scully dismisses this theory and instead credits the belief to clinical lycanthropy. The elder Parker is subsequently ripped apart by an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious a few hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1818 a {{golf course}} was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club, a group of Manchester businessmen, {{some of whom had}} emigrated from Scotland. This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland. The course at that time {{consisted}} of only five holes and had no fairways or greens as the players had to share the ground with other users. The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road. By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> at Kersal Vale.|$|E
60|$|Richard {{glanced at}} that ominous glitter in Crawshay's right hand, glanced at Brightman, {{and at the}} giant who was {{standing}} barely a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> and shrugged his shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't been a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> {{from the}} {{governor}} this afternoon till I started for here." [...] The genuineness of the accent surprised Heyst, without convincing him of {{the truth of the}} words.|$|R
6000|$|Drawing a leathern mitten {{from his}} belt, the youth {{held it to}} Crusoe's nose, and then threw it a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> {{at the same time}} exclaiming in a loud, {{distinct}} tone, [...] "Fetch it." ...|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{exited the}} mass of {{aircraft}} and was immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b> Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it {{to be one of}} the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month's tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the Wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).|$|E
5|$|Mark Rathbun {{spent only}} {{four days in}} the Hole in 2004 but says that he left after seeing his old friend Tom De Vocht being {{physically}} beaten by Miscavige. According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered to jog to a building 400 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in. He subsequently rented a car and spent a month touring the South before settling in southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|On 2 February 2005, Hardee's {{body was}} {{recovered}} from Greenland Dock, {{after he was}} reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January; he had been last seen late-night on 30 January. A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying {{to make his way}} home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk. But the Coroner found that, whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the quayside, Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk.|$|E

6000|$|He saw Noel. She had swayed back, {{and stood}} about a <b>yard</b> <b>away.</b> He could dimly see her {{covering}} {{her face with}} her arms. Feeling instinctively that she wanted to hide her fright, he said quietly: ...|$|R

5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (<b>yards)</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|The British waited half an {{hour before}} attacking again. This time when they {{attacked}}, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone wall {{on the opposite side of}} the road.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> {{from the body of}} a man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
60|$|The {{voice was}} now beside them, {{scarcely}} a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> yet {{they could see}} nothing {{on account of the}} light, which was intermittent, frequently going out for an instant as the operator's thumb tired on the switch.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowd had}} eyes for naught but Akoon, and the rifle of Porportuk’s man lay across {{the hollow of}} his arm, the muzzle {{directed}} at Akoon a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> the man’s thumb on the hammer. But Akoon did nothing.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} who knew it hovered near, relying upon burnt sacrifices to the great joss, Luck. His piety was rewarded, for, in turning a page, her book slipped from her fingers and bounded from the bench a full <b>yard</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
5|$|Walsh was {{employed}} with the FBI until 1942 when, as a Reserve Marine Lieutenant, {{he took a}} leave to serve with the United States Marine Corps during World War II. After he left, Hoover refused to allow any more active agents {{to be members of}} any military reserve. He fought in the Pacific Theater, specifically on Okinawa and in North China. In one incident, he and his comrades were pinned down by a sniper, whom Walsh was able to kill from 90 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> with a single shot to the torso from a M1911 pistol. He earned the rank of Colonel and returned to the FBI for two years from 1946–1947. In total, during his tenure with the agency, he killed between 11 and 17 suspects.|$|E
5|$|What {{followed}} {{is unclear}} {{as there are}} several versions. Oesau was chased by 1st Lt. James Leslie Doyle, 1st Lt. Wilbur L. Jarvis III and 1st Lt. James C. Austin, of the 428th Fighter Squadron (474th FG, 9th AF). All three were experienced pilots and chased Oesau from 28,000 feet to tree-top level. In the ensuing 20 minute dogfight, Oesau defended skillfully, though his aircraft was damaged by gunfire. While attempting an emergency landing, his Gustav received a final burst of fire in the cockpit area and crashed into the ground 6 miles south west of St. Vith. His body was thrown clear of the aircraft some <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the first-half, it was Alavés who started the half the better of the two sides. Contra put a cross from {{the right side of}} the pitch into the penalty area, which was met by Moreno, whose header beat Westerveld to make the scoreline 3–2. Four minutes later Alavés had equalised. They were awarded a free-kick 25 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> from goal and Moreno went straight through the Liverpool wall and into the goal past Westerveld. Liverpool reacted to the scoreline being levelled at 3–3 by substituting Stéphane Henchoz with Vladimír Šmicer. Steven Gerrard was placed in the right-back position as a result of the change. Three minutes later, Owen was brought down by defender Antonio Karmona, who was subsequently booked. Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, which Gary McAllister hit into the Alavés wall. In the 64th minute, both sides made substitutions. Liverpool replaced Emile Heskey with Robbie Fowler, while Alavés goalscorer Javi Moreno with Pablo.|$|E
60|$|A startled exclamation {{directly}} behind him {{brought him to}} his feet in a flash, every muscle tense. He whirled his stick above his head as he turned, ready to strike, then let it fall with a clatter. For there, a bare <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> stood Betty.|$|R
6000|$|... "The monster gave {{a sudden}} flop that sent me {{head over heels}} a <b>yard</b> <b>away.</b> Then it tried to swim down the stream. But the hook and line held fast, and soon the fish {{realized}} it was firmly caught, after which it wisely abandoned the struggle.|$|R
50|$|The haveli of 'Nawab of Loharu', {{known as}} Mahal Sara, lies in Gali Qasim Jan, Ballimaran, where his son-in-law, noted poet Mirza Ghalib stayed {{for a few}} years, whose own haveli lies a few <b>yard</b> <b>away.</b> Now a gali is known as Kothi Nawab Loharu lane in Ballimaran, Chandni Chowk, Delhi.|$|R
5|$|On 9June 2004, the {{day after}} the first of a 21st-century pair of Venus transits {{occurred}} as predicted by Horrocks, a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove, which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft. In December 2005, a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road, which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family {{at the time he was}} collaborating with Horrocks. The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6June 2012, and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole, which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website. A celebration was also held at Crabtree's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re-creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage, inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural, to millions of viewers, and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|The {{incompletion}} on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> which is not considered a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
60|$|Then, to his astonishment, {{the hand}} he had laid upon the hat was {{snatched}} away, and next moment Hetty, {{with a red}} spot in her cheek, stood at least a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> from him. She had moved so quickly {{that he was not}} quite sure how she had got there.|$|R
6000|$|He {{seized a}} fork and spoon and assailed the bombe. It cut rather stiffly. [...] "Come up!" [...] said Kipps, with {{concentrated}} bitterness, and the truncated summit of the bombe flew off suddenly, travelling eastward with remarkable velocity. Flop, it went upon the floor a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> and for awhile time seemed empty.|$|R
50|$|On the book's website, Maddox also jokingly {{listed a}} set of rules for fans, such as barring eye contact or talking {{directly}} to him (referring to an urban legend about popular figures such as Hillary Clinton and Shania Twain), formal dress attire, and remaining at least three feet (1 <b>yard)</b> <b>away</b> at all times.|$|R
5|$|Hunter's force {{advanced}} {{towards the}} town in a semi-circle formation, composed by the four battalions arranged {{from left to right}} in the following order: the 10th Sudanese, 9th Sudanese, the reduced 3rd Egyptian, and the 11th Sudanese. The artillery battery was with the 3rd Egyptian. The force reached the ridge of the plateau overlooking the town, about three hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> at a quarter past six. Major-General Hunter, finding the Mahdist garrison prepared for the assault and entrenched in their defenses, ordered the artillery to bombard their positions, which commenced at six-thirty. However, the artillery proved ineffective, as the guns were unable to strike within the narrow trenches or blast aside the cover behind which the Mahdist infantry waited. Hunter ceased the barrage, and ordered Lieutenant MacDonald to lead his brigade in a general advance. The command to fix bayonets was given, and the troops began an orderly advance across the three hundred yards that separated them from their objective. However, facing a line of Mahdist riflemen well-protected in their trenches, the soldiers of each advancing battalion were compelled to open fire without direct orders. The uncoordinated volleys of the advancing brigade were moderately effective against the Mahdist riflemen, who had not yet returned fire. When the battalions were about halfway across the three hundred yard stretch, their lines of fire began to converge due to their semi-circle formation, and the 10th Sudanese, on the left, was forced to halt to avoid coming under the fire of the rightmost 11th Sudanese.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{continued}} northeast, becoming {{large and}} wedge-shaped. It then passed {{just north of}} Fairview, completely destroying multiple homes and debarking numerous hardwood trees. Pieces of debris were found speared through vehicles in this area. The tornado then briefly passed through a section of Morgan County {{near the town of}} Hulaco, destroying several older block-foundation homes and snapping numerous large trees off at the base. The tornado then crossed into Marshall County and impacted the rural community of Ruth, just north of Arab. A large but poorly-anchored brick home was swept completely away in this area, with the debris scattered 100 yards from the foundation. Several large trees on the property were ripped out of the ground and missing, along with a trailer that was unable to be located {{at the time of the}} survey. Multiple other homes and structures were impacted in the Ruth area, and a gas station was completely destroyed. A shed was destroyed with pieces of large farm machinery stored inside thrown up to 20 <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> a storage trailer was tossed 100 yards and found impaled by multiple planks of wood, and concrete power poles in the area were bent over. Arab's power grid was completely crippled by the tornado's effects, and many roads in the area were obstructed by downed trees and power lines. The tornado damaged and destroyed several other homes, garages, and sheds north of Union Grove before it crossed the Tennessee River, snapping numerous trees in a forested area before dissipating.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{dominated}} {{the majority of}} the first half. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech's third-string kicker Justin Myer kicked a 37-yard field goal, which was the only scoring play of the quarter. Myer added a 43-yard field goal in the second quarter. At the end of the half, however, Denard Robinson threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Junior Hemingway to give Michigan a 7–6 lead and on the ensuing kickoff, Michigan's J.B. Fitzgerald forced a fumble, which Michigan recovered. Michigan's Brendan Gibbons kicked a 24-yard field goal as time expired. In the third quarter, Michigan scored another touchdown on a Denard Robinson to Junior Hemingway pass, this time from 18 yards out. This scoring drive followed an interception by linebacker Frank Clark. Virginia Tech responded with another Justin Myer field goal, this time from 36 <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b> In the fourth quarter, Virginia Tech's quarterback Logan Thomas trimmed Michigan's lead to two points, and then promptly tied the game throwing a successful two-point conversion to Marcus Davis. Michigan responded with a 39-yard Brendan Gibbons field goal, but Virginia Tech tied the game with two seconds remaining via a 25-yard field goal by Myer. In overtime, Virginia Tech seemingly scored the go-ahead touchdown on a Logan Thomas to Danny Coale pass, but video review overturned the play. The next play saw Myer miss a 37-yard field goal. Michigan received the ball and saw Gibbons kick the game-winning 37-yard field goal.|$|E
60|$|I was in Regent Street, and I had {{collided}} with a decent-looking working man; and a <b>yard</b> <b>away,</b> perhaps, and looking a little perplexed with himself, was Gip. There {{was some sort of}} apology, and then Gip had turned and come to me with a bright little smile, as though for a moment he had missed me.|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} a strange one, {{flickering}} and yet constant, with the thousands of firearms, which kept up an unceasing roar. The swords clashed and ground together, and after a pass or two both men drew back. A bright flash from a musket not a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> threw a bright though momentary light on their faces.|$|R
60|$|A moment {{more and}} Walthew saw {{something}} glisten {{in the hand}} of the stealthy figure that seemed ready to spring. He was only a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> and, acting on impulse, he stumbled as if by accident and fell against the man. The knife dropped with a jingle, and the messenger dashed past, throwing Walthew a quick glance as he went.|$|R
