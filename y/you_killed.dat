5|$|Abu Qatada Ansari, a {{companion}} of Muhammad, who accompanied Khalid from Medina was so shocked at Malik's murder by Khalid that he immediately returned to Medina, and told Abu Bakr that {{he refused to}} serve under a commander who had killed a Muslim. The death of Malik and Khalid's taking of his wife Layla created controversy. Some officers of his army—including Abu Qatadah—believed that Khalid killed Malik to take his wife. After the pressure exerted by Umar—Khalid's cousin and one of Caliph Abu Bakr's main advisors—Abu Bakr called Khalid back to Medina to explain himself. Although Khalid had declared Malik an apostate, in Medina, ‘Umar told Khâlid: “You enemy of Allâh! <b>You</b> <b>killed</b> a Muslim man and then leap upon his wife. By Allâh, I will stone you". Some have argued that Umar later dismissed him from army service over this.|$|E

500|$|To {{design the}} missions, the {{designers}} {{began with a}} cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing {{the use of violence}} and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene {{from the end of the}} game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained [...] "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – <b>you</b> <b>killed</b> the maids, <b>you</b> <b>killed</b> the old people, <b>you</b> <b>killed</b> the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero...

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion {{at the end of the}} tenth century. There are a relatively large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a [...] "hermit's" [...] or [...] "priest's isle" [...] from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and the use of Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that the Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion. According to the Orkneyinga Saga the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said [...] "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have <b>you</b> <b>killed</b> on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel." [...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century and there is then a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079.|$|E

[...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop, Henry of Lund (also known as [...] "the Fat"), who was appointed sometime prior to 1035. The greatest source of Scottish influence after the appointment of the Scottish earls in the 13th century was probably through the church, although {{it is clear that}} Scots influence on the culture of Orkney and Shetland was fairly limited until the close of the 14th century or later. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves Communitas Orchadensis and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords, be they Norwegian or Scots. This independence of mind may have been fostered by the influence of Norwegian government which was essentially communal and federal by contrast with Scotland. It was not until the mid 16th century that the Norse institutions were replaced by Scottish systems following large-scale immigration from the south [...] and the islanders were probably bi-lingual until the 17th century.|$|E
