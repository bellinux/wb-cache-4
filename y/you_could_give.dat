500|$|While Windows RT {{functions}} {{similarly to}} Windows 8, {{there are still}} some notable differences, primarily involving software and hardware compatibility. Julie Larson-Green, then {{executive vice president of the}} Devices and Studios group at Microsoft, explained that Windows RT was ultimately designed to provide a [...] "closed, turnkey" [...] user experience, [...] "where it doesn't have all the flexibility of Windows, but it has the power of Office and then all the new style applications. So <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> it to your kid and he's not going to load it up with a bunch of toolbars accidentally out of Internet Explorer and then come to you later and say, 'why am I getting all these pop-ups?' It just isn't capable of doing that by design." ...|$|E
500|$|Kvinneakt was {{designed}} and created by Norman J. Taylor, a Seattle-based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington, between 1973 and 1975. The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full-length nude woman measuring 71" [...] x 38" [...] x 25". Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition. The works were purchased through a budget of $250,000; Kvinneakt was commissioned {{at a cost of}} $6,500. Funding sources for the project included Tri-Met (20percent) and the United States Department of Transportation (80percent). Of the 11 sculptures, only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough's (née Conchuratt) Cat in Repose were considered [...] "figurative". Claiming his intention was not to be vulgar, Taylor said: [...] "It's about grace and motion and a certain beauty and pride in the human figure. That may be sensual, but that's far different from sex." [...] According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council, Taylor intended the piece to be [...] "confrontational"; he admitted, [...] "the worst reaction <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> my work is no reaction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cox went on {{to suggest}} that oysters would be {{acceptable}} to eat, even by strict ethical criteria, {{if they did not}} feel: [...] "while <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> them the benefit of the doubt, you could also say that unless some new evidence of a capacity for pain emerges, the doubt is so slight that there is no good reason for avoiding eating sustainably produced oysters." [...] Cox has added that, although he believes in some of the ethical reasons for vegetarianism, he is not strictly a vegan or even a vegetarian because he consumes oysters.|$|E

2500|$|Jamaican male sexual {{identity}} {{has long been}} defined in opposition to homosexuality. According to Dr. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a {{professor of anthropology at}} the University of the West Indies, [...] "A lot of Jamaican men, if you call them a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It's the worst insult <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> to a Jamaican man." [...] Dr. Stewart believes that homophobia influences almost every aspect of life and shapes the everyday language of ghetto youth. [...] "It's like if you say, 'Come back here,' they will say, 'No, no, no don't say 'come back'.' You have to say 'come forward,' because come back is implying that you're 'coming in the back,' which is how gay men have sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|His eloquence was in vain, and {{his request}} {{to be shot}} was denied. On 10 November 1798, he was found guilty and was {{sentence}}d to be hanged on 12 November. Before this sentence was carried out, either he attempted suicide by slitting his throat or British soldiers tortured and mortally wounded Tone. The story goes that he was initially saved when the wound was sealed with a bandage, and he was told if he tried to talk the wound would open and he would bleed to death. He responded by saying [...] "I can yet find words to thank you sir; it is the most welcome news <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> me. What should I wish to live for?".|$|E
2500|$|In his 1955 investigation, Moseley {{found other}} flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed {{several of the}} people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these {{witnesses}} contradicted Adamski's claims. One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard [...] "a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc." [...] several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a [...] "planned operation." [...] Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: [...] "Now you know the [...] picture connected to your name is in the book (Flying Saucers Have Landed) too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers...you could do yourself a lot of good. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>give</b> lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name." ...|$|E
