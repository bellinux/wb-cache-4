40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{benefits}} Cue: While agroforestry, as a science, is quite new, in fact farmers have been enjoying the benefits of having trees on their farms for generations. Some trees, for example, produce nutrient-rich leaves which, when they fall on the soil, act as a natural fertilizer. In the lakeshore areas of Malawi, Faidherbia albida trees, known locally as msangu, are often left by farmers, who recognise the fertility benefit they give. But agroforestry {{is about more than}} just increasing soil fertility. Carefully chosen trees and shrubs, if planted on farms, can provide a huge range of benefits, from building materials to insecticides. Excello Zidana recently spoke to Dr Henry Phombeya, Project Co-ordinator for Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, about the many advantages of having trees on farms. IN:		?There are several and normally I like dividing them. ? OUT:		?. agroforestry really can help to boast crop yields. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 29 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Henry Phombeya of Malawi?s Land Resource Centre, talking to Excello Zidana. Transcript Phombeya	There are several and normally I like dividing them in two categories. We?ve got some technologies that are dealing with soil fertility improvement and for these we use shrubs like Tephrosia vogelii, Sesbania sesban, and trees like Faidherbia albida locally known as msangu or mtete. And then there are some technologies that are to do more with afforestation. And here we have trees like the Sennas, Senna spectabilis, Senna siamea. Zidana		What are the other forms of agroforestry that you have been using or that you know? Phombeya	There are other forms yes of agroforestry technologies. For example we can talk of biomass transfer. These are instances where you?ve got trees that are planted say as boundaries around your farm. You can at times prune the branches, take the biomass that you realise from there and apply it to your field. That {{has proved to be a}} very important technology and crops have improved under such systems. And then when you get the leaves like that you have the branches and of course the tree you can use for fuel wood. So you have got two benefits here. Not even two, three. You are improving soil fertility, you have the trees that are demarcating your boundaries to avoid conflict with your neighbours and then you?ve got the fuel wood which is a very important factor now that there is rampant deforestation. Zidana	When we look around in the villages in Malawi we have discovered that a number of farmers have taken up the technology of using Tephrosia vogelii. What are the specific advantages regarding this shrub? Phombeya	Tephrosia it?s a very important shrub in that first and foremost it has got a very good biomass that when we incorporate in the soil it helps to build up organic matter. And at the same time it?s a legume, it fixes nitrogen. That?s contributing to soil fertility. But up and above that Tephrosia vogelii has got some insecticidal properties. If you crush the leaves of Tephrosia vogelii and you?ve got maize stalk borer, you put it in the maize funnel the maize stalk borer goes away. So it has got that insecticidal property that is a very important component. Zidana	You also talked about the tree which is locally known as msangu in Malawi. Phombeya	Faidherbia albida, that is the scientific name. Zidana	Faidherbia albida. Now if we talk about the lake shore areas, these trees are numerous, they are all over. Do the farmers realise the importance of retaining or keeping these trees? Phombeya	Yes I did research on Faidherbia albida specifically. And in the survey that we conducted it showed that people value these trees and they deliberately leave them on their farms. And asking them about why they leave them there their answers were, if you plant maize underneath a Faidherbia albida tree it does very well and <b>you?ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> variety of crops that can be grown underneath it. So in a way they know it?s an important tree. Zidana	So they are convinced that if you are using these trees definitely the fertility of the soil may be improved in one way or the other? Phombeya	Yes, they are aware of that, only that they don?t know exactly what happens for that fertility to come about and that?s the work of the scientist. Zidana	You have been talking about the trees like Leucaena but now we haven?t seen you doing much on the Leucaena. Is there any problem? Phombeya	Yes Leucaena leucocephala was a very important tree in those old days when agroforestry just came into the picture. But as we were working with it a terrible pest attacked it. That pest is called psyllid; it?s a pest that attacks the leaves, the tender leaves of Leucaena and it devastates the whole tree. A very dangerous pest. Zidana	But the animals enjoyed consuming or eating the leaves from the Leucaena tree? Phombeya	It was a very good fodder, highly nutritive. But all is not lost because breeders are looking at other species of Leucaena, like Leucaena pallida, Leucaena esculenta. They are looking at Leucaena that have resistance to psyllid attack. Zidana		How do you look at farming if many people adopted this concept? Phombeya	If people adopted agroforestry, like others have already done, productivity of their farms will be very high. We compared fields where we had just maize growing on its own and a plot where we had maize and then the agroforestry species and a bit of chemical fertiliser. The differences in yields were just too high, over 200 %. So agroforestry really can help to boost crop yields. End of track.

40|$|Paprika on a {{large scale}} in Zimbabwe Cue: Throughout history, spice crops have always been among the most {{expensive}} agricultural commodities. So are spices a good choice as a high value cash crop for farmers in sub-Saharan Africa? Choosing the right spice to grow is, not surprisingly, {{an important part of the}} answer. Paprika is a spice crop that over the last 15 years has been successfully grown in Zimbabwe. Paprika pods are thin, red and shiny like hot chilli peppers, but many varieties don?t have the strong taste of chillis. The pods are dried and processed to produce a bright red powder which is often added to other foods to improve their appearance. Demand for natural food colourants is growing, especially in wealthier countries, so paprika could be a good cash crop for farmers to grow. However, as Sylvia Jiyane found out, when she spoke to Mike Randall, a Zimbabwean paprika grower, growing the crop does require quite a lot of investment and expertise. Paprika is a heavy user of fertiliser, and also needs to be treated with pesticides, which when growing large areas will require specialist equipment. In fact, it is estimated that a hectare of paprika will cost a farmer around 1, 500 US dollars to grow, which does not include cost of the spraying machinery. The crop also requires about 200 labour days per hectare, so labour must be available throughout the season. But for larger, commercial farmers like Mike Randall, it is a rewarding crop, and one that can earn an income in foreign currency. IN:		?One of the good things about paprika? OUT:		? northwest of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 30 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that report was sent by Sylvia Jiyane. Transcript Randall	One of the good things about paprika for our area, is that it is quite hardy, and likes our hot conditions. However, at the same time we do have to put quite a lot of water onto it. But you can do it through drip irrigation, and at the same time put fertiliser through, which helps a lot in controlling the disease. Jiyane	What would you say are some of the major costs in paprika production? Randall	I think the major cost is probably the spraying. In order to get good yields from the crop, one of the main things is to plant it as early as you can, at the start of summer. But at the same time, planting early means that you have got to put a lot of chemicals, mainly insecticides, onto the crop, to keep it going throughout the length of summer. So you do have to spend a lot of money on the spraying, and we have had to buy machinery purely for the spraying of paprika. But at the same time, we expect to get good yields, which does justify the expense. Jiyane	When I was driving through your farm, I realised your paprika crop is quite densely populated. How do you harvest the crop? Randall	It is all harvested by hand. It is basically contract harvested. We pay per kg of harvested pods. They have got to be of a certain dryness, and it?s harvested on a daily basis. Jiyane	What are some of the advantages of growing paprika over other crops, such as maize, beans and other legumes? Randall	I think the main advantage is that it is paid on a US dollar based price, so you don?t lose out on the inflation. It?s quite an easy crop to grow, and also to reap, in that you reap it when it is fairly dry, but you are not, like tobacco, you are not pressed to reap it at exactly the right time. You can afford to even let some of it fall onto the ground, so long as you collect it fairly soon, and store it somewhere safe. You can store it for a month or two without losing any value on the crop. So it just gives you a few more options in as far as the right time to sell it. Because sometimes the price that the buyers will pay goes up towards the end of the season, and if you can hang on to your paprika, and then start selling it at the end of the season, you are obviously going to do better out of it. Jiyane		And if you were to advise a farmer who is listening right now, what would you say are the necessary conditions for one to do paprika production? Randall	Firstly, the most important thing is to make sure <b>you?ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> market for it. Now that should not be a problem, because there are a lot of people, a lot of buyers, looking for paprika. Secondly you need some form of water. You can try to rely on the rainfall, but because it is quite an expensive crop to establish and grow well, if you don?t get any rain you are going to lose a lot more money than if you were growing something like sorghum or maize. In so far as the soil types are concerned, it does best in a sandy soil. Sandy loam is probably the most ideal for it, because it doesn?t like getting water-logged; it dies very quickly if it is sitting in pools of water. Now lastly, the labour. We have always hand picked. A lot of the fertiliser and chemicals you can put on by hand. It is a very labour-intensive crop, so it?s a crop that is probably worth avoiding if you don?t have access to a reasonable supply of labour over the growing season. Jiyane	So there we are listeners, I was talking to Mike Randall, a paprika farmer in Unguza area, northwest of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. End of track. Mike Randall explains how growing paprika {{on a large}} scale does require considerable investment, particularly in chemicals and labour, but offers financial rewards in foreign currency...|$|E
40|$|Heartwater Cue: Heartwater {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{diseases}} affecting ruminants in sub-Saharan Africa. Transmitted in the bite of a tick, it can cause death within a few days of the first signs of disease appearing. For this reason, farmers whose animals are at risk must be very alert, in order to notice the first sign of the disease - a high temperature. Treatment at this stage with a tetracycline medicine usually saves the animal?s life, but once later signs of the disease begin, such as nervous movements of the eyes and lips, treatment is much less successful. Animals born in areas where heartwater is present generally develop immunity to the disease at an early age. However, any non-immune animal that is brought into a heartwater area is at risk and should be vaccinated. For this reason, pastoralists who move their flocks and herds in search of grazing are at particular risk of losing animals to heartwater, and exotic breeds are also very vulnerable. To find out more about the disease and how farmers can respond to it, Busani Bafana spoke to Ignatious Ndzinge, a veterinary doctor working in Gabarone, Botswana. He began by asking how the disease is transmitted. IN:		It is transmitted by what ? OUT:		?the animal will survive. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Ignatious Ndzinge emphasising the importance of quick treatment to save livestock that show symptoms of heartwater. Transcript Ndzinge	It is transmitted by what we call the South African bont tick and this tick is one that actually harbours the parasites that cause heartwater. Bafana		What are the signs and symptoms of heartwater? Ndzinge	The animal will start looking sick in the sense of malaise and the temperature goes up and the temperature would be about 40 ø. As time goes on the animal would have staggering gait and eventually they will fall down and later on they will die. Bafana	You also mentioned that there was a rise in temperature. How would I know that, would that be by touching the animal, is there anything physical that can tell me that the animal is suffering from heartwater? Ndzinge	The animal would start not eating. I think that {{is one of the}} things and then the staggering gait and also you will see the animal actually panting, you would know that it has a very high temperature. Touching alone will not help but if <b>you?ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> simple thermometer you can put it in the animal?s bum and you will see how high it is. Bafana	There is also the issue, doctor, of that animal may not be eating. Would I then see that the animal is losing some weight? Ndzinge	No because it is a very very acute disease in the sense that it comes very fast and all of a sudden the animal just goes down, is bumping into fences, trees and things like that. So it is not a disease that you will see gradually the animal losing weight, no. Bafana	How can farmers prevent heartwater from spreading once it has been discovered? Ndzinge	Dipping is one of the things that you have to do. There?s also a vaccine that they can use especially if you are buying cattle from a non-heartwater area they must be vaccinated against heartwater before they are introduced into the heartwater area. So this is one of the things that the farmers have to do to try and prevent it. But failing that it is dipping. Also the dipping should be strategic in a sense that we don?t want it to kill all the ticks but we also want the animals to be used to the tick bite. Bafana	You did talk about vaccines, how accessible are these vaccines to a farmer in a remote area? Ndzinge	Unfortunately this vaccine is what we call the blood vaccine which has to be kept under very low temperatures, - 18 ø and is not always very practical for the farmers to have it spare in remote areas. But it is available, the government of Botswana does make it available and get it transported to most remote areas in the country. But I have to caution that when you are vaccinating you can?t vaccinate pregnant animals because you are actually infecting the animals with the disease and some will abort if they are pregnant. Bafana	Can heartwater be passed on to humans, since Botswana is one of the top meat producing nations in southern Africa? Ndzinge	No it doesn?t affect humans at all. It is just a disease that affects cattle, sheep and goats and as I say like any other ungulates like those wild animals which look like cattle. Bafana	So if I see that my animal is diseased and there is no way of me treating it, I can go ahead and slaughter it? Ndzinge	I would never advise people just to slaughter animals and eat it, because you never know sometimes you may be thinking that it is heartwater but it maybe something else. It could be anthrax, it could be another disease that has got the same clinical signs. So I always say when an animal is sick and you slaughter it just burn the carcass. Bafana	And lastly doctor you operate in central Gaborone and do you have any outreach programmes where you try and reach the farmers in remote areas? Ndzinge	Yes we do that, yes we do go out and talk to farmers and try to educate them about diseases. For example for heartwater we would say that they must always keep Terramycin on their shelves so that when an animal is sick like that they can give you some treatment yes. Bafana	Terramycin is a medical chemical I believe but is there any cultural medicine they can use where Terramycin is not available? Ndzinge	No I don?t know of any but this drug which is an antibiotic and I think in Botswana everybody knows it as machonazotle it?s a very effective drug to use. If you use it in time the animal will survive. End of track. Ignatious Ndzinge, a veterinary doctor working in Gaberone, Botswana...|$|E

40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless <b>you?ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can you explain what you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.

Burstall cast Graeme Blundell in the lead:I remember Bourkie executive Graham Burke saying, <b>Youve</b> <b>got</b> to cast somebody like Jack Thompson. I said, Absolutely not. <b>Youve</b> <b>got</b> to cast somebody who wouldnt, on the surface, seem a stud or even particularly attractive. I actually thought that Alvin wasnt, that the comic element was connected with having a Woody Allen or a Dustin Hoffman figure who is not very obviously sexually attractive, and the girls rushing him. This becomes much funnier than {{if he was a}} stud figure.Blundell was paid $500 a week for the role.|$|R
