Our sound is recognizable each time you listen {{to one of our}} songs and that's something we really want for our music. You have the fastest rhythms, the more danceable ones, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> you can expect from an Anthrax record." [...] Benante said that elements from their earlier albums are still present on the record, though it explores [...] "other territories".|$|E

[...] She described the shooting process as [...] "the fun part" [...] because of: [...] "working with people I love—it’s always a great human moment because we’re sharing things and it’s good to see people who are here {{for you and your}} story, to tell your story.

2500|$|In 1975, Laughlin {{released}} The Master Gunfighter, {{a western}} {{set in the}} 1840s, detailing {{the plight of the}} Chumash people. Laughlin grew a full beard for the film and his character fought with both a 12-shot revolver and a samurai sword. Although it did reasonably well at the box office, critics were not pleased with the film. He returned to the Billy Jack franchise in 1977. However, the fourth entry in the series, Billy Jack Goes to Washington was a failure because of distribution problems, and it proved to be Laughlin's final film as a director. Laughlin blamed individuals within the United States government for the failure of the picture, telling CNN's Showbiz Tonight in 2005:At a private screening, Senator Vance Hartke [...] got up, because it was about how the Senate was bought out by the nuclear industry. He got up and charged me. Walter Cronkite's daughter was there, [...] Lucille Ball. And he said, 'You'll never get this released. This house <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>everything</b> will be destroyed.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Most [...] "classical compatibilists", such as Thomas Hobbes, {{claim that}} a person is acting on the person's own will only when it is the desire of that person to do the act, and also {{possible}} for the person {{to be able to do}} otherwise, if the person had decided to. Hobbes sometimes attributes such compatibilist freedom to each individual and not to some abstract notion of will, asserting, for example, that [...] "no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or inclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that he finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination to doe." [...] In articulating this crucial proviso, David Hume writes, [...] "this hypothetical liberty is universally allowed to belong to every one who is not a prisoner and in chains." [...] Similarly, Voltaire, in his Dictionnaire philosophique, claimed that [...] "Liberty then is only and can be only the power to do what one will." [...] He asked, [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>everything</b> at the pleasure of a million blind caprices?" [...] For him, free will or liberty is [...] "only the power of acting, what is this power? It is the effect of the constitution and present state of our organs." ...|$|E
