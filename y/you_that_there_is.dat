He addressed the publication to The Mayors; The City Manager; The City Transit Engineer; The members of The Committee on Mass-Transportation and The Tax-Payers and The Riding Citizens of Your Community. In it he wrote This is an urgent warning {{to each and every}} one of <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a careful, deliberately planned campaign to swindle you out of your most important and valuable public utilities–your Electric Railway System.|$|E
500|$|In May 2012, Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "I Care" [...] {{during her}} [...] revue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States' entertainment resort, hotel, casino and spa, Revel. Jim Farber of Daily News wrote that [...] "she delivered it with equal parts defiance and need". Dan DeLuca of The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded, [...] "The set list tipped too heavily at times towards bombastic balladry like 'I Care' and 'I Miss You'" [...] Tris McCall of New Jersey On-Line praised {{the performance of}} [...] "I Care" [...] during the show writing that she [...] "matched her guitar player’s solo note for note during a scalding version of 'I Care.'" [...] In 2013, [...] "I Care" [...] {{was part of the}} set list of The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour where Beyoncé performed it seated on a bar stool wearing a black fedora. The Observers Kitty Empire felt that the set [...] "dip" [...] with the performance of [...] "I Care" [...] before adding that [...] " [...] reminding <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> filler, even on Beyoncé albums" [...] In 2016, a medley with Ghost was used as an interlude between All Night and Don't Hurt Yourself in her The Formation World Tour.|$|E
500|$|Champollion was {{particularly}} {{captured by the}} array of important monuments and inscriptions at Thebes, and decided {{to spend as much}} time there as possible on the way back north. South of Thebes, the Isis sprang leak and nearly sank. Having lost many provisions and spent several days repairing the boat they continued south to Aswan where the boats had to be left, since they could not make it across the first Cataract. They traveled by small boats and camelback to Elephantine and Philae. At Philae, Champollion spent several days recovering from an attack of gout brought on by the hard trip, and he also received letters from his wife and brother, both sent many months earlier. Champollion attributed their delay to Drovetti's ill will. They arrived at Abu Simbel on November 26, the site had been visited by Bankes and Belzoni in 1815 and 1817 respectively, but the sand that they had cleared from the entrance had now returned. On January 1, 1829, they reached Wadi Halfa and returned north. That day, Champollion composed a letter to M. Dacier stating that [...] "I am proud now, having followed the course of the Nile from its mouth to the second cataract, {{to have the right to}} announce to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> nothing to modify in our [...] "Letter on the Alphabet of the Hieroglyphs." [...] Our Alphabet is good." ...|$|E
60|$|I told <b>you</b> before <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a twofold faith, and now I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two sorts of good works; {{and a man}} may be shrewdly guessed at with {{reference}} to his faith, even by the works that he chooseth to be conversant in.|$|R

2500|$|The {{statement}} from the Chief of Naval Staff at that time indicated that the final deal could be in excess of US$2 billion. When asked about CAG's finding that the navy had not done its risk analysis before going in for the ship, he was quoted as saying, [...] "I can ensure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no such thing. There is no question, we {{have been looking at}} the ship since the late 90s." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, {{first used}} the term in its {{diplomatic}} context, in a letter sent on 13 February 1814: [...] "It affords me great satisfaction to acquaint <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> every prospect of the Congress terminating with a general accord and Guarantee between the Great powers of Europe, with a determination to support the arrangement agreed upon, and to turn the general influence and if necessary the general arms against the Power that shall first attempt to disturb the Continental peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nolan’s gesture was imprecise, {{and pointed}} {{not to the}} redoubts and the {{captured}} British guns but, it seemed — at least to Lucan and his staff officers present — to the Russian battery guarding Ryzhov's cavalry {{at the end of}} the valley. Seeing Lucan's confusion, Nolan could have explained what Raglan intended, perhaps making the link – if he himself knew of the connection — between the third and fourth order; however, taken aback by Nolan's insolence, Lucan refused further discussion, and rode over to Cardigan standing in front of his brigade. Both cavalry commanders knew the dangers of attacking down the valley. When Cardigan learned what was expected of his brigade, he questioned the sanity of the order as conveyed to him by Lucan: [...] "… allow me to point out to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a battery in front, battery on each flank, and the ground is covered with Russian riflemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean to tell}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{places where}} <b>you</b> could put your fingers through her seams. It's only the pumpin' that keeps her afloat." ...|$|R
50|$|Decision Maker: No, {{this is very}} {{silly and}} counterproductive. I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> people involved, and I {{do not want to}} play with their feelings.|$|R
60|$|But {{to come to}} {{that which}} remains; I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two things <b>that</b> did make unfeigned {{confession}} hard. The first I have touched upon.|$|R
2500|$|Some initial {{military}} reactions {{seemed to}} dismiss the news {{as if it were}} of little importance, with one spokesperson comparing the verses to the presence of the phrase [...] "In God we Trust" [...] on United States currency. However General David Petraeus left no doubt that senior commanders, once apprised of the situation, considered the situation to be extremely serious. Delivering what news reports called a [...] "stinging criticism of the contractor," [...] Petraeus said that [...] "It is disturbing. This is a serious concern to me and to the other commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan because it indeed conveys a perception that is absolutely contrary to what we have sought to do." [...] Petraeus added that [...] "There’s a reason that we put people through cultural awareness training....I can assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> much greater sensitivity among our troops about this sort of thing than apparently there is from the contractor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ride {{starts with}} an indoor section, where riders pass Jigsaw's {{equipment}} and Billy on his tricycle, who laughs {{as the train}} passes by. If {{you are on the}} second dispatched car (two cars are dispatched one after the other, seemingly plunging them directly into a pit of strobe-lit spikes which are narrowly avoided), the vehicle will stop while Billy gives a speech, informing <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no escape, and proclaiming, [...] "Here's what happens when you lose", before allowing the train to pass – this regulates the distance between cars. Riders then approach two dimly-lit swinging blades which appear to get closer, before a hidden drop that is nearly vertical moves riders out of the way. Air blasts at riders imitating the firing of syringes from loaded crossbows, which appear to miss over riders' heads. The train then enters a heartline roll, as riders can see Jigsaw in a pool of blood. Water is sprayed at the train during the roll to imitate blood, and a loud scream can be heard at the same time. The train exits the warehouse and travels towards the [...] vertical lift hill.|$|E
2500|$|When Brodie Innes sent on {{a sermon}} by E. B. Pusey, Darwin responded {{that he could}} [...] "hardly see how {{religion}} & science can be kept as distinct as he desires, as geology has to treat {{of the history of}} the Earth & Biology that of man.— But I most wholly agree with <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no reason why the disciples of either school should attack each other with bitterness, though each upholding strictly their beliefs. You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me & I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy." [...] In response to an enquiry about the same sermon from the botanist Henry Nicholas Ridley, Darwin stated that [...] "Dr Pusey was mistaken in imagining that I wrote the Origin with any relation whatever to Theology", and added that [...] "many years ago when I was collecting facts for the Origin, my belief in what is called a personal God was as firm as that of Dr Pusey himself, & as to the eternity of matter I have never troubled myself about such insoluble questions.— Dr Pusey's attack will be as powerless to retard by a day the belief in evolution as were the virulent attacks made by divines fifty years ago against Geology, & the still older ones of the Catholic church against Galileo". Brodie Innes deplored [...] "unwise and violent" [...] theological attacks on his old friend, for while they had disagreements, [...] "How nicely things would go if other folk were like Darwin and Brodie Innes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} change it for yours," [...] I answered. [...] "It is evidently {{insufficient}} to warn <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> times when preaching becomes an impertinence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Doesn't it strike <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{at least}} two very strong points against that theory?" [...] he asked, making two {{gigantic}} knots in his piece of string.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Did I {{not tell}} <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no luck in Sunday fishing?' said Matte sulkily; {{and his wife}} was so frightened that she never even once thought of Ahti's cows.|$|R
6000|$|CHR. But did you think, when {{at first}} he {{suggested}} it to <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> such {{a man to be}} found, of whom it might justly be said, that He never committed sin? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it was treble that {{distance}} last night," [...] Norbanus said in surprise. [...] "Think <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> really danger of its coming this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Tompkins, the bosun's mate, [...] "I {{think it}} {{my duty to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a great deal of}} dissatisfaction among the men." ...|$|E
6000|$|Anthea Merril smiled. [...] "Is that all? It has not {{occurred}} to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> perhaps, {{a reason why}} he and Nellie Austerly understand each other?" ...|$|E
60|$|DAN. So like <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{times when}} I almost wish I {{had never met}} you. You set me {{thinking}} about myself, {{and that is a}} subject I find it pleasanter to forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then, that is {{one point}} I wish to make, you know. Ours is an old family, I would like to remind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> Marshmoretons in Belpher before the War of the Roses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you be}} so absurd?" [...] {{cried the}} queen. [...] "How often must I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no fairies? And even if there were--but, no matter; pray let us drop the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I didn't {{come here}} only to tell <b>you</b> <b>that.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> money {{coming to you}} through him--enough to make you {{comfortable}} {{for the rest of}} your life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have had}} enough bobance and boasting," [...] said Hordle John, rising and {{throwing}} off his doublet. [...] "I will show <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> better men left in England than ever went thieving to France." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it is Frances," [...] she said, bending {{her head}} graciously that Frances might kiss her still rosy cheek. [...] "I {{expected}} {{it would be}} Cecilia.
