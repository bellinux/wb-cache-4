500|$|A Select {{journalist}} enthused {{about the}} {{track in the}} context of the duo's wider catalogue: [...] "As soon as it starts <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> remember the excitement that comes from hearing a KLF record for the first time. The original ambient house melody kicks in – and it hasn't dated a day. The chorus is given an extra kick by Acid Brass' massed ranks of horns and trumpets.... It is quite brilliant." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelmingly}} negative reviews, a few reviewers {{had positive}} {{things to say}} about the song and video. Entertainment Weekly writer Joseph Lynch noted that there was [...] "something sickeningly catchy about this tune that keeps you coming back for more." [...] Rolling Stones Perpetua stated, [...] "When you see this video, <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> notice everything that it does 'wrong', but it actually gets {{a lot of things about}} pop music right, if just by accident." [...] OK! Magazine also noted that [...] "some are calling the 13-year-old signed singer the next Justin Bieber." [...] After watching the video, singer Chris Brown said: [...] "Honest opinion? It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. People are so upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 26, 2007 {{a letter}} to Solicitor General Paul Clement, Senators Charles Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, Russ Feingold and Sheldon Whitehouse urged that an {{independent}} counsel be appointed to investigate whether Gonzales had perjured himself in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous day. [...] "We ask that <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> appoint an independent special counsel from outside the Department of Justice to determine whether Attorney General Gonzales may have misled Congress or perjured himself in testimony before Congress," [...] the letter read in part. According to the July 10, 2009 DOJ Inspector General Unclassified Report on the President's Surveillance Program, Gonzales {{did not intend to}} mislead Congress. [...] There was no finding of perjury or other criminal wrongdoing by Gonzales ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{pamphlet}} in English titled JAPAN HAS SURRENDERED {{was dropped}} over the camp by three Beaufighters on 16 August. From 19–23 August, leaflets were dropped by aircraft all over known {{areas in which}} the Japanese were concentrated, giving general war news and news of {{the progress of the}} surrender. On August 19 or 20, more leaflets were dropped on the camp. Signed by Major-General George Wootten, General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated [...] "I know that you will realise that on account of your location, {{it will be difficult to}} get aid to <b>you</b> <b>immediately,</b> but you can rest assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for you as soon as possible".|$|E
2500|$|The {{steamship}} tickets he {{had bought}} that morning for the return to Europe with Caresse were in his pocket. The coroner also found in his pocket a cable from Josephine addressed to Crosby on the Mauretania before they arrived in New York: [...] "CABLE GEORGE WHEN YOU ARRIVE AND WHERE I CAN TELEPHONE <b>YOU</b> <b>IMMEDIATELY.</b> I AM IMPATIENT." [...] A second cable from another girl simply said, [...] "YES." [...] A picture of Zora, the 13-year-old girl {{he had sex with}} in Egypt, was reportedly found in his wallet. The coroner reported that Crosby's toenails were painted red, and that he had a Christian cross tattooed on the sole of one foot and a pagan icon representing the sun on the other. The coroner concluded that Josephine had died at least two hours before Crosby. There was no suicide note, and newspapers ran sensational articles for days about the murder or suicide pact—they could not decide which.|$|E
2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> think they're dead and you start to worry. If they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon after VE {{day there}} came a dispute with Britain over French {{mandates}} Syria and Lebanon known as the Levant which quickly developed into a major diplomatic incident. In May, de Gaulle sent more French troops to re-establish their presence provoking an outbreak of nationalism. On 20 May, French troops opened fire on demonstrators in Damascus with artillery and dropped bombs from the air. Finally, on 31 May, with the death toll exceeding a thousand Syrians, Churchill decided to act and sent de Gaulle an ultimatum saying, [...] "In order to avoid a collision between British and French forces, we request <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks". This was ignored by both de Gaulle and the French forces and thus Churchill ordered British troops and armoured cars under General Bernard Paget to invade Syria from nearby Transjordan. The invasion went ahead and the British swiftly moved in cutting the French General Fernand Oliva-Roget's telephone line with his base at Beirut. Eventually, heavily outnumbered, Oliva-Roget ordered his men back to their bases near the coast who were then escorted by the British. A furious row then broke out between Britain and France.|$|E
2500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{found that}} Ms. Kelly [...] "sounds like an album where Rowland is mostly sorting through some deeply {{personal}} relationship issues {{with a couple}} relatively lighthearted songs thrown in for variety." [...] He noted that [...] "all-around, the album does provide a stronger set of songs than 2002's Simply Deep. The material tends {{to be kind of}} insidious, rather than hitting <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> or going through one ear and out the other." [...] Giving the album three stars out of five, he also remarked that [...] "the lyrics [...] are direct and specific, going beyond basic breakup material." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani stated that, [...] "this time around, both the production and lyrics are stronger." [...] He praised the [...] "bona fide club jams" [...] on the album. Billboard wrote that while [...] "Rowland may never upstage her superstar groupmate Beyonce, but she certainly has the vocal chops and charm to stand on her own stiletto-clad feet. Compared with her gospel-fueled 2002 solo debut, Rowland appears confident and dominant on foot-stompers [...] though still short of career-defining, Ms. Kelly finds its author opening up more while welcoming the possibility that destiny may just find another star.|$|E
2500|$|Theodore of Mopsuestia paraphrases: [...] "In {{addition}} to all which I have said, I give you this last commandment, to remember My law, which I gave to all Israel through Moses, plainly declaring {{what they ought to}} do in each thing, and as the first token of obedience, to receive the Lord Christ when He cometh, appearing for the salvation of all men: Who will end the law, but show His own perfection. It had been well, had <b>you</b> <b>immediately</b> believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to the}} law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent to you before the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E
