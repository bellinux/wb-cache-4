500|$|As {{the last}} song created for Revival, Gomez has called [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] a {{personal}} favorite from the record. When asked about collaborating with Gomez, Michaels commented: [...] "I think Selena {{is a lot}} like Justin and I, in the way that…when you find something that you feel connected to, and it's real and it's honest, you don't let it go. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> it can lead you." [...] A snippet of the track was first teased along with the official artwork on September 26, 2015. Later, the song was fully released as the album's first and only promotional single, a week before album release, followed by the album's two singles, [...] "Good for You" [...] and [...] "Same Old Love".|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 2008, LenDale White and Keith Bulluck of the Tennessee Titans {{stepped on}} a Terrible Towel after the Titans's 31–14 victory. Pittsburgh's Larry Foote responded, [...] "They {{deserved}} to do that, they whooped us, they deserve to celebrate and, hopefully, we'll see them again." [...] While Hines Ward said, [...] " [...] did kind {{of the same thing}} and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> they went." [...] Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher, by this point working for CBS as an analyst on The NFL Today, mentioned on the program that such antics can come back to haunt teams. Tennessee was the top seed in the playoffs, however following the incident the Titans proceeded to lose eight consecutive games, including an '08 divisional playoff game and their '09 Week 1 game against the Steelers, 13-10. After the Titans' 8th consecutive loss—a 59-0 blowout to the New England Patriots, the Titans worst loss ever—Titans coach Jeff Fisher expressed regret for his team's behavior towards the Towel, and a number of Titans players autographed a Terrible Towel and mailed it to Allegheny Valley School – the Pittsburgh charity that now owns the trademark. The Titans won their next 5 games.|$|E
2500|$|As a child, {{he loved}} {{television}} and {{was fascinated by}} his parents' 8 mm film home movie camera. Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>where</b> you come from? You can't be a movie director.' I guess maybe some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too." ...|$|E
