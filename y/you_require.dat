2500|$|Rav Huna deduced from Judah's {{commitment}} to Jacob {{with regard to}} Benjamin in [...] "I will be surety for him; of my hand shall <b>you</b> <b>require</b> him," [...] that a guarantor becomes responsible for the debt that he has guaranteed. Rav Hisda, however, demurred, saying that Judah assumed an unconditional obligation to return Benjamin, for in [...] Reuben promised, [...] "Deliver him into my hand, and I will {{bring him back to}} you," [...] and Judah surely promised no less than Reuben.|$|E
2500|$|So {{important}} was the support of Prince Feisal's Sherifial Hedjaz Arab force to the defence of the EEF's right flank, that they were substantially subsidised by the War Office. After a delay in receipt of a payment, the High Commissioner in Egypt Reginald Wingate wrote to Allenby on 5 July 1918, [...] "I think we shall manage the subsidy required {{as well as the}} extra £50,000 <b>you</b> <b>require</b> for Northern Operations." [...] At the time £400,000 was on its way from Australia, while Wingate was asking the War Office for an additional £500,000, emphasising the importance of the regular [...] "payment of our Arab subsidy." ...|$|E
2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If you repeat conventional thoughts, <b>you</b> <b>require</b> zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
