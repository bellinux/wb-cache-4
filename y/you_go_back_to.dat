500|$|The novel skims {{over the}} brutal attacks, lasting a week, on blacks in Detroit during World WarII. Years later, in 1967, Lefty is {{incorrectly}} told that that year's Detroit riots were started {{by a black}} man raping a white woman; this falsehood is never rectified. However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service {{to a number of}} white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, [...] "hy don't <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> your own country?", returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him.|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, Australian {{recording}} artist Sia confirmed {{that she would}} work on several ballads for Aguilera's then-upcoming album. Aguilera commented about the collaboration, [...] "I'm definitely a fan of Sia's. I was thrilled she also wanted to work together and, in turn, was a fan of mine". In an interview for Billboard, Sia said, [...] "She [...] was just excited {{to get to work}} with the artists she loves. There's this misconception that she's a middle-America kind of person. But she's a little hipster. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her house and sit by the fire with some wine, and what's playing over the sound system? The Knife and Arthur Russell. She doesn't listen to pop music".|$|E
500|$|In July 2006, The Observer Music Monthly interviewed Timberlake {{and stated}} that the track [...] "is arguably the album's 'Cry Me a River'." [...] In response, Timberlake said, [...] "It is similar. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Aaliyah's biggest record, 'Are You That Somebody' – it's similar to that too because it's that percussive ballad." [...] When asked about the lyrics, [...] "There's just one thing I need from you: say I do", being autobiographical, he said no, adding that the line before that, [...] "this ring here {{represents}} my heart", is about marriage and love. Timberlake stated, [...] "It's not specifically about marriage, but about a humble approach to love. None of it is autobiographical, though obviously I have experience to draw from." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Disney {{began to}} {{negotiate}} with Joseph Kosinski to direct Tron: Legacy. Kosinski admitted that at the time, he was not keen on the idea but it later grew on him as time progressed. Kosinski {{was involved in a}} meeting with Bailey, president of Walt Disney Pictures. [...] "Disney owns the property, Tron," [...] Bailey stated. [...] "Do you know it? Are you interested? What would your take be? In a post-Matrix world, how do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the world of Tron?" [...] Kosinski wanted to embrace the general ambiance of the film, and wished to not use the internet as a model or use a formula emulative of The Matrix film series. As neither individuals were in equal agreement on choosing a perspective to conceive the film, Kosinski asked Bailey to lend him money {{in order to create a}} conceptual prototype of the Tron: Legacy universe, which was eventually presented at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International. [...] "So, we went into Disney," [...] he recalled, [...] "and I told them, 'We can talk about this all day, but in order to really get on the same page, I need to show you what this world looks and feels like. Give me some money and let me do a small test that will give you a hint for a couple minutes of it, and see what you think.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It {{had nothing to do with}} my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
