500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] is a doo-wop song, and lyrically {{comprises}} a list {{of factors}} Trainor's love interests {{should be aware of}} before proposing to her. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dubbed the song [...] "a YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy," [...] and opined, [...] " [...] imagines marriage as contract between equals who work and don't cook". The melody in [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was likened to American singer Dion's [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] (1961), and sonically the song comprises a series of slick production slap-beats, a rock-inspired drum track, zippy piano and ebullient brass instrumentation. The EP's final track, [...] "Close Your Eyes" [...] is a modern slow dance ballad about ignoring negativity and loving <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> your own terms. Backed by an acoustic guitar, Trainor solicits a nuanced, soulful, fluttery vocal performance afront pitch-shifted background vocals on the track.|$|E
500|$|... "Me & the Rhythm" [...] is a dance, disco, R and synthpop song, {{while its}} {{production}} contains steel drums, deep house beats, [...] "pulsating" [...] percussion and [...] "smoky" [...] synths throughout its instrumentation. Lyrically the song addresses {{the concepts of}} losing <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> the dance floor and being free in the moment. [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] was well received by contemporary music critics, with praise directed towards its vintage disco sound and Gomez's sultry vocals. The promote the song, the singer appeared on The Today Show to perform a set which included a medley of [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] with [...] "Come & Get It". The song was performed during Gomez Today concert, she performed it on a medley with previous hit [...] "Come & Get It". The track was included on the setlist for Gomez's 2016 Revival Tour.|$|E
500|$|... "Swingin Party" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Westerberg and {{produced}} by Tommy Ramone, and was recorded by The Replacements. It is an indie rock and rock and roll ballad with influences from jazz, country and new wave. It features staccato chords instrumented by electric guitar. According to Bill Janovitz from AllMusic, the song climbs scales in a way reminiscent of [...] "Somethin' Stupid" [...] by Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (1967). The lyrics are introspective, and portray the protagonist's [...] "feigned nonchalance". Writing for Spin, editor J.D. opined that the song's theme is [...] "literary reflections" [...] as Westerberg sings, [...] "Quttin' school and goin' to work and never goin' fishin'". According to Tim Holmes of Rolling Stone, the song's theme is that [...] "life is a lilting series of ultimately empty, but nonetheless compulsory, soirees", while Robert Hilburn from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the song is [...] "about loneliness and youthful insecurity". In an interview for the Los Angeles Times, Westerberg said: [...] "One {{of the reasons we}} used to drink so much is that it was scary going up on stage. That's one of the things 'Swingin' Party' is all about on the album ... how it is a little frightening to put <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> display all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture {{can be summed up in}} the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> the screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E
500|$|Marco Pérez (who plays Andrade in the film) {{referred}} to Espinosa's performance as [...] "a fascinating freshness", praising her musical {{training for the}} role and her attention to detail, further detailing that [...] "it {{would have been easy}} to create a sensationalized, one-dimensional portrait of Gloria, but Sofía goes behind the public persona {{to the heart of the}} woman". The film premiered in Mexico on January 1, 2015, as it was distributed by Universal Pictures with about 1,000 copies. Espinosa and Pérez received positive reviews for their performances from Jessica Oliva of Cine Premiere magazine, who stated that the actors [...] "seem to blend in with their characters. Sofía Espinosa stands out with her voice (singing all the songs), and her physical interpretation and charisma, while Marco Pérez, Sergio Andrade, manages to embody the duality of that genius of the industry, perverse and visionary at the same time". Sofía Ochoa Rodríguez and Verónica Sánchez of En Filme were [...] "surprised by [...] performance" [...] as it was [...] "very close to Gloria Trevi's, albeit with a nasally accent, and cadence which lets through the hoarse, sarcastic and melancholic style that permeates on every one of the songs the actress sings. Her acting work and physical resemblance let her move naturally from comedy to pain, loneliness to longing, to the easy smile, to the dance, to the jumps on stage and the twinkle in her eyes". In contrast, David Noh of Film Journal International was not impressed by Espinosa's acting, saying that she [...] "lacks appeal and is quite ordinary in a role that calls for some of the electricity the very young Jennifer Lopez managed to ratchet up in her musical biopic, Selena". Gloria Trevi praised the work of Espinosa in the film, stating that [...] "it is shocking to see <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> film, the girl [...] did an extraordinary job". Espinosa won the Diosa de Plata and the Ariel Award for Best Actress for Gloria.|$|E

[...] Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer, who commented that although the show had lots of [...] "cool effects," [...] it [...] "lands, splat, {{in a pile of}} nonsense and dim dialogue." [...] In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying, [...] "you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you could repeatedly hit <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> the head with a brick.
