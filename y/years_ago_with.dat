5|$|The Inuit of the Thule culture—whose {{descendants}} {{form the}} majority of the current population—arrived nearly a thousand <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century. The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with walruses, reindeer, and particularly the fur seals constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{and evolution of}} the Solar System began 4.6billion <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> the gravitational collapse of {{a small part of}} a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.|$|E
5|$|Tehama started life some 600,000 years ago. At {{its peak}} activity, it reached {{approximately}} 3,350meters (11,000ft) high, with a basal diameter of approximately 12kilometers. Volcanic activity then declined 400,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> other volcanic lava domes forming {{at the edges}} of Mount Tehama later on, the largest and best known of which is Lassen Peak. A combination of continued hydrothermal activity and erosion, particularly by glaciers during ice ages, removed the central cone of the volcano, leaving a large caldera, the northern edge of which can still be seen.|$|E

5|$|The cervix was {{documented}} in anatomical literature {{in at least}} the time of Hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> descriptions provided by both Hippocrates and Aretaeus. However, there was some variation in word sense among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice.

5|$|The {{red panda}} is {{considered}} a living fossil and only distantly related to the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally {{more closely related to}} {{the other members of the}} superfamily Musteloidea to which it belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas (which also was an ancestor for all living bears; pinnipeds like seals and walruses; and members of the family Musteloidea like weasels and otters) can be traced back to the Early Tertiary period tens of millions of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> a wide distribution across Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the NCVP can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 20 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> the {{emplacement}} of alkali basalt in western Yukon. Several types of volcanic eruptions have since created different landforms across the NCVP, including shield volcanoes, lava domes, stratovolcanoes and cinder cones. Other volcanic formations, notably subglacial volcanoes, take their shape from the environment they formed in regardless of what magma type they produced. The NCVP contains over 100 volcanoes and is the most volcanically active area in Canada, with eruptions expected to occur roughly every 100 years.|$|E

5|$|George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was {{the first}} to {{classify}} the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species, although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid from a broad hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, or smaller and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within it. A molecular study published in 2008 focussing on the Cape York population found it was genetically closer to the eastern forest subspecies than to the Top End form. These birds became segregated around 0.27 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>with</b> some gene flow still with eastern birds.|$|E
5|$|Several archaeological digs have {{revealed}} that the site was occupied during the Upper Palaeolithic. There is evidence of an open settlement of the Creswellian culture on the hill {{in the middle of}} the headland dating to around 14,100 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>With</b> over 13,000 lithic artefacts it is probably the largest site of the period. Most interesting were several blades typically found at Upper Paleolithic sites across Europe, but rarely seen outside of caves in the UK, where open air sites of this age are extremely rare. People at the Head were heavily involved with the production of blades, further excavations identified 649 tools, dominated by backed blades, endscrapers and burins.|$|E
5|$|The lion's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} species of the genus Panthera: the tiger, the snow leopard, the jaguar, and the leopard. Studies from 2006 and 2009 concluded that the jaguar is a sister species to the lion and the leopard is a sister taxon to the jaguar/lion clade while 2010 and 2011 studies have swapped the positions leopard and jaguar. P. leo evolved in Africa between 1 million and 800,000 years ago, before spreading throughout the Holarctic region. It appeared in the fossil record in Europe {{for the first time}} 700,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> the subspecies Panthera leo fossilis at Isernia in Italy. From this lion derived the later cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), which appeared about 300,000 years ago. Lions died out in northern Eurasia {{at the end of the}} last glaciation, about 10,000 years ago; this may have been secondary to the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna.|$|E

5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> the eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might {{have occurred in the}} last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
5|$|Magmatism in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> the {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range shield volcano 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million years ago to construct the Ilgachuz Range shield volcano, which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years ago {{led to the creation of}} the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. The Itcha Range continued to be an area of Anahim hotspot volcanism well into the Quaternary period (2.58million years ago to present).|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in {{separate}} occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>with</b> affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks {{to the efforts of}} Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.|$|E
