500|$|The quest {{gameplay}} was less-well received, with Sliva {{saying it}} made him [...] "feel like [...] was stuck in the opening hours of an MMO", while Juba called the tasks [...] "dull". Parkin stated that the quests [...] "can seem trivial under {{the eye of the}} apocalyptic clock". VanOrd commented that while many quests were [...] "absorbing on their own", he admired their ability to get the player out into the world. Destructoid's Dale North felt that the time limit made the quests [...] "a waste of the precious time left". The time limit itself received mixed reviews. Sliva said the time limit gave the game [...] "a sense of urgency... that I really enjoy.", while VanOrd said the limit worked against the player and [...] "collides with almost every other aspect of the game." [...] Juba enjoyed planning out his days, but on the other had felt that the time limit prevented exploration, and that it [...] "severely [...] <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> fully dive into some of the systems." [...] Elliot said the limit overly pressured him, and became unpleasant when coupled with the time penalty for fleeing battle. The Famitsu reviewers said that the time limit was not an overly stressful factor.|$|E

2500|$|Sensation is the fiction-writing mode for portraying a character's {{perception}} of the senses. [...] According to Ron Rozelle, [...] "...the success of your story or novel will depend on many things, but the most crucial is <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> bring your reader into it. [...] And that reader will be most completely in when you deliver the actual sensations of the many things that comprise your story" [...] As stated by [...] Jessica Page Morrell, [...] "You breathe life into fiction by translating the senses onto the page, producing stories rooted {{in the physical world}} ... that creates a tapestry, a galaxy of interwoven sensory ingredients." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{researchers}} believe the hippocampus is only involved in episodic memory and spatial cognition. This then {{raises the question}} where semantic memory may be located. Some believe semantic memory lives in temporal neocortex. Others believe that semantic knowledge is widely distributed across all brain areas. To illustrate this latter view, consider your knowledge of dogs. Researchers holding the 'distributed semantic knowledge' view believe that your knowledge of the sound a dog makes exists in your auditory cortex, whilst <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> recognize and imagine the visual features of a dog resides in your visual cortex. Recent evidence supports {{the idea that the}} temporal pole bilaterally is the convergence zone for unimodal semantic representations into a multimodal representation. [...] These regions are particularly vulnerable to damage in semantic dementia, which is characterised by a global semantic deficit.|$|E

2500|$|Two more {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} April 2012. The first involved Ellerbe's demotion of Battalion Chief Richard Sterne {{to the rank}} of captain on April 8. Two firefighters and a lieutenant in a station in Northeast D.C. had accepted a case of beer from a grateful local resident. Ellerbe requested the men be suspended. Sterne discovered that the men had rejected the gift, but the resident left it behind anyway. When Sterne reprimanded the two firefighters rather than suspended them, Ellerbe issued the demotion and cited the disciplinary hearing as the reason. [...] "Your failure to hold the members accountable for their receipt of the beer in violation of the Rules of Conduct brings into question <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> exercise proper judgment in the performance of your assigned duties," [...] he wrote. Sterne filed an appeal with the D.C. Office of Employee Appeals. The second incident involved the transfer of Battalion Chief Kevin Sloan. Sloan ruled that the lieutenant in the case was not guilty, as he was not present when the gift was delivered. Ellerbe subsequently transferred Sloan from active duty to a desk job in April 2012, although he gave no reason for the transfer. Sloan called the action retaliatory and said Ellerbe engaged in [...] "workplace bullying". Sloan, too, filed an appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) {{supported}} the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement. Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that learning is done {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence <b>your</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale. His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning: ...|$|E
