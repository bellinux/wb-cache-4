5000|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2013 {{found that a}} majority of parents used the lie-to-children teaching methodology with the two most common reasons presented for lying to their children given as: an attempt to decrease poor behavior patterns by the children, or due to a concern for the emotional status of children.
