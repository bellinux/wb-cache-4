2500|$|Since the semi-autobiographical The 400 Blows (1959), it {{has been}} noted that Truffaut often portrayed {{personal}} experiences and emotions throughout his films. Via such expressionistic use of the medium, he proclaimed himself as a film auteur, within a theory of film as art which he personally advocated as a director and a critic. As a result, Truffaut's films often appeared to focus on certain themes and stylisations, such as the vitality of youth and childhood, particularly embodied by the character of Antoine Doinel, who is a recurring presence across {{a number of his}} films. The Green Room however was made towards the end of Truffaut's career, and thematically the film contrasts to his earlier works. The Green Room appears to reminisce on childhood, whilst focusing more on the final stages of life, as Truffaut expresses his views of death and remembrance of the dead. This theme for a film had [...] "preoccupied him for several years and had been accentuated by the deaths of numerous friends and colleagues", such as those who previously worked alongside him on Shoot the Piano Player. Nonetheless, the alternative theme of the film again reflects Truffaut's sense of personal expressionism throughout his career. When asked [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contradiction between the cult of death and the love of the life?" [...] Truffaut replied [...] "it's the theme of the film." [...] Gillain wrote that that the film [...] "points to cinema as a celebration of memory." [...] Yet, also thematic throughout The Green Room is a familiar [...] "estrangement from human contact and romantic obsession", which has been prominent in [...] "most of the films that Truffaut has made over a period of twenty years." ...|$|E

'Come! as you're ambitious, {{and are a}} very neat draughtsman, you shall--ha ha!--you shall try your hand on these {{proposals}} for a grammar-school; regulating your plan, of course, by the printed particulars. Upon my word, now,' said Mr Pecksniff, merrily, 'I shall be very curious to see what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammar-school. Who knows but a young man of your taste might hit upon something, impracticable and unlikely in itself, but which I could put into shape? For it really is, my dear Martin, it really is in the finishing touches alone, that great experience and long study in these matters tell. Ha, ha, ha! Now it really will be,' continued Mr Pecksniff, clapping his young friend on the back in his droll humour, 'an amusement to me, to see what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grammar-school.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Carl, I've {{never played}} as much with any one as with <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>make</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men I know seem very unenterprising. It frightens me. Perhaps I oughtn't {{to let you}} jump the fence so easily." ...|$|R

Come hither, lad," [...] he continued, {{addressing}} {{a man who was}} executing some delicate job in seamanship on the poop, at no great distance from the spot where the groupe of officers had placed themselves; [...] "come hither: Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sail in the south-western board." ...|$|E

6000|$|He rose, and {{crossing}} the room, stood close beside her chair.
