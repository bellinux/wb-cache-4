500|$|... "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is a hip hop and rave song, with a {{duration}} of three minutes and forty-two seconds. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song's composition is a [...] "chaotic dense spray of boasts over a muscular, scraping beat". Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy labeled the song as [...] "noisy, trap-tastic twerker" [...] that is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2012 single [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and according to him, contains blazin' beats, brags aplenty, nasty unapologetic attitude. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is an aggregation off [...] "distorted" [...] synthesisers derived from Joey Beltram's 1990 record [...] "Mentasm" [...] "until it sounds weird and disorientating". The Boston Globes James Reed labeled [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] as a club banger containing a heavy bass [...] "that rumbles more in your chest instead of rattling your feet." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on the song [...] "Rihanna sprays declamations like machine gun fire over what could pass for a lost early ’90s Prodigy rave anthem." [...] The lyrical content of [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] revolves around Rihanna explaining how if any of her crew does not respect her, then she should no longer remain with her, singing: [...] "How could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> hood, but you're so fuckin' pop?/ How could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> fun and sound like you're selling rocks?". On the song, Rihanna sounds [...] "indignant" [...] and [...] "impressed" [...] with being herself and proclaims: [...] "Walk up in this bitch like I own the ho".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written by Stan herself, Șerban Cazan, LeAnna James, and Naz Tokio; the {{production}} was made by Cazan. It was composed during FonoCamp 2013, the first international songwriting camp in Romania which was organized by both Fonogram and HaHaHa Studios and held in Azuga. Fellow Romanian and international singers were also present at the two-weeks event, such as Delia Matache, Mohombi, Smiley and Deepcentral. The track was mixed for HaHaHa Production and recorded at Fonogram Studios and HaHaHa Studios. In an interview in Barcelona, Spain, Stan described the song as [...] "more oriental, {{with a lot of}} spiritual meaning". She continued to explain that [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] was written as a present for her Arabic and Asian fans due to the song's vibe. According to Pop Shock, the track is a Caucasian-flavoured mid-tempo ballad. Lyrically, Stan tells her unidentified boyfriend not to be so hard on her, and if he really loves her, he needs to give her his everything. The chorus of [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] consists solely of the phrase [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> hard on me / If you love me, come and give me your everything".|$|E

500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... How could <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E

2500|$|In uncharacteristically bold discussions {{after dinner}} Darwin asked his guests [...] "Why {{do you call}} yourselves Atheists?" [...] When they responded that they [...] "did not commit the folly of god-denial, [...] avoided with equal care the folly of god-assertion", Darwin gave a {{thoughtful}} response, concluding that [...] "I am with you in thought, but I should prefer the word Agnostic to the word Atheist." [...] Aveling replied that, [...] "after all, 'Agnostic' was but 'Atheist' writ respectable, and 'Atheist' was only 'Agnostic' writ aggressive." [...] Darwin smiled and responded [...] "Why should <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>so</b> aggressive? Is anything gained by trying to force these new ideas upon the mass of mankind? It is all very well for educated, cultured, thoughtful people; but are the masses yet ripe for it?" [...] Aveling and Büchner questioned {{what would have happened}} if Darwin had been given that advice before publication of the Origin, and had confined [...] "the revolutionary truths of Natural and Sexual Selection to the judicious few", where would the world be? Many feared danger if new ideas were [...] "proclaimed abroad on the house-tops, and discussed in market-place and home. But he, happily for humanity, had by the gentle, irresistible power of reason, forced his new ideas upon the mass of the people. And the masses had been found ripe for it. Had he kept silence, the tremendous strides taken by human thought during the last twenty-one years would have been shorn of their fair proportions, perhaps had hardly been made at all. His own illustrious example was encouragement, was for a command to every thinker to make known to all his fellows that which he believed to be the truth." ...|$|E
