5|$|RKO, and {{the movie}} {{industry}} as a whole, had its most profitable year ever in 1946. A Goldwyn production released by RKO, The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives, was the most successful Hollywood film of the decade. But {{the legal status of}} the industry's reigning business model was increasingly being called into doubt: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bigelow v. RKO that the company was liable for damages under antitrust statutes for having denied an independent movie house access to first run films—a common practice among all of the Big Five. With profits at a high point, Floyd Odlum cashed in by selling off about 40% of his shares in the company to a group of investment firms. After Koerner's death, Radio-Keith-Orpheum president N. Peter Rathvon and RKO Radio Pictures president Ned Depinet had exchanged positions, with Depinet moving to the corporate offices in New York and Rathvon relocating to Hollywood and doubling as production chief while a permanent replacement was sought for Koerner. On the first day of 1947, producer and Oscar-winning screenwriter Dore Schary, who had been working at the studio on loan from Selznick, took over the role.|$|E
5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All Quiet on the Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E

25|$|The film, {{which went}} into general release on January 7, 1947, placed 26th ($3.3 million) in box office {{revenues}} for 1947 (out {{of more than}} 400 features released), one place ahead of another Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street. The film {{was supposed to be}} released in January 1947, but was moved up to December 1946 to make it eligible for the 1946 Academy Awards. This move was seen as worse for the film, as 1947 did not have quite the stiff competition as 1946. If it had entered the 1947 Awards, its biggest competition would have been Miracle on 34th Street. The number one grossing movie of 1947, The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives, made $11.5 million.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Loy all but abandoned her acting career {{to focus on the}} war effort and work closely with the Red Cross. She was so fiercely outspoken against Adolf Hitler that her name appeared on his blacklist. She helped run a Naval Auxiliary canteen and toured frequently to raise funds. She returned to films with The Thin Man Goes Home (1945). In 1946, she played the wife of returning serviceman Fredric March in The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives (1946). Loy was paired with Cary Grant in David O. Selznick's The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947). The film co-starred a teenaged Shirley Temple. Following its success, she appeared again with Grant in Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), and with Clifton Webb in Cheaper by the Dozen (1950). Throughout her career, she championed the rights of black actors and characters to be depicted with dignity on film.|$|E

25|$|Dionysius {{copied the}} last decennovenal {{cycle of the}} Cyrillian table ending with Diocletian 247, and then added a new 95-year table with {{numbered}} Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi (<b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Lord Jesus Christ) because, as he explained to Petronius, he {{did not wish to}} continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians. The only reason he gave for beginning his new 95-year table with the year 532 was that six years were still left in the Cyrillian table after the year during which he wrote. For the current year he only stated that it was 525 years after the Incarnation of Christ, without stating when this event occurred in any other calendar. He did not realise that the dates of the Alexandrian Easter repeated after 532 years, despite his apparent knowledge of the Victorian 532-year 'cycle', indicating only that Easter did not repeat after 95 years. He knew that Victorian Easters did not agree with Alexandrian Easters, thus he no doubt assumed that they had no bearing on any Alexandrian cycle. Furthermore, he obviously did not realise that simply multiplying 19 by 4 by 7 (decennovenal cycle × cycle of leap years × days in a week) fixed the Alexandrian cycle at 532 years, otherwise he would have stated such a simple fact.|$|E
500|$|Critics and {{directors}} who have {{placed it on}} their Sight & Sound lists include Richard Peña, Michel Ciment, David Denby, Lawrence Kasdan, Steve McQueen and Paul Schrader. Schrader said the film [...] "has it all... represents all that film can be." [...] Martin Scorsese included it {{on a list of}} [...] "39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker." [...] French film critic André Bazin praised the film's mobile photographic style; he said its depth of field and deep focus mise-en-scène resembled that seen in Citizen Kane and The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives.|$|E
500|$|The {{cinematography}} influenced John Huston's The Maltese Falcon. Cinematographer Arthur Edeson used a wider-angle lens than Toland and {{the film}} includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, {{but it did not}} use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that Citizen Kane did. Edeson and Toland are often credited together for revolutionizing cinematography in 1941. Toland's cinematography influenced his own work on The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives. Other films influenced include Gaslight, Mildred Pierce and Jane Eyre. Cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa said that his use of deep focus was influenced by [...] "the camera work of Gregg Toland in Citizen Kane" [...] and not by traditional Japanese art.|$|E

[...] Gradually, the couple's relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had {{a better understanding of the}} world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters". Ferdinand enjoyed Marie's presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.|$|E
500|$|In his 1950 essay [...] "The Evolution of the Language of Cinema", Bazin placed Citizen Kane {{center stage}} {{as a work}} which ushered in a new period in cinema. One of the first critics to defend motion {{pictures}} as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film {{as an example of}} cinema as an art form and wrote that [...] "Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have." [...] Bazin also compared the film to Roberto Rossellini's Paisà for having [...] "the same aesthetic concept of realism" [...] and to the films of William Wyler shot by Toland (such as The Little Foxes and The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called [...] "a dialectical step forward in film language." ...|$|E
500|$|Rand {{extended}} her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism {{while working in}} Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a [...] "friendly witness" [...] before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal {{of it in the}} 1944 film Song of Russia. Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was. She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best <b>Years</b> <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as [...] "futile".|$|E
