500|$|According to Sheffield, {{there was}} dissension {{initially}} among the orchestral musicians, {{some of whom}} [...] "were looking down their noses at the Beatles, I think". Sheffield recalls that McCartney ensured their cooperation by demanding: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>want</b> to get fucking paid or not?"

[...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why {{she thought it would}} be a good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

You're {{at the point where the}} starter is out of the game, you're in the middle (of the bullpen), these are the <b>guys</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get to.

But can you guarantee with that one pitch that you're going to do something with it? I don't think any ballplayer on earth can guarantee that. You might pop it up, miss it, roll over it, jam yourself. Then you make one out on one pitch. I want to see him get a pitchers' strike right there.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} {{to answer the question}} “Why do <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> always <b>want</b> to twist everything? ” We review the various ways in which twists, twisted actions and twisted crossed products arise, and then discuss some cohomological obstructions to the existence and triviality of twisted actions. Our review begins with the classical problems of classifying group extensions and irreducible unitary representations, and explains how cocycles and twisted actions arise. We then describe the various kinds of twisted actions occurring in the operator-algebra literature. For completeness, we have included brief descriptions of how cocycles arise in quantum mechanics and deformation theory. In § 2, we discuss three cohomological obstructions. These lie in, respectively, a sec-ond cohomology group, a relative cohomology group introduced by Huebschmann and Ratcliffe, and a third cohomology group. All these cohomology groups have descriptions in terms of extensions, and we use these descriptions wherever possible. The groups are related by an eight-term exact sequence which extends the usual five-term restriction-inflation sequence; our main point is that this exact sequence is compatible with our us...|$|R
