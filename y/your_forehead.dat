The Portland Mercury Katie Shimer called the bar [...] "one million percent fun" [...] and said, [...] "Whatever your fetish, the strippers deliver ... Make sure you stuff your pockets with singles, 'cause you'll be spending {{at least a}} good hour at the rack." [...] Similarly, the Seattle alternative weekly The Stranger said the venue was [...] "perhaps the funnest place {{in all the world}} ... especially when the fellers trot on stage in a vast array of hilarious costumes". The paper's Wm. Steven Humphrey wrote, [...] "These nudie cuties were born to entertain, and prove it by leaping from stage to tabletop, hanging naked upside down (by the tops of their FEET!!), and if you're extremely lucky, gingerly lifting a dollar bill off <b>your</b> <b>forehead</b> with their ass cheeks. Now that's talent!" [...] Byron Beck of Willamette Week said the dancers at Three Sisters [...] " [...] a quaint queer tavern into the most mouthwatering of watering holes in P-town". The paper also called the club [...] "the best place to view wiener-wiggling".|$|E
500|$|Portal 2s {{additional}} gameplay elements, like light bridges, lasers, and the gels, were praised {{as appropriate}} {{additions to the}} game. Reviewers were pleased with {{the difficulty of the}} puzzles throughout the game, which appeared visually complicated at first but had uncomplicated solutions. Times Evan Narcisse said that he feared the addition of new gameplay elements would [...] "dilute the purity of the experience, but everything's still executed with Valve's high level of charm and panache." [...] Tom Hoggins of The Telegraph praised the manner with which these elements were introduced through a [...] "brilliant learning curve of direction, rather than instruction", and considered it a [...] "design ethos that is supremely generous, but dealt with marvellous economy". Chris Kohler of Wired wrote that the game's puzzles [...] "never require excessively complicated solutions", and that much of the puzzle solving is [...] "filled with moments that will have you slapping <b>your</b> <b>forehead</b> and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm such an idiotwhy didn't I see that before?. Stapleton was not as pleased with the gel additions as with the other new mechanics, calling it [...] "difficult to control". He felt that they have [...] "only a couple of uses at most". Bright felt that Portal 2 was easier than its predecessor, in part that he felt much of the game was effectively tutorials for the new gameplay additions, requiring [...] "careful use of the tools provided", leaving him with the impression that [...] "the game was on rails".|$|E

2500|$|In 99BC, Sima Qian became {{embroiled in}} the Li Ling affair, where Li Ling and Li Guangli, two {{military}} officers {{who led a}} campaign against the Xiongnu in the north, were defeated and taken captive. Emperor Wu attributed the defeat to Li Ling, with all government officials subsequently condemning him for it. Sima {{was the only person}} to defend Li Ling, who had never been his friend but whom he respected. Emperor Wu interpreted Sima's defence of Li as an attack on his brother-in-law, Li Guangli, who had also fought against the Xiongnu without much success, and sentenced Sima to death. At that time, execution could be commuted either by money or castration. Since Sima did not have enough money to atone his [...] "crime", he chose the latter and was then thrown into prison, where he endured three years. He described his pain thus: [...] "When you see the jailer you abjectly touch the ground with <b>your</b> <b>forehead.</b> At the mere sight of his underlings you are seized with terror... Such ignominy can never be wiped away." [...] Sima called his castration [...] "the worst of all punishments".|$|E

50|$|Your baby's skull {{has seven}} bones. Normally, these bones don't fuse until around age 2, giving your baby's brain time to grow. Joints called cranial sutures, made of strong, fibrous tissue, hold these bones together. In {{the front of}} your baby's skull, the sutures {{intersect}} in the large soft spot (fontanel) on the top of your baby's head. Normally, the sutures remain flexible until the bones fuse. The signs of craniosynostosis may not be noticeable at birth, but they become apparent during {{the first few months of}} your baby's life. The symptoms differs from types of synostosis. First of all there is Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the suture at the top of the head (sagittal suture) forces the head to grow long and narrow, rather than wide. Scaphocephaly is the most common type of craniosynostosis. The other one is called Coronal synostosis (anterior plagiocephaly). Premature fusion of a coronal suture — one of the structures that run from each ear to the sagittal suture on top of the head — may force <b>your</b> baby's <b>forehead</b> to flatten on the affected side. It may also raise the eye socket and cause a deviated nose and slanted skull. The Bicoronal synostosis (brachycephaly). When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely, your baby may have a flat, elevated forehead and brow.|$|R
6000|$|Oh, awful thought! Life and death, the Devil himself, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself, {{fighting}} {{in your heart}} and in mine, and {{in the heart of}} every human being round us! And yet most blessed thought, hopeful, glorious,--full of the promise of eternal victory! For greater is He that is with us, than he that is against us; and He who conquered Satan for Himself, can and will conquer him for us also. No thing can separate us from the love of Christ; no thing, yea no angel, or devil, principality, or power; no thing, but only ourselves, only our own proud and wayward will and determination to the Devil's voice in our hearts, and not the voice of Christ, the Word of Life, who is nigh us, in our hearts, even in our darkest moments, loving us still, pitying us, ready, able and willing to help all who cast themselves on Him, and raise us, there and then, the very moment we cry to Him and renounce the Devil and our own foolish will, out of self-will into God's will, out of darkness into light, out of hatred into love, out of despair into hope, out of doubt into faith, out of tempest into peace, out of the death of sin into the life of righteousness, the life of love and charity, which abideth for ever. Oh, listen not to the lying, slanderous Devil, who tells you that by your own sin you have lost your share in Christ, lost baptismal grace, lost Christ's love--Lost His love? His, who, were you in the very lowest depths of hell, would pity you still? His love, who Himself went down into hell, and preached to the spirits in prison, to show that he did care even for them? Not so: into Him you have been baptized. His cross is on <b>your</b> <b>foreheads,</b> His Father is your Father:--and can a father desert his child, even though he sinned seventy and seven times, if seventy and seven times he turn and repent? Can man weary God? Can the creature conquer and destroy the love of his Creator? Can Christ deny Himself? Not so; whosoever thou art, however sorely tempted, however deeply fallen, however disgusted and terrified at thyself, turn only to that blessed face which wept over Jerusalem, to that great heart which bled for thee upon the cross, and thou shalt find him unchanged, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever, the Lord of life and love, able and willing to save to the uttermost all who come to God through Him, and the accusing Devil shall turn and flee, and thou shalt know that thy Redeemer liveth still, and in thy flesh thou shalt see the salvation of God, and cry, 'Rejoice not against me, Satan, mine enemy; for when I fall I shall arise.' ...|$|R

Are you afraid of me? Do you think I would hurt you? Not for all the world, my dear little girl. And--and look how beautiful the moon and stars are, and how calmly they shine when the rockets have gone out, and the noisy wheels have done hissing and blazing. When I came here to-night I did not think I should have had such a pretty little companion to sit by my side, and see these fine fireworks. You must know I live by myself, and work very hard. I write in books and newspapers, Fanny; and I quite tired out, and was expected to sit alone all night; and--don't cry, my dear, dear, little girl." [...] Here Pen broke out, rapidly putting an end to the calm oration which he had begun to deliver; for the sight of a woman's tears always put his nerves in a quiver, and he began forthwith to coax her and soothe her, and to utter a hundred and twenty little ejaculations of pity and sympathy, which need not be repeated here, because they would be absurd in print. So would a mother's talk to a child be absurd in print; so would a lover's to his bride. That sweet artless poetry bears no translation; and is too subtle for grammarians' clumsy definitions.

Do we mean to hint that r. Arthur Pendennis made any use of the monosyllable in question? Not so. In the first place, it was dark: the fireworks were over, and nobody could see him; secondly, he was not a man to have this kind of secret, and tell it; thirdly and lastly, let the honest fellow who has kissed a pretty girl, say what would have been his own conduct in such a delicate juncture? ...|$|R

As to your mother, you yourself feared already that her mind had given way from grief. Who could believe anything against me? Had not Ziemianitch hanged himself from remorse? I said to myself, 'Let's put it to the test, and be done with it once for all.' I trembled when I went in; but your mother hardly listened to what I was saying to her, and, in a little while, seemed to have forgotten my very existence. I sat looking at her. There was no longer anything between you and me. You were defenceless--and soon, very soon, you would be alone.... I thought of you. Defenceless. For days you have talked with me--opening your heart.
