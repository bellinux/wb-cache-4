Sotomayor does not belong to a Catholic parish or attend Mass, but does attend church for important occasions. She has said, [...] "I am a very spiritual person [...] maybe not traditionally religious in terms of Sunday Mass every week, that sort of thing. The trappings are not important to me, but, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe in God. And, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe in the commandments." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Vega's {{religious}} views, he {{was raised}} in the Jewish faith, but declared himself to be Catholic for many years due to his mother's upbringing. When asked about God he stated, [...] "I distrust the name 'God' but, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> believe in a higher power, God is in all of us," [...] he says, before deciding: [...] "There is an immense power. There has to be." [...] He also shared the views of Spinoza, the pantheist philosopher.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{believe that}} the chosen people concept as affirmed by Judaism in its holy writ, its prayers, and its millennial tradition. In fact, I believe that every people—and indeed, in a more limited way, every individual—is [...] "chosen" [...] or destined for some {{distinct}} purpose in advancing the designs of Providence. Only, some fulfill their mission and others do not. Maybe the Greeks were chosen for their unique contributions to art and philosophy, the Romans for their pioneering services in law and government, the British for bringing parliamentary rule into the world, and the Americans for piloting democracy in a pluralistic society. The Jews were chosen by God to be 'peculiar unto Me' as the pioneers of religion and morality; that was and is their national purpose.|$|E

6000|$|But {{they came}} shyly {{up to the}} Gilson hedge, and when Milt chuckled, [...] "Bully walk; let's do it again," [...] she said only, [...] "Oh, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> like it. Very much." ...|$|R
60|$|DE LEVIS. [Stung by {{the faint}} {{contempt}} {{in his tone}} of voice] <b>Yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Oh, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's {{because you}} have made up your mind to do {{something}} despicable and wicked.|$|E

6000|$|This {{surprised}} George a great deal, {{and almost}} made him forgive his uncle the inquiry he had received. [...] "Oh, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think of her," [...] said he. [...] "I {{thought of her}} a little at least." ...|$|R
6000|$|He. [...] "Oh, <b>yes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} much of him. Lucky dog! but he must be rather mean. They {{say that he is}} engaged to a girl in England, and has thrown her over for the widow." ...|$|R
60|$|LINA. [frankly] Oh <b>yes.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not quarrel. You {{are what}} is called a chump; but you are not a bad sort of chump.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, well, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> do that. He {{thanked me}} and went the {{following}} Sunday. Amazing how these rich Johnnies love getting something for nothing. There was that old American I met down at Marvis Bay last year--' ...|$|R

5000|$|Carella, {{who began}} writing songs {{at the age}} of 14, said: [...] "Some of my songs are fun and happy, but most of them are deep.

60|$|JUNO. <b>Yes</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Or {{at least}} I did. But I'm an Englishman; and I {{think you ought}} to respect the {{conventions}} of English life.|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT (resolutely). <b>Yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> It's not reasonable. But I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do. If Giuseppe goes, I'll go with him and protect him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have {{a finger}} in the pie," [...] {{returned}} the boy, with a self-satisfied air; [...] "but I say, Betty," [...] he added, becoming suddenly serious, [...] "what d'ye think o' what that rascally chief said about takin' you to his wigwam? You know that means he intends to make you his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>yes,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> You {{remember}} in her statement {{she said that}} her sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once {{that there must be}} a communication between the two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator." ...|$|R

"This Week in Keith History" [...] - an {{interlude}} {{that finds}} Olbermann providing amusing reactions to clips from his earlier ESPN stint {{that he has}} not seen in advance ("I haven't seen it, I don't know what it is, I didn't get a hint, and <b>yes</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> pay for that haircut").
