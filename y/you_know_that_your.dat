Upon hearing this, Zheng rushed to see his brother's corpse; weeping greatly, he said to him, [...] "Gongshu Duan, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> older brother would always forgive you; why has it come to this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your rebuke is just, yet it savours of ingratitude. I {{should not}} have done so, but I was {{completely}} taken aback. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> face is dirty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>your</b> {{smile is}} crooked?” I asked him; for I {{knew that she}} must attend him, and I wished to save {{her as much as}} possible.|$|E
