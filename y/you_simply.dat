500|$|Ferraro gained immediate, {{large-scale}} media attention. At first, journalists {{focused on}} her novelty as {{a woman and her}} poor family background, and their coverage was overwhelmingly favorable. Nevertheless, Ferraro faced many press questions about her foreign policy inexperience, and responded by discussing her attention to foreign and national security issues in Congress. She faced a threshold of proving competence that other high-level female political figures have had to face, especially those who might become commander-in-chief; the question [...] "Are you tough enough?"

Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, <b>you</b> <b>simply</b> didn't get it here.

500|$|The {{second season}} was made {{available}} {{in its entirety}} on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at 12:01a.m. PT. Prior {{to the release of}} season 1, three reviewers, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal, and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers. Stanley notes that the show [...] "is probably seen best one episode at a time. It's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast, but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderousâ€”a romp slowed down to a dirge". Smith also notes that due to its [...] "relentless theme", [...] "House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged", deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a [...] "bag of M's". However, Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying [...] "So, on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and <b>you</b> <b>simply</b> cannot stop watching, then, yes, you may power-binge your way through all 13 hours at once". Upon viewing the four episode season 2 preview Time James Poniewozik says [...] "I could easily see powering through the season in a free weekend, precisely because no individual episode needs much time to sink in". Stanley also felt the second season was [...] "binge-worthy" [...] upon viewing the preview. However, Ellen Gray of Philly.com supports not binge-watching the season, as she believes it does not serve it well.|$|E

[...] Andrew C. Bradick of Prefix Magazine gave the album a favorable review and called it [...] "Wilco's first step toward aging well, but it transcends transition and is an album that sounds right in its place and time."

[...] Tiny Mix Tapes also gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "While the elders will rejoice [...] this sober, satisfied, and craftily subdued effort, the younglings of the bunch, with their abbreviated attention spans, iPod shuffles, and demand for instant gratification, will declare the album a boring and lethargic affair." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine likewise gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "Though it may not fit comfortably alongside any other albums in Wilco's catalogue, Sky Blue Sky is further confirmation that, even at their most retro, they're among contemporary pop music's most vital acts." [...] Likewise, Graeme Thomson of The Observer gave it four stars and said, [...] "The closer you listen to the jazzy guitars, Beatles touches and easy, shuffling rhythms ... the more it transpires that Tweedy is simply allowing the songs sufficient room to speak up for themselves." ...|$|E
