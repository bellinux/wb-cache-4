And I believe, I don't {{remember}} the quote exactly, but I believe {{you said you had}} checked with a higher authority. I would like to ask you, what part does your faith play on your policy decisions? ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{want to read}} {{something}} you said four years ago at this very setting: [...] "Freedom means freedom for everybody." [...] You said it again recently when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> about legalizing same-sex unions. And you used your family's experience as a context for your remarks. Can you describe then your administration's support for a constitutional ban on same-sex unions? ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Richard Rahn, Chairman of the Institute for Global Economic Growth, {{wrote in}} The Washington Times: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to name {{one person who}} has enabled more people to gain wealth and {{security}} than any other person on the globe, who would you name? In 1881, here in Berlin, Otto von Bismarck started the world's first modern pay-as-you-go social security system which served {{as the model for}} the U.S. Social Security system and that of many other countries, including setting the retirement age at 65. No, Bismarck is not the answer to the opening question. The answer is Jose Pinera." ...|$|E

I don't suppose you really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe you'd like something real dressy to wear if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> out anywhere of an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that Jane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them, and I don't mean you shall be behind them.

If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed {{on the back of}} the fellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a {{military}} carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command. You must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung his cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Feeder,' replied Mr Toots gravely, 'the fact is, {{that there}} were several {{circumstances}} which prevented me from communicating with you until after my marriage had been solemnised.

In the second place, our wedding was strictly private; there being nobody present but one friend of myself and Mrs Toots's, who is a Captain in--I don't exactly know in what,' said Mr Toots, 'but it's of no consequence. I hope, Feeder, that in writing a statement of what had occurred before Mrs Toots and myself went abroad upon our foreign tour, I fully discharged the offices of friendship.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Clive did {{not know}} how to look at this {{character}} of his relative, but Clive's companion burst into a fit of laughter, at which F. B. nodded gravely, and resumed his narrative. [...] "I don't know how much money he has had from your governor, but this I can say, the half of it would make F. B. a happy man. I don't know out of how much the reverend party has nobbled his poor old sister at Brighton. He has mortgaged his chapel to Sherrick, I suppose you know, who is master of it, and could turn him out any day. I don't think Sherrick is a bad fellow. I think he's a good fellow; I have known him do many a good turn to a chap in misfortune. He wants to get into society: what more natural? That was why <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to meet him the other day, and why he asked you to dinner. I hope you had a good one. I wish he'd ask me.|$|E
