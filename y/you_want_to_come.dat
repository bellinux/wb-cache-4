500|$|I {{needed to}} {{maintain}} a very strong relationship with Tommy [...] During that period, {{the beginning of their}} end, I had to stay away more than normal from her because she was going through a rough time. She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt that part of what she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E
500|$|In a {{roundtable}} {{interview with}} multiple news outlets, Vaughn {{responded to a}} question about choosing [...] "Love Love" [...] by the British band Take That for the end-credits theme, explaining, [...] "I bumped into [...] Gary [...] in , and we were just talking, and I said, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and see a rough cut of it?’ And they came, and they wrote the song, and I listened to it, and I said, ‘I think it’ll be a hit’, and if we can do a video which gets girls more interested ... we might get them to come and watch it. So it’s pure commerce, to be blunt, and I want women to see this film." [...] An instrumental of the song [...] "Run (I'm a Natural Disaster)" [...] by Gnarls Barkley is used in the 'mutant recruitment' scene.|$|E
500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} VVVVVV was {{composed}} by chiptune musician Magnus Pålsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose VVVVVV after playing Space Phallus, an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. [...] Pålsson {{wrote on the}} Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was [...] "amazed at the depth {{that came with the}} games, even though they were small and short." [...] In writing the music for VVVVVV, Pålsson aimed to make [...] "uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds whether you want to or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the game even more." [...] The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled MMMMMM which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. [...] The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was directed by}} Dean Karr. Filming commenced on December 1, 2011 in Los Angeles. During an interview with MTV News, Lee stated that the visual was [...] "ethereal", also saying that [...] "this [...] {{is going to look}} a lot different. Actually, I kind of wanted it to be the opposite. The first video, for 'What You Want,' was very real, and this is very surreal." [...] The singer further confessed that the clip draws inspiration from dark fantasy horror film Paperhouse (1988) in order to achieve surreality. Lee further explained, [...] " [...] this girl, and everything that she would draw would come to life in her dreams, and she was creating this dream world for herself. And at first, it was cool, but then it's like this nightmare. So I sort of thought it would apply, and be cool, to have it be this dream that you're trapped in. So you're in a place that, at first, is a magical world, but at the same time, you're isolated and trapped there, and that's the reason <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to reality after a time." [...] When filming the video, fiber optics were used reportedly in order to create the effect of things coming to life after drawing them. Lee described the appearance {{of the rest of the}} group in the visual as [...] "sort of like the dream within the dream, in an abyss of darkness".|$|E
500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I was scared to death. Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Though the Fourth Doctor was {{overwhelmingly}} the Doctor most imitated in the programme from 2000–2004, other Doctors {{also received}} treatment by the cast. With {{the coming of}} the 2005 series of Doctor Who, Dead Ringers added the most recent incarnations of the Doctor to its repertoire (for example, suggesting that Christopher Eccleston's real reason for leaving the programme was because his parents are hardcore Star Trek fans, which is possibly a parody of Star Trek fandom). The 2005 series trailer also parodied the [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Come</b> With Me?" [...] trailers used to advertise the series; Eccleston's dialogue being spoken by impersonators of Tony Blair, Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy (due to BBC impartiality {{in the run-up to the}} 2005 General Election, all three political parties were represented).|$|E
