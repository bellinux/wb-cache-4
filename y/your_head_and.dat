You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

500|$|Comparing {{the music}} {{with those of}} Rahman's in Shankar's {{previous}} films, Krishnakumar of Rediff.com said, [...] "Jayaraj doesn't disappoint, but while ARR wafted and lingered, Jayaraj explodes and fizzles away.

500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] is {{a feminist}} call-to-arms, {{complete}} with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having {{a man who}} loves <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> your heart. If he doesn't treat you right (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God {{and the power of}} orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of [...] "Vogue" [...] and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.|$|E

[...] It was a passionate kind of relationship that we directed into creativity, into writing, into creating this piece. [...] We put the drama between us on stage." ...|$|E

Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful and it almost makes the audience wonder what exactly happened.

500|$|With Feliciano again up, Secretariat {{returned}} to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts, but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2–5 favorite {{caught the attention of}} veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, [...] "You carry an ideal around in <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way.

500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most fun part, in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} Enterprise would be {{successful}} in its mission was planned {{from the start of}} the development of the year-long storyline. However, the producers and writing team would joke that there would be a [...] "bizarre twist" [...] such as the crew returning to Earth and discovering that it was now ruled by giant cockroaches. The writers decided against a Xindi-based cliffhanger and sought an unusual twist. Braga said that [...] "I can't remember who said 'Nazis,' but we just somehow ended up with Nazis. Then that didn't even feel like enough, so we decided to make them alien Nazis." [...] He expected it would make the returning episode in season four [...] "really interesting", and wanted to end the series on something [...] "wacky". Most of the cast were not given the final few pages of the script until they were already in production. Actor Dominic Keating, who portrays Malcolm Reed on Enterprise, called the ending a [...] "lovely twist... that just makes you scratch <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> wonder at what you've just seen." [...] The twist was wrapped up at the start of season four with the two-part episode [...] "".|$|E

500|$|Admitting {{she is not}} perfect, Beyoncé {{sings the}} lines [...] "Would you rather I be a machine who doesn't notice when you late or when you lyin'?" [...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking {{that he is not}} perfect. However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First both of my legs go back on <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> <b>and</b> Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing. I thought it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] and [...] "Man Overboard".|$|E
500|$|The episode, {{like the}} others in the series, was shot over eight days, with the 'May vs. May' fight being shot over three of those days—one 16-hour day, a half-day, and a quarter-day. In {{preparation}} for the fight, both Wen and her stunt double Samantha Jo had to learn both May and Agent 33's actions, with Jo explaining that [...] "Usually you only have to learn one side, so you can just drill that into <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> have that muscle memory and be good to go. But for this fight, for both Ming and myself, we had to learn both sides of the fight. And we knew on the day we were filming that we’d have to be changing our wardrobe back and forth. So we’d be going {{to one side of the}} fight, to the other side of the fight, back to the other side, and we just wanted to make sure we were safe about it. Because if we spaced out and started doing the other side again, we didn’t want anyone to get hurt. So that’s why we trained together. We were doing two sessions twice a week, anywhere from two to five hours at Ming’s house just trying to get as physically ready and as mentally ready as possible. But thankfully, we’d already done so many episodes together by that point that we were super comfortable, and we know each other’s body movements." ...|$|E

500|$|Moffat and Vertue became {{interested}} in casting Cumberbatch as the title character after watching his performance in the 2007 film Atonement. The actor was cast after reading the script for the creative team. [...] "Cumberbatch", says The Guardian, [...] "has a reputation for playing odd, brilliant men very well, and his Holmes is cold, techie, slightly Aspergerish". Cumberbatch said, [...] "There's a great charge you get from playing him, because {{of the volume of}} words in <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the speed of thought—you really have to make your connections incredibly fast. He is {{one step ahead of the}} audience and of anyone around him with normal intellect. They can't quite fathom where his leaps are taking him." [...] Piers Wenger, head of drama at BBC Cymru Wales, described the series' rendering of Sherlock as [...] "a dynamic superhero in a modern world, an arrogant, genius sleuth driven by a desire to prove himself cleverer than the perpetrator and the police—everyone in fact". Addressing changing social attitudes and broadcasting regulations, Cumberbatch's Holmes replaced the pipe with multiple nicotine patches. The writers believed that Sherlock should not talk like [...] "a completely modern person", says Moffat, but were initially intent that [...] "he never sounded like he's giving a lecture". Moffat turned the character [...] "more Victorian" [...] in the second series, capitalising more on Cumberbatch's [...] "beautiful voice" [...] to make it sound like [...] "he's giving a lecture".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Fifteen" [...] was {{directed}} by Roman White, who previously directed Swift's music video [...] "You Belong with Me". White began {{with the intention of}} creating a video different than others Swift did in the past. To do so, he believed he needed to set the video outside of high school. White explained, [...] "Well, I think I really wanted this video to kind of be an evolution for Taylor [...] I actually said to her, 'I don't think we should shoot in a high school.' And I don't think she wanted to either." [...] White conceptualized the video's setting by taking into account the literal meaning of the song and transforming into something new. He conceptualized the setting to be new world where Swift could revisit her memories, as they manifest around her. [...] "Let's take the literal meaning of this song and watch it evolve in front of us ... almost as a memory in <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> create this world, somewhere you walk in on this desolate desert and you start to sing about all these great memories you have... of everything you love blooming around you, and so we literally grew this garden around her", White said. [...] The world moved from one situation to the next. White decided to annex surreal elements to create a cross between a garden and the heart of the memories. He intertwined Swift's emotions with the growth of the garden. The garden grew when Swift felt happy, but at the sight of pain and negative emotions, clouds appear and the garden dies, which also symbolized Anderson's broken heart.|$|E
