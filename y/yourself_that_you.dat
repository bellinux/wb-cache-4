[...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy <b>yourself</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E

[...] She has blanket permission to withhold anything and everything. But she did come to discuss things. And therefore she starts discussing this, discussing that. And it's always [...] "Well, this is all right to talk about." [...] And before she's finished, she has mentioned everything. And each new item - [...] "Well, this really isn't so important that I have to withhold it. I can use the withholding permission for more important matters." [...] Simply a hypnotic technique. To make them respond to the idea of withholding, and to respond to the idea of communicating.|$|E
6000|$|MARGARET (severely). Not you; so {{sure you}} could do it better <b>yourself.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>you</b> all over. Daddy, do you {{remember}} how you taught me to balance a biscuit on my nose, like a puppy? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It isn't {{possible}} for me," [...] she said simply, [...] "to {{tell you how}} glad I am. Don't <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> feel <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have done the right thing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I {{wanted to}} say, {{but it sounds}} {{different}} on your lips. It sounds as though you meant it <b>yourself,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> meant it because of me." ...|$|R
