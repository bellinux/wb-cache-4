Compared to adult males who’s <b>yearly</b> <b>wages</b> hovered around $485.11 and adult females who’s remained at $345.44, minors of either sex only earned roughly $143.64 <b>yearly.</b> This large <b>wage</b> gap made child labor attractive to mill owners, and quickly drew manufacturers to the Lehigh Valley area. Between 1880 and 1925, {{the value of}} silk products manufactured in Pennsylvania increased tenfold. At this time, working children were the cheapest form of labor used to maximize profits. In 1876, roughly 30 silk manufacturers opened plants in Pennsylvania {{largely due to the}} availability of child labor and the lack of concern for children in the wage labor force. By 1907, children comprised roughly 30% of the labor force throughout the Pennsylvania silk mills, many under the legal working age of 12.|$|R

When an early estimate for the 2011 indexed minimum wage increase (approximately 10-cents) was announced by state Labor Commissioner Brad Avakian in September 2010, the OCPP advocated the increase as a needed boost for the state's poor. The group also pointed out that the wage hike would act as a counterbalance to the coming state tax increase for gas and diesel.|$|R
50|$|A talent (Ancient Greek , talanton ‘scale’ and ‘balance’) was a unit {{of weight}} of {{approximately}} 80 lb, and when used as {{a unit of}} money, was valued for that weight of silver. As a unit of currency, a talent was worth about 6,000 denarii. Since a denarius was the usual payment for a day's labour, {{the value of a}} talent was about twenty years of labour, by an ordinary person. By contemporary standards (ca. AD 2009) at the rate of the US minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, the value of a talent would be approximately $300,000 over 20 years, while, at the median <b>yearly</b> <b>wage</b> of $26,363, a talent would be valued at about $500,000.|$|R

30|$|Belgium {{is indeed}} {{characterized}} by a centralized hierarchical system of collective bargaining for wages, which {{takes place at the}} national, industry and firm level; negotiations at each lower level cannot yield less favorable outcomes than the higher level.

This so-called “wage margin” wants to limit wage increases which could harm the competitiveness of Belgian products in the international market. A third nation-wide mechanism affecting wage setting is indexation, which ties gross labor compensations to changes in consumer prices, and establishes a de facto floor for wage increases in the year.|$|R
