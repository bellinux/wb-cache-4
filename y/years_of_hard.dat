5|$|Meanwhile, on 20 February 1948, Prokofiev's {{estranged wife}} Lina {{was arrested for}} 'espionage', as {{she had tried to}} send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labour.

5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor. His confession was full of absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 1969, Kouandété accused Alley of {{plotting}} to kidnap and murder him. Facing the death penalty, Alley {{was sentenced to}} ten <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor at an open trial held on October 4. Zinsou had intervened for Alley, and it strained relations {{between the president and}} Kouandété. The latter decided to lead another coup on December 10. In the aftermath, Alley was released from incarceration and reinstated in the army. In July 1968, he was named Secretary General of National Defence. Kouandété ended up becoming Alley's adjutant.|$|E
5|$|Sentenced to 25 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor, Hartmann {{refused to}} work. He was {{eventually}} put into solitary confinement, which enraged his fellow prisoners.

Hartmann made a complaint to the Kommandants office, {{asking for a}} representative from Moscow and an international inspection, {{as well as a}} tribunal, to acquit him of his unlawful conviction. This was refused, and he was transferred to a camp in Novocherkassk, where he spent five more months in solitary confinement. Eventually, Hartmann was granted a tribunal, but it upheld his original sentence. He was subsequently sent to another camp, this time at Diaterka in the Ural Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The Romans faced further reverses on the {{battlefield}} and a savage guerrilla war in the Bosnian mountains. It took them three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> fighting to quell the revolt, which was described by the Roman historian Suetonius,writing in c. AD 100, as the most difficult conflict faced by Rome since the Punic Wars over two centuries earlier. Tiberius finally succeeded in quelling the revolt in 9AD. This was apparently lucky timing for the Romans: that same year Arminius destroyed Varus' three legions in Germany. The Roman high command {{had no doubt that}} Arminius would have formed a grand alliance with the Illyrians.|$|E
5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant danger of being shot by poachers.|$|E

5|$|Alexander's 10-year {{campaign}} in Asia, and the Macedonian {{conquest of the}} Persian empire, were to become the stuff of legend. The Macedonian army campaigned in Asia Minor, the Levant, Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia and Persia, winning notable battles at the Granicus, the Issus and Gaugamela, before the final collapse of Darius's rule in 330 BC. Alexander thus became ruler of the extensive Persian domains, although his rule {{over most of the}} territory was far from secure. Alexander continued campaigning in central Asia in the following years, before crossing into the Indian sub-continent. However, the Macedonian army became increasingly unhappy, and eventually mutinied, forcing Alexander to turn back. Alexander spent his final years attempting to consolidate his empire and planning future campaigns but, probably exhausted by <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> campaigning, he died in Babylon in 323 BC.|$|E
5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of Gabon, formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of Gabon during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to Gabon in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E

5|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty-two Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested.

Ninety-one {{were found guilty}} and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. According to cultural historian Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, the government of Puerto Rico, {{caught in the middle}} of a potentially damaging affair that could jeopardize its political agenda, kept silent for nearly two months. Finally, the incidents were made known by a local newspaper alerted by several letters written by the imprisoned soldiers to their families. Secret negotiations between the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments took place and the Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá {{was born}} on 29 February 1952 in Cerro, Havana. The fifth of seven children, he was brought up as a Roman Catholic and {{attended}} a Marist Brothers school in Havana. Payá was the only student at the school who refused to join the Communist League following the Cuban Revolution. The school was later closed. In 1969, {{he was sentenced to}} three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor on Isla de Pinos when he refused to transport political prisoners during his mandatory military service.

5|$|Elsewhere, {{however, the}} process of {{consolidation}} was harder, or failed completely: Aghlabid-controlled Ifriqiya was confirmed in its autonomous status, effectively slipping entirely from Abbasid control, while in Azerbaijan, al-Ma'mun's general Isa ibn Abi Khalid re-established control over the various local Muslim lords in the cities, {{but was unable to}} suppress the Khurramite revolt. Expeditions were sent against the Khurramites under Sadaka ibn Ali al-Azdi in 824 and Muhammad ibn Humayd al-Ta'i in 827–829, but both failed before the mountainous terrain and the Khurramites' guerrilla tactics, with Ibn Humayd losing his life as well. It was not until the accession of al-Mu'tasim, who employed his new military corps composed of Turkish slave-soldiers (mawali or ghilman) against the Khurramites, that their rebellion was suppressed, after <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> campaigning, in 837. Despite the restoration of caliphal authority in most provinces, the Caliphate continued to be troubled by rebellions: the rest of al-Ma'mun's reign saw a series of uprisings by the Zutt in lower Iraq, a three-year revolt against oppressive taxation in Egypt in 829, in which both the Christian Copts and the Muslims participated, as well as the unsuccessful revolt of Ali ibn Hisham, Ibn Humayd's successor as governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan.|$|E
