25|$|Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter {{and longer}} while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually for {{multiple}} times (2-3 typically). Steeping too hot or {{for too long}} results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew’s taste is also affected by the steeping technique. Two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down and to leave the tea leaf in the pot and gradually add more hot water as <b>you</b> <b>drink</b> the tea.|$|E
500|$|The couple {{viewed the}} Loew's State {{engagement}} in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare {{material for the}} engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the [...] "Doughnut Dunkers" [...] and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, [...] "Careful what <b>you</b> <b>drink,</b> Mr. President. [...] I got rolled {{in a place like}} this once." [...] His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.|$|E
500|$|After {{producing}} the James Gang's first three albums, he followed singer-guitarist Joe Walsh {{when he left}} the band, first as a solo artist with the Szymczyk-produced albums Barnstorm (the first recorded at the Caribou Ranch studio) and The Smoker <b>You</b> <b>Drink,</b> the Player You Get and later with the Eagles. His most prolific collaborations have been with Walsh; the two have made over 15 albums together in many settings. Walsh himself moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1971 in order to work with Szymczyk and the location would inspire one of Walsh's biggest solo hits, 1973's [...] "Rocky Mountain Way". Besides work with Walsh in his band The James Gang and as a solo artist, he also brought Walsh in to work on several albums he was doing with other musicians, using him as a session player for the B. B. King album Indianola Mississippi Seeds and the Michael Stanley album Friends and Legends. It was at Szymczyk's suggestion that the Eagles bring in Walsh to give them a [...] "rock" [...] edge; Walsh remained a core member of the band until Frey's death in 2016 effectively finished the band.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, a low-alcohol, {{sweetened}} beer {{made from}} a blend of lambic and a much lighter, freshly brewed beer to which brown sugar (or sometimes caramel or molasses) was added. The fresh beer {{was referred to as}} meertsbier, and was not necessarily a lambic. Sometimes herbs were added as well. The use of meertsbier (or water) and of substandard lambic in the blend made this a cheap, light, sweet drink for everyday consumption. The 19th century French poet Charles Baudelaire commented on faro's disagreeable aftertaste, [...] "It's beer that <b>you</b> <b>drink</b> twice", believing that the Faro in Brussels was brewed from the waters of a river (the Senne or Zenne) that was also used as a sewer.|$|E

2500|$|Jack Limpert {{published}} {{evidence as}} early as 1974 that Felt was the informant. On June 25 of that year, {{a few weeks after}} All the President's Men was published, The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial, [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Drink</b> Scotch, Smoke, Read, Maybe You're Deep Throat." [...] It began [...] "W. Mark Felt says he isn't now, nor has he ever been Deep Throat." [...] The Journal quoted Felt saying the character was a [...] "composite" [...] and [...] "I'm just not that kind of person." [...] In 1975, George V. Higgins wrote: [...] "Mark Felt knows more reporters than most reporters do, and there are some who think he had a Washington Post alias borrowed from a dirty movie." [...] During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify and the prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights J. Stanley Pottinger, discovered that Felt was [...] "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings preserved the secrecy of Felt's alter ego from the public.|$|E
2500|$|His studies {{began at}} Carthage, and {{continued}} during years spent at Athens (philosophy) and at Rome (oratory), where he evidently {{served as a}} legal advocate. Comparing learning to fine wine but with an opposite effect, Apuleius wrote, [...] "The more <b>you</b> <b>drink</b> and the stronger the draught, the better {{it is for the}} good of your soul." [...] He also traveled to Asia Minor and Egypt. While returning to Carthage he fell seriously ill in Oea (an ancient coastal city near modern Tripoli), where he convalesced at the family home of an old student friend Pontianus. Eventually Apuleius married Prudentilla, the older, wealthy widow of the house, and mother of Pontianus. Evidently the marriage was good; Sidonius Apollinaris called Prudentilla one of those [...] "noble women [...] held the lamp while their husbands read and meditated." [...] Yet debauched and greedy in-laws (this characterization by Apuleius) wantonly claimed he had murdered Pontianus; they did, however, prosecute Apuleius for using nefarius magic to gain his new wife's affections. At the trial in nearby Sabratha the Roman proconsul Claudius Maximus presided. Apuleius, then in his thirties, crafted a trial speech in his own defense, which in written form makes his Apology; apparently he was acquitted.

2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so <b>you</b> <b>drink</b> loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as far as I could on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E
