[...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E

[...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that.

500|$|Complex {{gave the}} episode a {{positive}} review, writing {{that it was}} overshadowed by [...] "Leave It to Beaver", {{but that it was}} also a good episode by itself as well. [...] " [...] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special is the way it trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful.

500|$|Keith DeCandido, in a 2012 {{review for}} Tor.com, gave the episode {{a score of}} 7 out of 10. He said that the {{majority}} of the guest cast were [...] "pretty nowhere", but that the backbone of the episode was Lenard portraying Sarek, [...] "one of the most beloved recurring roles in the franchise's history, and this episode is a beautiful illustration of why". He called the telepathy plot [...] "dopey sci-fi stuff", but praised the direction of Landau in—among others—the concert scene, which he called a [...] "tour de force". He said, however, that the standout part of the episode was the interaction of Stewart and Lenard, who he referred to as [...] "two great actors at the absolute top of their game". He said that [...] "Stewart simply owns the mind-meld, a turbulent, raw scene that leaves the character of Sarek completely exposed, and Stewart sells it amazingly.

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being.

500|$|Streep portrayed Roberta Guaspari, {{a real-life}} New Yorker who found passion and {{enlightenment}} teaching violin to the inner-city kids of East Harlem, {{in the music}} drama Music of the Heart (1999). A departure from director Wes Craven's previous work in films like A Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream series, Streep replaced singer Madonna, who left the project before filming began due to creative differences with Craven. Required to perform on the violin, Streep went through two months of intense training, five to six hours a day. Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she {{may be the most}} versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's – with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork Media {{said that}} while Acid Tongue is [...] "immediately pleasurable," [...] the album's {{downfall}} is that [...] "Lewis does {{such a good job}} of nailing choice sounds and styles from pop's past that you can't help getting reeled in right away; only upon later reflection do <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own." [...] The review continued, [...] "In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge." [...] Time noted that Acid Tongue [...] "sprawl with misplaced ambition" [...] and that only the title track sticks. Another review observed, [...] "Lewis seems to be [...] on her way to a more definitive musical existence [...] but she doesn’t quite seem to know yet." [...] Acid Tongue was also slated for its [...] "hip-hop-like roster of unnecessary cameos. Zooey Deschanel and M.

500|$|While {{the book}} Lone Survivor chronicles Marcus Luttrell's 1999 {{enlistment}} and training, {{as well as}} his 2005 deployment to Afghanistan, Berg decided that the film adaptation would focus mainly on the events of the failed United States Navy SEALs mission Operation Red Wings, as well as the bonding and camaraderie of Luttrell and his fallen teammates. Prior to writing the screenplay, Berg met with the families of the deceased. [...] "My research started with meeting the families of the SEAL teammates who were killed", he said. [...] "I went to New York and met the Murphys. I went to Colorado and met the Dietzes, and I went to Northern California and met the Axelsons. After spending time with them, <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> these kids were the best and the brightest; they were the stars of the families. The grief and the wounds are still very raw. You would have to be inhuman to not feel the responsibility when that kind of grief gets shared with you." [...] Berg also expressed that he was motivated by the families to make the story as realistic as possible; his goal was [...] "to put [...] into the experience of what these guys went through.

500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' is about what, in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E
500|$|Graduation {{opens on}} a sparse note with [...] "Good Morning", {{beginning}} with an echoed, metronomic cowbell beat and a thumping bassline melded with a simple, arpeggiating synthesizer drone. The drone is drowned {{by the music}} that arrives at the chorus, which is a conflation of ambient synths and an astral backing choir crafted from a non-verbal vocal sample of [...] "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" [...] by Elton John. [...] "Good Morning" [...] eventually concludes with the voice of Jay-Z reiterating lyrics from [...] "The Ruler's Back", the rapper's own opening track of his sixth studio album The Blueprint. The production for [...] "Champion" [...] features intermittent drops and 808-handclaps and expresses a slight jazz-rock influence, eschewing guitars and trumpets in favor of breezy synths. During the verses, West raps over a constant loop of the words [...] "their eyes" [...] while the chopped-up hook is formed from the question, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>realize,</b> <b>that</b> you were a champion?" [...] Both phrases are recontextualized from a line lifted from [...] "Kid Charlemagne" [...] by Steely Dan. The song also sports a reggae-inspired bridge delivered by Connie Mitchell in a distinct toasting vocal style. The soul-fired track [...] "I Wonder" [...] starts off with its piano-based refrain, which contains samples of [...] "My Song" [...] by British poet Labi Siffre. It then proceeds to morph into a myriad of interlaced synths that are impacted by distorted snare drum strokes and ethereal electronic keyboards. During the bridge, the chord progression changes and the song adopts a heavy string section that emulates the melody of its synths. The composition then enters an instrumental passage and finishes off with a sweeping string arrangement.|$|E

500|$|As a mascot character, Crash {{has drawn}} {{numerous}} comparisons to competing mascots such as Mario and Sonic by reviewers. Dave Halverson of GameFan praised Crash's animations, appearance and mannerisms as [...] "100% perfection". A reviewer for Game Revolution praised Crash's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] as [...] "always refreshing", and John Broady of GameSpot described Crash as [...] "disarmingly cute and fuzzy". Doug Perry of IGN {{was critical of}} the character, seeing him as [...] "insanely capitalistic", negatively comparing his voice to Luigi of the Mario series and accusing him of being [...] "the most see-through, copycat mascot that ever existed." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone also disliked Crash's voice, remarking [...] "it is really annoying to hear a child say, 'Whoa!' every time you fall in the water, especially when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the child's voice {{is supposed to be}} Crash". Crash's animations, particularly in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, have been praised as humorous by reviewers. Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed Crash's [...] "overextended running style and self-punishing attacks" [...] as establishing him as an [...] "empty-headed but enthusiastic character", and compared his facial contortions to those of comedian Red Skelton. In a poll held by MSN in late 2008 to determine the most iconic video game character, Crash ranked at #8. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the eleventh best video game character. However, he also ranked eighth on IGN's top 10 list of video game characters who should die, adding {{that it would be a}} mercy killing.

[...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What I think was surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E
