500|$|Mellor's earlier works {{examined}} {{the relationships between}} cultures, including in his mezzotint prints in which he juxtaposed [...] "images of native and introduced flora and fauna—for example, a kangaroo with a bull—to symbolise two different peoples and cultures". These issues were also addressed in his painting for the exhibition Native Titled Now, shown in South Australia in 1996. Mellor's interest in cultural interactions extends beyond the making of his art. In a panel discussion on Indigenous art education, Mellor emphasised that, in teaching Indigenous art within visual arts, {{it was important to}} be aware of both Aboriginal and settler history, [...] "so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their interaction and the whole set of issues that arise from those two things being parallel". Mellor's emphasis on past interactions between cultures led gallerist and critic Michael Reid to consider that Mellor's works had earned him [...] "an important place in the visual narrative of Australian history".|$|E

When asked by Bob Pockrass about being on probation, Busch said, [...] "It refrains me from not beating {{the shit out of}} you right now because you ask me stupid questions. But since I'm on probation, I suppose that's {{improper}} to say as well. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> racing things, we'll talk about many things, Bob.

60|$|There are a {{great many}} people who imagine that {{elementary}} teaching might be properly carried out by teachers provided with only elementary knowledge. Let me assure you that that is the profoundest mistake in the world. There is nothing so difficult to do as to write a good elementary book, and there is nobody so hard to teach properly and well as people who know nothing about a subject, and I will tell you why. If I address an audience of persons who are occupied in the same line of work as myself, I can assume that they know a vast deal, and that they can find out the blunders I make. If they don't, it is their fault and not mine; but when I appear before a body of people who know nothing about the matter, who take for gospel whatever I say, surely it becomes needful that I consider what I say, make sure that it will bear examination, and that I do not impose upon the credulity of those who have faith in me. In the second place, it involves that difficult process of knowing what you know so well that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> your ordinary business. A man can always talk about his own business. He can always make it plain; but, if his knowledge is hearsay, he is afraid to go beyond what he has recollected, and put it before those that are ignorant in such a shape that they shall comprehend it. That is why, to be a good elementary teacher, to teach the elements of any subject, requires most careful consideration, if you are a master of the subject; and, if you are not a master of it, it is needful you should familiarise yourself with so much as you are called upon to teach--soak yourself in it, so to speak--until you know it as part of your daily life and daily knowledge, and then {{you will be able to}} teach anybody. That is what I mean by practical teachers, and, although the deficiency of such teachers is being remedied to a large extent, I think it is one which has long existed, and which has existed from no fault of those who undertook to teach, but because, until the last score of years, it absolutely was not possible for any one in a great many branches of science, whatever his desire might be, to get instruction which would enable him to be a good teacher of elementary things. All that is being rapidly altered, and I hope it will soon become a thing of the past.|$|E
