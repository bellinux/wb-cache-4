5|$|When Echo & the Bunnymen {{entered the}} studio to record What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life?, bassist Les Pattinson {{received}} news {{that his mother was}} unwell. That, coupled with Pattinson's perception that McCulloch wanted everything his way, led to Pattinson announcing his retirement from the band. McCulloch and guitarist Will Sergeant were determined to continue as Echo & the Bunnymen and recruited session musicians so they could record the album. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and was recorded at Doghouse Studios in Henley-on-Thames, Parr Street Studios in Liverpool, and Olympic Studios, Maida Vale Studios and CTS in London.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact {{we were able to do}} our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of the Staircase, Curreri's 2004 release saw {{the return}} of Jeff Romano, who {{produced}} and performed on 2002's From Long Gones to Hawkmoth. The title of the record comes from a French expression l'esprit d'escalier, the things you think to say after you are already out the door. His first live album, Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Paul Curreri was recorded at Charlottesville's (now-defunct) Gravity Lounge, and released in 2006. Musical backing was provided by Charlottesvillians Randall Pharr (bass) and Spencer Lathrop (drums).|$|E

500|$|When Henriksen {{first got}} the script, he mistook {{it for a}} film because of its [...] "powerful" [...] story. He was not fond {{of the idea of}} {{participating}} in a television project. Henriksen contacted Carter about the character; his first question was [...] "How are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to make this hero a hero? I mean, it is so dark, how are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to handle this?" [...] Carter replied saying that Frank was a hero because he was able to [...] "stand-up" [...] against all of this. Henriksen was also worried about the dark [...] "feel" [...] of the show, saying that all shows needs some glimpse of {{light at the end of}} the tunnel. According to Carter [...] "The yellow house" [...] was the light, which Henriksen later agreed upon.|$|E

500|$|After working {{together}} as Electrafixion, McCulloch, Sergeant and Pattinson regrouped in 1997 and returned as Echo & the Bunnymen with the UK Top 10 hit [...] "Nothing Lasts Forever". An album of new material, Evergreen, was greeted enthusiastically by critics {{and the band}} made a successful return to the live arena. Though Pattinson left the group for a second time, McCulloch and Sergeant continue to record as Echo & the Bunnymen, releasing What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? (1999), Flowers (2001), Siberia (2005), The Fountain (2009), and Meteorites (2014).|$|E
500|$|What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? was {{released}} on 16 April 1999 through London Records following {{the release of the}} first single from the album, [...] "Rust", the previous month. One further single, [...] "Get in the Car", followed the album's release. The album received mixed reviews from the music press, being described as both flawless and having no appeal. The album was not as popular with the public as earlier releases from Echo & the Bunnymen; the album peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} {{is going to}} commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> {{to have a new}} sensation. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> to see {{the most beautiful woman in}} the world." ...|$|R

500|$|Released in March 1999, [...] "Rust" [...] was {{the first}} single to come from What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life?. The single peaked at number twenty-two on the UK Singles Chart, and NME {{magazine}} named it their Single of the Week. The album was released the following month on 16 April and, having failed {{to appeal to the}} public as much as the band's previous albums, peaked at number twenty-one on the UK Albums Chart. [...] "Get in the Car", one of the tracks recorded with Fun Lovin' Criminals, was later released as a single.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} a source of {{inspiration}} for Joyce Carol Oates' short story [...] "Where Are <b>You</b> <b>Going,</b> Where Have You Been?", prompting her to dedicate the story to Dylan. A portion of the first verse of the song was used as the title for Barry Hannah's 1995 novel Yonder Stands Your Orphan. Graham Bonnet's version of the song appears on the soundtrack of the 2009 Peter Jackson film The Lovely Bones.. Philadelphia pop punk band The Wonder Years's 2009 Distances split EP opens with a track entitled [...] "An Elegy for Baby Blue," [...] which references Dylan's song by directly quoting him in its chorus.|$|E
500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' and we had no {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> are always <b>going</b> to have the really cute one. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> to have the quiet one. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> to have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> to have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R

500|$|The {{game has}} been {{considered}} by game reviewers {{as one of the}} better shoot 'em up video games in the genre as well {{as one of the best}} games on the TurboGrafx-16 gaming console. Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser from Dragon reviewed the game in its [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column, giving the game 5 out of 5 stars. Brett Alan Weiss from Allgame considered this game as [...] "one of the most highly regarded games in the TurboGrafx-16 library". VideoGames & Computer Entertainment featured a walkthrough of the game which spanned over two issues in 1990; they praised the game, saying that it is [...] "one of the fastest games for the TurboGrafx-16", that it [...] "will keep <b>you</b> <b>going</b> for hours".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Science Journal G. Wayne Clough, the 12th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution assuaged [...] the animosities between critics and proponents of the exhibition: [...] “So I don't think there's anything negative here. I think the Smithsonian tried to do it right. When we heard the concerns, we asked the community to come together and talk about it, and we listened, and some people in that audience had their minds changed, as a matter of fact, but not everybody. So, I think it's time {{in a situation like this}} to pause, and for the profession itself to say, [...] "Okay, there's a problem, what are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> to do about it? And, you remember, the United States never signed the UNESCO treaty.” ...|$|E
500|$|What Are <b>You</b> <b>Going</b> to Do with Your Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E
