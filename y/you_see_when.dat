500|$|Srikula adepts {{most often}} worship Lalita using the {{abstract}} Sri Chakra yantra, which {{is regarded as}} her subtle form. The Sri Chakra can be visually rendered either as a two-dimensional diagram (whether drawn temporarily {{as part of the}} worship ritual, or permanently engraved in metal) or in the three-dimensional, pyramidal form known as the Sri Meru. It is not uncommon to find a Sri Chakra or Sri Meru installed in South Indian temples, because – as modern practitioners assert – [...] "there is no disputing that this is the highest form of Devi and that some of the practice can be done openly. But {{what you see in the}} temples is not the srichakra worship <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> it is done privately." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1973, {{while still}} grieving {{the loss of}} her daughter, Rice took a {{previously}} written short story and turned it into her first novel, the bestselling Interview with the Vampire. She based her vampires on Gloria Holden's character in Dracula's Daughter: [...] "It established to me what vampires were—these elegant, tragic, sensitive people. I was really just going with that feeling when writing Interview With the Vampire. I didn't do a lot of research." [...] After completing the novel and following many rejections from publishers, Rice developed obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). She became obsessed with germs, thinking that she contaminated everything she touched, engaged in frequent and obsessive hand washing and obsessively checked locks on windows and doors. Of this period, Rice says, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> you're in that state is every single flaw in our hygiene and you can't control it and you go crazy." ...|$|E

2500|$|If qualia of {{this sort}} exist, then a {{normally}} sighted person who sees red {{would be unable to}} describe the experience of this perception {{in such a way that}} a listener who has never experienced color will be able to know everything there is to know about that experience.

Arbona said that [...] "when Tony Stark spoke to General Ross at the end of The Incredible Hulk, you could tell they already knew each other; they spoke about some shared history they'd had together. Well in Iron Man 2: Public Identity <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>when</b> they first meet, and what that shared history is." [...] This comic explains that the AI J.A.R.V.I.S. was created in memory of Edwin Jarvis, introduced here as Howard Stark's butler. A younger version of the character appears in Agent Carter, portrayed by James D'Arcy.|$|E

He likes to cite Chinese masters of the classical period, mentioned by Matisse who taught the student to identify with his subject: to paint the tree in its expansion, the rock in its rugged massiveness and mentions that the precept can be also found in General semantics by Alfred Korzybski: [...] "To be efficient, a language should be similar in its structure to the structure of the event it is supposed to represent". This idea that an artwork should be autonomous — epoch and even author's identity, taking second place — has provoked vigorous discussions with artists friends, notably with painter Joan Mitchell.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the film, {{the camera}} moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, {{revealed}} to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been [...] "absorbed" [...] into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right {{at the center of the}} central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>When</b> you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.|$|E
