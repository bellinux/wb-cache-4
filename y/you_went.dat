He {{was offered the}} {{occasional}} job, including the opportunity to direct Since <b>You</b> <b>Went</b> Away for David O. Selznick, but turned them down. Lewis, meanwhile, was busier than ever with his production duties and often worked late hours, leaving Whale lonely and bored. Lewis bought him a supply of paint and canvasses and Whale re-discovered his love of painting. Eventually he built a large studio for himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{its second}} week, Dreaming of You fell to number {{three on the}} Billboard 200 chart, and {{remained}} there for two consecutive weeks. Sales of Dreaming of You continued to decrease, falling to number six in its fourth week. In its fifth week, Dreaming of You dropped to number eight. Starting in its sixth week, the album remained in the top twenty of the Billboard 200 chart. On the week ending October 28, 1995, sales of Dreaming of You rose 18% after an eighteen-week decline. This {{was followed by the}} highly publicized murder trial. The album remained on the Billboard 200 chart for forty-four consecutive weeks, exiting the chart at number 181 on the week ending June 1, 1996. Lannert predicted Dreaming of You would remain atop the Latin music charts until Selena's next posthumous release. It remained at number one for forty-two consecutive weeks until Enrique Iglesias displaced it with his self-titled debut album on the week ending May 25, 1996. Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>went</b> on to become the best-selling Latin and Latin pop album of 1995 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant <b>you</b> <b>went</b> in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

500|$|Even though Besman had his {{own record}} label, Sensation Records, he {{licensed}} [...] "Boogie Chillen'" [...] to Los Angeles-based Modern Records. [...] On November 3, 1948, it was released nationally and Hooker commented on its immediate appeal: [...] "The thing caught afire. [...] It was ringin' all around the country. [...] When it come out, every juke box <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to, every place <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to... they were playing it there". [...] Because of the response, Nashville, Tennessee, radio station WLAC, a 50,000 watt clear-channel station that reached fifteen states and Canada, played the song ten {{times in a row}} during one broadcast night. [...] It entered the Billboard Race Records chart on January 8, 1949, where it remained for eighteen weeks, and reached number one on February 19, 1949. It became the most popular race record of 1949 and reportedly sold [...] "several hundred thousand" [...] to one million copies. [...] In an experience similar to Muddy Waters' 1950 hit [...] "Rollin' Stone", the song's popularity allowed Hooker to give up his factory job and concentrate on music.|$|E

500|$|Selznick {{liquidated}} his {{corporation in}} the early 1940s but returned to independent producing in 1943.

[...] Selznick ceased his independent productions in 1948. Beginning with Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), he entered into a period of co-producing motion pictures with other filmmakers. [...] In 1954, he made his sole venture into television with the production Light's Diamond Jubilee. Selznick retired from filmmaking after producing an adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms (1957).|$|E

500|$|Australian {{novelist and}} critic Robert Drewe gave a {{positive}} review, praising {{the performance of}} Breuls, the cinematography by Martin McGrath, and director Steven Vidler's choice of such a controversial subject for a first film. Upon noting that the filmmakers deliberately insisted that their characters be portrayed as different from the actual {{people involved in the}} Leigh Leigh murder as possible, Drewe said the film is [...] "asking a lot of Australian audiences to expunge reality from their memories", though he concluded that the film should be [...] "compulsory viewing for all Australian teenagers." [...] Rob Lowing from The Sun-Herald noted that the film belonged to a slew of Australasian films that focused on middle class life and ultimately gave the film 3½ stars out of 4, stating, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to see Romper Stomper, Metal Skin, Idiot Box or Once Were Warriors, this gritty, punchy social drama ably fits into that class." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{noted the}} {{similarities}} between the Iraqi boys and those from Western cultures. Peter Scarlet, the artistic director at the Tribeca Film Festival, said, [...] "What's fascinating about the film that resulted is how very familiar and ordinary these kids are – they're not really all that different from your own teenagers or the kids <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to school with. The kids of Baghdad High also open us up to a very different sense of life in Iraq than what we've been seeing on the nightly news for five years." [...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy. They like to wrestle each other, love Western music, dream big and have trouble buckling down in school." ...|$|E
500|$|... "JJ" [...] {{was filmed}} in November 2008 {{in the same}} {{production}} block as the series' eighth episode, [...] "Effy". Ollie Barbieri did some research to help him in playing JJ, who has Asperger syndrome. He said that, in initial episodes, he played JJ as [...] "quite mad and I jumped around a lot", though by this episode his portrayal was [...] "watered down a bit". Charles Martin shot an unscripted scene that involved Barbieri destroying the set of JJ's bedroom; Martin believed this would help Barbieri to get into JJ's mindset. Barbieri was also able {{to learn more about}} his character by creating the collage in JJ's room himself, in which JJ has tried to organise his thoughts about his friends and his life. Martin said that he and Barbieri had a [...] "very involved director-actor relationship" [...] and that he enjoyed [...] "JJ" [...] the most out of all the episodes he directed in the series. According to runner Laurence Wigfield, JJ's clinic was described in the script as [...] "a desolate shabby place, the kind of place <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to die", with the bracketed suggestion of Fishponds Studio, where the Skins offices are. Though Wigfield initially [...] "couldn't believe" [...] this, the studio was used for filming the scene, which Wigfield admitted [...] "worked quite well". The scene in which JJ and Emily bond after meeting at the clinic was filmed in Bristol's Brandon Hill Park, near Cabot Tower.|$|E

500|$|Following Sellers's death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough {{said that}} Sellers [...] "had the genius {{comparable}} to Chaplin", while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as [...] "a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts {{he gave to}} the world. For them, he is assured of {{a place in the}} history of art as entertainment." [...] Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the Pink Panther films, stated that [...] "Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere <b>you</b> <b>went,</b> the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything". Director Blake Edwards thought that [...] "Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing". Sellers's friend and Goon Show colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers's death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said [...] "I'm shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him"; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, [...] "Anything to avoid paying for dinner". Secombe later declared to journalists [...] "Bluebottle is deaded now". Milligan later said that [...] "it's hard to say this, but he died at the right time." [...] The Daily Mail described Sellers as [...] "the greatest comic talent of his generation as well as a womanising drug-taker who married four times in a fruitless search for happiness", a [...] "flawed genius" [...] who, once he latched on to a comic idea, [...] "loved nothing more than to carry it to extremes".|$|E
500|$|Arnold Wayne Jones {{from the}} Dallas Voice gave the album {{four out of}} five stars, writing that the show [...] "has all of the Material Girl's majesty and fetishistic eroticism, merged with lots of disturbing, violent imagery and a huge catalog of songs". Jones {{concluded}} that Madonna was more provocative than before with the release. Chuck Campbell from The Republic gave the album three and a half stars out of five, writing that [...] "an ambitious woman like Madonna will not let herself become a nostalgia act". He added that Madonna makes that clear every time she goes on tour: [...] "she's living in the moment, and she's all about her newest material." [...] The Advocates review for the release was positive, saying that the DVD affirms the fact that Madonna's [...] "musical reign continues". Entertainment Focus Pip Ellwood felt that the highlights of the record were the live performances of [...] "Human Nature" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". He concluded the review by saying that [...] " [...] Making perfect use of her dancers, the video screens and the sets, the MDNA World Tour is one of [...] most spectacular to date and she still performs with the passion and the energy she always has done. If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to the show then get your copy of this and treat it like a souvenir. If you didn't you need to check it out as it's one of the best shows she's ever done." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic awarded the release three out of five stars, saying that [...] "there are unexpected musical moments that do make MDNA World Tour worth hearing", including the performance of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Like a Prayer". However, he felt that the CD release was unnecessary since the album would be a better experience with its video.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E
