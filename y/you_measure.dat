25|$|This {{has some}} {{interesting}} implications. For starters, Everett {{suggested that the}} universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. To see this, consider an observer measuring the spin of some particle, which previously is in an undetermined state (a superposition of possible spins). When <b>you</b> <b>measure</b> the spin, you may determine it to be up or down. But in fact, there has been a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one where <b>you</b> <b>measure</b> up, and the other where <b>you</b> <b>measure</b> down. Thus, the indeterminacy of the system simply grows and you become a part of it.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} on The Chronic {{was seen as}} innovative and ground-breaking, and received universal acclaim from critics. AllMusic commented on Dr. Dre's efforts, [...] "Here, Dre established his patented G-funk sound: fat, blunted Parliament-Funkadelic beats, soulful backing vocals, and live instruments in the rolling basslines and whiny synths" [...] and that [...] "For the next four years, it was virtually impossible to hear mainstream hip-hop that wasn't affected in some way by Dre and his patented G-funk." [...] Unlike other hip hop acts (such as The Bomb Squad) that sampled heavily, Dr. Dre only utilized one or few samples per song. In Rolling Stones The Immortals – The Greatest Artists of All Time, where Dr. Dre was listed at number 56, Kanye West wrote on the album's production quality: [...] "The Chronic is still the hip-hop equivalent to Stevie Wonder's Songs in the Key of Life. It's the benchmark <b>you</b> <b>measure</b> your album against if you're serious." ...|$|E

2500|$|If <b>you</b> <b>measure</b> {{the three}} qubits, you will observe a three-bit string.
