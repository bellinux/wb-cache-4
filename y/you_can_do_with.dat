In 2010, he reappeared at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a Christmas concert special. In 2012, it was announced he would again appear at the Proms with the John Wilson Orchestra in a concert celebrating Broadway musicals. Regarding his musical passion, MacFarlane has said, [...] "I love and am fascinated by exciting orchestration—what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a band that size—and I think in many ways it's a lost art." [...] MacFarlane's sound of music is predominantly traditional pop, easy listening, jazz, vocal, vocal jazz, show tunes, swing, and big band He will occasionally use musical comedy for either his shows or movies.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] on her Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). The {{song was}} the penultimate track {{on the tour}} setlist, before the show's encore, [...] "Holiday". For the performance, Madonna invited {{a member of the}} audience to join her during the song, and while dancing with them and playfully spanking the guest, she finished the performance giving a banana as a [...] "gift". The first guest during the opening night in Montreal, Quebec, Canada was the song's producer Diplo. The singer turned him around and simulated insertion of the fruit, while saying: [...] "There’s so many things <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a banana." [...] Other celebrities given bananas by Madonna during the performance of [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] included Ariana Grande, Amy Schumer, Nelly Furtado, Anderson Cooper, Graham Norton and Katy Perry, who was called the [...] "Best Unapologetic Bitch Ever" [...] by Madonna.|$|E
500|$|Rubin {{encouraged}} a [...] "back to basics" [...] approach and wanted {{the group to}} bring finished songs to the studio. This approach conflicted with U2's freeform recording style, by which they improvised material in the studio. The Edge said, [...] "we sort of hadn't really finished the songs. It's typical for us, because it's {{in the process of}} recording that we really do our writing." [...] Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "once we have a song, we're interested in the atmospherics and the tones and the overdubs and the different stuff <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it... things that Rick was not in the slightest bit interested in. He was interested in getting it from embryonic stage to a song that could be mixed and put on a record." [...] They ultimately decided to shelve the material recorded with Rubin, but expressed interest in revisiting it in the future.|$|E
500|$|The rhythmic {{direction}} of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects, including repeated whirring and grinding sounds. Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard, making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies. He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance, [...] "whether we were in space, or underwater {{or a group of}} Africans playing—just different soundscapes". Onstage, he also had a table set up holding a mbira, claves, agogo bells, and several other hand percussion instruments, which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop. [...] "I would hit them just like they do at [...] fights!", Cosey recalled. His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine, as during the [...] "Ife" [...] segment. Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha, the Japanese tour's sponsor, and told him [...] "see what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Rather than use it to create rhythms, Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, creating a sound he said was [...] "total tapestry".|$|E

2500|$|Work on Lightning {{was done}} between January 1 and July 2012, in Matt and Kim's old {{apartment}} on Grand Street in Brooklyn, New York. The album was written and recorded using the music production software Logic Pro. The 10 tracks of Lightning were pared from 25-26 songs originally {{written for the}} album, which Matt Johnson said that [...] "it gave us [...] {{a lot more to}} choose from, which let Kim and I really broaden this album out." [...] He {{said in an interview that}} the group [...] "felt there was a lot going on in the songs" [...] on their album Sidewalks. [...] "In a way, the safest thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a song is to make it have a lot of stuff. The more you put on, the less the actual songwriting is exposed. For the new album , I was excited to do as little possible to the songs production-wise and still have them be strong." [...] He also said that the album's recording location [...] "was a nice farewell" [...] to the apartment.|$|E
2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not really sure if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 Matson began a decades-long {{separation}} from the Beats. The seeds were evident in a discussion with Ginsberg, when Matson asserted that [...] "Every user is a pusher." [...] Ginsberg countered, [...] "That isn’t literally true," [...] {{at least in the}} eyes of the judicial system. Matson's experience, especially with Huncke and Erin Black, led him to question the Beats’ elitism and their patriarchal, anti-feminist bias. Moving away from the bias that savage aspects are at the apex of our personalities, showed Matson the larger landscape. At Huncke's Memorial in 1996, Matson addressed Huncke's impulse that [...] "the only thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the pain inside is medicate it. That's shitty, Herb." [...] Gregory Corso complained Matson was criticizing Beat behavior, and Matson replied that other options were available. [...] Matson had become by then an avid participant in 12-step programs. Matson's most influential teachers, besides poetry and Huncke, were women. [...] "I am a person!" [...] Erin Black proclaimed in 1964, with proto-feminist exactness. Eila Kokkinen, who was conversant with the Beats, provided a balanced perspective and included psychoanalytic insights. Relationships with Martha Muhs, Maggie Clougherty, and Phyllis Ideal, and the general atmosphere of the 1970s engendered the sense that whatever strategies worked for Matson needed to include women. [...] The strategies needed to work for women, also. Fundamental threads prevail throughout Matson's work: the urge to honesty and to give messages from the body first regard. The stage was set, through training with the Beat Generation, for the development of his writing and of his career. Matson's evolution points directly toward his recent conception of [...] "Paleo Poetry" [...] and the primitive heart.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complement}} the gameplay, distinctive, stylistic visuals were decided upon {{and carried out}} through the CANVAS graphics engine. Adding a touch of fantasy to the mix, the development team hoped {{to be able to}} garner attention from gamers who did not play games with similar settings but more realistic combat. The use of a warm color palette took emphasis away from the [...] "grotesque, realistic nature of war itself," [...] as Nonaka had stated, and focused instead on the characters and story. Tanaka added that, [...] "we wanted to show that realism isn't the only thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> 3D graphics." [...] The character designs for the game were created by Raita Honjou, who, {{along with the rest of}} the development staff, aimed for a look that was described by 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish as [...] "rustic." [...] In early stages designs drew more directly on examples from World War II, however they proved to be too modern for what the team wanted to achieve. Thus, Raita aimed for a motif closer to that found in World War I, first creating Alicia and Welkin's concept illustrations and using them as a basis for the rest of the Gallian cast. World War II influence can still be seen in the designs of Imperial characters such as Gregor, whose uniform is heavily based on German officers' uniforms from that period. The end result of these efforts was described by Japanese director Mamoru Oshii as giving him [...] "an impression similar to ... the Nausicaä manga," [...] and Nonaka admits to aiming for the style found in World Masterpiece Theater.|$|E
2500|$|McCreight {{prevented}} a {{confrontation between the}} 7th Cavalry Regiment and aggrieved Ojibwe from Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. In 1885, a band of 100–150 of Chief Little Shell’s Ojibwe warriors left the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation and came to Devils Lake on a Sunday morning before day break while the town was sleeping. The Ojibwe were in a serious dispute with the U.S. government and were angry because white settlers were breaking treaties, stealing Indian timber and killing Indian game. They came to Devils Lake to protest, determined to right a grievance and threatening the settlers. [...] McCreight was the “Indian Man” in Devils Lake, and his roommate doctor woke him before sunrise saying: [...] "Get up quick, the Indians are out there; they are holding a war-dance; they mean devilment and will burn the town; hurry, and see what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> them!" [...] McCreight was sympathetic to Ojibwe grievances and understood their anger and frustration. He immediately went to the Ojibwe camp, parleyed with Little Shell and eventually persuaded the natives to return to Turtle Mountain. McCreight reported, “ It was all over before the town folks stirred about after their late Sunday morning breakfast; and over their own late breakfast, the doctor and the writer decided it best to say nothing, to avoid publicity, for it might interfere with business, and perhaps bring the wrath of General George Armstrong Custer's troops at the fort, against the suffering natives, and so the incident was closed and soon forgotten — forgotten except for the life-long humiliation at failure of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to intercede for and {{protect the rights of}} these abused natives.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, {{leading up to the}} point that you betray her and do the most intimate act <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
