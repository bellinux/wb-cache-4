25|$|One likely {{reason for}} the {{relatively}} few Japanese words for 'fool' is vagueness. In both English and Japanese, the words for 'fool' have meanings that vary along scales of friendly-hostile, or joking-serious. In English, {{at one end of}} a scale are words like silly goose and at the other end are words like stupid asshole. And in Japanese, at one end are words like kamaboko baka 蒲鉾馬鹿 'silly chump' and at the other end are words like baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 'damn fool'. The difference is in the degree of lexical diversification along the scales of meaning. English seems to have more 'fool' words with more specificity – Japanese seems to have fewer 'fool' words with more vagueness. There are decided pragmatic and communicative advantages to such lexical vagueness. If you call me a stupid son-of-a-bitch, I know exactly what you mean. But if you call me a baka-yarō, I cannot be so sure of what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>The</b> expression baka-yarō 馬鹿野郎 {{is one of the most}} insulting terms in the Japanese lexicon, but it is vague and can range in meaning from an affectionate 'silly-willy' to an abusive 'jerk-off fool'. Baka-yarō is so widely used that it has become semantically weak and vague. Such vagueness can serve to conceal hostility and thus to maintain social harmony.|$|E
500|$|During his {{childhood}} and adolescence, Divine was called [...] "Glenn" [...] by {{his friends and}} family; as an adult, he used the stage name [...] "Divine" [...] as his personal name, telling one interviewer that both [...] "Divine" [...] and [...] "Glenn Milstead" [...] were [...] "both just names. Glenn is the name I was brought up with, Divine is the name I've been using for the past 23 years. I guess it's always Glenn and it's always Divine. Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> character Divine or the person Divine? You see, it gets very complicated. There's the Divine you're talking to now and there's the character Divine, which is just something I do to make a living. She doesn't really exist at all." [...] At one point he had the name [...] "Divine" [...] officially recognized, as it appeared on his passport, and {{in keeping with his}} personal use of the name, his close friends nicknamed him [...] "Divy".|$|E
2500|$|She {{asked the}} detective supervising her if this {{woman had been}} {{investigated}} to which he supposedly responded with, [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> LAPD detective." [...] He elaborated that the woman, a former girlfriend of the victim's husband, {{was in fact a}} current LAPD detective but [...] "she's not a part of this". He insisted that the case was simply a burglary as the department had long concluded. No other detective would pursue the case, and the evidence went back into the files.|$|E

2500|$|On March 4, 1948, Walter Winchell named Gallinger {{as one of}} {{the players}} {{involved}} in the gambling scandal. The same day, Montreal sportswriter Dink Carroll spoke with Gallinger after the game between Boston and Montreal. [...] "You probably know what this is about, don't you?" [...] Carroll asks. [...] "Yes, you want to know if I've made any decision about baseball," [...] Gallinger answered. Carroll informed Gallinger that Winchell had just named him as the Boston player involved. [...] "Winchell", said Gallinger. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> fellow in New York?" [...] Initially Gallinger appeared too bewildered to comment, but eventually denied the accusations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> guitar's out of tune? What do you mean I have to be there at 11? What do you mean I can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really do seem to be taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, it sounds as if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E

2500|$|Achong {{is better}} known for playing cricket. He was mainly a bowler. His stock ball was left-arm {{orthodox}} spin (left-arm finger spin), {{but one of his}} variations was unorthodox left-arm spin. After bowling this variation to have Walter Robins stumped at Old Trafford in 1933, it is reputed that Robins said to the umpire Joe Hardstaff Sr., [...] "fancy being done by a bloody Chinaman". Learie Constantine is said to have replied: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> bowler or the ball?" [...] An unorthodox left-arm spin delivery (spinning from the off side to the leg side for a right-handed batsman) is known as a [...] "chinaman" [...] as a result. However, Achong was not the earliest recorded Test match player to bowl unorthodox left-arm spin – that is believed to be Charles Llewellyn of South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|However, its {{continued}} rapid expansion {{meant that it}} had outgrown its new premises by the 1920s, requiring yet another move. A large parcel of land in Bloomsbury near the British Museum was acquired from the Duke of Bedford and Charles Holden was appointed architect with the instruction to create a building [...] "not to suggest a passing fashion inappropriate to buildings which will house an institution of so permanent a character as a University." [...] This unusual remit may {{have been inspired by}} the fact that William Beveridge, having just become director of LSE, upon asking a taxi driver {{to take him to the}} University of London was met with the response [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>the</b> place near the Royal School of Needlework". Holden responded by designing Senate House, the current headquarters of the university, and at the time of completion the second largest building in London.|$|E
