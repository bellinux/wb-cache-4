6000|$|ERNEST. Gilbert, you bewilder me. You {{have told}} me that all art is, in its essence, immoral. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> now that all thought is, in its essence, dangerous? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> Paul, about the--the--subject we {{were talking}} of on our way here?" [...] asked Fred, who was still devoting much of his {{attention}} to a deer's rib.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who are {{the good}} grown-up people?" [...] asked Felix suddenly, forgetting {{that he was in}} church.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{say your}} comrades {{know nothing of}} your family history?" [...] she had said {{to him on the}} journey thither. [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I s'pose I can't get {{clear of}} it then," [...] said Davy with a sigh. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Marilla and Mrs. Lynde on me, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{wear one}} too,' said the captain, {{pointing}} to the pin in his necktie. 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that I am a traitor to the flag, sir? I warn you Professor, to be careful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought so. There was a {{dishonesty}} {{about your}} dear eyes {{which has never}} been there before, and love-making and dishonesty are inseparable as coupled hounds. Up comes man, and away goes innocence. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> anything about him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to know me you would feel none of this," [...] she said. [...] "We don't know each other--we've always been--interrupted.... Were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this that day my aunts came?" [...] she asked, recollecting the whole scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "What were <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me?" [...] said I, smiling, for I saw {{she wanted}} to go on. [...] "You have roused my curiosity, and now you must gratify it." ...|$|R
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN. Don't be goin' {{out there}} till I tell you, you imp! I must speak {{to your father}} first. (Coming closer to him and {{lowering}} her voice.) Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her about it? ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Prendergast {{had made}} up his mind that nothing could be gained by soft usage with Mr. Mollett. Indeed nothing could be gained in any way, by any usage, unless it could be shown that Mollett and Talbot were not the same person. He could afford {{therefore}} to tell the scoundrel that he was a scoundrel, and to declare against him--war to the knife. The more that Mollett trembled, the more abject he became, the easier would be the task Mr. Prendergast now had in hand. [...] "Well, sir," [...] he continued, [...] "are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what business has brought you here to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as you're bid, will you, {{and give}} me the whisky. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> when I'm to eat and when I'm to drink, like a child?" [...] This he said in that tone of voice which made Mrs. Moulder know that he meant to be obeyed; and though she was sure {{that he would make}} himself drunk, she was {{compelled}} to minister to his desires. She got the whisky and hot water, the lemon and sugar, and set the things beside him; and then she retired to the sofa. John Kenneby the while sat perfectly silent looking on. Perhaps he was considering whether {{he would be able to}} emulate the domestic management of Dockwrath or of Moulder when he should have taken to himself Mrs. Smiley and the Kingsland brick-field.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our liturgy," [...] {{observed}} Crawford, [...] "has beauties, {{which not}} even a careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; {{but it has also}} redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt. For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I ought to be" [...] (here was a glance at Fanny); [...] "that nineteen times out of twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to have it to read myself. Did you speak?" [...] stepping eagerly to Fanny, and addressing her in a softened voice; and upon her saying [...] "No," [...] he added, [...] "Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not allow my thoughts to wander. Are not <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so?" ...|$|E
5000|$|BMX Plus!: [...] "When {{you were}} interviewed by BMX PLUS! last year you said <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> retire {{at the end}} of 1979. In fact you said <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> retire every year since 1976. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us the same thing this year?"Thomsen: (Laughing) [...] "I always say that. You know me."—BMX Plus! January 1981 ...|$|R

5000|$|She {{became a}} member of a girl group named G.L.A.M. in 2009, and later joined B.C.G., another girl group. She filmed a music video as part of G.L.A.M. for a song titled [...] "JellyBean" [...] in 2009. During this time, Gomez also began {{recording}} herself singing and rapping songs using Garageband, and created a YouTube account to post covers of popular songs online. She also began writing her own songs, and by the age of thirteen had taught herself how to play guitar. Gomez befriended production duo The Jam when she was thirteen, who liked Gomez's written work. The trio began working on material together, resulting in the covers of the songs [...] "Otis" [...] (2011), [...] "Lighters" [...] (2011), [...] "Novacane" [...] (2011) and Take Care (2011). These songs were meant {{to be part of a}} mixtape, titled @itsbeckygomez, though this project never came to fruition. Her cover of [...] "Otis" [...] caught the attention of renowned producer Dr. Luke, who had worked with artists including Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus, among others. Luke scheduled a meeting with Gomez, and asked her to play guitar for him; he later signed her to his Kemosabe Records record label, through RCA Records. In reference to her video clip for [...] "Otis", Luke claimed [...] "I would have signed her off that video alone. I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, 'This is even better.' Then I found out she could write and it was like, 'What else are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> that you’re also Van Gogh?' Her potential is limitless." [...] Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't look so ashamed," [...] he said, smiling faintly. [...] "I'm {{not afraid}} of him. What is it <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No you won't. That drink was {{for you if}} {{you went}} ashore. If <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me the island, you must do it in your sober senses." ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[With a laugh.] There you go kiddin' again. [Then {{seeing his}} hurt expression--quickly.] But <b>you</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about yourself. You're Irish, of course I can tell that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh! I knew that," [...] {{retorted}} Jenny Wren. [...] "What do {{you suppose}} my eyes are make for? I thought <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me something I didn't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Maraton," [...] he said, [...] "now I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you</b> this question. To-morrow {{you go to}} Manchester to {{pronounce}} your doctrines. To-morrow <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> incite the working people of England practically <b>to</b> revolt. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them that it is for posterity they must strike? Do you mean, when you thunder at them from the platforms, <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them the truth?--to tell them that the good which you promise is not for them nor for their children, nor their children's children, but for the unborn generations? Do you mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The old gentleman did not reply, but began {{switching}} at some invisible dandelions. 'What {{you tell}} me,' he said presently, 'reminds {{me of my}} Aunt Amanda. She was a fine woman, and she had two lovers.' ('You little round-faced scamp!' thought Miss Amanda. 'Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> that child all my love-affairs? And {{what do you know}} about them, anyway? I never confided in you. You were nothing but a boy, although you were a very inquisitive one, always wanting to know things, and what you have found out is beyond me to imagine.') ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me, ma'am," [...] he said; [...] "I must remind you that <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me your secrets, without any wish to intrude on them on my part--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jenny, however, is less hostile than he expected, {{and though}} he feels awkward and tends {{to run away from}} her, she {{actually}} invites him to walk with her to her home. Hesitantly he says: [...] "But you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> aren't <b>you?</b> Aren't <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what we did to you?" [...] Jenny does not answer, but before going into her home she briefly touches his hand and afterwards gives him a look over her shoulder from the door. The story ends with Jack <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> his own home, saying to himself over and over again: [...] "Jenny won't tell, Jenny won't tell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, he wouldn't. Nobody would {{suppose that}} anybody would pick {{me out for}} this kind of thing. If I'd known that <b>you</b> were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me such a story as this I wouldn't have come with you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{interrupted}} Old Man Coyote. [...] "It {{was handed}} down from your greatest-great-grandfather, {{who lived in the}} days when the world was young and what <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me about happened. Isn't that it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is of no}} use my {{thinking}} about it, Mary," [...] Mr. Armstrong said, resignedly, [...] "especially as I suppose <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> me. I have made one suggestion, {{and it seems that}} it is incorrect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She merely smiled, {{and went}} on: 'And I {{should not have}} told you of my {{engagement}} if I had not {{thought it would be}} safer to do so, considering the story <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> your husband.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Many Presbyterians were {{angered by}} what they felt was a loss of liberty in worship and criticized [...] "canned prayers." [...] In the General Assembly meeting to approve the book, one {{commissioner}} threw the book {{across the room and}} said, [...] "Faugh! It smells of priestcraft." [...] Another speaker responded, [...] "This is not van Dyke's prayer book. It belongs to every member of the committee you appointed. It is not a liturgy. It's not a ritual. It does not contain 'canned' prayers. It contains great live prayers of our fathers. Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the man who wants to use this book that he can't have it?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Watch Tower {{spokesman}} Donald T. Ridley says neither elders nor HLC {{members are}} instructed or encouraged to probe into {{the health care}} decisions of Witness patients and do not involve themselves in patient hospitalisations unless patients request their assistance. Yet Watchtower HLC representative David Malyon says he would respond to [...] "sin" [...] of Witnesses he is privy to by effectively saying [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them or shall I!" [...] Nevertheless Ridley says Muramoto's suggestion that Witnesses {{should be free to}} disregard Watch Tower scriptural teachings and standards is preposterous. He says loving God means obeying commandments, not disobeying them and hiding one's disobedience from others.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{the truth}} as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done to old Wilkins. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Jane, {{you should}} not be so cross,' cried Clara, 'when it is your own Jemmy, come on purpose to help and comfort us all! <b>You</b> are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Uncle Oliver, and make him glad to see him, as you know you are.' ...|$|R
