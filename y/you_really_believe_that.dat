2500|$|In mid-summer, MacDonell {{personally}} visited Shahumyan's home in Baku {{and the two}} {{discussed the}} issue of British military involvement in a generally amiable conversation. Shahumyan first raised the specter of what British involvement would entail: [...] "Is your General Dunsterville [...] coming to Baku to turn us out?" [...] MacDonell reassured him that Dunsterville, {{being a member of}} the military, was not claiming any political stake in the conflict but was merely interested in helping him defend the city. Unconvinced, Shahumyan replied, [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a British general and a Bolshevik commissar would make good partners....No! We will organise our own force to fight the Turk." ...|$|E
6000|$|JULIA (doubtfully). Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I {{am not the}} shallow, jealous, devilish {{tempered}} creature {{they all}} pretend I am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are an {{even greater}} pessimist than I myself," [...] Norgate observed. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the {{position}} is so critical?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe,</b> mother, <b>that</b> {{every one}} who is born into the world is sent for a purpose, and with a {{specific}} work to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O grandpapa, {{that is not}} fair! Indeed, <b>you</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that.</b> O, say <b>you</b> don't!" [...] And Beatrice's {{black eyes}} were full of tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{told you}} the truth," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Playmore, [...] "because he was cunning enough {{to see that the}} truth would help him in irritating your suspicions. <b>You</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> he shared your suspicions?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Worthless!" [...] she repeated. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it, father. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Thain {{would do}} you an ill turn like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Britt, {{looking into}} her clear eyes, {{acquired}} a new confidence in her. [...] "Tell me, Miss Lambert, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> your father {{comes to you}} in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the {{mutilated}} remains {{which you}} discovered this morning are {{the remains of}} our brother?' he asked. 'And {{do you believe it}} on such evidence as this?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Halsey," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} out to lunch. At least, I wish it to be thought that I am {{going out to}} lunch. As a matter of fact, I shall return in about ten minutes by the back way. I do not wish you, however, to know this. I {{want you to have}} it in your mind that I have gone to lunch and shall not be back until a quarter past two. If there are {{visitors}} for me--Inquirers of any sort--act exactly as you would have done if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> I was not in the building." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope what I may say {{need not}} be kept a secret long. You joke with me about Miss Baker; but <b>you</b> cannot <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> my {{affections}} are placed there? You must, I think, have guessed by this time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, Miss Dacre, <b>you</b> cannot indeed <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> this vulgar ruffian, this grim scarecrow, this Guy Faux, was--was--myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whom do {{you take}} me for?' she exclaimed angrily. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> it was just for the {{pleasure}} of talking that I gave you the advice you have neglected so abominably?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Le Drieux," [...] said Arthur; [...] "let us {{be honest}} with one another, now that the thing is settled and {{diplomacy}} is uncalled for. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jones is Jack Andrews?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you believe, in {{your secret}} soul, Agatha--I take {{the liberty of}} using your Christian name because I wish to be very solemn--do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> any human being was ever unselfish enough to love another in the story-book fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My friends, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>that</b> kingdom, {{and in that}} King? Do you <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are now {{actually}} in a kingdom of heaven, which cannot be moved; and that the living, acting, guiding, practical, real King thereof is Christ who died on the Cross? ...|$|R
60|$|You {{must believe}} this much about yourselves {{before you can}} believe more. You must fairly and <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> GOD made <b>you</b> one thing before you can <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you have made yourselves another thing. <b>You</b> must <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not mere {{machines}} and animals, but immortal souls, before <b>you</b> can <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have sinned; for animals cannot sin--only reasonable souls can sin. We must <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God made us at bottom in His likeness, before {{we can begin to}} find out that there is another likeness in us besides God's--a selfish, brutish, too often a devilish likeness, which must be repented of, and fought against, and cast out, that God's likeness in us may get the upper hand, and we may be what God expects us to be. We must know our dignity before we can feel our shame. We must see how high {{we have a right to}} stand, that we may see how low, alas! we have fallen.|$|R
6000|$|... "He talks {{as if it}} were a real thing!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "George, <b>you</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saw {{somebody}} in the summer-house? The place was empty. I tell you positively, when you pointed into the summer-house, the place was empty. You have been thinking and thinking of this woman till you persuade yourself that you have actually seen her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Isabel," [...] I said, {{after it}} was all over, and Mrs. Deering had {{vanished}} in a mist of happy tears, [...] "I suppose {{this is what you}} call perfectly providential. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Miss Gage didn't send her back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "we are in London, {{alone in}} a taxicab, secure against any {{possible}} eavesdropping. You preach the advantage of our Kaiser-led country. Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Kaiser is the man for the task which is coming?" ...|$|E
60|$|And I say again, as I {{said last}} Sunday, {{that this is}} a spiritual question, a Gospel sermon; for by your conduct in this matter will your faith in the Gospel be proved. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Jesus Christ came down from heaven and {{sacrifice}}d Himself for you, you will be ready to sacrifice yourselves in this matter for those for whom He died; to sacrifice, without stint, your thought, your time, your money, and your labour. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> He is the sworn enemy of all misery and disease, you will show yourselves too the sworn enemies of everything that causes misery and disease, and work together like men to put all pestilential filth and damp out of this parish. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> you are all brothers, equal in the sight of God and Christ, you will do all you can to save your brothers from sickness and the miseries which follow it. If <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> your children are God's children, that at baptism God declares your little ones to be His, you will be ready to take any care or trouble, however new or strange it may seem, to keep your children safe from all foul smells, foul food, foul water, and foul air, that they may grow up healthy, hearty, and cleanly, fit to serve God as christened, free, and civilised Englishmen should in this great and awful time, the most wonderful time that the earth has ever seen, into which it has pleased God of His great mercy to let us all be born.|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. 'You {{are very}} clever, Alice, but do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{this is no}} shock to you? Oh, woman, why has this {{deception}} not struck you to the ground?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} done, O my people! And {{now that we}} have {{finished}} with these dogs, I have another word to say to you. You may have thought or heard that I was too fond of them, and especially of one of them," [...] and she glanced toward Oliver. [...] "Well, there are certain dogs who will not work unless you pat them on the head. Therefore I patted this one on the head, since, after all, he is a clever dog who knows things that we do not know; for instance, how to destroy the idol of the Fung. O great Abati, can any of <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> I, of the ancient race of Solomon and Sheba, I, the Child of Kings, purposed to give my noble hand to a vagrant Gentile come hither for hire? Can <b>you</b> <b>really</b> have <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> I, the solemnly betrothed to yonder Prince of Princes, Joshua, my uncle, would for a moment even in my heart have preferred to him such a man as that?" [...] And once again she looked at Oliver, who made a wild motion, as though he were about to speak. But before he could so much as open his lips Maqueda went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, I {{want you}} to tell me this," [...] Basil Ransom said, leaning forward towards Verena, with his hands on his knees, and {{completely}} oblivious to his hostess. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> all <b>that</b> pretty moonshine you talked last night? I could have listened to you for another hour; but I never heard such monstrous sentiments, I must protest--I must, as a calumniated, misrepresented man. Confess you meant it as a kind of reductio ad absurdum--a satire on Mrs. Farrinder?" [...] He spoke in a tone of the freest pleasantry, with his familiar, friendly Southern cadence.|$|R
6000|$|... "In the idiom of this country, Countess," [...] he said, [...] "I {{raise my}} hat to you. You {{preserve}} your mask of ignorance to the end. So much so, indeed, that I find myself asking do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Germany {{intends to do}} this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{make the best}} you can of your bargain and not expect too much from her. And don't ride over her with a very high horse. And let her have her own way a little if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> she has your {{interest}} at heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{nothing about}} it!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "I wish I had a {{thousand}} tongues {{to talk of}} it. Captain, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Cheddy man is a priest, or what goes for one in his own country? If he is, he ought to marry you and Edna." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dying! my dear wife; {{not a bit}} of it. I am no more dying {{than you}} are. I have been ill, it is true, but that is only because you have fretted me so. The dying was only a little ruse to get your consent. All is fair in love and war, you know; and of course <b>you</b> never <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> in <b>that</b> {{precious}} agreement. That {{was nothing but a}} bit of maidenly shyness, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Sir Wingrave," [...] she said, [...] "you {{have been}} so generous, so kind, and I may not even speak of my gratitude. Don't please think me {{unreasonable}} or ungracious. I can't tell you how I feel, but I must, I must, I must go away. I could not live here any longer now that I know. Fancy {{for a moment that}} I am your sister, or your daughter! Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>really,</b> <b>that</b> she would feel the same? And I think you would wish her to. Don't be angry with me, please." ...|$|R
60|$|Be it so, my friends. I {{only hope}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> do <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> John the Baptist {{did come to}} {{proclaim}} that a Saviour was born into the world--provided only that you remember all the while who that Saviour was. John the Baptist tells you who He was. If you will only remember that, and get {{the thought of it}} into your hearts, you will not be inclined to put any words of your own in place of the prophet Malachi's, or to fancy that you can describe better than Malachi what John the Baptist's work was to be; and that turning the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers, was {{only a small part of}} John the Baptist's work, instead of being, as Malachi says it was, his principal work, his very work, the work which must be done, lest the Lord, instead of saving the land, should come and smite it with a curse.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you expect}} to carry that by going {{out into the streets}} with all the roughs of London, and putting {{yourself}} in direct opposition to the authority of the magistrates? Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the ballot will become {{the law of the land}} any sooner because you incur this danger and inconvenience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Holy step-father, you mean; for a step-father {{he seems}} to prove to merry England. But do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> an old man down in Italy can make a bit of rag conquer by saying a few prayers at it? If I am to believe in a magic flag, give me Harold Hardraade's Landcyda, at least, with Harold and his Norsemen behind it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor dear Percival!" [...] cried Count Fosco, {{looking after}} him gaily, [...] "he {{is the victim}} of English spleen. But, my dear Miss Halcombe, my dear Lady Glyde, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> crimes cause their own detection? And you, my angel," [...] he continued, turning to his wife, who had not uttered a word yet, [...] "do you think so too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord Marcus, I came to show <b>you</b> one. Nobody <b>really</b> <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{of all men}} {{failed in}} your duty out there in Jerusalem. Why, the thing is absurd, as even those carpet-captains before whom you were tried knew well. Still, your {{position}} is most awkward. There is evidence against you--of a sort. Vespasian will not interfere, for he is aware that this is some private matter of Domitian's, and having had one quarrel with his son over the captive, Pearl-Maiden, he does not wish for another over the man who bought her. No, he will say--this prefect {{was one of the}} friends and officers of Titus, let Titus settle the affair as it may please him when he returns." ...|$|R
5000|$|Salant {{did try to}} {{kill the}} documentary, but stories about it began {{appearing}} in the trade press, putting CBS into a potentially embarrassing situation were it not to air. In mid-1965, Salant gave Peters the go-ahead to complete the episode. Peters worked with the New York chapter of the Mattachine Society to secure interviews with two additional gay subjects, Lars Larson and Jack Nichols, {{both of whom were}} fully accepting of their sexuality. Nichols later recalled his encounter with Wallace: [...] After we finished and the camera was turned off, Mike Wallace sat down with me and talked for about half an hour. He said, [...] "You know, you answered all of my questions capably, but I have a feeling <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> homosexuality is as acceptable as you make it sound." [...] I asked him why he would say that. [...] "Because," [...] he said, [...] "in your heart I think you know it's wrong." [...] It was infuriating. I told him I thought being gay was just fine, but that in his heart he thought it was wrong. [...] Peters added more footage of psychiatrists espousing that model along with scenes from the 1965 convention of the East Coast Homophile Organizations. CBS gave final approval to [...] "The Homosexuals" [...] and scheduled it to air in the spring of 1966.|$|R
40|$|You {{are likely}} reading this {{wondering}} what possible relationship zombies could have to law libraries, much less collection development policy and process. <b>You</b> see, I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the zombies are honing in on a fundamental truth of librarianship {{that is often}} neglected. Of course the library’s holdings are important, {{but it is the}} human capital behind the collection that makes all the difference in achieving excellence in service. It is the experienced minds of those librarians responsible for selecting, weeding, cataloging and connecting users with the materials in the collection that take the library from being a mere repository of information to being a living, breathing, full-service place of wonder. Of all the collection development tools I have used in my quest to build a better collection, the most vital tool has been the wealth of knowledge, experience and ideas found in the incredible minds of my colleagues...|$|R
