2500|$|Around 1890, Bion {{invested}} $3,000 in a phosphate mining {{enterprise that}} promised {{a return of}} $100,000 in three months time. When he lost the entire amount, he never again speculated, and applied that same principle at Barnett Bank. He was fond of telling people, [...] "It is not the things you don't know that get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> It is the things {{you think you know}} for sure that get you in trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It IS right!" [...] {{he cried}} lightly. [...] "I {{am not going}} to see a woman whom I feel so tenderly for as I do for <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> without trying to help her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is your wish, Essper?" [...] {{continued}} Vivian, in {{a kinder}} tone. [...] "If {{there be any}} service that I can do you, you will not find me backward. Are <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble?</b> you surely are not in want?" ...|$|E
60|$|Your several despatches received. You {{should call}} on General Halleck. Telegraph him at once. I have telegraphed him that <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I did. Your sister told me something; all she knew, perhaps, but not enough. Anyhow, <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{about money}} and I promised to help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw <b>you</b> was <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> miss, and I came to help you. My husband {{wanted to}} come, {{but he has}} the {{rheumatism}} and I wouldn't let him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, you don't," [...] Joe {{interrupted}} hotly. [...] "When I leave I 'm {{not going}} to leave <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> on my account. So don't you try anything like that. I 'll get away, never fear, and if I can figure it out I want you to come along too; come along anyway, and figure it out afterward. What d' you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] said Mr. Custer, [...] "that I {{had gone}} down after my guns. Why didn't you tell me, in the first place, that I was a king, and that I might get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> if you were found with me? Why, they may even take me for an emperor or a mikado--who knows? And then {{look at all the}} trouble we'd be in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beat it or I'll run <b>you</b> <b>in.</b> <b>Trouble</b> {{with you}} is, you old hag, you don't {{appreciate}} a nice quiet little chap like Wrenn, {{and you try}} to bully him--and him here for years. Get out or I'll put you out. I'm no lamb, and I won't stand for any of your monkey-shines. Get out. This ain't your room; he's rented it--he's paid the rent--it's his room. Get out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if I hear <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> father, I shall come on at once," [...] went on Dan, {{and from}} this {{decision}} his parent could not dissuade him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me be your friend," [...] he pleaded. [...] "Never {{mind what}} has happened, {{or what is}} going to happen. <b>You</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Let me share it with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never met him, and glad I didn't," [...] said Bland, with a grim humor. [...] "So <b>you</b> got <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> {{and had to}} go on the dodge? What kind of trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not think}} to harm you or involve <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> though I hoped to win some small portion of your love, and I had {{something}} to give you in exchange, if beauty and great wealth are really worth anything. But you must go, dear, now, whilst I am brave. I {{hope that you will}} be happy with your Angela. When I see your marriage in the paper, I shall send her this tiara as a wedding present. I shall never wear it again. Go, dear; go quick." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of {{course he}} {{followed}} her; {{but he was}} not so quick after her but that time had been given to her to recover herself. [...] "It is true," [...] she said. [...] "I have the strength of which I tell you. Though I have given myself to you as your wife, I can bear to be divorced from you now,--now. And, my love, though it may sound heartless, I would sooner be so divorced from you, than cling to you as a log that must drag you down under the water, and drown <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> and care. I would;--indeed I would. If you go, of course that kind of thing is over for me. But the world has more than that,--much more; and I would make myself happy,--yes, my love, I would be happy. You need not fear that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'GENTLEMEN: You {{will have}} to go to the state {{legislature}} about that [...] speculation of yours--Congress don't know anything about religion. [...] But don't you hurry to go there, either; because this thing you [...] propose to do out in that new country isn't expedient--in fact, it [...] is ridiculous. Your religious people there are too feeble, in [...] intellect, in morality, in piety in everything, pretty much. You [...] had better drop this--you can't make it work. You can't issue stock [...] on an incorporation like that--or if you could, it would only keep [...] <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> all the time. The other denominations would abuse [...] it, and [...] "bear" [...] it, and [...] "sell it short," [...] and break it down. They [...] would do with it just as they would with one of your silver-mines [...] out there--they would try to make all the world believe it was [...] "wildcat." [...] You ought not to do anything that is calculated to bring [...] a sacred thing into disrepute. You ought to be ashamed of [...] yourselves--that is what I think about it. You close your petition [...] with the words: [...] "And we will ever pray." [...] I think you had better--you [...] need to do it. [...] "'Very truly, etc., [...] "'MARK TWAIN, [...] "'For James W. N-----, U. S. Senator.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he answered, [...] "is not {{my idea of}} friendship. If we are friends, I {{have the}} right to help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> your <b>troubles,</b> {{whatever}} they may be." ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{county seat}} editor says he prefers {{living in a}} small town, where the people will sympathize with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and if you haven't any troubles, they will hunt some up for you! ...|$|E
50|$|Almighty, ever-living God, You give {{strength}} to the weary And new courage {{to those who}} have lost heart.

6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] I {{said to her}} in a low tone, [...] "but I believe that <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Can I help you? Don't be afraid to tell me if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{think only}} of you. And {{the thought that}} you are unhappy overshadows all others. They {{believe that it is}} to them you should have come, if <b>you</b> were <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> instead of coming here." ...|$|R
50|$|One key {{aspect of}} {{gameplay}} was discussed in slight detail. As in the films, Harry Callahan walks {{the line between}} bad cop and psychopath. Players were also to walk that line. The game was to feature reactive AI, both for crooks and cops. While there was no further explanation, it appeared that if the player was soft on crooks, they may not take Harry Callahan seriously. On the other end, excessive force will put <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> with the police chief.|$|E

The advent of social media has {{revolutionized}} the way we communicate as a society, and wireless technologies allow us to do so faster than we ever thought possible. The lines between personal and professional personas have merged into an indistinguishable haze of likes, links, and posts, making transparency an everyday issue...|$|E
40|$|In my {{previous}} column, 1 I talked {{at length about}} pointers; this month {{the focus is on}} references. A reference is an alias to an object. While it is often implemented by the compiler using pointers, that fact is only a distraction, and you should not allow it to confuse you; references and pointers are quite different. A pointer is a variable that holds the address of an object. A reference is an alias for an object. Pointers may be null references may not be null—you can't alias nothing. References must be initialized. You create a reference by writing the type of the target object, followed by the reference operator (&), followed by the name of the reference. Thus, if you already have an integer variable named someInt, you can make a reference to that variable by writing: int &someRef = someInt; This is read as "someRef is a reference to integer and someRef is initialized to refer to someInt, " or more commonly, "someRef is a reference to someInt. " If you ask a reference for its address, it returns the address of its target. That is the nature of references. They are aliases for the target. This can get <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> Eve...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does {{it matter}} to me, lad?" [...] Bartle said: [...] "a night's sleep more or less? I shall sleep long enough, by and by, underground. Let me keep <b>thee</b> company <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> while I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|Violet Wayne {{shook her}} head. “That was pretty, {{but not quite}} sincere,” she said. “In some respects I am older than you—and <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> dear. Perhaps if you told me {{everything}} I could help you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{should know}} {{it better than}} we?" [...] said Don Pedro bitterly, [...] "since {{we have had to}} fly to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> our <b>trouble</b> as to the natural {{protector}} of all who are weak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I will write," [...] she promised. [...] "But I {{think it}} better {{that you should}} forget me. I hope we have not {{involved}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> any <b>trouble</b> with your neighbors or with the coroner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not persecution, Anna," [...] he {{answered}} gently. [...] "Only {{you are the}} woman I love, and <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble.</b> And <b>you</b> are something of a heroine, too. You see, my riddle is solved. I know all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are ridiculous, Kit," [...] {{she said}} gently. [...] "But if <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> about Wolf {{and the men}} in Morocco, go to Jacinta. I think she ought to help. That's all. You mustn't keep me. The others are curious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no use our {{denying it}} to ourselves. It is so. <b>You</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> and <b>you</b> will {{not listen to}} my advice. You leave my house and take {{to the roof of}} a new and an untried friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I say a new friend. Twelve months ago, {{though you}} might call there, you never did more than that--and even that but seldom. They are new friends; and yet, now that <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble,</b> <b>you</b> choose to live with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she said, [...] "that {{you must}} have been very miserable. Above all things, now, {{whatever}} you may have done for your liberty, don't be fainthearted. If <b>you</b> are <b>in</b> <b>trouble</b> or danger <b>you</b> must come to me. You promise?" ...|$|R
