25|$|Neighbouring landowners {{might try}} to {{encroach}} on the town boundaries, or the Marches as they were known, moving them back 100 <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to their own benefit. It {{had to be made}} clear to anyone thinking of or trying to encroach that they dare not do so.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most Indian {{villages and}} towns, the smashan or {{cremation}} ground is not {{situated on the}} periphery of the village. As cremation grounds are seen to be polluting, most Indian smashans are located far from the center of town. Both the Tarapith mandir and smashan are very close (within 100 <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so)</b> to the center of the town and near Dwarka River. It is said that Tara Ma's footprints are preserved in the smashan; this is a common theme in Hinduism, where deities or their especially holy followers are said to leave their footprints in rocks. Many Sadhus and Tantrikas live in the smashan, some with permanent huts as residences. The smashan is filled with dogs, traditionally polluting animals who were said to share food with the Vamamarga saint Bamakhepa, whose samādhi or tomb is located next door to the main Tarapith temple.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Motley {{became the}} second black player voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in his {{hometown}} of Canton. Having played successfully as a fullback and pass blocker on offense and as a linebacker on defense, he is seen {{as one of the best}} all-around players in football history. Blanton Collier, an assistant who took over as the team's head coach after Paul Brown's firing in 1963, said Motley [...] "had no equal as a blocker. He could run with anybody for 30 <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> And this man was a great, great linebacker." ...|$|E
60|$|She could {{distinguish}} {{his dark}} form again a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away. She wanted to escape.|$|R
60|$|And rather quickly, a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart, {{and talking}} of horses, they {{returned}} to the house.|$|R
60|$|Bruce Carmyle stared for {{a moment}} at the <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of French bread which the waiter had placed on the table.|$|R
2500|$|The Lochmaben Stone (...) is a {{megalith}} {{standing in}} a field, nearly a mile west of the Sark mouth on the Solway Firth, three hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> above high water mark on the farm of Old Graitney in Dumfries & Galloway in Scotland. The area {{is also known as}} Stormont. Together with a smaller stone it is all that is left of a stone circle dating back to around 3000BC.|$|E
2500|$|Somewhat later, in 1862, the {{residents}} of Placer County (Auburn, Foresthill) came upon a scheme to build a road from the Foresthill divide to Squaw Valley {{with the intent of}} luring immigrant trains away from Nevada City and into Placerville and neighboring vicinities. George Wharton James, the author, described the road as an ill-fated enterprise: [...] "The grade is frightful. For an hour or more, we go slowly up it stopping every few <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to give our horses breath," [...] James wrote of a ride on the old road a half century after it was built. [...] "It is hard enough for horses to go up this grade but to pull heavily-ladened (sic) wagons - it seems impossible, [...] " [...] he concluded. Later attempts to improve this road or forge other wagon roads not successful.|$|E
60|$|They {{went with}} him a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> Then Carrie gasped at what she saw in the growing light of dawn.|$|E
5000|$|... the punter-to-be's {{lining up}} a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> deeper in {{formation}} than that back's usual position, (sometimes concealed by other backs' lining up deeper too) or going in motion by backpedaling ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{sat down}} upon a boulder and I {{sat on a}} lower slab a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away, and we looked at one another. [...] "It's still unreal," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I could, Sir John. I {{could easily}} hide {{a piece of}} white cotton a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> long in my clothes, scanty as these are, and could {{certainly}} manage, unobserved, to drop it outside the window." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} drew {{up in the}} Albert Road, {{within a}} hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> of Wrayson's own block of flats. The Baroness alighted first.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it is. Stop, driver, stop!" [...] We {{were still}} a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we {{finished}} our journey upon foot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Niel," [...] said Bessie Croft--for she {{was named}} Bessie--when they had painfully limped one hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> [...] "will you think me rude if I ask you a question?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lying flat {{upon his}} face, diagonally across the roadway, was {{the form of}} a man in the blue-and-red uniform of the Belgian army. Maurie backed the {{ambulance}} a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> as Maud sprang out and knelt beside the prostrate form.|$|R
60|$|One day {{we came to}} a halt {{under the}} most {{magnificent}} tree I ever saw. It was a mowano tree, whose trunk consisted of six stems united in one. The circumference a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> from the ground was eighty-four feet-- upwards of nine yards in diameter.|$|R
6000|$|Noises above me, I think, on {{the edge}} of the precipice. Something coming down, oh, how slowly. Something comes, and fumbles about a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away. Then I cry out feebly, and the {{something}} approaches. M. Claude's hearty voice calls out cheerily, [...] "Enfin, le voilà!" [...] and I am saved.|$|R
60|$|There was a rush forward, {{the horn}} of the car sounded, {{everything}} swayed violently to the right for perhaps ten <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> {{and there was a}} report like a pistol-shot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, Dick, {{there is}} a movement; they are getting the guns in {{position}} on that knoll {{a little to the}} right, and a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in front of their tent." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} trolley-car and tramped {{through the mud}} a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> to the school, talking about the time we and Warner walked out there years ago, and the {{pleasant}} time we had.|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{were told}} to run after the snap and just keep going until we heard the passer yell 'hike' <b>or</b> our name. <b>So,</b> I ran and ran. I {{was about to give}} up when I heard Robinson call. I turned and caught the ball a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> short of the goal and went over with it." ...|$|R
60|$|He bowed, folding his arms, {{as if to}} {{make her}} feel safe from him. And when, {{regardless}} of the rain, she began to move on, he walked beside her, a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away, humbly, as though he had never poured out those words or hurt her lips with the violence of his kiss.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{afterwards}} Herb Brackenrigg {{kicked a}} penalty goal for Eastern Suburbs. South Sydney now attacked strongly, and appeared likely to score, but Horrie Miller, intercepting a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{from his own}} line, raced the whole length of the ground and scored a beautiful try behind the posts. Brackenrigg converted, making the scores 7 points to 6 in favour of Eastern Suburbs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> I should say," [...] the {{fisherman}} replied. [...] "We was working behind a boat, {{but we could}} see over it well enough. Presently we saw Master Horton come down, and stand alongside the others.|$|E
6000|$|So {{sure was}} Septimus {{of the cause}} of his {{collapse}} that he did not even trouble to look at the Rectory windows in the hollow near the church two hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> away. He only looked at Anthony, saying: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see that}} boat over there?" [...] he said. [...] "I don't wish to {{overtake}} it at present. Keep a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> behind it, but row inshore {{so that it}} shall not seem that you are following them." ...|$|E
60|$|The chains {{were long}} enough to permit him to move a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> in any {{direction}} and by feeling the walls he found {{he was in a}} small circular room that had no outlet except the passage by which he had entered, and that was now closed by the door of steel. This {{was the end of the}} series of caverns and corridors.|$|R
60|$|Their craft {{was about}} thirty feet long, {{consisting}} {{of a pair of}} parallel canoes, very narrow, and at the distance of a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> lengthwise, united by stout cross-timbers, lashed across the four gunwales. Upon these timbers was a raised plat-form or dais, quite dry; and astern an arched cabin or tent; behind which, were two broad-bladed paddles terminating in rude shark-tails, by which the craft was steered.|$|R
60|$|Eudena {{struck a}} spark and blew at it; it twinkled {{brighter}} and then--went out. At that she cast down flint and firestone and stared blankly. Then she sprang {{to her feet}} and scrambled a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> up the cliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for a moment I do not know, for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple of seconds she had slid back to the ledge again with bleeding hands.|$|R
60|$|Taking every {{precaution}} {{to conceal}} their trail, they rode back, keeping a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> {{to the right}} of the line by which they had come. A quarter of an hour passed, and then Turk gave his growl of warning.|$|E
60|$|He did pass, and, as the impetuous {{and quite}} irresistible {{locomotive}} {{is brought to}} a sudden pause when the appropriate brakes are applied, so was he brought to a sudden halt by Minnie a hundred <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> farther on.|$|E
60|$|We {{were in it}} now, for, as I had hoped, {{the horses}} {{followed}} the mare without hesitation. For the first twenty <b>yards</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> all went well, I heading up the stream. Then suddenly I felt that the mare was swimming.|$|E
60|$|He did not reply, but {{continued}} to walk beside her, just a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> apart from her, turning his steps {{in the direction of}} the gates, toward the Albert Bridge, their nearest way home. She--meekly now, for already she was sorry--turned to look at him. Something in his attitude, the stoop of the shoulders, usually so square and erect, the hands curiously clasped behind his back, told her that her shaft--very thoughtlessly aimed--had struck even deeper than it should.|$|R
50|$|FM Rail, {{shortly before}} its bankruptcy, leased the Mantle Lane Sidings to reduce costs. However, {{it had not}} {{properly}} assessed {{the state of the}} sidings or the work needed to bring them up to spec so only one line was ever used, up {{to the edge of the}} trees. Only one tree was ever felled, to allow a wagon to sit a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> further in. Following FM's demise, all of its stock at Mantle Lane was taken elsewhere for scrap or further use.|$|R
25|$|He {{would run}} towards {{the corner and}} then swiftly turn inwards, running {{parallel}} to the back line, and some ten yards from it. At this point he was pursued probably by three of the opponents, barely keeping up. This continued till he got opposite the further goal post, and then one huge foot was smartly dropped on the ball, stopping it dead, {{and of course the}} pursuers all ran a <b>yard</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> too far, not suspecting the sudden pull up; thus he had a clear shot at the goal.|$|R
