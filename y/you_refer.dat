2500|$|On 8 May 1903, Arkansas Attorney General William G. Whipple {{wrote to}} U.S. Attorney General Philander C. Knox to {{announce}} (and request funding for) {{investigation of a}} “white-capping” case. Whipple wrote that an “inferior class of white men feeling themselves unable to compete [...] with [...] colored [...] tenants [...] combined [...] to [...] drive [...] them [...] out [...] of [...] the [...] country.” Knox approved the investigation, responding that the Department of Justice was “alive [...] to [...] the [...] aggressive attitude of such organized bands as those to which <b>you</b> <b>refer,</b> [...] and determined to meet such emergencies with proper and decisive action”.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Sir Colin Hope stated: [...] "...he {{factory in}} {{question}} was not owned or operated by this Company. It was {{owned and operated by}} a company known as J.W. Roberts Limited ("JWR"). JWR ceased production at that factory in 1958/59, and vacated and sold the premises shortly thereafter. Although JWR continued in business for some time after leaving the Armley site, the company ceased to trade over twenty years ago... I am aware of the various comments and allegations that have been made about JWR's Armley factory, particularly as the source of the contamination to which <b>you</b> <b>refer.</b> Those comments and allegations are not accepted." [...] In the Commons, John Battle responded that he was in possession of correspondence [...] "in which the same T plc sought to convince Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes that, for tax purposes, J.W. Roberts of Armley was still in business {{as an integral part of}} T and should be taken into account when calculating tax reductions. Is it too cynical to suggest that JWR is counted in only for profits, but discounted when it comes to its responsibility for local lives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As to Vaikom, I {{think you}} shall let the Hindus do the work. It is they {{who have to}} purify themselves. You can help by your sympathy and your pen, but not by {{organizing}} the Movement and certainly not by offering Satyagraha. If <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the Congress resolution of Nagpur, it calls upon the Hindu Members to remove the curse of untouchability. Untouchability is the sin of the Hindus. They must suffer for it; they must pay the debt they owe to their suppressed brothers and sisters. Theirs is the shame and theirs must be the glory when they have purged themselves of the black sin. The silent loving suffering of one pure Hindu as such {{will be enough to}} melt the hearts of millions of Hindus, but the sufferings of thousands of non-Hindus on behalf of the untouchables will leave the Hindus unmoved. Their blind eyes will not be opened by outside interference, however well intentioned and generous it may be, for it will not bring home to them their sense of guilt. On the contrary, they would probably hug the sin, all the more, for such interference. All reforms to be sincere and lasting must come from within." ...|$|E

To what conspiracy is it that <b>you</b> <b>refer?</b> I know of none. What is this letter which you say Vitelli wrote me? I take it <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> to the Lord of Citta di Castello.
