The current study investigated the mechanism of dietary supplements of large <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> {{and its effects on}} metabolic syndrome and the hepatic steatosis in male db/db mice. Our data showed that dietary supplements of large <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> and water extract significantly reduced water intake and food consumption, lowered the serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and significantly reduced blood glucose level and increased glucose tolerance in db/db mice when compared to untreated db/db mice. In addition, the dietary supplement of large <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> prevented the fatty liver formation and restored the normal hepatic structure of db/db mice. Furthermore, the dietary supplement of large <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> obviously reduced the lipid synthesis related to gene fatty acid synthase, the sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 and acetyl-CoA carboxylase α, as well as fatty acid synthase and sterol response element-binding protein 1 expression, while the lipid catabolic genes were not altered in the liver of db/db mice. This study substantiated that the dietary supplement of large <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> has potential as a food additive for ameliorating type 2 diabetes-associated symptoms...|$|R

30|$|Green, <b>yellow</b> {{and black}} <b>tea</b> leaves (intact and {{pulverised}} leaves) {{were used for}} extraction by methanol or acidified methanol. Spectrophotometric methods were used for determination of selected parameters. Antioxidant activity was determined in extracts and pulverised tea leaves by application of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrilhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ′azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzthiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid (ABTS) free radicals. For determination of antioxidant activity of the pulverised leaves, ‘QUENCHER’ method was used. The method {{is based on the}} direct treatment of dry sample with free radicals. Extracts obtained by extraction of pulverised tea leaves with acidified methanol had the highest phenolic content (3.823, 4.226 and 6.829  g/kg for green, black and <b>yellow</b> <b>tea,</b> respectively). In methanol extracts, phenol content decreased in order yellow[*]>[*]green[*]>[*]black tea and, in acidified methanol extracts, yellow[*]>[*]black[*]>[*]green tea, regardless of particle size of tea leaves for extraction. Flavonoid and tannin contents followed the same tendency as phenol content. The highest antioxidant activity had acidified methanol extracts of pulverised tea leaves, regardless of used method (DPPH and ABTS). Results of antioxidant activity obtained with ‘QUENCHER’ method were compared with results of acidified methanol extracts. Green and <b>yellow</b> <b>tea</b> had higher antioxidant activity when ‘QUENCHER’ method was used in contrast to the black tea where higher antioxidant activity was determined in extract.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>tea,</b> called huángchá (...) in Chinese and hwangcha (...) in Korean, is a {{rare and}} {{expensive}} variety of tea. It is produced similarly to green tea, but with an added step of being steamed under a damp cloth after partial oxidation, giving the leaves a slightly yellow colouring during the drying process. This process also imparts a mellower and less grassy taste than is found in green teas. The tea is a cross between unoxidized green tea and post-fermented dark tea.|$|R
30|$|White <b>tea,</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>tea,</b> green tea, oolong, pu-erh tea {{and black}} tea are all {{harvested}} {{from the same}} species Camellia sinensis, but are processed differently to attain different levels of oxidation. Fermentation of crushed tea leaves results {{in the production of}} the black tea. This process is characterized by enzymatic oxidation and condensation of polyphenolic compounds generating oligomeric (theaflavins) and polymeric (thearubigins) polyphenols (Ju et al. 2007). Their beneficial effects on health are ascribed to their antioxidant and biomodulating properties. It has been reported that theaflavins are able to inhibit certain types of cancer (Kosińska and Andlauer 2004; Tu et al. 2004; Kundu et al. 2005; Ju et al. 2007; Dvořáková et al. 2010; John et al. 2014; Korir et al. 2014).|$|R

50|$|Fixing or “kill-green” {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} enzymatic {{browning}} of the wilted leaves is controlled through the application of heat. It is held that the longer it takes to fix the leaves, the more aromatic will be the tea. Fixing is carried out via steaming, pan firing, baking or with the use of heated tumblers. Application of steam heats the leaves more quickly that pan firing, as a result of which steamed teas taste ‘green’ and vegetal while the pan-fired ones taste toasty. This procedure is carried out for green <b>teas</b> and <b>yellow</b> <b>teas.</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{knowledge}} that Chinese tea which had started to prevail among China since the Tang dynasty downward had given great influences upon eating and drinking culture all over the world. Various tactics had been tried for cultivation of tea trees and production of tea leaves within China, which results in different production methods for Six Great Teas; Lü Cha (Green Tea), Hong Chag (Red Tea), Qing Cha (Blue Tea), Bai Cha (White <b>Tea),</b> Huang Cha (<b>Yellow</b> <b>Tea)</b> and Hei Cha (Black tea). Green Tea is not fermented, Red Tea is fermented and Blue Tea which is represented by famous Wulongcha is half fermented, while White and <b>Yellow</b> <b>Teas</b> are lightly fermented which {{is also known as}} Later Fermented Tea. In this way, tea has obtained rich variation. In early days, tea trees were planted amongst the lands south of the Yangzi River and it had been considered to be difficult to cultivate them north of that river. Yet, as shown by the recent fact that Laoshan (嶸山) in Qingdao 青島 of Shandong Province, where is located north of Yangzi River, had succeeded in producing Green Tea, a range of areas in China carry out various different methods for Tea production. One of the representatives for such Tea Leaves production and processing is Anhua (安化) Tea in Hunan Province. The inquiry records from its planting to production and processing had been carried in Dagong Bao (大公報； News for Great Public) of 1910 's published in Changsha.

5000|$|The Chinese {{learned to}} process tea in a {{different}} way in the mid-13th century. Tea leaves were roasted and then crumbled rather than steamed. By the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unfermented tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried. This stops the oxidation process which turns the leaves dark and allows tea to remain green. In the 15th century, Oolong tea, where the tea leaves were allowed to partially ferment before pan-frying, was developed. [...] Western taste, however, preferred the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to ferment further. <b>Yellow</b> <b>tea</b> was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.|$|R
