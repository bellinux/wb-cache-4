50|$|The {{worsted count}} {{was only a}} rough {{measurement}} and {{has been replaced by}} more exact methods such as the metric yarn count. However, for fine wool, the memory of the older system survives in the S numbers which have a very rough correspondence to worsted count. In other words, fiber that yielded about 80 worsted hanks is roughly comparable to fiber designated as 80s using the S numbers. The critical difference is that while the worsted number was an indirect measure (and a rough one at that) of <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness,</b> the S number is a direct (and precise) measurement of the thickness of the fiber. The S number of fiber, and hence of yarn, fabric, or garments made of that fiber, is determined using the international standard promulgated by the International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO).|$|E

The next process is to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to strengthen the resulting slubbing such that it can be wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double knitting yarn, the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

40|$|Plain woven Kevlar fabrics {{are widely}} used as body {{protection}} materials. The present study investigated the impact performance of five styles of Kevlar fabrics K 310, K 706, K 720, K 745 and K 779 from Hexcel. The fabrics are different in many aspects, i. e., weight per square meter, yarn counts, yarn size, Kevlar fiber type, friction and breaking strength. Silica nanoparticles were impregnated into the fabric to enhance the ballistic impact performance. The fabric impregnated with nanoparticles exhibit significant enhancement in impact performance over their neat counterparts. Fabrics experience large deformation under impact. More or less yarn pull-out was observed on all the fabrics. The in-plane yarn pull-out force has good correlation to the impact performance: fabrics with higher pull-out force performed better in impact tests. A two-dimensional finite element model was proposed to simulate the single yarn pull-out procedure and predict the maximum pull-out force. The most important fabric features are included in this model: yarn count, <b>yarn</b> size, fabric <b>thickness,</b> <b>yarn</b> waviness, fiber modulus, fiber diameter and coefficients of friction et al. The numerical results show good agreement with the experimentally measured pull-out forces. To understand the impact process, a constitutive model was developed to characterize the nonlinear anisotropic properties of the fabric in large deformation. The nanoparticles largely increase the shear stiffness, while only slightly affect the tension behavior along warp and weft yarn directions. This constitutive model was incorporated in the commercial FEA software ABAQUS through the user-defined material subroutine and used to simulate deformations with various loads. Finally the out-of-plane yarn pull-out force was predicted from the in-plane yarn pull-out results using finite {{element method and the}} proposed constitutive model. ...|$|R

In this paper, a specially constructed rig, which can rotate a yarn at a high speed without inserting any real twist into the yarn, was used to simulate a ring spinning process. Yarn tension was measured at the guide-eye during the simulated spinning of different yarns at various balloon heights and with varying yarn length in the balloon. The effect of balloon shape, <b>yarn</b> hairiness and <b>thickness,</b> and <b>yarn</b> rotating speed, on the measured yarn tension, was examined. The {{results indicate that the}} collapse of balloon shape from single loop to double loop, or from double loop to triple etc, lead to sudden reduction in yarn tension. Under otherwise identical conditions, a longer length of yarn in the balloon gives a lower yarn tension at the guide-eye. In addition, thicker yarns and/or more hairy yarns generate a higher tension in the yarn, due to the increased air drag acting on the thicker or more hairy yarns...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we explore the {{potential}} of X-ray micro-computed tomography (X-ray micro CT) to characterize the microstructural variation of four different 3 D warp-interlaced fabrics. The accuracy of the technique was determined quantitatively by comparing measured values of <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness,</b> width and spacing between the yarns from X-ray micro CT images with measurements obtained from optical micrographs of the same textile. This comparison indicates {{that the difference between}} the two techniques is not statistically significant, lending credence to X-ray micro CT as a means to acquire input for models of textiles and textile composites. Micro-structural variation in a given fabric was found to be quite large (standard deviation of the geometrical parameters up to 16 %). A comparison of similar yarns in different directions and fabrics also resulted in large variations. Variability of the fabric parameters is implemented in a "virtual textile" model of 3 D fabrics. The influence of the variability of the fabric internal geometry on the mechanical properties of the composite is estimated using a micro-mechanical model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Two-dimensional {{woven fabric}} {{composite}} models were {{developed for the}} elastic analysis of WF composites in Part I of this paper. The effect of undulation of <b>yarn</b> and fabric <b>thickness</b> on the elastic properties of woven fabric lamina was studied.

In the present paper, the effect of pp between two adjacent yams on the elastic properties of woven fabric lamina and the effect of laminate configuration for different number of layers on the elastic properties of woven fabric laminates for different material systems are studied. An optimum gap between adjacent yams gives higher Young's moduli, and it depends upon the fabric structure and material system. A basic building block is found which gives higher elastic properties than with any other configuration with the same number of layers. Such a basic building block can then be used for making thicker laminates.

40|$|Woven fabrics {{have found}} {{enormous}} application {{in our daily}} life and in industry because of their flexibility, strength and permeability. The aim of this work {{was to create a}} general model for through thickness air permeability and thermal conductivity for different types of textile fabrics because of their applications in industries and everyday life. An analytical model to predict through thickness air permeability was developed. The objective was to create a model which will take into consideration the two primary mechanisms of air flow in fabrics: through the gaps between yarns and through the <b>yarns.</b> Through <b>thickness</b> air permeability was measured according to British Standard BS EN ISO 9237 : 1995. Several fabrics were tested including plain weave, twill weave and satin weave fabrics. The analytical model is a combination Kulichenko and Van Langenhove's analytical model which predicts the permeability through gaps between yams with Gebart's model to predict permeability within yams. Analytical predictions were compared to the experimental data. Computational modelling of through thickness air permeability using Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD software is presented in this thesis. The Polymer Composites Research Group in the University of Nottingham has created a textile schema, named TexGen. The prerequisites of this software were to be able to model various types of textile structures. A CFD model using CFX 11. 0 was developed to be able to predict fabric permeability. In addition, an analytical model was developed for fabrics deformed by shear, compaction and tension. Experimental work for through thickness air permeability of sheared fabric was used to verify predicted results. An analytical model for thermal conductivity of fabrics was developed including the influence of moisture content on thermal conductivity. Two existing approaches for single-layer fabrics are described and compared: rule of mixtures and thermal resistance approach. A me 6 iod for thermal conductivity prediction for multiple layer fabrics is presented. The results are compared to the experimental data and analysed. Some predicted results were in excellent and good agreement with experimental data whereas other predicted results were in poor agreement with experimental data as they were dramatically affected by the assumptions made in the analytical model.

40|$|AbstractAfter fabric relaxation, {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in wale and course density due {{to a reduction in}} loop length and this actually will affect the fabric properties. Then, it is useful to find a relation between loop length and courses and wales per unit length as well as the <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness</b> because wales and courses per unit length can be easily measured at any state while it is difficult to measure the loop length in the knitted fabrics. Therefore, it is required to find an equation, through which the value of loop length can be easily calculated from the measured values of courses and wales per unit length at any state after the knitting process. In this work estimated equations to calculate the knitted loop length for open to normal structure and for normal to compact structure are developed. By comparing the value of the loop length predicted from this work with the other mentioned models, {{it was found that the}} calculated values are very near to the L value of the case study; so the developed equations are acceptable.

40|$|Predictions of {{geometric}} characteristics and elastic properties of patterns in woven fabric composites are proposed based on unit cells. This study addresses the optimization of the elastic properties within woven fabric composite unit cells with multiple designs based on periodic boundary conditions and evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, the study permits a reliable prediction of mechanical behavior of woven fabric composites unit cells {{in which the}} weave patterns are the variables. The models are treated as a single-ply for each weave pattern embedded in a matrix pocket. The analyzed weave patterns are created by TexGen, the simulation is done with ABAQUS. At the unit cell level, effective elastic properties of the yarn were estimated from Finite Element (FE) simulations using periodic boundary conditions. An evolutionary algorithm is adopted in optimizing the elastic properties of woven fabric composites with recombination and mutation operators. We present a parameter study to investigate the effect of various geometric parameters. Those parameters include the gap length, {{the shape of the}} yarn section, the <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness,</b> the constituent materials, the fiber volume fraction and the elastic properties.

30|$|An {{alternative}} to {{this approach is}} to use the FE method to directly replicate the braiding process. For example, Pickett et al. (2009) investigated the effect of different machine settings in the braiding of carbon tows over an irregular-shape preform. Shell elements were used to model the tooling surfaces whilst bar and beam elements were used for bias and unidirectional axial yarns, respectively. Material properties such as friction coefficients for yarn-to-yarn contact and yarns-to-tooling contact, and yarn bending were included in the modelling. Good correlation was found with respect to the experimental observations. Van Ravenhorst and Akkerman (2014) proposed an inverse-kinematic solution for the modelling and simulation of a circular braiding machine. They simulated the braiding process over a mandrel with an irregular cross-section and centre of symmetry. Models showed good correlation with experimental results, although the difference in braid angle was as high as 10 ∘ in certain regions of the overbraided mandrel. The assumptions made, such as no yarn interaction, no friction between yarns and other machine parts, zero <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness</b> and immobility of the yarns after being deposited, are deemed to be the cause of mismatch between prediction and experimental observations. As described in (Goyal et al. 2005; Pickett et al. 2009), it is challenging to capture the effective lenticular cross-sectional geometry of the bias yarns. The use of beam elements with a circular cross-section could lead to model inaccuracies at micro-scale level. For example, the lenticular shape the yarn adopts within a braid cannot be captured with such elements. Large errors, especially in the calculation of the transverse properties of the braid, may occur when the lenticular yarn shape is not properly modelled. Wang and Sun (2001); Wang et al. (2004, 2010) introduced the concept of “digital-elements” for the virtual manufacture of textile fabrics. Filaments in a yarn are discretised as a sequence of rod-elements connected by frictionless pins. This approach allows the simulation of a variety of textile manufacturing processes such as weaving or braiding, and investigation of the shape that the filaments assume during the conversion into a textile. Numerical results matched well with experimental observations.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a micromechanical unit cell model of 5 -Harness satin weave fabric textile composite for {{the estimation of}} in- plane elastic properties. Finite element modeling of unit cell at mesoscopic level has been recommended over employing costly experimental setup for such sophisticated materials. The unit cell is identified based upon its ability to enclose the characteristic periodic repeat pattern in the fabric weave. Modeling of unit cell and its analysis for this new model are developed using an open source software, TexGen and a commercially available finite element software ABAQUS®. The scope of altering weave pattern and yarn characteristics is facilitated in this developed model. Several parametric {{studies were carried out}} in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the model and to investigate the effects of various geometric parameters such as yarn spacing, <b>yarn</b> width, fabric <b>thickness</b> and fibre volume fraction on the mechanical behavior of woven composites. Present analysis reveals that the values of Young's and shear modulus increased with increasing in the fabric parameters such as yarn width and fabric thickness. On the other hand it is decreased when the spacing between the yarns increased. A good comparision was obtained between the predicted results and available experimental and theoretical data in open literature for the developed unit-cell model and its suitability is tested for multi-scale analysis. The potential advantage of the present scheme lies in its ability which permits the textile modeling from building of textile fabric model to its solution including mesh generation undertaken using an integrated scripting approach thus requiring far less human time than traditional finite element models...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{improved}} (up-to-date) insight into the environmental burden of textiles made of the base materials cotton, polyester (PET), nylon, acryl, and elastane. The research question is: Which base material and which life cycle stage (cradle-to-gate as well as cradle-to-grave) have the biggest impact on the environment? Methods: Life cycle inventory (LCI) data are collected from the literature, life cycle assessment (LCA) databases, and emission registration database of the Dutch government, as well as communications with both manufacturing companies of production equipment and textile companies. The output of the calculations is presented in four single indicators: Ecocosts 2012 (a prevention-based indicator), CO 2 equivalent (carbon footprint), cumulative energy demand (CED), and ReCiPe (a damage-based indicator). Results and discussion: From an analysis of the data, it becomes clear that the environmental burden is not only a function of the base materials (cotton, PET, nylon, acryl, and elastane) but also of the thickness of the yarn (for this research, the range of 50 – 500 dtex is examined). The authors propose that the environmental burden of spinning, weaving, and knitting is a function of 1 /yarn size. The cradle-to-grave analysis from raw material extraction to discarded textile demonstrates that textiles made out of acryl and PET have the least impact on the environment, followed by elastane, nylon, and cotton. The use phase has less relative impact than it is suggested in the classical literature. Conclusions: The impact of spinning and weaving is relatively high (for yarn thicknesses of less than 100 dtex), and from the environmental point of view, knitting is better than weaving. LCA on textiles can only be accurate when the <b>yarn</b> <b>thickness</b> is specified. In case the functional unit also indicates the fabric per square meter, the density must be known. LCA results of textile products over the whole value chain are case dependent, especially when dyeing and finishing processes and the use phase and end-of-life are included in the analysis. Further LCI data studies on textiles and garments are urgently needed to lower the uncertainties in contemporary LCA of textile materials and products...|$|E
