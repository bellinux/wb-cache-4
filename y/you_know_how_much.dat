'Haven't you {{anything}} to say at all? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I loved my brother. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it meant to me that he should live to wipe out all memory of my father's crime.

60|$|<b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I {{loved my}} brother. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{it meant to}} me that he should live to wipe out my father's dishonour. All the future was centred on him, and you sacrificed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} must see her. If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{she talks about}} you, you would not think of leaving Ireland without seeing her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be offended. You wouldn't be if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{there was}} at stake. But I've got to trust some one--and {{it must be a}} woman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You look tired," [...] said Rosamond, kindly; [...] "put {{your feet}} upon the front seat--nobody will look. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you cleared?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't {{have gone}} in {{for this kind of}} thing if I hadn't thought I was sure. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you owe me, don't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Twemlow, {{your word}} will have weight with her pompous, self-blinded father. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he makes of your family. Lose no time. Warn him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, thank you.--This is {{just what}} I wanted to be assured of.--Oh! if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I love every thing that is decided and open!--Good-bye, good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Knox tosses {{documents}} {{on top of}} low bookcase between fireplace and bedroom door, and starts to shake hands.) You're damn careless with those papers. You wouldn't be if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Gherst paid for them.|$|R
6000|$|His face became red up to {{the roots}} of his hair as he stood looking at her without answering. [...] "You would grant it certainly," [...] she continued, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it would be valued." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{money there}} is in that thing?” he asked, as if {{addressing}} slowly some hobgoblin sitting between the ears of the horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor again! That {{would seem}} to infer that we are prosperous now. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I owe half the stores in this city, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am quite}} myself,' said I, after a pause. 'We have more cause {{to think of}} my aunt than of anyone. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> she has done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When I add Mary's {{thanks to}} mine,' said Martin, 'I {{have made the}} only poor {{acknowledgment}} {{it is in our}} power to offer; but if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we feel, Tom, you would set some store by it, I am sure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, do now, ma'am!" [...] pleaded the big fellow, simply. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> good it does me, you would. Why, it's {{been like}} heaven {{to me to}} get into such a home as this for a day,--it has indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} would speak as you do, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> your words hurt me. In such a matter as this I should not be {{justified}} in allowing your opinions to have weight with me. But your sympathy {{would be so much}} to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|LAWTON: 'My DEAR Mrs. Crashaw, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I prize that {{rheumatism}} of yours! I will be serious--I will be {{only too}} serious. The garotter is Mr. Roberts himself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Touchwood {{answered}} instantly, [...] "To {{sea with}} all my heart, but not with a land-lubber for commander.--Harkye, brother, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> of a horse's furniture belongs to a ship?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said I, [...] "but think again! Does {{not this}} smack {{a little of}} some Government connivance? <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we have {{wondered}} already at the man's security." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will reform. I have reformed. I say it boldly; I {{have become}} an altered man since I <b>knew</b> <b>you.</b> I have lived with one hope, and even the hope alone has changed me. Now I have got all that I have hoped for. Oh, Emily, I wish <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I love you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father, ask him {{to remain}} here. We shall not disturb him, I am sure, in our talking. And, moreover, if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> I owe to him--to his own bravery and his strength--you would {{understand}} <b>how</b> <b>much</b> safer I feel when he is close to me, though we are surrounded by an army of our brave mountaineers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing," [...] said Flora, {{turning from}} her brother, and {{speaking}} with warmth to Fred; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> that unhappy old creature has suffered, {{you would not}} be surprised to find her somewhat cross at times.

6000|$|... "So I have {{no doubt}} he will come round, with you. Do try and not vex him {{more than you can}} help, Bob. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> we all owe him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{perfectly}} cynical!" [...] cried Miss Vane. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> {{good the}} flower mission has accomplished among the deserving poor? Hundreds of bouquets are distributed every day. They prevent crime." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stay my charmer, can {{you leave}} me? [...] Cruel, cruel to deceive me; [...] Well <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> you grieve me; [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! [...] Cruel charmer, can you go! ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Penniman, however, {{with her}} high {{conception}} of the sanctity of pledges, carried her point.

[...] "Mr. Townsend wishes most particularly to see you, Catherine; he believes that if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much,</b> and why, he wishes it, you would consent to do so." ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Martha sniffed. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> Aunt {{can express}} in a sniff. But I tripped to church like a bird.|$|R
60|$|OCTAVIUS. I have no hope, Ann: I {{accept my}} ill luck. But I don't think <b>you</b> quite <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it hurts.|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> afraid I am? I {{have thought}} of every accident, in dreadful nights. How {{do you know what}} my life is, or what it has been all these miserable years?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{he had to}} go into it now. [...] "I don't {{think you}} can have it," [...] he said, and then as she {{remained}} silent, [...] "Marjorie, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> money I've got?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Excuse me, Miss Kate," [...] {{said the}} captain with {{a twinkle in}} his grey eye, [...] "you told me I was your first lodger, so how can <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> trouble other men would give?" ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Thank {{you for a}} {{handsome}} compliment. I have a big dog; {{and he is the}} best fellow I <b>know.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> uglier <b>you</b> are than a chow, you wouldn't start those comparisons, though. [Rising] Well, if you have nothing for me to do, I am going to leave your heel {{for the rest of the}} day and enjoy myself. What would you recommend me to do with myself? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know that, guardian. But I {{have such}} need of your advice and support. Oh! <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> need I have to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAR EDWARD,--I {{was very}} glad to receive your Letter, which showed me that you have learned {{something}} since I left home.
