40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} work is described {{dealing with the}} small-amplitude dynamic characteristics of plane four-bar linkages with prismatical links, one link being fixed in space. The object is to devise methods by which a design can be investigated as a vibrating system, given that it is already kinematically suited to its task. The theoretical work {{is based on the}} assumption that only flexural vibrations are important, and uses the method of receptances to establish frequency equations which are then solved numerically to compare with the experimental results. The fundamental natural frequencies of the linkage were studied by free vibration tests and fundamental resonant response curves were obtained under conditions of forcing. The input was a mechanical scotch <b>yoke</b> <b>drive</b> when the links were flexible and an electro-magnetic exciter when the links were rigid. Comparison of experiment and theory shows extremely good agreement for natural frequencies over wide ranges of configuration and acceptable agreement for the forced response curves...|$|E
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch <b>yoke</b> type <b>drive</b> may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. Eccentric cam, crank and scotch <b>yoke</b> <b>drives</b> need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a device which is {{particularly}} relevant to test 3 D quasi-static magnetic numerical computations: axial eddy-current couplings. It consists in two rotors, a driving and a driven one. The driving rotor is made with a ring of magnets, alternating north and south poles, glued on an iron <b>yoke.</b> The <b>driven</b> one is constituted by only a copper ring and another yoke. The rotating permanent magnets induces eddy currents in copper, producing an electromagnetic torque and {{the rotation of the}} copper side. The phenomena are analogous to those existing in an induction machine. This application is a really interesting test case because of the following advantages: 1. Its geometry is purely 3 D but simple. It can be meshed with structured or unstructured grid and includes anti-periodic symmetries. 2. The eddy currents due to movement can be treated without remeshing. 3. There are two kinds of field sources: magnets and eddy-currents. 4. The simplicity of the device permits to easily build prototypes and to obtain experimental measurements needed to validate computational results. The authors had performed several numerical FEM computations on this particular device. The eddy currents problem is solved thanks to two classical formulations based on magnetic vector and scalar potentials, i. e. (a, v) and (h e, φ). The general GPL solver GetDP had been chosen because it really suits to our weak formulations. A comparison between these two formulations has been performed. Problems can be solved both considering a linear b(h) relationship, or a more realistic curve. A special focus is put on the electromagnetic torque evaluation thanks to three post-processing computations: Laplace forces (L-F), average Maxwell stress tensor in the airgap (M-T), and global Joule losses (J-L). Results are compared with experimental measurements made on a magnetic transmission already designed and built by ourselves...|$|R

The author selected basic {{parameters of the}} mechanism, calculated {{the size of the}} radius vector of variable cam profile and appropriate racing rotary angles. Using the calculated data, in the program Autodesk Inventor cam profile was built and three dimensional cam itself was created, and the other elements of the mechanism were created: base, cylindrical gear which wheel acts as <b>yoke</b> disk, rollers, <b>driven</b> shaft. To load the mechanism, driving link was created as a rotary table of screen printing press with four positions for mounting products. A cam mechanism assembly was created with overlap of the necessary links between elements. According to the power parameters of a table, calculation was conducted, processing of the values was carried out and compared with values used for the calculations. It was determined that the deviation of data obtained as a result of modeling compared to the theoretical data is within acceptable limits at 1. 3 %. Thus, the conducted simulation of a cam mechanism with periodic rotation using the new automated design program Autodesk Inventor Simulation allowed to confirm the workability of the proposed method of calculation and the correctness of the theoretical principles and adopted assumptions. ? ?????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ?????

40|$|The power {{produced}} from an engine of automobile {{can be transferred}} to the drive wheel by power transmission system. Each automobile has different power transmission system constructive features depend on the vehicle’s driveline concept. (H. Bayrakceken et al., 2006) To transmit the driving torque from the engine or gear unit to the wheels, most of passenger car and light vehicle driven by combustion engine has at least two driveshaft as a basic requirement (Amborn, P. 1995). During operation, torsional stress and bending stress was experienced by driveshaft due to the weight of the car or misalignment of journal bearing (Asi, 2006). In order to meet the requirements {{of one of the most}} highly stressed components in automotive assembly, a failure investigation must be conducted. Finite element method was used as stress analysis to determine the stress conditions at the failed section. Nearly all of driveshaft are metal shafts or metal tubes that has special joint at each end called universal joint (Birch and Rockwood 2005). Power transmission system of vehicles consist several components which sometimes encounter unfortunate failures. Some common reasons for the failures may be manufacturing and design faults, maintenance faults, raw material faults, material processing faults as well as the user originated faults. In this study, fracture analysis of a universal joint <b>yoke</b> and a <b>drive</b> shaft of an automobile power transmission system are carried out. Spectroscopic analyses, metallographic analyses and hardness measurements are carried out for each part. For the determination of stress conditions at the failed section, stress analysis is also carried out by the finite element method. The common failure types in automobiles and revealed that the failures in the transmission system elements cover 1 / 4 of al...|$|R
