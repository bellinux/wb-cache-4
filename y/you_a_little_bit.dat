[...] In response to being compared to both Kesha and Uffie, Dev said, [...] "I just feel that I have a lot more to say and the ability to have an eclectic sound, I'm not bashing either artist, but I'm {{going to be able to}} give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more than what you've heard on those records. When my album comes out, hopefully I won't have to hear another reference or comparison." [...] Much of Dev's music is inspired by rap music, as she believes that fans respond to [...] "pop music but with rap roots". She said, [...] "I've always been into hip-hop.

"I think, my dear," [...] {{she said}} gently, [...] "that I {{will have to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of our family history {{that may not be}} very {{pleasant}} to hear or tell. Perhaps you don't know that when your mother married we--we--did not exactly approve of her marriage. Perhaps we were mistaken; at any rate it was wrong and foolish to let it come between us and her as we have done. But that is how it was. None of us approved, as I have said, but none of us was so bitter as your Uncle Paul. Your mother was his favourite sister, and he was very deeply attached to her. She was only a year younger than he. When he bought the Greenwood farm she went and kept house for him for three years before her marriage. When she married, Paul was terribly angry. He was always a strange man, very determined and unyielding. He said he would never forgive her, and he never has. He has never married, and he has lived so long alone at Greenwood with only deaf old Mrs. Bree to keep house for him that he has grown odder than ever. One of us wanted to go and keep house for him, but he would not let us. And--I must tell you this although I hate to--he was very angry when he heard we had invited you to visit us, and he said he would not come near the Grange as long as you were here. Oh, you can't realize how bitter and obstinate he is. We pleaded with him, but I think that only made him worse. We have felt so bad over it, your Aunt Ellen and your Uncle George and I, but we can do nothing at all." ...|$|E
