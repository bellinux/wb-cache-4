During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants.

He is the lord and master of Amuba and myself, and yet, as you see, his son treats us not as servants, but as friends. Ameres {{is one of the}} kindest of men; and as to his daughter Mysa, whose special attendant I am, I would lay down my life to shield her from harm. <b>Your</b> <b>grandchild</b> could not be in better hands. As to her religion, although Ameres has often questioned Amuba and myself respecting the gods of our people, he has never once shown the slightest desire that we should abandon them for those of Egypt." ...|$|R

6000|$|When {{the magi}} {{had heard the}} king's {{narrative}} of {{the circumstances under which}} the discovery of the child's preservation had been made, through complaints which had been preferred against him on account of the manner in which he had exercised the prerogatives of a king among his playmates, they decided at once that Astyages had no cause for any further apprehensions in respect to the dreams which had disturbed him previous to his grandchild's birth. [...] "He has been a king," [...] they said, [...] "and the danger is over. It is true that he has been a monarch only in play, but that is enough to satisfy and fulfill the presages of the vision. Occurrences very slight and trifling in themselves are often found to accomplish what seemed of very serious magnitude and moment, as portended. <b>Your</b> <b>grandchild</b> has been a king, and he will never reign again. You have, therefore, no further cause to fear, and may send him to his parents in Persia with perfect safety." ...|$|R

40|$|Would {{you take}} a {{potentially}} life-saving drug if you knew that <b>your</b> children and <b>grandchildren</b> might suffer the side effects? Would you change your lifestyle if it meant you could reverse disadvantages built into your genes? Would you be comfortable if corporations could infer intimate details about your life history without asking? What if that data could improve your quality of life? Epigenetics - our epigenome - controls how our genes behave without altering their sequence. Just about everything affects it, from nutrition, drugs, and toxins to child rearing, culture, and society. Many diseases, from obesity to addiction to cancer, {{can be linked to}} epigenetic modifications. Furthermore, throughout development and life, from conception to death, the exposures you have will not only affect your own epigenome, but potentially also your child’s, and <b>your</b> <b>grandchild’s.</b> This rapidly expanding field of biological, physiological, sociological, and psychological research could be key to discovering why, and more importantly how, we are the way we are. Epigenetics has consequences for medicine, pregnancy, childcare, law and how we live on an everyday basis. This book will provide a comprehensive introduction to the mechanisms and real-life consequences of epigenetics, and will arm the reader with the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions about the future of epigenetics in modern society. This is a call for serious consideration about the effects of epigenetics on society. Epigenetics has been independently peer-reviewed for accuracy by international experts. It is written by students of diverse disciplines, and intended for students and educated lay people. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|You {{are in your}} {{seventies and}} begin noticing changes in your vision. The center of your vision has become dark and hazy, making faces and objects {{difficult}} to discern. <b>Your</b> <b>grandchild</b> comes over to visit; {{and when you look}} down at him, you see a dark, cloudy void where his face would normally be. With great concern, you see your doctor and discover that you have age–related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of sixty–five (Johnson, 2005). You soon learn that there is no cure for AMD, but that researchers are trying to understand not only how to cure the disease but how to prevent it as well. Age–related macular degeneration (AMD) is a disease that affects the central vision of more than six million Americans (Wang et al., 2007). Nearly 30 % of Americans over the age of seventy–five will exhibit some signs of early AMD. Of that population, 7 % will have advanced disease and suffer extreme loss of vision (Johnson, 2005). It is expected that the occurrence of AMD will triple in the next thirty years as the aging population increases (Johnson, 2005). The disease affects primarily the macula of the eye, the part of the retina responsible for central vision (Harvard...|$|R

6000|$|... "Matter!" [...] cried Lewis, {{before the}} Professor could reply, [...] "why, it matters very much indeed. I can prove it. Our {{excellent}} guide Antoine {{told me of}} a man who fell into a crevasse high up on the Glacier des Bossons, and was of course lost; but about forty years afterwards the part of the glacier into which he fell had descended into the valley, and the body of the man was found--at least portions of it were found here and there. This, as you are all aware, is a well-known fact. Bear in mind, in connection with this, that all glaciers do not travel at the same rate, nor all parts of a glacier at an equal rate. Now, suppose that you were to lose a gold watch or a diamond ring in a crevasse, the value of which might be incalculable in consequence of being a gift from some beloved one, would it not be a matter of the last importance to know exactly {{the rate at which the}} said crevasse travelled, so that you or <b>your</b> <b>grandchildren</b> might return at the precise time and claim the property?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was very}} little sentiment, however, in {{marshalling}} the company at the dinner given to Mr. Canning. I will not undertake {{to say that all}} the guests were invited to meet this gentleman, and that he had been asked to name a day, as is usual when it is intended to pay an especial compliment; but I was asked to meet him, and I understood that the dinner was in his honour. Diplomatic etiquette made short work of the matter, notwithstanding, for the doors were hardly thrown open, before all the privileged vanished, with a quickness that was surprising. The minister took Madame de Villèle; M. de Villèle, Mrs. Brown; M. de Damas, the wife of the oldest ambassador; and the Nuncio, Madame de Damas: after which, the ambassadors and ministers took each other's wives in due order, and with a promptitude that denoted great practice. Even the charge disappeared, leaving {{the rest of us to}} settle matters among ourselves as well as we could. Mr. Canning, Mr. Gallatin, Lord Clanricarde, the divine, the secretary, and myself, were left with only the wife of the clergyman and Miss Gallatin. As a matter of course, the Americans, feeling themselves at home, made signs for the two Englishmen to precede them, and Mr. Canning offered his arm to Mrs. ----, and Lord Clanricarde, his to Miss Gallatin. Here occurred a touch of character that is worthy to be mentioned, as showing of how very little account an American, male or female, is in the estimation of a European, and how very arbitrary are the laws of etiquette among our English cousins. Mr. Canning actually gave way to his son-in-law, leaving the oldest of the two ladies to come after the youngest, because, as a marquis, his son-in-law took precedence of a commoner! This was out of place in America, at least, where the parties were, by a fiction in law, if not in politeness, and it greatly scandalized all our Yankee notions of propriety. Mrs. ---- afterwards told me that he apologized for the circumstance, giving Lord Clanricarde's rank as the reason. [...] "Sempereadem," [...] or [...] "worse and worse," [...] as my old friend O----n used to translate it. What became of the precedency of the married lady all this time? you will be ready to ask. Alas! she was an American, and had no precedency. The twelve millions may not settle this matter as it should be; but, take my word for it, the [...] "fifty millions" [...] will. Insignificant as all this is, or rather ought to be, <b>your</b> <b>grandchildren</b> and mine will live to see the mistake rectified. How much better would it be for those who cannot stop the progress of events, by vain wishes and idle regrets, to concede the point gracefully, and on just principles, than to have their cherished prejudices broken down by dint of sheer numbers and power! ...|$|E
