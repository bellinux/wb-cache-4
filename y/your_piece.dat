2500|$|I found <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> [...] very interesting. Sober {{and serious}} {{without trying to}} be funny. It exudes humor, {{a sure sign of}} refined taste. Furthermore, the {{material}} is fresh and eye-catching. Your style is well-published, admirably fitting.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this short {{enumeration}} of my strength, Blodget, since it gives me new assurance of my people's fidelity. You I will not distrust; the others I cannot, and there is a feeling of high confidence--What do you see?--why do you lower <b>your</b> <b>piece,</b> and stand at guard, in this manner?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to occupy the opponent's castle with two of <b>your</b> own <b>pieces,</b> or, to capture all of <b>your</b> opponent's <b>pieces</b> while {{retaining}} two or more of <b>your</b> own <b>pieces.</b>|$|R

"But now, papa, {{after all}} {{you say in}} <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> there, I cannot help feeling that, if I had the taste and the money too, {{it would be better}} than the taste alone with no money. I like the nice {{arrangements}} and the books and the drawings, but I think all these would appear better still with really elegant furniture." ...|$|E
60|$|Why {{the pale}} doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the {{forecastle}} of your third sentence? Have no fears. <b>Your</b> <b>piece</b> {{will be a}} Go. It will go {{out the back door}} on the first night. They've all done it--the 1364. So will 1365. Not one of us ever thought of the simple device of half-soling himself with a stove-lid. Ah, what suffering a little hindsight would have saved us. Treasure this hint.|$|E

Mr Mulholland has met with an unfortunate accident, and I am looking after the {{entertainment}} in his place. Come with me and play over <b>your</b> <b>piece.</b> I should like to see that you are perfect in it. Dear me, dear me, what a noise those boys are making. Why are they behaving in that extraordinary way, I wonder!" ...|$|E
50|$|Ataxx is an {{abstract}} strategy board game that involves play by two parties on a seven-by-seven square grid. The {{object of the}} game is to make <b>your</b> <b>pieces</b> constitute a majority of the pieces on the board {{at the end of the}} game, by converting as many of <b>your</b> opponent's <b>pieces</b> as possible.|$|R
5000|$|If you sink <b>your</b> last <b>piece</b> {{before the}} queen, {{you lose the}} board, three points and one point for each of <b>your</b> opponent's <b>pieces</b> left.|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to arrange <b>your</b> <b>pieces</b> in certain winning {{formations}} before your opponent can. It is unique because any piece that is moving must move as far as it can.|$|R
60|$|I {{have a story}} coming out: God {{knows when}} or how; it answers to {{the name of the}} BEACH OF FALESA, and I think well of it. I was delighted with the TRAGIC MUSE; I thought the Muse herself one of your best works; I was delighted also to hear of the success of <b>your</b> <b>piece,</b> as you know I am a dam failure, and might have dined with the dinner club that Daudet and these parties frequented.|$|E

[...] "Mr. Pilkington, if {{what you}} say is true, and I'm afraid {{there is no doubt that}} it is, the only thing I can do is to give you back your property. So will you please try to {{understand}} that everything is just as it was before you gave my uncle the money. You've got back your ten thousand dollars and you've got back <b>your</b> <b>piece,</b> so there's nothing more to talk about." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{be ashamed}} to {{recognise}} {{her was a}} weakness beneath him; he spoke to her, and was leaving her, pluming herself on his notice, when he saw little Marianne's blue eyes fixed wistfully upon him, {{and held out his}} hand to her. She ran up to him joyfully, and he led her a few steps from her mother's party. 'Well, little one, how are you? I have <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> of spar quite safe. Have you said how d'ye do to Bustle?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Was that Phoebe?' she said. 'You have a clear, good touch, my dear, as {{they used}} to say I had when I was at school at Bath. Play another of <b>your</b> <b>pieces,</b> my dear.' ...|$|R

6000|$|The manager laughed. [...] "Oh, {{the average}} public would {{consider}} that very pessimistic. They want no harm to come even from doing wrong. They want the drama to get round it, somehow. If you could show that Divine Providence forgets wrong-doing altogether in certain cases, {{you would make}} the fortune of <b>your</b> <b>piece.</b> Come, why couldn't you try something of that kind? It would be the greatest comfort to all the sinners in front, for every last man of them--or woman--would think {{she was the one}} who was going to get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you {{see that}} canoe, that came out last, is {{paddling}} down towards us? It {{looks as if it}} were drifting, but I have seen them dip a paddle in, several times. The others are pulling up their lines, so as to be in readiness to join in. Get <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> ready to pick up, and aim the moment I give the word. They {{think they are going to}} surprise us, but we must be first with them. Go on with your fishing, and just drop your line overboard, when you pick up your gun." ...|$|E

He may have a scrap left, {{that he used to}} make caps for the Christmas boys when he used the rest to paper Mrs Hunter's closet with down at Downhill. <b>Your</b> <b>piece</b> was left over of that, and may be there was half-a-yard more; but he locks that there {{workshop}} of his, so as one can't get in to get a bit of shavings to light the fire. So you must ask him. I am sure I dare not do it. He's that angry if one does but look into his shop." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "These things belong only to pronunciation, {{which is}} the least part of grammar," [...] said Mrs. Garth. [...] "That apple-peel is to be eaten by the pigs, Ben; if you eat it, I must give them <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> of pasty. Job has only to speak about very plain things. How {{do you think you}} would write or speak about {{anything}} more difficult, if you knew no more of grammar than he does? You would use wrong words, and put words in the wrong places, and instead of making people understand you, they would turn away from you as a tiresome person. What would you do then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Johnnie Toole {{was playing}} a piece called Partners. Not a good play. And the Yeoman of the Guard had just been {{produced}} at the Savoy. That makes it seem a long time ago, doesn't it? Well, I mustn't take up all your time. Good-bye, Mr. Bevan. I am glad {{to have had the}} opportunity of this little talk. The Regal Theatre, I think you said, is where <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> is playing? I shall probably be going to London shortly. I hope to see it." [...] Lord Marshmoreton rose. [...] "As regards the other matter, there is no hope of inducing you to see the matter in the right light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You did,' said Wardle. 'I saw you do it--I {{observed}} {{you pick}} him out--I noticed you, as you raised <b>your</b> <b>piece</b> to take aim; and I will say this, {{that the best}} shot in existence {{could not have done}} it more beautifully. You are an older hand at this than I thought you, Tupman; you have been out before.' It was in vain for Mr. Tupman to protest, with a smile of self-denial, that he never had. The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary; and from that time forth his reputation was established. It is not the only reputation that has been acquired as easily, nor are such fortunate circumstances confined to partridge-shooting.|$|E
50|$|Additionally {{there are}} {{professional}} rules in this scenario. They state {{that if you}} have no possible moves you must skip your turn and wait until one of <b>your</b> <b>pieces</b> is free to move. Usually if there are only two players in the game the regular rules apply.|$|R
