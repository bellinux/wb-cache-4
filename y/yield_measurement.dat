With Alvarez and Lawrence H.

In June 1945, he was issued with an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to Tinian in the Western Pacific in a C-54 of the 509th Composite Group.

The yield of collapsed point-defect clusters is demonstrated unequivocally to be temperature dependent, remaining approximately constant up to lattice temperatures of 573 K and then abruptly decreasing with increasing temperature. This drop in yield is not caused by defect loss during or following ion irradiation. This temperature dependence {{can be explained by}} a thermal spike effect.

5000|$|The {{goal of the}} T2K {{experiment}} is to gain a more complete understanding of neutrino oscillation parameters. Previous neutrino experiments observed the disappearance of muon neutrinos in a beam as they oscillate to tau neutrinos, but oscillation from [...] to [...] was not observed until July 19, 2013. The {{reason for this is}} that the mixing angle θ13, that controls the probability for this oscillation, is very small. T2K was the first experiment to measure the appearance of electron neutrinos in a muon neutrino beam. T2K's ND280 detector will take data on neutrino interaction cross section measurements on water. Precise measurements of the other neutrino mixing parameter Δm and θ23 are another aim of the experiment. Future upgrades to T2K could <b>yield</b> <b>measurement</b> of the CP violation phase δ by comparing oscillations of neutrinos to those of antineutrinos.|$|E

In the United States the grain yield is typically reported as bushels per acre. SI units for grain <b>yield</b> <b>measurement</b> are typically reported as tonnes per hectare or in few cases [...] The harvester speed can be obtained by ground speed measurement from measuring the wheel speed of the harvester, radar mounted on the harvester, or by GPS.

40|$|Most {{insurance}} products pay indemnities based on actual losses incurred by the policyholder (e. g., automobile collision insurance, {{property and casualty}} insurance, etc.). This is also true of many Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP) {{insurance products}} that pay indemnities based on farm-level yield or revenue shortfalls. Yet for some commodities, such as hay, <b>yield</b> <b>measurement</b> is difficult and often imprecise, especially at the farm-level. Further, since the commodity is frequently used on the farm, rather than sold in the market, sales documents are often not available to verify historic production (and hence, yield) estimates. For other commodities (e. g., pasture and rangeland) farm-level <b>yield</b> <b>measurement</b> is practically impossible. How can one offer insurance protection for these commodities? USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) is currently investigating whether new index insurance designs based on weather variables (e. g., precipitation) can provide farmers with useful risk protection in these situations.

40|$|Efficient {{locating}} the fruit {{on the tree}} {{is one of the}} major requirements for the fruit harvesting system. In this paper, automatic segmentation and yield calculation of fruit based on shape analysis is presented. Color and shape analysis was utilized to segment the images of different fruits like apple, pomegranate, oranges, peach, litchi and plum obtained under different lighting conditions. First the input sectional tree image was converted from RGB colour space into the L*a*b colour space. The resultant image was then applied to the algorithm for fruit segmentation. The Edge detection and combination of a circular fitting algorithm was used for the automatic segmentation of fruit in the image. The resultant edge points were then used for fitting the approximate circular shape. The resultant fitted circles were used as a count of total number of fruits in an image. Hundred sectional tree images of different fruits were used for the segmentation and <b>yield</b> <b>measurement.</b> The results indicate that the proposed method can accurately segment the occluded fruits with the efficiency of 98 % and the average <b>yield</b> <b>measurement</b> error was found a...|$|E
