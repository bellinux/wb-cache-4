He beat out Troy Tulowitzki by 2 points in the closest NL vote since the system was revised in 1980. Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year. Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Braun also received the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league players. [...] "When your peers recognize <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> award, that's great", he said. [...] "Those are the guys {{out there on the}} field with you, competing against you. Their opinion counts the most, for a player." [...] In voting for the NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, Braun received two 10th-place votes and finished 24th overall.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{position}} as a naturalist on board was as a self-funded guest with no official appointment, and he could leave the voyage at any suitable stage. At the outset George Peacock had advised that [...] "The Admiralty are not disposed to give a salary, though they will furnish <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> official appointment & every : if a salary should be required however I am inclined {{to think that it}} would be granted". Far from wanting this, Darwin's concern was to maintain control over his collection. He was even reluctant to be on the Admiralty's books for [...] until he got assurances from FitzRoy and Beaufort that this would not affect his rights to assign his specimens. Darwin did not want his collection to go to the British Museum as he had heard that specimens from the first Beagle voyage were still waiting to be described. Beaufort assured him that he [...] "should have no difficulty" [...] as long as he [...] "presented them to some public body" [...] such as the Zoological or Geological societies. Darwin himself thought his new finds should go to the [...] "largest & most central collection", not the [...] Cambridge Philosophical Society museum that Henslow was setting up at Cambridge, but after getting Henslow's willing agreement to take delivery of the consignments of specimens, Darwin replied that he hoped to give some to the Cambridge museum.|$|E
500|$|The {{reception}} of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in Halo3 was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of IGN decided the change took away the [...] "intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites", in the process reducing the character's role to that of [...] "a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword". Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend.com stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom Halo3 was their first game in the series. IGN's reviewer took issue with the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of allies in the game, and singled out the Arbiter in particular; [...] "The Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original Halo," [...] Hilary Goldstein said. Describing the AI of the character, Goldstein felt players could [...] "enjoy watching your supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. What {{is the point of}} sticking <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> AI compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?" [...] The New York Times Charles Herold found that in comparison to Halo2, where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in Halo3 was [...] "extraneous". On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum were reviewers like G4tv, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. In a list of the top alien characters in video games, MSNBC placed the Arbiter at the number two ranking.|$|E

500|$|Vikram next {{featured}} in Rajapattai (2011) alongside Deeksha Seth {{under the direction}} of Suseenthiran where he played a henchman trying to get a break in the Tamil film industry. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics in December 2011 and performed below expectations at the box office. Vikram also completed half of a fantasy period film during 2011, Karikalan in which he played Karikala Chola, a Tamil king who ruled in 270 BC, opposite Zarine Khan {{under the direction of}} graphics director Kannan, but the film was later shelved owing to production troubles. He then appeared in his second project with director Vijay, portraying the lead role of a blinded RAW agent in the action-thriller, Thaandavam. The film, which also featured Anushka Shetty, Amy Jackson and Lakshmi Rai in pivotal roles, opened to mixed reviews in September 2012. For his role of a blind man, Vikram trained under noted human echolocation specialist Daniel Kish, with the latter also playing a cameo in the film. A critic from Sify.com noted that it was [...] "Vikram and him alone who diverts your attention from the film's little logical script flaws and spellbinds <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> endearing act that is Thaandavam's biggest strength"; subsequently the film did average business commercially. The actor was next seen portraying the title role in Bejoy Nambiar's bilingual David, which released with different cast members in Hindi and Tamil. Vikram remained the only common lead actor in the versions, with his segment playing out a love story between a careless drunkard fisherman and a mute girl played by Isha Sherwani. While the Tamil version opened to predominantly positive review, the Hindi film also won mixed reviews, with both films performing average business at the box office.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2001, Dench's husband Michael Williams {{died from}} lung cancer. Dench went to Nova Scotia, Canada, almost {{immediately}} after Williams's funeral to begin production on Lasse Hallström's drama film The Shipping News, a therapy she later credited as her rescue: [...] "People, friends, kept saying, 'You are not facing up to it; you need {{to face up to}} it,' and maybe they were right, but I felt I was– in the acting. Grief supplies <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enormous amount of energy. I needed to use that up." [...] In between, Dench finished work on Richard Eyre's film Iris (2001), in which she portrayed novelist Iris Murdoch. Dench shared her role with Kate Winslet, both actresses portraying Murdoch at different phases of her life. Each of them was nominated for an Academy Award the following year, earning Dench her fourth nomination within five years. In addition, she was awarded both an ALFS Award and the Best Leading Actress Award at the 55th British Academy Film Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1826, Ibrahim managed to capture the marshes around the city, {{although}} not without heavy losses. He thus cut the Greeks off from the sea and blocked off their supply route. Despite the Egyptians and the Turks offering them terms to stop the attacks, the Greeks refused, and continued to fight. On 22 April, the Greeks decided to sail from the city during the night, with 3,000 men, to cut {{a path through the}} Egyptian lines and allow 6,000 women, children and non-combatants to follow. However, a Bulgarian deserter informed Ibrahim of the Greeks' intention, and he had his entire army deployed; only 1,800 Greeks managed to cut their way through the Egyptian lines. Between 3,000 and 4,000 women and children were enslaved and {{many of the people who}} remained behind decided to blow themselves up with gunpowder rather than be enslaved. The news that the Third Siege of Missolonghi had ended in an Ottoman victory sparked horror all over Greece; at the National Assembly, Kolokotronis was giving a speech when the news of Missolonghi's fall reached him, leaving him to remember: [...] "the news came to us that Missolonghi was lost. We were all plunged into great grief; for half an hour there was so complete a silence that no one would have thought there was a living soul present; each of us was revolving in his mind how great was our misfortune". The American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe, serving as a doctor with the Greeks, wrote back to America: [...] "I write <b>you</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> almost breaking heart. Missolonghi has fallen!", which he called [...] "damning proof of the selfish indifference of the Christian world. You may talk to me of national policy and the necessity of neutrality, but I say, a curse upon such a policy!". The news of Missolonghi's fall had a huge impact on the rest of Europe, sparking a vast outpouring of songs, poems, essays, sermons and plays in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, with the recurring image of Missolonghi's fall being the murder of a sweet and innocent young Greek woman at the hands of the Turks as a symbol of the unwillingness of the Christian powers of the world to do anything for the Greeks. In May 1826, Hastings arrived in Greece with a British-built steamship, the Karteria (Perseverance), which astonished the Greeks to see a ship powered by steam and did not move either via sail or oars. The Karteria suffered from constant engine breakdowns, but Hastings was able to use the ship successfully twice over the course of the next two years, at Volos and in the Gulf of Corinth.|$|E
