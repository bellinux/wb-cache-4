5|$|At 5ft 4in (1.62m), Burnham was slight, but he {{was also}} muscular and bronzed, with a finely formed square jaw. He had a boyish {{appearance}} which he used to his advantage on numerous occasions. His most noticeable feature was his steady, grey-blue eyes. Contemporary reports had it that Burnham's gaze appeared to never leave those of the person he was looking at, and <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> could simultaneously monitor all the details of the physical surroundings. It was also said that Burnham's eyes possessed a far-away look such as those acquired by people whose occupation has caused them to watch continually at sea or on great plains.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if you find it too late. <b>Yet</b> <b>somehow,</b> {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|The 2011 tournament was {{hosted by}} New Zealand: it saw {{a repeat of}} the 1987 World Cup finale standings, as Australia took on Wales in the Bronze final and won 21-18, while New Zealand, by {{defeating}} France 8-7 in the final, became the first nation to win on home soil twice. This tournament was notable for the fact that France lost twice in the pool stages, to NZ and Tonga, and <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> managed to progress {{all the way to the}} Final to face off with NZ one more time. This represented the first time any team had played each other twice in a world cup and was also the first time the winner and runner-up of the same pool progressed through to the Finals.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. <b>Yet,</b> <b>somehow,</b> they end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are non-measurable sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} 2011, [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] {{was voted}} number 25 on MTV's 25 Best Songs of 2011. James Montgomery wrote that the song was a [...] "supremely {{saccharine}} single from erstwhile Girls Aloud member mashes together every notable pop moment in recent history, <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> manages to be better that {{the sum of its}} parts. That's thanks mostly to the supercharged, sing-a-long chorus, where the whole thing comes together in a head-spinning rush. She should go solo more often." [...] The song was also listed on Billboard magazine's Best Songs of 2011 list at number 14. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was listed as The Guardians 14th best song.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Rothbard's [...] "long and winding <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> {{consistent}} road {{had taken him}} from anti-New Deal and anti-interventionist Robert Taft supporter into friendship with the quasi-pacifist Nebraska Republican Congressman Howard Buffett (father of Warren Buffett) then over to the League of (Adlai) Stevensonian Democrats and, by 1968, into tentative comradeship with the anarchist factions of the New Left." [...] Rothbard advocated an alliance with the New Left anti-war movement, {{on the grounds that}} the conservative movement had been completely subsumed by the statist establishment. However, Rothbard later criticized the New Left for supporting a [...] "People's Republic" [...] style draft. It was during this phase that he associated with Karl Hess and founded [...] with Leonard Liggio and George Resch, which existed from 1965 to 1968.|$|E
500|$|Farrell next {{appeared}} in Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, which premiered in 2007 and was {{distributed in the}} US in early 2008. Reviews were mixed, with Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide writing that Allen's work was [...] "shallow and unconvincing from beginning to end" [...] and Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle saying that although [...] "it's {{not as good as}} Match Point or Crimes and Misdemeanors...taken on its own, it's a fairly impressive piece, a directorially vigorous, well-acted, tightly constructed movie". LaSalle praised Farrell: [...] "Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> this worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear and so unencumbered as he does here." [...] Manohla Dargis concurred in the New York Times, adding that she thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star Ewan McGregor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Myles, briefly, {{and then}} again neither spoke, until by-and-by the Lady Anne came, {{bringing}} the ball.

Then he took the ball, and knew enough to bow his acknowledgment in a manner neither ill nor awkward.|$|R

500|$|... "What Lies Below" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. The A.V. Club contributor Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode with a B-, explaining that despite some nice moments, it was [...] "an {{episode of the}} show that started out utterly predictably, continued along an utterly predictable path and <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> got fairly enjoyable by the end just through sheer force of will {{on the part of}} the cast." [...] IGN's Ramsey Isler also found the episode average and predictable, as it lacked [...] "much of the quintessential storytelling elements that, once upon a time, made this one of the best shows on TV." [...] Like many other critics, Isler thought the episode was too similar to The X-Files, and gave it 7.0/10. TV Squad columnist Jane Boursaw thought Walter discovering a cure was a little far-fetched, and wished Broyles was a greater part of the show. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B+.|$|E
500|$|Although [...] "Lard of the Dance" [...] aired as a teaser episode a month earlier, [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] was the {{official}} season premiere of The Simpsons tenth season. Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "It is gratifying to report that, {{based on the}} season premiere, The Simpsons promises to remain the most reliable half-hour of laughs on television." [...] Similarly, David Bianculli of The New York Daily News reported that [...] "The Simpsons is one series that, year after year, remains fresh and funny and lively and surprising. Based on tonight's season premiere, that amazing streak is in no danger of ending." [...] Lauri Githens of The Buffalo News gave the episode a 5/5 rating, commenting that it shows that [...] "This cynical, bleak <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> still hopeful comedy is nowhere near midlife crisis with Season No. 10. It's still fall-down funny. Thank God." [...] She cited Homer's line to Marge as he and Bart leave for the Edison Museum, [...] "I'm-taking-Bart-over-state-lines-back-soon-I-have-your-wallet-bye!", as the best line of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Singer-songwriter David Gray {{commented that}} the great {{achievement}} of The Basement Tapes is that Dylan found {{a way out of}} the anguish and verbal complexity that had characterized his mid-sixties albums such as Blonde on Blonde: [...] "It's the sound of Dylan letting his guard down. 'Clothes Line Saga' and all those ridiculous songs, he's obviously just making it all up, they were having such a great time. The sound of The Band is so antiquated like something out of the Gold Rush and Dylan fits in because he's this storyteller with an ancient heart. At the time everything he did was so scrutinized, <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> he liberated himself from all that and enjoyed making music again. You hear an unselfconscious quality on this record which you don't ever hear again." [...] "He mocks his own inertia and impotence", writes critic Mike Marqusee, [...] "but with a much gentler touch than in Blonde on Blonde. In place of that album's strangled urgency, Dylan adopts a laconic humor, a deadpan tone that speaks of resignation and self-preservation in the face of absurdity and betrayal." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{the voice}} of Sir James--a voice that had regained a little of its naturalness--a calm, even lazy English voice--confident from the {{experience}} of years of respectful listeners. <b>Yet</b> it <b>somehow</b> jarred upon her nerves with its complacency and its utter incongruousness to her feelings. Nevertheless, the impulse {{to know more about the}} sketch was the stronger.|$|R
5000|$|... "Prisoner of the Highway" [...] {{tells of}} a truck driver who is enticed, but also [...] "imprisoned", by the highway. <b>Yet</b> he <b>somehow</b> finds freedom behind the wheel. It is rumored that a music video to the song was in post {{production}} earlier that year, but was later cancelled, although a video was filmed for the single's b-side [...] "She Loves My Car".|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} named the 11th best {{psychedelic}} album of 2015 by Redefine magazine, with writer Thad McKraken stating that Weird Owl [...] "doesn’t do anything particularly well, and <b>yet,</b> it’s <b>somehow</b> arranged with such a concise precision that it rules". In regards to Weird Owl's discography, Jeff Treppel of Decibel called the album [...] "the finest LP of their career".|$|R
500|$|During World War II, the Ritz became {{integral}} to {{political and social}} life among the elite, {{and a number of}} eminent royals, aristocrats and politicians moved into the hotel. Camilla Russell, the wife of writer Christopher Sykes, stated that the Ritz [...] "enjoyed a tremendous vogue during the war and was, even more than ever, much used as a meeting place", and at night was [...] "crowded <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> safe". Angela, Countess of Antrim, Syke's sister, remarked that the Ritz was the ideal meeting place for [...] "gathering news of husbands at the wars". Emerald Cunard took up residence in the Ritz for a period, but later moved to the Dorchester. In the summer of 1940, the Albanian royal family, including King Zog I, Queen Geraldine, Crown Prince Leka, the King's six sisters, two nieces, three nephews and others moved into the hotel and were given their own floor, escorted by Chamberlain, the Albanian diplomats from Paris, and numerous bodyguards. Zog brought the royal gold and jewels with him, which were kept in the storeroom of the Ritz before being deposited in the Bank of England.|$|E
500|$|Branco {{called the}} {{original}} rape storyline [...] "the gold standard of rape stories," [...] {{and stated that}} Carlivati had changed it into a soap opera cliché. Carlivati's addition to the characters' histories left him feeling betrayed, hurt, depressed, angry, insulted, and disgusted, {{and he said that}} he had wasted almost 20 years investing in and believing in the original rape storyline. At the [...] "re-rape" [...] storyline's conclusion, Branco stated that the payoff was worth the tense moments. [...] "However obscene or depraved the riskiest storyline in recent memory was," [...] he said, [...] "the fallout has been shockingly riveting—thanks to the fact that head writer Ron Carlivati is playing all the psychological beats of Todd's self-serving and criminal actions." [...] Branco also gave credit to St. John. [...] "Nominated for a 2009 Soap Opera Spirit Award as outstanding lead actor, St. John inarguably faced the most challenging assignment of any actor in 2008—in any genre," [...] said Branco. [...] "And <b>yet,</b> <b>somehow,</b> St. John made it work. In a lesser actor's hands, the storyline most certainly would have resulted in career suicide for all involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{stated that}} in this story, Alcazar was [...] "a {{deflated}} version of what he used to be", noting {{that by the end}} of the story he had become [...] "a prisoner in his own palace. A sad, <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> appropriate, ending." [...] Farr suggested that the changes to the characters represented [...] "an element of dismantling of the characters and their traits", something that he believed had also been present in the previous two adventures, Flight 714 to Sydney and The Castafiore Emerald. In his psychoanalytical study of The Adventures of Tintin, the literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès expressed the view that, as with The Red Sea Sharks, Tintin and the Picaros served as [...] "a kind of retrospective" [...] due to the return of various characters. He also suggested that the carnival revelers in San Theodores evoked the figures from the previous stories: [...] "Scots, Africans, Chinese, Indians, cowboys, bullfighters, and, of course, the inevitable parrot". The Lofficiers saw the adventure as a partial sequel to The Broken Ear, which was also set in San Theodoros and which contained many of the same characters.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{artists such}} as Blue Rodeo and k.d. lang {{received}} airplay on CKLN prior to being picked up by mainstream radio. The Globe and Mail says of the station that [...] "it sat {{at the forefront of}} independent music and radical politics in the city for more than three decades, working with a shoe-string budget, and <b>yet</b> it <b>somehow</b> always managed to survive." ...|$|R
60|$|Tallente, {{a person}} very little given to self-analysis, never really {{understood}} the impulse which {{prompted him to}} lean towards her, the slightly quickening sense of excitement with which he sought for the kindness of her eyes. Suddenly he felt his fingers clasped in hers, a warm, pleasant grasp, <b>yet</b> which <b>somehow</b> or other {{seemed to have the}} effect of a barrier.|$|R

500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{described}} the video as [...] "quite a hot mess", further comparing the dancers with the {{ones from the}} video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". The writer finished the review calling it [...] "a four-minute art-school film unworthy of her Sasha Fierceness". Jennifer Cady of E! Online commented that the video was [...] "all about being gritty and edgy, like strutting around a downtown L.A. warehouse in crazy designer fashion and chewing bubblegum. Hard-core style". Cady further described the dance in the video for [...] "Diva" [...] as [...] "way easier to learn than [...] in 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". However, she chose the C-3PO-inspired mannequins, the lack of Beyoncé's robot hand and the [...] "obnoxious camera work or car explosion" [...] as the worst parts of the video. Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak commented: [...] "The video has the production values of the clearance bin at Family Dollar, and <b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> it works." [...] Slezak further described the set as a [...] "trunk full of mannequins, Cylon-y fringed sunglasses, and angry-lady dancing {{on display in the}} accompanying video". The video was ranked at number 13 on Black Entertainment Television's (BET's) Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
500|$|The video {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} media outlets. James Montgomery from MTV News {{commented that the}} video is [...] "grisly and garish, but also incredibly clever and visually arresting". T. Kyle writing for MTV Buzzworthy gave the video a positive feedback, writing [...] "Christina manages to be fun and provocative, the styling is beautiful and even aspirational, and Legendtina's body looks amazing". Sam Lansky from Idolator website complimented Aguilera's [...] "charming sense of humor" [...] and deemed [...] "Your Body" [...] as one of Aguilera's best music videos. Writing for Billboard, Jason Lipshut noted the video seemed to be inspired by the unending stream of violence on TV, but felt that Aguilera's clothing style in the video was the standout part. In {{a review of the}} video for Yahoo! Music, Lyndsey Park complimented the cultural references in the video, writing that [...] "it's enough to make even Seth MacFarlane or Dennis Miller's heads spin. And <b>yet,</b> <b>somehow,</b> it's all so very, very Xtina". Marc Hogan of Spin wrote that [...] "It might take us a few more viewings to get the joke, but at least there's enough amazing absurdity going on to make that prospect sound entertaining". On December 4, 2012, Fuse announced that [...] "Your Body" [...] was the number one video of 2012, based on online voting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the short}} film, the duo play [...] "Mac and Jack", {{a pair of}} conmen who sell a [...] "miracle potion". The {{salesman}} (McCartney) offers Jackson the potion, and claims that it is [...] "guaranteed {{to give you the}} strength of a raging bull". Jackson drinks the potion and challenges a large man to arm-wrestle. Unbeknownst to a watching crowd, the man—along with Linda—is also in on the scam. After Jackson wins the rigged contest, the crowd of people surge forward and buy the potion. Mac and Jack then donate all of the money earned from the scam to an orphanage. After this scene, McCartney and Jackson star as vaudeville performers who sing and dance at a bar. On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya. When law-enforcement officers appear {{at the back of the}} venue, Mac quickly starts a small fire onstage and Linda hollers [...] "FIRE!", emptying the venue and allowing the group to escape via backstage (<b>yet</b> <b>somehow</b> finding time to change into tuxedoes first). The video ends with Paul, Linda, and Michael as they drive off into the sunset. La Toya, who was handed a bunch of flowers by McCartney, is left at the roadside.|$|E
