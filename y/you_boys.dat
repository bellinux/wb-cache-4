500|$|Phineas and Ferb makes liberal use {{of running}} gags, and Phineas has several {{recurrent}} lines that are featured in most episodes. When {{he comes up}} with an idea of what adventure he and his brother are going to have that day, he says [...] "Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!" [...] During the course of an adventure, Phineas is generally asked by a disbelieving adult if he is not [...] "a little young to be..." [...] part of whatever occupation he is currently carrying out. For example, while constructing a shrine to his sister on the face of Mount Rushmore, a park ranger asks him [...] "Aren't <b>you</b> <b>boys</b> a little young to be restoring a national monument?" [...] Phineas generally answers [...] "Yes, yes I am," [...] though on a few occasions has responded [...] "No" [...] or [...] "Well, I don't think so." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / <b>You</b> <b>boys</b> better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / Something I can hold on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch your back / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel to it, all distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E

2500|$|The Doors were {{notorious for}} their {{appearance}} on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer Jim Morrison change the lyrics to their hit single [...] "Light My Fire" [...] by altering the line, [...] "Girl, we couldn't get much higher", before the band performed the song live on September 17, 1967. However, Morrison sang the original line, and on live television with no delay, CBS was powerless to stop it. They were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek, the band was told, [...] "Mr. Sullivan liked <b>you</b> <b>boys.</b> He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again." [...] Morrison replied with glee, [...] "Hey man, we just did the Sullivan show."—at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success. Manzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He {{has said that the}} band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident was re-enacted in the 1991 biographical film, The Doors.|$|E
