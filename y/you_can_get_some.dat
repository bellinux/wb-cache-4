500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It {{is going to be}} very cinematic and about as non-linear as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get.</b> <b>Some</b> levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E

I would like a chicken dinner myself, but as it is, I think I will enjoy a Mouse or two better. Pay my respects to Farmer Brown's boy when he comes in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "it's {{very much}} as I expected. With a {{sheltered}} landing here and as good a trail inland as they could find, it's not difficult to understand why those fellows were anxious that I should stand in with them, or, at least, leave them alone. This thing, of course, was meant as a warning." [...] Then he addressed the boys: [...] "You needn't wait. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> more of those branches sawed off in the slashing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my boy, you had best {{spend an}} hour in {{cleaning}} up your father's armour and arms.

6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what it is, Mopsey," [...] said Ben, after he had whispered with Johnny and Dickey, and they had nodded their heads as if agreeing with what he said, [...] "we'll give you our share of the theatre--'cause, of course, we can't spend any time actin', now that we've got the store, an' you an' Nelly can own it alone. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> other actors, an' we'll buy tickets every time you have a show, whether we can come or not." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{couple of}} years went by; then the {{original}} story--my own version--cropped up again and went floating around in the spelling, and with my name to it.

It's all in the game. Besides, I had learned, a good while before that, {{that it is not}} wise to keep the fire going under a slander unless <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> large advantage out of keeping it alive.

The road brings us bikers together and the brotherhood is all about like-minded people coming together to share the same passion. No one is alone on the highway and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> support <b>some</b> way or the other.|$|R

60|$|P.S. - Were {{all your}} {{privateer}}s voiceless {{in the war}} of 1812? Did NO ONE of them write memoirs? I shall have to do my privateer from chic, if you can't help me. My application to Scribner has been quite in vain.

6000|$|... "Now {{the first}} thing, mother, {{is to prevent}} dad from going out to-night. He must be kept out of it, {{whatever}} others do. I've brought a bottle of gin from Birmingham.

Get the cork out; he's sure to drink a glass or two anyhow, perhaps more, but it will send him off to sleep, sure enough. It's the strongest I could get, and he's out of the way of drink now. I don't suppose they'll miss him when they start; but if any one comes round for him, you tell 'em I brought him some Old Tom over, and that he's so dead sleepy he can't move. Later on, if <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> woman or child to come in, and let them see him, so that there'll be a witness he was at home when the thing came off, that'll make him safe.

5000|$|The north façade was rebuilt {{after the}} {{earthquake}} of 1907, the facade of which remains a buttressed base and a small corner portion.

From the inner courtyard <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> into <b>some</b> apartments, formerly used as stables and servants quarters and made habitable by the last heirs of his vassals i.e. Franceschelli in 1920, the cellars and the former prisons where there is a sandstone block with written [...] "Nolite nocere" [...] which means [...] "do not do this wicked thing." [...] From the courtyard there is a ramp that puts in the noble quarter divided into several private apartments and only one of them inhabited by the descendants of the feudal lords.

40|$|This paper analyzes what may have been a mistake by pianist Thelonious Monk playing a jazz solo in  1958. Even in a Monk composition designed for patterned mayhem,  a note can sound out of pattern. We reframe the question of whether the note was a mistake and ask instead about how Monk handles the problem. Amaz-ingly,  he replays the note into a new pattern that res-ituates its jarring effect in retrospect. The mistake,  or better,  the mis-take,  was “saved ”  by subsequent notes. Our analysis,  supported by reflections from jazz musi-cians and the philosopher John Dewey,  encourages a {{reformulation}} of plans,  takes,  and mis-takes as catego-ries for the interpretation of contingency,  surprise,  {{and repair}} in all human activities. A final section suggests that mistakes are essential to the practical plying and playing of knowledge into performances,  particularly those that highlight learning. A mistake {{is the most}} beautiful thing in the world. It is the only way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to <b>some</b> place you’ve never been before. I try to make as many as I can.
