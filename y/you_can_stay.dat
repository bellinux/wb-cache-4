500|$|Sibelius {{appears to}} have vacillated over {{a name for the}} new tone poem. By 3April 1914 he had dropped [...] in favor of [...] On 29April he wrote to Parker in favor of the {{original}} title ("Herr Doctor, now you must forgive me for performing the new tone poem in its final version with the original title [...] The version Aallottaret that I sent to <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> with Mr. Stoeckel".). This position, too, proved fleeting. By the end of May, Sibelius had settled on , and the tone poem appeared under this title, albeit misspelled, on the 4June Norfolk Festival program: [...] " [...] —Tone Poem (Nymphs of the Ocean)". In preparation for the publication of the tone poem by Breitkopf & Härtel in June 1915, Sibelius included alongside the Finnish title, , an [...] "explanatory" [...] German translation, [...] (in English: The Oceanides). The piece was published as Op.73 and dedicated to Mr. and Mrs. Carl Stoeckel.|$|E
500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew. [...] When asked about his roles, {{he was unable to}} explain why he was consistently cast as a bad guy, but said that he enjoyed it. [...] "I would never want to come in now and play a nice guy for three months. That would be dreadfully boring. This suits me fine. It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show." [...] He added, [...] "I don't love the character I play. If I met Todd on the street, I wouldn't say 'Hi' to him, but I do love playing this character." ...|$|E
500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E

2500|$|Speculative {{economic}} bubbles are {{an obvious}} anomaly, {{in that the}} market often appears {{to be driven by}} buyers operating on escalating market sentiment/ [...] irrational exuberance, who take little notice of underlying value. These bubbles are typically followed by an overreaction of frantic selling, allowing shrewd investors to buy stocks at bargain prices. Rational investors have difficulty profiting by shorting irrational bubbles because, {{in the words of a}} famous saying attributed to John Maynard Keynes, [...] "Markets can stay irrational longer than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>stay</b> solvent." [...] Sudden market crashes as happened on Black Monday in 1987 are mysterious from the perspective of efficient markets, but allowed as a rare statistical event under the weak-form of EMH. Benoit Mandelbrot has argued that market bubbles are not anomalous but rather characteristic of price dynamics described by power laws such as Pareto, Zipf [...] or Tracy-Widom [...] combined with persistence in price change trends.|$|E
