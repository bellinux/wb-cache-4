Relying on theory and practice, we will {{do our best to}} explain why church planting networks are critical to urban church planting movements. Caveat: We are not movement experts or church planting professionals. We won’t offer <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> on church planting, urban ministry, or CPMs today. However, what we hope to do is clarify what a movement is, how we are working towards it in Austin, and underscore the critical role of kingdom-minded networks in transforming the spiritual, social, and cultural fabric of a city. To that end we will cover four main areas: 1) Why a Network 2) The Vision of our C...|$|E

5000|$|After having passed Lyon {{during his}} journey, Yorick spends {{the night in}} a {{roadside}} inn. Because there is only one bedroom, he is forced to share the room with a lady and her chamber-maid ("fille de chambre"). When Yorick can't sleep and accidentally breaks his promise to remain silent during the night, an altercation with the lady ensues. During the confusion, Yorick accidentally grabs hold of something belonging to <b>the</b> chamber-maid. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> line is: [...] "when I stretch'd out my hand I caught hold of the fille de chambre's...End of vol II". The sentence is open to interpretation. <b>You</b> can say <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> is omitted, or that he stretched out his hand, and caught hers (this would be grammatically correct). Another interpretation is to incorporate 'End of Vol. II' into the sentence, so that he grabs the Fille de Chambre's 'End'.|$|R
500|$|The book {{begins with}} a {{quotation}} from Henry James, [...] "Never say <b>you</b> know <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> about any human heart." [...] A short preface (an anonymous editor suggests {{it was written in}} 1987) explains that the earliest pages have been lost, and recounts briefly Mountstuart's childhood in Montevideo, Uruguay before he moves to England aged seven with his English father and Uruguayan mother. In his final term at school he and two friends set challenges. Logan is to get on to the school's first XV rugby team; Peter Scabius has to seduce Tess, a local farmer's daughter; and Ben Leeping, a lapsed Jew, has to convert to Roman Catholicism. Mountstuart enters Oxford on an exhibition and leaves with a third in History. Settling in London, he enjoys early success as a writer with The Mind's Imaginings, a critically successful biography of Shelley; The Girl Factory, a salacious novel about prostitutes (which is [...] poorly reviewed but sells well); and Les Cosmopolites, a respectable book on some obscure French poets. Mountstuart's mother loses the family wealth in the Wall Street Crash. He embarks on a series of amorous encounters: he loses his virginity to Tess, is rejected by Land Fothergill whom he met at Oxford, and marries Lottie, an Earl's daughter. They live together at Thorpe Hall in Norfolk, where Mountstuart, unstimulated by slow country life and his warm but dull wife, becomes idle.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the next}} {{meeting of the}} club Chamier sounded the author a little about his poem. [...] "Mr. Goldsmith," [...] said he, [...] "what do <b>you</b> mean by <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> in <b>the</b> first line of your Traveler, 'remote, unfriended, solitary, slow?' do you mean {{tardiness}} of locomotion?" [...] "Yes," [...] replied Goldsmith inconsiderately, being probably flurried at the moment. [...] "No, sir," [...] interposed his protecting friend Johnson, [...] "you did not mean tardiness of locomotion; you meant that sluggishness of mind which comes upon a man in solitude." [...] "Ah," [...] exclaimed Goldsmith, [...] "that was what I meant." [...] Chamier immediately believed that Johnson himself had written the line, and a rumor became prevalent {{that he was the}} author of many of the finest passages. This was ultimately set at rest by Johnson himself, who marked with a pencil all the verses he had contributed, nine in number, inserted toward the conclusion, and by no means the best in the poem. He moreover, with generous warmth, pronounced it the finest poem that had appeared since the days of Pope.|$|R
6000|$|One {{legacy of}} his mother's Pen remembered, of which Laura could have no cognisance. It was that wish of Helen's {{to make some}} present to Fanny Bolton; and Pen wrote to her, putting his letter under an {{envelope}} to Mr. Bows, and requesting that gentleman to read it before he delivered it to Fanny. [...] "Dear Fanny," [...] Pen said, [...] "I have to acknowledge two letters from you, {{one of which was}} delayed in my illness" [...] (Pen found the first letter in his mother's desk after her decease and the reading it gave him a strange pang), [...] "and to thank you, my kind nurse and friend, who watched me so tenderly during my fever. And I have to tell <b>you</b> that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>words</b> of my dear mother who is no more, were words of goodwill and gratitude to you for nursing me: and she said she would have written to you, had she had time--that she would like to ask your pardon if she had harshly treated you--and that she would beg you to show your forgiveness by accepting some token of friendship and regard from her." [...] Pen concluded by saying that his friend, George Warrington, Esq., of Lamb Court, Temple, was trustee of a little sum of money, of which the interest would be paid to her until she became of age, or changed her name, which would always be affectionately remembered by her grateful friend, A. Pendennis. The sum was in truth but small, although enough to make a little heiress of Fanny Bolton, whose parents were appeased, and whose father said Mr. P. had acted quite as the gentleman--though Bows growled out that that to plaster a wounded heart with a banknote was an easy kind of sympathy; and poor Fanny felt only too clearly that Pen's letter was one of farewell.|$|R

"Now, you see, {{you don't}} {{do this thing}} a bit better than you did a {{fortnight}} ago, and I'll tell <b>you</b> what's <b>the</b> reason. <b>You</b> want to learn accounts--that's well and good. But you think all you need do to learn accounts is {{to come to me}} and do sums for an hour or so, two or three times a-week; and no sooner do you get your caps on and turn out of doors again than <b>you</b> sweep <b>the</b> whole thing clean out of your mind. You go whistling about, and take no more care what you're thinking of than if your heads were gutters for any rubbish to swill through that {{happened to be in the}} way; and if you get a good notion in 'em, it's pretty soon washed out again. You think knowledge is to be got cheap--you'll come and pay Bartle Massey sixpence a-week, and he'll make you clever at figures without your taking any trouble. But knowledge isn't to be got with paying sixpence, let me tell you. If you're to know figures, you must turn 'em over in your heads and keep your thoughts fixed on 'em. There's nothing you can't turn into a sum, for there's nothing but what's got number in it--even a fool. You may say to yourselves, 'I'm one fool, and Jack's another; if my fool's head weighed four pound, and Jack's three pound three ounces and three quarters, how many pennyweights heavier would my head be than Jack's?' A man that had got his heart in learning figures would make sums for himself and work 'em in his head. When he sat at his shoemaking, he'd count his stitches by fives, and then put a price on his stitches, say half a farthing, and then see how much money he could get in an hour; and then ask himself how much money he'd get in a day at that rate; and then how much ten workmen would get working three, or twenty, or a hundred years at that rate--and all the while his needle would be going just as fast as if he left his head empty for the devil to dance in. But the long and the short of it is--I'll have nobody in my night-school that doesn't strive to learn what he comes to learn, as hard as if he was striving to get out of a dark hole into broad daylight. I'll send no man away because he's stupid: if Billy Taft, the idiot, wanted to learn anything, I'd not refuse to teach him. But I'll not throw away good knowledge on people who think they can get it by the sixpenn'orth, and carry it away with 'em as they would an ounce of snuff. So never come to me again, if you can't show that you've been working with your own heads, instead of thinking that you can pay for mine to work for <b>you.</b> That's <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> I've got to say to you." ...|$|R
