500|$|Nude per l'assassino {{has been}} met with mixed to {{negative}} reviews. Writing for AllMovie, Jason Buchanan rated the film two stars out of five, calling it [...] "unabashedly sadistic". Budd Wilkins, writing for Slant magazine, rated the film three stars out of five, calling it [...] "one {{of the more}} sordid examples" [...] of the giallo genre. Wilkins noted that the film's violence [...] "isn't necessarily stronger than in contemporary giallo films like Argento's Deep Red", {{but that it is}} [...] "more resolutely tied to aberrant sexuality than almost anywhere else in the genre". Wilkins also compared the film's central premise—that of revenge for a failed abortion—to that of Massimo Dallamano's 1972 film What Have <b>You</b> <b>Done</b> <b>to</b> Solange?. DVD Talk's Adam Tyner also gave the film two stars out of five, summarising it as [...] "not much of a movie". Tyner noted that Nude per l'assassino [...] "doesn't set out to be revered as an artistic triumph", and described it as [...] "worth at least a rental" [...] for fans of the genre.|$|E

500|$|As Charles {{was always}} trying to find {{elements}} that were unusual in sitcoms, the episode had a scene in which Jerry dreams he is interrogated by the FBI for his illegal cable hookup, and is killed when he tries to escape. Charles recalled the dream sequence as [...] "one of the most ambiguous scenes we did [...] " [...] and felt it was very Tarantino-like. At the end of the dream Kramer holds Jerry in his arm, stating [...] "what have <b>you</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> my little cable boy?"; this scene had to be filmed multiple times, as it was hard for Seinfeld not to laugh when Richards stated the line. In audio commentary he recorded for the Seinfeld: Volume 1 DVD set, Charles noted how he established three of the episode's four storylines in one scene, in which the characters eat and talk at Monk's Cafe. [...] "The Baby Shower" [...] also {{is one of the few}} episodes of season two in which the primary storylines of all four characters come together in the final scene. In [...] "The Busboy", which had been filmed earlier, the four storylines also intersected in the final scene, but the episode aired as the final episode of season two. Charles also felt the episode defined the Kramer character more, as it is the first episode in which Kramer speaks out against the system. In addition, the episode also establishes Elaine's interest in the Kennedys, a plot element that would return later in the season four episode [...] "The Virgin".|$|E
