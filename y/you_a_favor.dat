6000|$|... "But from my {{respect for}} you, Signer Merreek, {{and from my}} daughter's love for your nieces--the brave and {{beautiful}} signorini--I shall dare to ask from <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> But already I am aware {{that we do not}} deserve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then King Angus said: [...] "As to {{the matter}} of {{granting}} <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> that I would do in any case for the love I bear you. So let me hear {{what it is that}} you have to ask of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Good evening, Cousin Meadow Mouse,' said Mr. Wharf Rat, {{swinging}} a bag {{down from his}} shoulder. 'Will <b>you</b> do <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> for me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And will <b>you,</b> as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> to <b>a</b> {{neighbor}} {{and an old}} friend, do whatsoever you may toward releasing the unfortunate man?" [...] General Herkimer insisted.|$|R
6000|$|... "And as to you, sir," [...] {{said the}} doctor, {{who had a}} very rough, abrupt way of speaking, [...] "I have to thank <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> done me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Emily, may I ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> {{before you}} go? I am {{only one of}} the masters {{employed}} in the school; but I don't think--let me say, I hope I am not guilty of presumption--if I offer to be of some small service to one of my pupils--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{willing to}} do <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> {{particularly}} as I want something to show my friends in Canada that I brought the packet safe. But I'm {{not going to put}} myself to much inconvenience. You have written the letters. Let me have them; I must catch my train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it willingly, Dick, {{and there}} won't be {{any time to}} pay for, even if it takes a week!" [...] cried Dan Baxter. [...] "I am glad {{to be able to}} do <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> indeed I am!" [...] And he gazed admiringly at the oldest Rover boy. [...] "Just you come with me." ...|$|E
5000|$|A: Well, why don't <b>you</b> do me <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> ... why don't <b>you</b> {{go to the}} devotees and {{ask their}} {{explanation}} about it? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} fancy it is necessary," [...] {{said the}} girl, {{with a little}} smile. [...] "Still, I {{have something to tell}} <b>you,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> to ask. Ferris has left Silverdale, and you must never make any attempt to discover what caused the fire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{father has}} looked tired {{during the last}} hour," [...] she said aside. [...] "I have been warned that {{excitement}} may prove dangerous, but hardly care {{to remind him of}} it. Would <b>you,</b> as <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> to me, persuade him to return home with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. It's {{apt to be}} a very {{baffling}} time at the best. All the {{men that}} you like are taken up with their own people, and even the men that you don't like overvalue themselves, and think they're doing <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> if they give you a turn at the Gym or bring you a plate of something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{she does}} it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall mind much. She {{is the sort of}} woman who knows how to rule well. In fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was doing <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> all the while." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} go alone," [...] {{declared}} Thurston, doggedly. [...] "You can choose between my company {{and that of}} my assistant. And you shall not go until you rest. Further, I must ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> Will you receive Mrs. Leslie until I have seen her and arranged for her return? There is no married rancher within some distance, and I cannot well bring her here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Half an hour’s {{talk with}} you cool and comfortable, in the office,” said the red-bearded man. “We’d like some drink—the Contrack doesn’t begin yet, Peachey, so you needn’t look—but what we really want is advice. We don’t want money. We ask <b>you</b> as <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> because <b>you</b> did us <b>a</b> bad turn about Degumber.” ...|$|R

50|$|What {{do you do}} {{when your}} neighbors are a bunch of hit men, con men, and mad dog murderers? Well, if you're Moose Flanagan, you ask the most notorious convict of them all, Al Capone, for help. But when that convict comes through for you and then asks <b>you</b> for <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> in return {{suddenly}} it's a whole different scenario.|$|R
6000|$|... "That ends our business, then, for the present," [...] he said. [...] "Now I {{am going}} to ask both of <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> Perhaps I have no right to, but {{as a man of}} honor, Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, you can take it from me that I ask it in your {{interests}} as well as my own. Don't tell the Count von Hern of my visit to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Hall," [...] she said, {{with a faint}} {{attempt at}} a smile, [...] "we are old friends, and I feel I can ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> You once before acted as our escort--it was for a short but a happy time--will you accept a larger trust? My father is busy in Sacramento for the mine: will you, without saying {{anything}} to anybody, take Jessie and me back at once to Devil's Ford?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you see, I {{have several}} dresses," [...] Isobel said gravely, [...] "and I cannot say until the morning arrives which I may wear; it will depend {{a good deal}} how I feel. Besides, I might object to your wearing {{the same color as}} I do. You {{remember}} in the old times, knights, when they entered the lists, wore the favors that ladies had given them. Now I have no idea of giving <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> You have done nothing worthy of it. When you have won the Victoria Cross, and distinguished yourself by some extraordinarily gallant action, it will be quite time to think about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I say I {{was going}} to hang him? I never saw such people as you. What's the difference? <b>You</b> ask <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> and then <b>you</b> ain't {{satisfied}} when you get it. Before or after's all one--you know how the trial will go. He killed the nigger. Say--I must be going. If your mate {{would like to come}} to the hanging, fetch him along. I like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{continued}} her husband; [...] "in giving the living to Frank <b>you</b> did me <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> equal {{to what you}} would have done had he been my own child; and unsolicited, too, my lord, it was an additional compliment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs Null," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "I want to implore <b>you</b> to do <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> for me. I don't {{see how it}} can be disagreeable to you, and I am sure it will confer the {{greatest}} possible obligation upon me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The little {{marquise}} stared {{an instant}} at the velvet ledge of the balcony, and then murmured, [...] "Not {{a man of}} stone, a man of wood." [...] Newman had taken her husband's empty chair. She made no protest, and then she turned suddenly and laid her closed fan upon his arm. [...] "I am very glad you came in," [...] she said. [...] "I want to ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> I wanted to do so on Thursday, at my mother-in-law's ball, but you would give me no chance. You were in such very good spirits that I thought you might grant my little favor then; not that you look particularly doleful now. It is something you must promise me; {{now is the time}} to take you; after you are married you will be good for nothing. Come, promise!" ...|$|E
5000|$|One good turn deserves another: If {{someone has}} done <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> {{you should be}} willing to do her or him a {{comparable}} favor if and when he or she should need one.|$|E
5000|$|While {{in captivity}} of the Weapon X offshoot, the Native was {{operated}} on by Doctor Vapor, who removed genetic material {{from her to}} be sold to other parties and discovered that the Native’s accelerated physiology had resulted in a pregnancy from her liaison with Wolverine. Wolverine killed Doctor Vapor and left with the Native. However, the pair were watched by Sabretooth who promised to finish what he started. Tracking the couple, Sabretooth revealed Native's condition, defeated Wolverine and subsequently killed the Native which also resulted in the death of their unborn child. Logan wakes up and tracks Native once again to find her dead corpse. It had a note written in her blood from Victor Creed, saying: [...] "I did <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> runt - you can thank me later." [...] Wolverine is reduced to tears.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Barker curled {{her pretty}} lip. [...] "It doesn't take very long to lend ten {{thousand}} dollars!" [...] she said. [...] "But that's what I always tell you. You have about made me sick by singing {{the praises of}} those wonderful partners of yours, and here <b>you</b> ask <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> {{of one of them}} and he tells you to sell your securities! And you know, and he knows, they're worth next to nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Oh, I don't know,' says Whiskers. 'I guess Little Old New York {{can take}} care of herself. I guess I know a man that's on the square when I see him. I've always found the Western people all right. I ask <b>you</b> as <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> Mr. Peters,' says he, 'to keep that roll in your pocket for me. I know a gentleman when I see him. And now let's have some more beer.' ...|$|R
5000|$|After Star Trek, he {{appeared}} in the comedy short Boutonniere (2009). It [...] "...was a movie {{written and directed by}} my former landlady and friend, Coley Sohn. She called up and said, Would <b>you</b> do me <b>a</b> <b>favor</b> and be in my short film?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Burke's {{entrepreneurial}} activities included {{cooking and}} selling barbecued chicken sandwiches backstage, {{as well as}} sandwiches, soft drinks, and fried chickens at increasingly inflated prices to other performers who were refused service at restaurants on the Chitlin' circuit in the [...] "Jim Crow" [...] South. According to Sam Moore of the soul duo Sam & Dave, [...] "He gave me one pork chop, one scoop of macaroni and cheese, and one spoonful of gravy. I said, ‘Is that it?’ And he’d say, [...] "That’s it, brother. I’m doing <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor,</b> so {{take it or leave}} it." [...] Trombonist Fred Wesley was one who was critical of Burke's business practices. [...] Burke demanded and operated the concessions at the Apollo Theater when he performed there in 1966. This was very profitable for him but so enraged the owner Frank Schiffman that he was banned from performing at the Apollo for life. After playing at the reopening of The Cavern Club in Liverpool in July 1966, Burke said: “The Cavern was a great place to play. The groove was there, the people were there, and it was wonderful. I remember them selling hot Pepsis. What a mistake - you gotta put ice in those things. Think of how many more they could have sold with ice in them." ...|$|E
5000|$|According {{to friends}} and colleagues, the ISI warned the {{journalist}} {{at least three times}} prior to his death. In October 2010, Shahzad was summoned to ISI headquarters the day after publishing a sensitive article on Abdul Ghani Baradar's capture. Afterwards he wrote to Human Rights Watch (HRW) predicting that he might be detained by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency. According to HRW's Ali Dayan Hasan, he was [...] "fairly sure that sooner or later something was going to happen". Shahzad informed Hasan in an email that he was threatened by an ISI official who had said: [...] "I must give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> We have recently arrested a terrorist and recovered a lot of data, diaries and other material during the interrogation. The terrorist had a list with him. If I find your name in the list, I will certainly let you know." [...] In a June 2011 opinion piece for The News International, journalist Ahmed Quraishi stated the [...] "agency's version is very straightforward: they met Shahzad at a registered government office about a story he did and asked him either to confirm his sources or retract the story because it damaged Pakistani interests." [...] Nine days prior to his disappearance, Shahzad met with American journalist Dexter Filkins and told him, [...] "Look, I'm in danger... I've {{got to get out of}} Pakistan." ...|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Lottie 2 ̆ 7 s Market Basket {{was more than}} a grocery store. A meeting place, a wailing wall, a place to borrow, Lottie was always there, the good {{listener}} with an open purse. She knew all the gossip and called all the local politicians by their first names so she could, when the occasion arose, do <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>favor.</b> Campaign posters plastered the store windows and every charity drive was represented. After school, children pressed against the candy counter and found their pennies garnered more than at any other store. When the small bell over the door gave warning of a customer, Lottie would call a greeting, her unlined face stretched into a smile. Above the counter, her body appeared small and dainty, but when she hobbled out to teeter awkwardly between the helter-skelter stacks of crates around the store, her heavy bottom rocked...|$|E
