500|$|Eleven people, {{including}} three British, were interviewed in December. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions, including [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> Madeleine?" [...] and [...] "Where did you hide the body?" [...] Robert Murat, {{his wife and}} her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club {{around the time of}} the disappearance. They admitted having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.|$|E
500|$|Libby {{is one of}} the few main {{characters}} not to have a centric episode detailing her life before the crash. The writers said a reason for killing the character was so they could explore her backstory in a mysterious and posthumous way. The producers intended to explore Libby's backstory through flashbacks in the show's third season, and later in the fourth season, although her character did not appear. Although she appeared in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", her backstory was not explored. In September 2008, the writers stated her backstory would probably be explored in the fifth season; however, Lindelof revealed in May 2009 her story would not be explored any further, saying, [...] "I have learned that if <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> someone off the show, they are less likely to cooperate with you". The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments, and they could not reveal Libby's story without her.|$|E
500|$|Bundy also {{confided in}} Special Agent William Hagmaier of the FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit. Hagmaier {{was struck by}} the [...] "deep, almost mystical satisfaction" [...] that Bundy took in murder. [...] "He said that after a while, murder is not just a crime of lust or violence", Hagmaier related. [...] "It becomes possession. They are part of you ... becomes a part of you, and you [...] are forever one ... and the grounds where <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> them or leave them become sacred to you, and you will always be drawn back to them." [...] Bundy told Hagmaier that he {{considered}} himself to be an [...] "amateur", an [...] "impulsive" [...] killer in his early years, before moving into what he termed his [...] "prime" [...] or [...] "predator" [...] phase at about the time of Lynda Healy's murder in 1974. This implied that he began killing well before 1974—though he never explicitly admitted doing so.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene when}} Walter pleads with Gus {{demonstrates}} the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse. During that scene, Walter tells Gus, [...] "You kill me, you have nothing. <b>You</b> <b>kill</b> Jesse, you don't have me." [...] Jesse is visibly {{moved by the}} statement, which Aaron Paul described as [...] "the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt's loyalty is to Jesse." [...] "Box Cutter" [...] also illustrated Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to break into Walter's house, {{going so far as}} to use her baby as a prop in her facade. After Skyler breaks into Walter's apartment, she finds the plastic eyeball of a teddy bear that has been part of the series since the second season. The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter's gradual descent into a life of crime, and Skyler's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent.|$|E
500|$|Other {{elements}} {{came into}} the story design. Levine {{had an interest in}} [...] "stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [...] ". In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run, representing societies that have [...] "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people". The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like The Manchurian Candidate, as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon [...] "Would you kindly" [...] after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> people, even innocent people, to survive?", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.|$|E
500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – but they said, 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> Den.' I don't agree with censorship {{but there has to}} be a level of responsibility." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1510, a {{group of}} Dominican friars arrived in Santo Domingo led by Pedro de Córdoba; appalled by the injustices they saw {{committed}} by the slaveowners against the Indians, they decided to deny slave owners the right to confession. Las Casas was among those denied confession for this reason. In December 1511, a Dominican preacher Fray Antonio de Montesinos preached a fiery sermon that implicated the colonists in the genocide of the native peoples. He {{is said to have}} preached, [...] "Tell me by what right of justice do you hold these Indians in such a cruel and horrible servitude? On what authority have you waged such detestable wars against these people who dealt quietly and peacefully on their own lands? Wars in which you have destroyed such an infinite number of them by homicides and slaughters never heard of before. Why do you keep them so oppressed and exhausted, without giving them enough to eat or curing them of the sicknesses they incur from the excessive labor you give them, and they die, or rather <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> them, in order to extract and acquire gold every day." [...] Las Casas himself argued against the Dominicans in favour of the justice of the encomienda. The colonists, led by Diego Columbus, dispatched a complaint against the Dominicans to the King, and the Dominicans were recalled from Hispaniola.|$|E
500|$|Kung Fu Hustle makes {{references}} {{to a wide}} range of films, animated cartoons, wuxia novels and other sources. Sing and Bone resemble George Milton and Lennie Small from the 1992 film Of Mice and Men. The housing arrangement of the Pig Sty Alley is similar to that of a 1973 Hong Kong film, The House of 72 Tenants. There are two {{references to}} Chow's previous film, Shaolin Soccer. [...] When Sing arrives at Pig Sty Alley, he plays skillfully with a soccer ball, then says, [...] "You're still playing football?". The second reference is the scene in which a clerk beats Sing up on a bus. The clerk also appeared in Shaolin Soccer as the leader of an opposing team who used hidden weapons to beat up the Shaolin soccer team. When Sing challenges a boy in the Pig Sty Alley, Sing calls him [...] "The Karate Kid", a reference to the 1984 film of the same name. During the altercation between Sing and the hairdresser, the hairdresser states, [...] "Even if <b>you</b> <b>kill</b> me, there will be thousands more of me!". This is a reference to a famous quote made by Lu Haodong, a Chinese revolutionary in the late Qing Dynasty. The scene in which Sing is chased by the Landlady as he flees from the Alley is a homage to Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner, characters in the Looney Tunes cartoons, even including the pursuer's (the Landlady's) ill fate. In the scene in which Sing robs the ice cream vendor, a poster for the 1935 film Top Hat is in the background. As Sing arrives at the door to the Beast's cell in the mental asylum, he hallucinates a large wave of blood rushing from the cell door, similar to a scene in The Shining. The Landlady says at one point, [...] "Tomorrow is another day," [...] which is a line from the 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and its 1939 film adaptation.|$|E
