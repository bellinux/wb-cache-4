2500|$|The Wu Shu {{recorded}} that Sun Ce once led {{a military}} expedition against the Shanyue and {{ventured into the}} hills alone after slaying the Shanyue chief and sending his men to pursue and destroy the remaining Shanyue forces. He encountered Yu Fan, who asked him where his bodyguards were. When Sun Ce {{told him that he}} had ordered his bodyguards to join the rest of his men in attacking the Shanyue, Yu Fan exclaimed, [...] "This is so dangerous!" [...] He then asked Sun Ce to dismount from his horse and said, [...] "The terrain here is deep and dangerous. You can't control your horse well under such conditions, so you should travel on foot, guide your horse along, and arm <b>yourself</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bow and arrows. I'm good in using a spear and I'll lead the way." [...] After reaching flat ground, Sun Ce mounted his horse again and asked Yu Fan, [...] "You don't have a horse. What are you going to do?" [...] Yu Fan replied, [...] "I can travel on foot. I'm capable of travelling 300 li in a day. Since the start of the campaigns, no one has been able to match my pace. You can try letting a horse run and I'll catch up with it on foot." [...] They encountered a signaller at the main road. Sun Ce took the signaller's horn and blew it. His men recognised the sound of the horn and rushed there to join him. They patrolled the area and pacified the three commanderies.|$|E
