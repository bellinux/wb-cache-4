Millesime was unhappy with {{certain aspects of the}} story, for instance wanting the entire Lyme sequence removed because they considered it [...] "too boring". WGBH gave the BBC detailed notes, which were then integrated into the script. One change concerned the ending. To display the climax when Anne and Wentworth finally approach each other with their feelings, two different scenes were shot, one in which they kiss and one in which they do not. Dear first wrote a scene closely modelled after Austen's ending: Anne reunites with Wentworth on the streets of Bath, and the two exchange words and hold hands. Eaton felt that after hours of waiting, audiences [...] "would go nuts with frustration and irritation" [...] if the two did not kiss. Eaton also thought [...] "a kiss would be an emotional pay-off", and WGBH believed it would give the film a wider appeal. Michell agreed to compromise, opting to shoot one British version and one American version—the latter included the kiss. The American ending is reflected on the international poster, which shows the two protagonists embracing. While the kiss attracted some criticism among fans, actress Amanda Root defended it. [...] "After the great suspense of the story, by the end you're desperate for Anne and Captain Wentworth to get together, desperate! Film is a visual medium, after all. You don't necessarily want to see them in bed together, but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see something like a kiss", she said.|$|E

[...] With which, however, as he simply met this spontaneity in a manner {{to show that he}} had often had it from young persons of her race, and that he was {{familiar}} even with the possibilities of their familiarity, she felt her freedom rendered vain by his silence, and she immediately tried to think of the most reasonable thing she could say. This would be, precisely, on the subject of that freedom, which she now quickly spoke of as complete. [...] "That's of course by itself a great boon; so please don't think I don't know it. I can do exactly what I like--anything in all the wide world. I haven't a creature to ask--there's not a finger to stop me. I can shake about till I'm black and blue. That perhaps isn't all joy; but lots of people, I know, would like to try it." [...] He had appeared about to put a question, but then had let her go on, which she promptly did, for she understood him the next moment as having thus taken it from her that her means were as great as might be. She had simply given it to him so, and this was all that would ever pass between them on the odious head. Yet she couldn't help also knowing that an important effect, for his judgment, or at least for his amusement--which was his feeling, since, marvellously, he did have feeling--was produced by it. All her little pieces had now then fallen together for him like the morsels of coloured glass that used to make combinations, under the hand, in the depths of one of the polygonal peepshows of childhood.

In reality, I am a person first, just like you, and would prefer to be called by my name.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is easy to}} {{underestimate}} the difficulties of using floating-point numbers in programming. This is especially the case in pre-university informatics education and competitions, where one is often {{led to believe that}} floating-point arithmetic is a good approximation of the real number system. However, most of the mathematical laws valid for real numbers break down when applied to floating-point numbers. We explain this break-down and illustrate it with four simple examples. In informatics education and competitions, the students need to be trained, programming assignments need to be formulated, submitted programs need to be evaluated, and variations among computing platforms need to be handled. We show that the use of floating-point numbers gives rise to various kinds of non-trivial difficulties in all these areas. Coping with such difficulties would require that teachers, students, and organizers gain experience in numerical mathematics. We strongly recommend to avoid the use of floating-point numbers in pre-university education and competitions whenever possible. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> use floating-point numbers, then study the literature of numerical mathematics and be prepared to do a convincing error analysis. Key words: informatics education, informatics competitions, floating-point arithmetic, numerical mathematics...|$|E

Designing an effective, relevant and ethical project, working effectively with international partners, and disseminating a useful product are just a few of the important issues that students will encounter as they plan their work abroad. This Student Handbook represents over a year of collaborative work between U-M students across disciplines. Our intent is to offer a roadmap for planning projects abroad, with advice on multiple levels — from the logistics of paying for your trip and staying safe, to broader issues such as ethics and sustainability. With the support and encouragement of the Center for Global Health, every stage in the development of this resource was led by students – from the identification needs to the drafting of content. We encourage students and faculty at schools around the world to adapt and improve upon our work. We ask that you, as a matter of courtesy, inform us about these adaptations so that we can learn from others as we continue to address critical health issues through research and action. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> adapt the handbook, find other people interested in similar issues, or stay current on related resources — please join our Google site...|$|E
40|$|Blue-White-Red, {{an example}} Agile process: Blue-White-Red {{is a simple}} Agile system {{originated}} by Liz Sedley and myself for a London company transitioning to Agile development. There wasn’t {{a great deal of}} up front thought that went into this system, we just started trying to approximate XP (Beck 2000) and at first it was a poor approximation. We modified our process as we went along. Looking back there is a heavy Scrum (Schwaber and Beedle 2002) influence but mainly this is what worked for us. This process originated at one company and eventually Liz and myself left the company and went our separate ways. We both took the same basic process and implemented it elsewhere with modifications. This description also draws on our experience, since so although I’ve described it as one company it is more of a composite image. I {{have come to the conclusion}} that you can’t just take an Agile, or any other, process off the shelf and use it. You have to create a process that works for you. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take an existing process and implement it then you are going to need help. In fact I would go as far as saying I doubt you can actually implement XP unless you actually have Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham or one of the other process authors actually on your team.
