2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies. [...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. I think about it all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E

2500|$|While in New York, she got {{involved}} in voice acting at 4Kids Entertainment and NYAV Post with English parts in anime dubs. Her first ever anime role was in Magical Doremi, which did not air on television, and her first anime television role was with Yu-Gi-Oh! GX where she voiced Alice, and later Yubel, which was her first major anime role. In an interview {{she said that she}} would get instructions on how to voice the character based on a brief description and sometimes a picture of the character. Prior to voicing in anime, she was only aware of a few titles such as Dragon Ball Z which her brother liked, and Sailor Moon which her friends liked. She said [...] "It's surreal because I took the original role (in Yu-Gi-Oh) because I liked the character and, of course, as an actor <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but it came with this bonus of all these fans. It's amazing to be part of such a close-knit excited community." [...] She would later voice in Pokémon as well as cartoons such as Winx Club and Chaotic.|$|E

6000|$|My {{idea was}} that, {{in a case}} like this, it's no good trying opposition.

5000|$|He {{received}} a B.A. in English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he developed interests in history, philosophy and architecture. It {{was at this}} time that he saw Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove {{and fell in love with}} movies. In a recent L.A. Weekly interview, he describes the film's impact on him: [...] "It said to my whole generation of filmmakers that you could make an individual statement of high integrity and have that film be successfully seen by a mass audience all at the same time. In other words, you didn't have to be making Seven Brides for Seven Brothers if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the mainstream film industry, or be reduced to niche filmmaking if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be serious about cinema. So that's what Kubrick meant, aside from the fact that Strangelove was a revelation." [...] His daughter Ami Canaan Mann is also a film director and producer.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} two {{conventions}} to define these matrices, {{depending on whether}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with column vectors or row vectors. Different graphics libraries have different preferences here. OpenGL prefers column vectors, DirectX row vectors. The decision determines from which side the point vectors are to be multiplied by the transformation matrices. For column vectors, the multiplication is performed from the right, ie , where vout and vin are 4x1 colum vectors. The concatenation of the matrices also is done from the right to left, ie, for example , when first rotating and then shifting.|$|E
