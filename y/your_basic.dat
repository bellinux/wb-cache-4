I'm <b>your</b> <b>basic</b> offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that." [...] Beatles producer George Martin stated: [...] "Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life", although Martin later added, [...] "He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier." [...] Starr commented: [...] "I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: [...] "I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to {{be good enough to}} fill it." ...|$|E
500|$|Metacritic had 81 {{favourable}} reviews out of 100 {{for both}} the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions; the GameCube version received 77 favorable reviews. Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the interaction with stages {{as one of the}} best parts of the game, commenting that it adds more strategy to the combat. He praised the return of [...] "classic characters", commenting on their new designs and how different their attacks are. Jeremy Dunham of IGN wrote that it was the best game of the Mortal Kombat series. He also stated that the removal of special move buttons, which caused too much damage to an opponent, was one of the developer's best decisions. With the special moves removed from the fights, and the addition of Breakers, players are now able to stop any combo. However, he called character designs in Deception [...] "robotic" [...] in comparison to other fighting games such as the Dead or Alive series or Virtua Fighter 4. The soundtrack was also criticized for having [...] "basic sound effects". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin commented that the fights have been highly improved with the addition of new fighting styles which: [...] "is clearly inspired by kung fu movies". Although he stated the fights were not perfect and noted they could end in a few seconds due to the interaction with the arenas, he liked how painful and funny some moves looked. TeamXbox's Dale Nardozzi praised the characters' animations and movements, adding that the soundtrack: [...] "sets the tone perfectly for <b>your</b> <b>basic,</b> disembowelments, decapitations, and impalements." ...|$|E

500|$|Written by musicians Cory Lerios and George Gabriel, the show's {{theme song}} [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] (also known as [...] "Call Me, Beep Me! (The Kim Possible Song)" [...] or simply [...] "The Kim Possible Song") is {{performed}} by American recording artist Christina Milian. Having already {{been working for}} Disney Channel at the time, appearing as a correspondent on the network's miniseries Movie Surfers after declining an offer to appear on their variety show The Mickey Mouse Club, Milian learned about Kim Possible from Disney when the studio called her in recruitment of an artist to record the new show's theme song. After meeting with the songwriters, who then proceeded to write the song, for the first time, Milian returned to the studio to record [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] one week later. Romano also contributed vocals to the song. Described as a Motown-influenced R and teen pop track, [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] is heard during the show's opening title sequence, encouraging viewers and listeners to contact Kim for assistance should they ever find themselves in difficult situations, featuring the lyrics [...] "Danger or trouble, I'm there on the double." [...] The sounds of mobile devices and modern-day technology are incorporated throughout the song. Although [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] begins [...] "I'm <b>your</b> <b>basic,</b> average girl" [...] in reference to Kim, these lyrics are paradoxical because there is little basic or average about its protagonist. A music video was released for [...] "Call Me, Beep Me", which features Milian and Romano recording the song in the recording studio interspersed with short scenes from the series.|$|E

2500|$|Bart Simpson's Escape from Camp Deadly has {{received}} mixed to negative reviews. Nintendo Power {{gave it a}} 3.4/5 rating in 1991.

It's <b>your</b> <b>basic</b> side-scrolling platformer with little to no connection to the source material and lasts only about few hours at best. During the game you come across bullies, camp counselors and even a few wild animals, battling them with spitballs, a boomerang and, in the lunchroom level, food. This one is for completists only." [...] Matt Williamson of the Rocky Mountain News gave the game a C+ grade and commented that [...] "Escape from Camp Deadly tries too hard to be a Nintendo game. It's hard, I know, to try to make game graphics more primitive, but please, guys, the more complex you make the graphics, the more confusing a game gets!" [...] However, the Channel 4 video game programme GamesMaster gave the game an 89% rating.|$|E

Patton, Eisenhower wrote to Montgomery: [...] "Am delighted that <b>your</b> <b>basic</b> plan has begun brilliantly to unfold with Bradley's initial success". The success of Cobra was aided by Operation Spring when the II Canadian Corps under General Guy Simonds (the only Canadian general whose skill Montgomery respected) began an offensive south of Caen that made little headway, but which the Germans regarded as the main offensive. Once the 3rd American Army arrived, Bradley was promoted to take command of the newly created 12th Army Group consisting of 1st and 3rd American Armies. Following the American breakout, there followed the Battle of Falaise Gap as the British, Canadian and Polish soldiers of 21st Army Group commanded by Montgomery advanced south while the American and French soldiers of Bradley's 12th Army Group advanced north to encircle the German Army Group B at Falaise as Montgomery waged what Urban called [...] "a huge battle of annihilation" [...] in August 1944. Montgomery began his offensive into the Suisse Normande region with Operation Bluecoat with Richard O'Connor's VIII Corps and Gerard Bucknall's XXX Corps heading south. A dissatisfied Montgomery sacked Bucknall for being insufficiently aggressive and replaced him with General Brian Horrocks. At the same time, Montgomery ordered that Patton whose Third Army was supposed to advance into Brittany to send only minimal forces and instead ordered that Patton was to capture Nantes, which was soon taken.|$|E
