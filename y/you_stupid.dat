5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy <b>You</b> <b>Stupid</b> Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, <b>you</b> <b>stupid</b> idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schulz {{also added}} some fantastical characters, {{sometimes}} imbuing inanimate objects with sparks of life. Charlie Brown's nemesis, the Kite-Eating Tree, is one example. Sally Brown's school building, that expressed {{thoughts and feelings}} about the students (and the general business of being a brick building), is another. Linus' famous [...] "security blanket" [...] also displayed occasional signs of anthropomorphism. Another example is Charlie Brown's pitching mound, which at times would express thoughts and opinions ("Why don't {{you learn how to}} pitch, <b>you</b> <b>stupid</b> kid?").|$|E
2500|$|Otto's scenes, {{and those}} with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script {{had gone to the}} publishers, and so they {{can be found in the}} {{published}} version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the Fifth Legion to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg (John Cleese) says [...] "You cunt!! <b>You</b> <b>stupid,</b> bird-brained, flat-headed..." [...] The profanity was overdubbed to [...] "you klutz" [...] before the film was released.

[...] They continued to call her voice [...] "an unabashedly loud and sexual fuck-you New York honk—that translates perfectly to rap." [...] In a 2017 Complex article about her, the editor wrote [...] "unapologetic does not begin to describe the totally unfiltered and sheer Cardi B-ness of Cardi B's personality. She's a hood chick who's not afraid to be hood no matter the setting. Cardi B is Cardi B 24/7, 365, this is why she resonates with people, and that same energy comes out in her music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kricfalusi {{originally}} voiced Ren in {{a manner}} that he describes as [...] "a bad imitation of Peter Lorre." [...] Billy West said that he auditioned to play Ren; the creators of the series believed that having West—who was also voicing the title character in fellow charter Nicktoon Doug at the time—voice both Ren and Stimpy would give him too large of a workload. West voiced Ren after Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi; Kricfalusi would return for the Spike TV episodes and unaired episodes of The Ren & Stimpy Show. Chris Edgerly would voice the character in the game Nicktoons MLB though. In the pilot episode, Pierre Decelles provided Ren's signature diabolical laughter, while West performed Ren's laugh in the series. His catchphrase is [...] "You eediot", and he also uses variations of [...] "What is your problem, you sick little monkey?", which is similar to a quote by Lorre in The Maltese Falcon: [...] "You... you imbecile. You bloated idiot. <b>You</b> <b>stupid</b> fat-head, you." ...|$|E
