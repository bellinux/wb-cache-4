6000|$|... "You {{have heard}} {{something}} in that letter which makes <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your husband will take you back. Not a woman in London will speak to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{there will}} be a fight?" [...] she asked in a tone of surprise, as she took her seat on Nat's right hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} have you think of me that I could come to <b>you</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would promise me your love before I had shown you whether I had loved you or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Fred; that {{cannot be}} so. A mother would throw her arms round you and cling {{to you if}} she saw you going into danger. A mother would follow <b>you,</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> she might save you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't sail from Bridgetown," [...] said Dickory, [...] "and your {{daughter}} is not there. I come from Jamaica, where she now is, and was bound to Bridgetown to seek news of <b>you,</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had returned there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Impossible!' said Lord Cadurcis. 'My dear Doctor, I cannot {{understand}} you; you {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> you wish, even that you believe that I shall marry Venetia; and yet you permit me to infer that our union will only make us miserable. What do you wish me to do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|He.--And <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> these masters {{will know}} the grammar, the [...] fables, the history, the geography, the morality, in which they [...] will give her lessons? Moonshine, my dear mentor, sheer moonshine! [...] If they knew these things well enough {{to teach them to}} other [...] people, they never would teach them? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{be coming}} back at sunset, white man, why do you carry so many things upon your packs, and why are your saddle-bags filled with cartridges?" [...] he asked. [...] "Surely you do not speak the truth to me, and <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> never more will you see the sun set upon Bambatse." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>You</b> only <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> someone shows, who knows.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you don't}} really wish to learn any thing; {{but you want}} to have me decide the case, because each of <b>you</b> <b>hopes</b> <b>that</b> I shall decide in his favor. You want the {{pleasure}} of a victory, not the pleasure of acquiring knowledge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not tell}} the truth at once, Olaf? You are afraid of this beast, and that's why you let us come on here when {{you knew it was}} in the wood. <b>You</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> before we got back there it would be too dark to hunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{of course}} you damn yourself. But I suppose that's in your programme. You propose to throw mud at us; you believe, <b>you</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> some of it may stick. We know, of course, it can't," [...] {{explained}} the marquis {{in a tone of}} conscious lucidity; [...] "but you take the chance, and are willing at any rate to show that you yourself have dirty hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because in {{a vision}} she showed you this monastery, and {{led you to}} a spot beyond the {{mountains}} where she vanished, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this woman whom you saw die is re-incarnated yonder. Why not? In this there is nothing impossible {{to those who are}} instructed in the truth, though the lengthening of her last life was strange and contrary to experience. Doubtless you will find her there as you expect, and doubtless her khama, or identity, is the same as that which in some earlier life of hers once brought me to sin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My beloved! my husband!--Yes--though you {{may fancy}} me fickle and proud--I will call you {{so to the}} last; for were I fickle, I could have saved myself the agony of writing this; and as for pride, oh! how that darling vice has been crushed out of me! I have rolled at my mother's feet with bitter tears, and vain entreaties--and been refused; and yet I have obeyed her after all. We must write to each other no more. This one last letter must explain the forced silence which has been driving me mad with fears that you would suspect me. [...] And now you may call me weak; but it is your love which has made me strong to do this--which has taught me to see with new {{intensity}} my duty, not only to you, but to every human being--to my parents. By this self-sacrifice alone can I atone to them for all my past undutifulness. Let me, then, thus be worthy of <b>you.</b> <b>Hope</b> <b>that</b> by this submission we may win even her to change. How calmly I write! {{but it is only}} my hand that is calm. As for my heart, read Tennyson's Fatima, and then know how I feel towards you! Yes, I love you--madly, the world would say. I seem to understand now how women have died of love. Ay, that indeed would be blessed; for then my spirit would seek out yours, and hover over it for ever! [...] Farewell, beloved! and let me hear of you through your deeds. A feeling at my heart, which should not be, although it is, a sad one, tells me that we shall meet soon--soon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|SHE: [...] "You {{would have}} parted from me without a {{syllable}} to suggest it--perhaps parted from me forever?" [...] After a pause of silent humiliation for him: [...] "Do {{you call that}} brave or generous? Do you call it manly--supposing, as <b>you</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>that</b> I had any such feeling?" ...|$|R
60|$|My friends, I could not, without {{launching}} off {{upon some}} new topic, which would detain you too long, continue to-night. I {{thank you for}} this most extensive audience that you have furnished me to-night. I leave <b>you,</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt {{that all men are created}} free and equal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand {{aside from}} her, then--unless <b>you</b> are <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> her danger may protect YOU!" [...] said the Kentuckian, {{significantly}} drawing his revolver.|$|R
5000|$|... "She's hit rock bottom. It's been {{an honor}} {{for me to}} portray PTSD (in honor {{of those who have}} {{suffered}} from it). And that's what you hope - <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> there's a {{light at the end of}} the tunnel; <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> you can cross over to the other side, and find a reason to live again. And not just live, but thrive. And that's what I'm hoping that she finds - a way to respond correctly to the deaths of her most loved ones..." [...] Sonequa Martin-Green on Sasha's post-traumatic stress disorderover her losses in the fifth season.|$|E
5000|$|... "You start with, {{and you end}} with, what is the {{emotional}} journey for these characters. That {{is the most important}} thing to capture, that is the only thing to capture. Everything else is up for grabs, but you must take these characters on the same emotional journey that they took in the book, and hence take the audience on the same emotional journey that they took in the book and that's the goal, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> you achieve that." [...] Melissa Rosenberg, writer of The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, about adapting the book to film ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{announcement}} of Sonic Youth's hiatus, Gordon commenced touring with Ikue Mori, Tokyo-born drummer of late-1970s band DNA—Gordon had performed with Mori previously at {{events such as the}} NoFunFest in 2004. The duo completed a European tour in mid-2012 and Gordon explained during a corresponding interview, [...] "You sorta want to get lost and <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the audience gets lost with you ... You can feel if they’re listening, you can feel if there’s some connection.” Together with Bill Nace, Gordon and Mori were selected for the June 2013 All Tomorrow's Parties event that was curated by the band Deerhunter.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{it seems}} horrible to me," [...] said Margery, [...] "to be <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> some one may die {{in order that}} you may be better off, for, as you want money so much, <b>you</b> must <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your uncle will die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I owe him duty, no doubt. Had he bade me {{never to}} see <b>you,</b> I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> {{that would have}} sufficed. But there are other duties than that,--a duty even higher than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{and that}} is why I take the liberty of {{speaking}} to <b>you.</b> I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the great friendship which I feel for your mother will be allowed to stand as my excuse." ...|$|R
5000|$|To the band's surprise, {{the song}} became a hit at prom dances. Because of the song's lyrics, which many graduating seniors {{interpret}} as nostalgic and reflective {{of their time}} in high school, it has become a staple song at proms. Armstrong remarked that, in retrospect, the lyrics make sense when viewed that way. [...] "The people that you grew up and braved the trials of high school with will always hold a special place. Through all the BS of high school <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your friends had the time of their life, and that's what the song is talking about".|$|E
5000|$|Cloepfil's {{firm was}} {{selected}} in a 1999 design {{competition for the}} Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis over world-renowned architects such as Peter Zumthor, Herzog & de Meuron, and Rem Koolhaas. The museum was sited next to an existing Tadao Ando building for the Pulitzer Foundation and completed in 2003. The program of the museum was open-ended in the model of European Kunsthalls and does not own a collection. Describing his approach, Cloepfil said “I wanted a space that is energized {{on its own terms}} but also would be inspirational for artists. In a noncollecting context, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> artists are intensely motivated to generate work for the space." ...|$|E
5000|$|Not every {{character}} {{action was}} originally in the script. [...] "A {{lot of the}} times," [...] Lozano said, [...] "someone would make me laugh, and then my next line would be about responding to that. Any number of things could happen, which are usually the best moments. I wanted {{to be open to}} that. But it's hard, too, because I didn't want to screw up my lines." [...] She further relayed, [...] "There are many times when I think I didn't get a scene. When you don't feel anything, it's frustrating. I'm less hard on myself because I realize how difficult what we do is. But, as an actor, <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> you go in there and {{get caught up in the}} moment. I think, self-indulgently, that's why we become actors in the first place [...] - [...] to feel things." ...|$|E
5000|$|Robbie Daw from Idolator said [...] "Bottom line: Betty Who's {{first album}} {{is as good}} as <b>you</b> <b>hoped.</b> In <b>that</b> regard, she's done her job and {{delivered}} on the promise of that first EP from 18 months ago." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Darren Beckford was a {{brilliant}} striker for the Vale, but a nightmare to manage. It was like throwing a blancmangeat the wall, <b>you</b> just <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> a bit of it sticks!" [...] Manager John Rudge.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, Grayson; but one {{can never}} tell with {{conditions}} here such as they are. Have <b>you</b> any <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{will be able to}} obtain a safe conduct for us from General Villa?" ...|$|R
5000|$|At the end {{of season}} 13 of Law & Order: SVU, she and co-star Danny Pino weighed-in on their first season and both Giddish and Pino say they {{received}} not only a [...] "very warm welcome" [...] from SVUs cast and crew, but saw their respective characters explored more than they could hope for in their first season. [...] "They’ve given me a lot to work with — and I hope they give me more next season," [...] says Giddish. [...] "We're still playing 'musical chairs' in terms of partners, and that’s {{a great way to}} go about exploring the different characters." [...] Pino added, [...] "That’s what you hope for when you’re putting it down on paper and discussing what you want to play. I had pre-season conversations with showrunner Warren Leight, and <b>you</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> starts materializing — and it did. And that bodes well going into Season 14." ...|$|E
5000|$|Actor Adam Croasdell {{was cast}} in the role, commenting, [...] "It is my first soap and I'm really pleased {{to be in it}} — it's such a British institution. It's a real honour {{to be a part of}} it and it's a whole other skillset to what I've done before. I'm used to getting several takes if I need it, and this is like two takes and you move on. You have to be so on the ball when they call [...] "Action" ... I am so {{impressed}} with the writing, the dramatic tension and the array of brilliant characters. I'm a huge fan now and I'm not just saying that." [...] He added: [...] "With the leaving of Robert Kazinsky (Sean Slater), I'm feeling the pressure if I've been hired to step into his shoes! <b>You</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your storylines are going to be a little bit more than for flesh-fodder, but it's all good." ...|$|E
5000|$|After a third-place finish wasn't {{enough to}} advance Logano to the {{championship}} race, he said that it's not easy [...] "to play the race with rain in the area. You don’t know what’s gonna happen, but you just hope there’s another shot. <b>You</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> there’s a restart and if two of them slip up and you’re able to put it three-wide on the bottom, or do something like that, but just didn’t ever have the opportunity there at the end. We had plenty of opportunities {{to try and get}} ourselves to the front, we just weren’t as fast at the 4 (Kevin Harvick). We were a solid second place car, but (Dale Earnhardt) Junior timed it out really well when they pitted to that caution and it worked out really well for them.” He also said that he [...] "can't help the weather. I guess it wasn’t in the cards tonight, but I’m still super proud of what this Pennzoil team has done all year.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It {{will teach}} <b>you,</b> I <b>hope,</b> <b>that</b> it is {{dangerous}} to neglect or postpone doing one’s duty. We cannot always depend on repairing the mischief. When the proper opportunity is once lost, it may never return.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can quite understand! It {{must be a}} trying {{life for}} you, but there are always chances for an enterprising man in this country, and <b>you</b> must <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> your husband will shortly raise you above the {{necessity}} of enduring uncongenial social relations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was my fault; {{my anger}} and impatience! And <b>you</b> let me <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this--this undeserved feeling has survived even my usage!' ...|$|R
