[...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, we get the challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away {{with a level of}} wordplay and pseudo science that CSI or Alias could only have dreamed of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E
500|$|The Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe speculated: [...] "I have {{sometimes}} wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's {{does not indicate}} a species superior to that of man". Eugene Wigner wrote that, seeing von Neumann's mind at work, [...] "one had {{the impression of a}} perfect instrument whose gears were machined to mesh accurately to a thousandth of an inch." [...] Paul Halmos states that [...] "von Neumann's speed was awe-inspiring." [...] Israel Halperin said: [...] "Keeping up with him was... impossible. The feeling was <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> a tricycle chasing a racing car." [...] Edward Teller admitted that he [...] "never could keep up with him". Teller also said [...] "von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, {{and the two of them}} would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us." [...] When George Dantzig brought von Neumann an unsolved problem in linear programming [...] "as I would to an ordinary mortal", on which there had been no published literature, he was astonished when von Neumann said [...] "Oh, that!", before offhandedly giving a lecture of over an hour, explaining how to solve the problem using the hitherto unconceived theory of duality.|$|E

2500|$|The second section, [...] "The Love", {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a thunderous yearning through gigantic mid tempo, electronic balladry". It opens with the [...] "volcanic" [...] ballad [...] "Moments", which boasts atmospherics and influences of [...] "trippy" [...] samba. Lyrically, it sees Lo confessing her flaws before declaring [...] "On good days, I am charming as fuck!". [...] "The Way That I Am" [...] is a dubstep song filled with [...] "pain and passion" [...] as Lo sings in a soulful rasp and lyrically cries out to her partner to love her as she is; including flaws. [...] "Got Love" [...] is one of the albums [...] "pure" [...] pop moments, and contains an unwaveringly positive attitude. Lyrically, she rejoices exultant feelings of first falling in love as she sings [...] "Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond/Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops", and discusses the theme of immortality [...] "We live like legends now, know that would never die/Oh, we Got Love". Closing out the section is the power pop song [...] "Not on Drugs". Primarily a guitar-driven song that explores the topic of a feeling of love so bewildering and overpowering that it affects your behavior, as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> drugs.|$|E

[...] On the morning of September 4, 20 Weatherwomen entered the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) office and held the office workers captive until the Weatherwomen had run off copies of a leaflet to be handed out to student sympathizers. One of the Weatherwomen told Miss Dodd, who worked in the AFSC office, [...] "We thought until now <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> our side. Now we know you are a member of the enemy." [...] A short time later, all 75 Weatherwomen appeared at South Hills High School in Pittsburgh to participate in a [...] "jailbreak". The women spray painted anti-war slogans, [...] "Ho lives" [...] and [...] "Free Huey", on the school's main entrance doors, and handed out leaflets, urging high school students to [...] "bring the war home," [...] and asking students to leave the school campus. [...] Some Weatherwomen made speeches in the school's playground about racism, imperialism, and the SDS national action plans. Oughton was able to escape from the Pittsburgh police, but 26 others, including Cathy Wilkerson and Jane Spielman, were arrested at the school. The students at the high school had no idea who the Weatherwomen were, or even why the women chose their school.|$|E
