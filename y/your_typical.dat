The hypothesis here is that these “middle” responses have been, in some sense, inflated. That is, for whatever reason, a significant number of responders inaccurately report into these categories. Our results do indeed suggest that such inflation is present in these categories. Adjusted responses to these questions could lead to significant changes in policy, and should be reflected upon when analyzing and interpreting these scales...|$|R

Selection of materials, types of weatherstripping and buying and installing these products are discussed. Insulation is {{not the whole story}} for energy conservation! Even if your home is well-insulated, energy may be wasted through air infiltration. Air can leak around doors and windows, foundations, chimneys, exterior plumbing, etc. In the winter, air heated by your furnace is lost to the outside; in summer, hot outdoor air puts an extra load on your air conditioner. If <b>your</b> home is <b>typical,</b> one-half to three-quarters of your fuel bill is the result of air infiltration. Weatherizing your home by caulking and weatherstripping can effectively reduce energy waste.

Intuitively, the argument runs: an inductive inference to a hypothesis should in general make the evidence more probable than do alternative hypotheses; what would make your birth rank more probable than otherwise is the hypothesis that <b>your</b> birth is <b>typical</b> rather than atypical; if homo sapiens endures for mi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Has the {{reproductive}} performance in your herd improved, {{remained the same}} or declined over time? If <b>your</b> herd is <b>typical</b> for the Southeast, reproductive performance has declined over time. A study that evaluated reproductive performance from 1976 to 2002, in Florida and Georgia dairy herds, showed that days to first service, days to conception, and calving interval increased significantly over time (de Vries and Risco, 2006). Further, average pregnancy rates decreased from 22 % to 11 %. Although, causes for this decline is multifactorial, attenuation of estrus expression in high producing cows, embryonic mortality, energy metabolism early postpartum and its interactions with immune function {{play a major role}} (Wiltbank et al., 2006; Santos et al, 2007; Hammon et al., 2006). Further, the trend for larger herds has resulted in new challenges with compliance of reproductive programs, namely inseminating cows on a timely basis {{at the end of the}} voluntary waiting period (VWP). The purpose of this manuscript is to review recent findings in reproductive management of dairy cows and how they may be applied to enhance reproductive efficiency in dairy cattle.
