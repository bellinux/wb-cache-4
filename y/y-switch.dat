40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{optoelectronic}} <b>Y-switch</b> based on a three terminal active device and on the mode-mixing principle. It consists of a 1400 micron long asymmetrical rib waveguide designed to sustain only the fundamental and the first propagating mode; along this waveguide the difference in effective indices between these modes cumulates to 2 ir and the light emerges {{on the same side}} where it has been injected. In the ON state, the presence of an electron-hole plasma injected and spatially controlled with a Bipolar Mode Field Effect Transistor device (BMFET) forces the fundamental mode and the first propagating mode to be shifted by an additional —ir thus allowing the light to emerge {{from the other side of}} the waveguide. Numerical simulation of losses, cross-talk and switching speed are presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to efficient automated logic synthesis of reversible circuits using various gate types and initial specifications. These Reversible circuits are of interest to several modern technologies, including Nanotechnology, Quantum computing, Quantum Dot Cellular Automata, Optical computing and low power adiabatic CMOS, {{but so far the}} most important practical application of reversible circuits is in quantum computing. Logic synthesis methodologies for reversible circuits are very different than those for classical CMOS or other technologies. The focus of this dissertation is on synthesis of reversible (permutative) binary circuits. It is not related to general unitary circuits that are used in quantum computing and which exhibit quantum mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement. The interest in this dissertation is only in logic synthesis aspects and not in physical (technological) design aspects of reversible circuits. Permutative quantum circuits are important because they include the class of oracles and blocks that are parts of oracles, such as comparators or arithmetic blocks, counters of ones, etc. Every practical quantum algorithm, such as the Grover Algorithm, has many permutative circuits. These circuits are also used in Shor Algorithm (integer factorization), simulation of quantum systems, communication and many other quantum algorithms. Designing permutative circuits is therefore the major engineering task that must be solved to practically realize a quantum algorithm. The dissertation presents the theory that leads to MP (Multi-Path) algorithm, which is currently the top minimizer of reversible circuits with no ancilla bits. Comparison of MP with other 2 leading software tools is done. This software allows to minimize functions of more variables and with smaller quantum cost that other CAD tools. Other software developed in this dissertation allows to synthesize reversible circuits for functions with 2 ̆ 2 don 2 ̆ 7 t cares 2 ̆ 2 in their initial specifications. Theory to realize functions from relational representations is also given. Our yet other software tool allows to synthesize reversible circuits for new types of reversible logic, for which no algorithm was ever created, using the so-called 2 ̆ 2 pseudo-reversible 2 ̆ 2 gates called <b>Y-switches...</b>|$|R
