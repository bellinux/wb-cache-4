The idea of her {{crawling}} through her bed into this other world made it fantastical and have creative licence to have a few surreal elements. The bed scene was made up of thirty or so mattresses inside a tent of giant silk. The light was amazing, and once inside the bed set it felt so calming and peaceful. This serenity really reflects Pixie's performance in this section.|$|E

25|$|Family {{history and}} ancestry are factors that {{increase}} the risk of beta thalassemia. Depending on your family history, if <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> or grandparents suffered from beta thalassemia there is a high probability of the mutated gene being inherited by an offspring. Even if a child does not have beta thalassemia major, they can still be a carrier resulting in future offspring having beta thalassemia. Another risk factor is because of certain ancestry. Beta thalassemia occurs most often in people of Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Southern Asian, and African ancestry.|$|E

The [...] "go to work with <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> day" [...] idea appealed to Appel because it was {{something}} he [...] "lost the right" [...] to do when he went from public school to private school as a child. Appel considered those days to be his favorites because he [...] "didn't have to do anything" [...] at his parents' job. The idea of having a driver's license was something that Appel dreamed about when he was younger.|$|E

500|$|On October 12, 1991, {{breaking}} news forced ABC News to interrupt regular Saturday morning programming again.

He noted that Thomas and his accuser, Anita Hill, [...] "have a very painful disagreement about some things the woman says the man did to her when they were working together...You can ask <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> to tell you more."

500|$|Cohn and Levithan {{had written}} the novel in {{alternating}} chapters: Cohn writing from Norah's perspective and Levithan writing from Nick's perspective. Cera and Dennings recorded voice-over narration to mimic the first-person perspective from which the novel is written, but the voice-overs {{were not included in}} the final cut of the film. Scafaria says that the differences between the novel and the film were [...] "to make it a little more cinematic". She said that Nick and Norah's parents were written out of the script [...] "to absorb what it's like to be young, [...] you're not thinking about <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> when you're out all night". In addition to searching for Where's Fluffy?, Sollett felt that the film needed a second MacGuffin to propel the story forwards, so Norah's best friend Caroline got drunk and then lost, giving Nick and Norah an additional objective.|$|E
500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E

500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> and all the people, to authority...

500|$|Green Hill Zone {{has also}} been {{recognized}} by critics as a classic, well-known video game level.

Comparably, Joe Skrebels of Official Nintendo Magazine called it [...] "nostalgic", while Christopher Grant from Joystiq considered it to have a place [...] "in the center of your retro-gaming shrine". Kevin Wong of Complex stated that the game's and level's popularity were such that [...] "even if you didn't have a Genesis, this was the level you played at the department store while <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> went shopping." [...] Andy Kelly from Computer and Video Games called the Green Hill theme a [...] "monumental slice of Sega nostalgia", and GamesRadar writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. Anka has summarized that [...] "Green Hill Zone in the original game has gone down as an instantly recognisable piece of music in pop culture".|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album consists of vintage funk, soul, and jazz samples. Commenting on the album and its use of samples, Pitchfork s Jeff Weiss claims that both Nas and his producers found inspiration for the album's production through the music of their childhood: [...] "The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on [...] "Life's a Bitch". Jazz rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't {{need to make the}} connection explicit—he allowed you to understand what jazz was like the first time <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> and grandparents heard it." [...] Similarly, journalist Ben Yew comments on the album's nostalgic sounds, [...] "The production, accentuated by infectious organ loop, vocal sample, and synthesizer-like pads in the background, places your mind in a cheerful, reminiscent, mood." ...|$|E
