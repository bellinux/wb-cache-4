She's going to look like a 15-year-old, and we've designed her to wear trainers." [...] The doll was released in two versions: six-inch and full-size.|$|E

[...] He {{led them to the}} playoffs again in 1939–40, but the loss of players due to World War II took its toll on the franchise. [...] After finishing in last place the season before, the league announced that the Americans had suspended operations for the 1942–43 NHL season though Dutton {{continued to}} represent the team on the Board of Governors.

500|$|Other kitsune {{use their}} magic {{for the benefit}} of their {{companion}} or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect. As yōkai, however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion. Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered zenko and the use of their magic a sign of prestige. Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune. One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house [...] "has been ours for many <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> ... <b>we</b> wish to register a vigorous protest." [...] The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When I was given the script, it was the funniest thing I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] I {{knew there was something}} wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they hit you with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 <b>years,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E
