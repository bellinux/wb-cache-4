500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> {{you might be a}} lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to give me the scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with {{a kick in the}} shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E
500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{process was}} simple enough," [...] {{answered}} the Professor patiently. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a policeman. I think so now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well said, Master Poet!' cried he of the spectacles. 'Hide {{it under}} thy cloak, sayest thou? Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make <b>thee</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a jack-o'-lantern!' ...|$|R
500|$|A {{portion of}} the clip's premise was {{inspired}} by Jackson's then-relationship with record producer Jermaine Dupri, which was unconfirmed and had generated speculation within the media. Meyers explained, [...] "In the other video we were shooting, {{she came out of}} the trailer wearing a So So Def jacket, and that's when I got the idea, 'it would be great if you do a whole video if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you do now when you're going home'. It took her a minute, she thought about it, she asked JD if he'd be okay with doing the video, 'cus I was begging and I was like, 'if I could get the two of you in a simple video together, it's gonna be gold.' She asked and he said yea, and that's when my video came to life." [...] Meyers also had the idea for Dupri's cameo due to persistent rumors of their relationship circulating in the media, saying [...] "That's the whole concept here, a real simple video and then the slam dunk is JD's in the video. He hasn't been in any of her stuff and all the rumors of 'are they together, are they not together.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
500|$|Upon AJ's arrival, Ally Ross of The Sun said: [...] "New arrivals have {{included}} [...] Masood's supposedly funny and long-lost brother AJ, {{who made the}} fatal mistake of arriving with the line: 'Do I look like a comedian?' No. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> David Baddiel. Now kindly piss off". Kay Ribeiro from Heat said, [...] "We like new boy AJ. Not only is he a laugh [...] but he's providing light relief during [...] and 's split, which is making us sad." [...] Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances. In October 2012, Allison Jones from Inside Soap said, [...] "AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [...] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months, but it already feels as if we've known him for ages." [...] She also called Sharma and Ganatra, [...] "a killer on-screen pairing". Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma's role in EastEnders, naming {{him as one of}} [...] "50 things you should look forward to in Wales" [...] in 2013, saying, [...] "Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the 'Chekhov with a covered market' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book. So well done Newport's very own Phaldut Sharma who, since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed's gregarious but aggro-magnet brother AJ, has helped break up the unrelenting, bicker-filled misery of Albert Square." [...] Bevan later said that Sharma has [...] "shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise-cracking, wheeler-dealing AJ Ahmed", adding, [...] "He's the gregarious, trouble-magnet who's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre, squabble-filled soapiness of Albert Square." [...] Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a [...] "find" [...] but thought the writers might not be sure {{what to do with the}} character. Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ [...] "has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You," [...] he said bluntly, {{for they}} were out of hearing of the other two. [...] "If I were poetically minded I should say that <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> the Tragic Muse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You stood quite still, {{for what}} seemed a long time. I saw your face {{sideways}} in the glass. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a man thinking, and dissatisfied with his own thoughts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} <b>you</b> <b>look</b> so well before. Yes--I'll tell <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> it--that night, {{a year and}} a half ago, when you came in so wildlike, and scolded us for making remarks about you and Mr. Troy." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{left the}} boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a big stout boy. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E
2500|$|A blog named IHateCrocs.com {{was founded}} by two Canadian college {{students}} (one, Kate Leth, referred to the shoes as [...] "hideous"), while the website CrocFans.com documents uses of the shoes. [...] The Facebook group I Don't Care How Comfortable Crocs Are, <b>You</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Like</b> a Dumbass has been mentioned in the media.|$|E
2500|$|Men - In {{the second}} {{installment}} of the series, Trinny and Susannah investiage the fashion issues of men, and ultimately aim to get a nation of well-dressed British men. To start their campaign, Trinny and Susannah attend a dress-down day at a civil engineers where they entice the engineers into their pink box {{to talk about their}} outfits. They duo are shocked at {{the way in which the}} men dress, with Susannah remarking [...] "You've got amazing coloured eyes but <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> you've just crawled from under a stone." [...] Trinny and Susannah then monitor how men shop via secret cameras. They find that the men they have observed do not actually shop but get taken shopping by their wives.|$|E
6000|$|His tone {{had been}} most offensive. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] he replied grudgingly. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{the man who}} spoke to me {{a minute or so}} ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Ben," [...] {{said the}} youth. [...] "Why, wot’s the matter? Wot are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> that for? Ain’t you well?" [...] "Wot {{did you call}} me?" [...] demanded the new mate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well said, Master Poet!" [...] cried he of the spectacles. [...] "Hide {{it under}} thy cloak, sayest thou? Why, it will gleam {{through the holes}} and make <b>thee</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a jack-o'-lantern!" ...|$|R
2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on what <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> but on what you're saying".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the [...] "Neck Stretch" [...] from Deadly Alliance was {{included}} in Game Rant's selection of the series' worst Fatalities. [...] "First off, no blood. Second, why even bother?" [...] David Saldana of 1UP.com ranked it the number-one worst Fatality, describing it as [...] "the most evil of evils in the MK universe simply resign himself to making <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an ostrich." [...] Hardcore Gaming 101 commented, [...] "One highlight [...] in particular is Quan Chi's Fatality, but only because of how incredibly stupid it is." [...] Brian Nelms of GameSkinny opined that for Quan Chi being [...] "literally the big bad guy" [...] in Deadly Alliance, the finisher was [...] "a polygon-bending display of lame." [...] WhatCulture said, [...] "he only stomach-churning aspect about [...] was that it actually got off the drawing board", while Quan Chi had [...] "redeemed" [...] himself with the [...] "Leg Beatdown." [...] James Deaux of Earth-2.net deemed it the [...] "lamest" [...] finisher ever: [...] "In a series where people have their heads blown up, ripped off, sliced in half, torched, melted, and even eaten whole, the producers of the games felt that Quan Chi should one-down them by ... stretching their neck out an extra three feet." [...] ScrewAttack ranked the finisher sixth on their 2011 list of the series' ten worst Fatalities (titling it [...] "Quan Chi Makes You a Giraffe"), citing its lack of blood.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Wot are you a-roarin' at?' said Sam impetuously, {{when the}} old gentleman had {{discharged}} himself of another shout; 'making yourself so precious hot that <b>you</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a aggrawated glass-blower. Wot's the matter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "and {{cane and}} umbrella, if you like, and pocket-handkerchiefs, too. I will fit you out completely, and shall {{be glad to}} have <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> a decent man." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{voice was}} low and not pleasant. With {{considerable}} haste the clerk took down the key, protesting, [...] "I never said <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a sneak-thief. Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Well,” said Tony, “why {{the devil}} are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> that at me? I wasn’t engaged to Violet then, and I kissed her—and went away immediately. It is {{necessary}} {{that you should}} know this, you see.” ...|$|R
60|$|As you may, however, {{succeed as}} a result of the fuss that you are making,--in getting votes, I have thought it best to come. Also,--I am free to confess,--I wanted to see what <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse another remark {{upon your}} {{personal}} appearance," [...] the lady said, smiling, [...] "but two of <b>you</b> <b>look</b> more <b>like</b> Alsatians than French. You have the fair complexion and brown, wavy hair. <b>You</b> do not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Frenchmen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, Doris, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the {{pictures}} of Louise de Kerouaille." [...] He passed his fingers through a mass of curly hair.|$|E
