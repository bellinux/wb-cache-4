25|$|Scrubbing tubes: Water {{before and}} after the animal chamber must be removed. One {{arrangement}} would use a large acrylic column of Drierite (8 mesh (scale), i.e., relatively coarse) upstream (before the push pump, before the animal chamber) to dry incurrent airstream and several tubes with smaller mesh (10-20, i.e., relatively fine) Drierite to remove water after the animal chamber. To prepare a scrubbing tube, make sure there is a small amount of cotton {{at either end of the}} tube to prevent dust particles from traveling to the analyzers. Use small amounts of cotton, say around 0.005 g, just enough to keep the dust out of the tubing. Large amounts of cotton will block air flow when/if it gets damp. Pour the Drierite into the tube with a funnel, tap the tube on the bench to pack the grains tightly (to increase surface area - air + water rushes through loose Drierite, requiring frequent changes of scrubbers), and cap off with a small amount of cotton. To remove carbon dioxide] {{before and after}} the animal chamber, Ascarite II is used (Ascarite II is a registered trademark of the Arthur H. Thomas Co.). Ascarite II contains NaOH, which is caustic (so don't get any on <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> keep away from water). A scrubbing tube is prepared by placing a small amount of cotton into the tube end, filling one-third of the way with 10-20 mesh Drierite, adding a small amount of cotton, then an additional third of the tube with the Ascarite II, another layer of cotton, followed by more Drierite and capping the tube off with another small amount of cotton. Tap the tube on the bench as each layer is added to pack the grains. Note: Driereite can be used over and over again (after heating in an oven), although indicating Drierite will lose color with repeated drying; Ascarite II is used once and will be considered a hazardous waste.|$|E

Puscifer was once advertised as a side project with Danny Lohner, who had formerly performed live with Nine Inch Nails, but has since been formed {{as a manifestation of}} Keenan's [...] "creative subconscious"—meaning that Keenan is now using the name as a pseudonym for his solo work. Keenan has stated that it is [...] "a premiere improvisational hardcore band", and his [...] "catch-all, stream of consciousness, anything goes, etc." [...] project. When comparing the project to Tool in an interview with Rolling Stone, Keenan described it as his [...] "attempt to make music to inspire people. ... This is definitely not thinking man's music, but groove-oriented music that makes you feel good." [...] In a later interview with Artistdirect, Keenan said {{that he did not want}} the lyrics to be puzzles. He wanted the complexity to be in the music, stating [...] "that's the part that gets under <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> makes you feel good." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{keyboard}} before turning into an '80s-inspired dance-pop number. Reminiscent of Solveig's hit single [...] "Hello", the song has a [...] "pulsating" [...] French house composition, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook and chorus, inline with Madonna's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". According to Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice, following the introduction on the keyboard, the music continues to grow as Madonna sings the line, [...] "you feel the wind on your face and <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> it's here that I begin my story", and crashes following it. John Mitchell from MTV News described {{that there was a}} [...] "propulsive" [...] energy in the track that felt [...] "authentic and alive". He went on to add that [...] "the calculated perfectionism" [...] of other club tracks by Madonna might appear to be chilly, but the composition of [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] instead was [...] "effervescent" [...] and [...] "happy". According to the sheet music of the song published by Guitar Tabs, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocals ranging from C to A. The song follows a sequence of D–B–Amin–G in the verses and D–G–B–Emin during the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|Giving Beowulf {{three out}} of four stars, Roger Ebert argues that the film is a satire of the {{original}} poem. Time magazine critic Richard Corliss describes the film as one with [...] "power and depth" [...] and suggests that the [...] "effects scenes look realer , more integrated into the visual fabric, because they meet the traced-over live-action elements halfway. It all suggests that this kind of a moviemaking is more than a stunt. By imagining the distant past so vividly, Zemeckis and his team prove that character capture has a future." [...] Corliss later named it the 10th best film of 2007. Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers argues that “The eighth-century Beowulf, goosed into twenty-first century life by a screenplay from sci-fi guru Neil Gaiman and Pulp Fictions Roger Avary, will have you jumping out of <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> <b>and</b> begging for more... I've never seen a 3-D movie pop with this kind of clarity and oomph. It's outrageously entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the recent Criterion Collection release, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk review, had the following to say about it: [...] "I wouldn't call Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain – Criterion Collection an anti-war film so much as I'd call it a realist's war film. Rather than build his story around big explosions and the thrill of battle, Ichikawa instead brings the human drama front and center, directing his spotlight on a soldier who is left to his own devices when the guns stop blazing. He poses the question, 'When stranded on the bombed-out landscape after the fighting has calmed, what will those left behind do to survive?' It's bleak and it's chilling, and yet Fires on the Plain is also completely engrossing. It's the post-action picture as morality play, the journey of the individual recast with Dante-esque overtones. Ichikawa doesn't have to hit you {{over the head with}} a message because the story is so truthfully crafted, to state the message outright would be redundant. Once you've seen Fires on the Plain, the movie will get under <b>your</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> you'll find it impossible to forget." ...|$|E

They also praised Harness' script as [...] "impressive" [...] and said that Wilmshurst [...] "fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count {{is the key to}} {{crawling}} under people's skins". [...] They closed their review by saying [...] "The best Doctor Who episodes have something to say, get under <b>your</b> <b>skin,</b> <b>and</b> keep you pretty much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch {{as soon as it was}} done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences". The A.V. Club also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. They said [...] "'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that Doctor Who has genuinely surprised me. That fact, above all else, is why tonight’s episode rates as an instant classic" [...] and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that [...] "Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor". They ended their review by claiming that [...] "This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special".|$|E
