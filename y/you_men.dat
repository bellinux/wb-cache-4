500|$|On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as {{they neared}} where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy {{appeared}} from {{a hole in the}} snow, stared at them and asked, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>men</b> from California, or do you come from heaven?" [...] The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated immigrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the emigrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing [...] "such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description." [...] George Donner's arm was so gangrenous that he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.|$|E

500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of <b>you</b> <b>men</b> out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that he never came close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{widespread}} devotions in the Catholic tradition relate {{directly to}} Jesus Christ. Official Catholic teachings consider Eucharistic adoration an important practice which [...] "stimulates the faithful to {{an awareness of}} the marvelous presence of Christ and is an invitation to spiritual communion with Him." [...] In many cases Eucharistic adoration is performed by each person for an uninterrupted hour known as the Holy Hour. The inspiration for the Holy Hour is [...] when in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before his crucifixion, Jesus asks Peter: [...] "So, could <b>you</b> <b>men</b> not keep watch with me for one hour?".|$|E

[...] According to Clawson, after an hour of [...] "desultory conversation… of which the vilest accusations were laid against the [...] "Mormons," [...] the beastly talk of the mobbers," [...] three men who had left on horseback returned and directed Standing and Clawson to go with them.|$|E

[...] He moves [...] "a stone's throw away" [...] from them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says [...] "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it." [...] Only the Gospel of Luke mentions {{the details of the}} sweat of blood of Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will of the Father.

[...] Wolff's father asked the Dean to recognize that helping his son to reform was more important than punishment: [...] "I am taking the liberty of appealing to you, not in your official capacity, but as a man, to do what you can to assist him. You know all are subject to mistakes, and the blessing is in those who can aid and advise in correcting and saving rather than otherwise." ...|$|E
