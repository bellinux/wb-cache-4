500|$|In {{a review}} of Manson's album, his {{rendition}} of [...] "Cease to Exist" [...] was regarded as [...] "one of Manson's signature performances, and has justifiably invited comparison with Jim Croce and José Feliciano". Critic Michael Little considers Manson's version superior to the Beach Boys', having praise especially for Manson's vocals. Naturally, Little attests, [...] "you expect a tattered, raw, and raggedy voice, {{with a touch of}} lunatic rage, but what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> a smooth-voiced folk singer". He also wrote that Manson's raw, stripped-down take [...] "gives the song an impressive lo-fi immediacy that is a million miles away from the Beach Boys' treatment".|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} the fight between Don and Megan, Weiner {{commented on the}} violence and passion, noting that [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> that Don loves this woman" [...] and that Megan is [...] "everything that's good to him". [...] Jessica Pare commented on Don's {{lack of respect for}} her work, and Jon Hamm judged Don's actions as [...] "immature". However, Hamm regarded Don's fear as [...] "genuine" [...] when he is unsure of Megan's whereabouts. The flashback scene between Don and Megan in the car was actually shot for the fourth season finale, [...] "Tomorrowland", written and directed by Weiner, but was cut. Weiner decided to reinsert this scene into the episode as a flashback.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Declan Whitebloom in London on 28 November 2011. Whitebloom approached shooting the clip with a [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>get,</b> <b>is</b> what you get" [...] sentiment, which, as he noted, [...] "can create some real magic." [...] In regard to its concept, Whiteboom characterised the clip as [...] "kind of Monkees or Beatles-esque", elaborating that it revolves around [...] "five lads go crazy in London, it's like a big day out in London." [...] In a December interview with Capital FM, member Harry Styles reflected that the shoot was a fun, careless romp. Premiering on YouTube on 13 January 2012, the music video depicts the band performing in and around London. As of October 2017, the music video has garnered more than 550 million YouTube views. One Direction surged 35-10 from the previous week on Billboards Social 50 chart. Alex Hughes of The Huffington Post commented that the music video has an effortless element of happiness, proclaiming: [...] "if you fail to crack a smile, there is a 100 percent chance {{that you are the}} devil." ...|$|E

500|$|Turner {{followed}} up Private Dancer with Break Every Rule in 1986. Featuring [...] "Typical Male", [...] "Two People" [...] and [...] "What <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Is</b> What You See", the album sold over four million copies worldwide. Prior to the album's release, Turner published her memoirs, I, Tina, which {{later became a}} bestseller, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Turner's European Break Every Rule Tour, which culminated in March 1988 in Munich, Germany, contributed to record-breaking sales and concert attendances. In January 1988, Turner made history alongside Paul McCartney when she performed {{in front of the}} largest paying audience (approximately 184,000) to see a solo performer in Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, earning her a Guinness World Record. The success of Turner's two live tours led to the recording of Tina Live in Europe which was released that April. Turner lay low following the end of her Break Every Rule Tour, emerging once again with Foreign Affair which included one of Turner's signature songs, [...] "The Best." [...] She later embarked on a European tour to promote the album. While Foreign Affair went gold in the United States, with its singles [...] "The Best" [...] and [...] "Steamy Windows" [...] becoming Top 40 hits there. It was hugely successful in Europe, where Turner had personally relocated.|$|E
2500|$|Before every wire walk, Wallenda joins {{his family}} in prayer and he always wears a cross as he performs. He remarks, [...] "The Bible says pray without ceasing and I'm always praying." [...] He denies that his stunts [...] "test" [...] God. [...] "To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself {{in front of a}} truck," [...] he says. [...] Wallenda says he tries to live [...] "an upright life" [...] and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people to think of him as just a regular guy. [...] "I want people to like me, just for who I am," [...] he says. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> a regular person. I want people to relate to me." [...] Friends {{described}} him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2004, Hunt was {{diagnosed}} with breast cancer and told to have surgery to remove her right breast and her lymph nodes. Hunt postponed seeking treatment for five months, later wondering if she would have faced first stage rather than third stage cancer had she not. When she chose to have surgery, she decided to have it done in Ireland, because she felt that the Irish are more supportive and comfortable with illness than people in the U.S.; she envisaged that treatment in the U.S. would feel impersonal. Hunt decided to have a complete mastectomy with no following reconstruction. She says, [...] "Reconstruction – as if the breast is miraculously put back to the way it was. In fact, pretty much all <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> your cleavage back; you don't get any feeling or sensitivity... They take muscles from your back, skin from your thighs, fat from your stomach. You had a breast removed, but the rest of you was fine. Now half your body is hacked about – and for what?" [...] The day of her operation Hunt wrote a note on her breast to the surgical team, telling them to have fun, make sure they took the right breast off and drew them a flower.|$|E

2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was obviously {{that a lot of the}} story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to really think about that, and to suspect each other. ... So what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until near the end of the production.|$|E
2500|$|... "Let It Happen" [...] {{opens the}} album, {{and is about}} [...] "finding {{yourself}} always {{in this world of}} chaos and all this stuff going on around you and always shutting it out because you don't {{want to be part of}} it. But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics, with many calling it [...] "safe" [...] and a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja gave {{a rating of}} three out of five, terming it a mixed bag and wrote [...] "There isn't anything which comes across as memorable enough to be played a few months down the line, leave aside a few years. Eventually what <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> a soundtrack that would {{go along with the}} narrative and acts as a good situational ingredient but that's about it." [...] Koimoi also gave three out of five writing that album fall short of expectations. Planet Bollywood gave 5.5 out of 10, feeling [...] "Hai Ye Maaya" [...] was the only song worth listening, and wrote [...] " [...] Don 2 doesn't quite live up to expectations which were sky high after the huge success of the first film- it's a soundtrack that will only work alongside the movie and will take the story forward, but as an audio alone it just doesn't deliver. S-E-L play it safe by continuing on from where they left in the previous venture and there is hardly any innovation." [...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album a rating of two out of five calling it [...] "safe and self-conscious" [...] and wrote [...] "Don 2's music could fare much better if the composers Shankar-Ehsaan-and Loy had tried {{to step out of the}} prequel's shadow." ...|$|E

60|$|She did {{not answer}} me for a time, and as I waited I thought that there's nothing like a {{confession}} to make one look mad; and that of all confessions a written one is the most detrimental all round. Never confess! Never, never! An untimely joke {{is a source of}} bitter regret always. Sometimes it may ruin a man; not because it is a joke, but because it is untimely. And a confession of whatever sort is always untimely. The only thing which makes it supportable for a while is curiosity. You smile? Ah, but it is so, or else people would be sent to the rightabout at the second sentence. How many sympathetic souls can you reckon on in the world? One in ten, one in a hundred--in a thousand--in ten thousand? Ah! What a sell these confessions are! What a horrible sell! You seek sympathy, and all <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> the most evanescent sense of relief--if you get that much. For a confession, whatever it may be, stirs the secret depths of the hearer's character. Often depths that he himself is but dimly aware of. And so the righteous triumph secretly, the lucky are amused, the strong are disgusted, the weak either upset or irritated with you according to the measure of their sincerity with themselves. And all of them in their hearts brand you for either mad or impudent...|$|E

60|$|The most {{conspicuous}} feature of Benares is {{the pair of}} slender white minarets which tower like masts from the great Mosque of Aurangzeb. They seem to be always in sight, from everywhere, those airy, graceful, inspiring things. But masts {{is not the right}} word, for masts have a perceptible taper, while these minarets have not. They are 142 feet high, and only 8 1/2 feet in diameter at the base, and 7 1/2 at the summit--scarcely any taper at all. These are the proportions of a candle; and fair and fairylike candles these are. Will be, anyway, some day, when the Christians inherit them and top them with the electric light. There is a great view from up there--a wonderful view. A large gray monkey was part of it, and damaged it. A monkey has no judgment. This one was skipping about the upper great heights of the mosque --skipping across empty yawning intervals which were almost too wide for him, and which he only just barely cleared, each time, by the skin of his teeth. He got me so nervous that I couldn't look at the view. I couldn't look at anything but him. Every time he went sailing over one of those abysses my breath stood still, and when he grabbed for the perch he was going for, I grabbed too, in sympathy. And he was perfectly indifferent, perfectly unconcerned, and I did all the panting myself. He came within an ace of losing his life a dozen times, and I was so troubled about him that I would have shot him if I had had anything to do it with. But I strongly recommend the view. There is more monkey than view, and there {{is always going to be}} more monkey while that idiot survives, but what view <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>is</b> superb. All Benares, the river, and the region round about are spread before you. Take a gun, and look at the view.|$|E
6000|$|... 12. I dined to-day with Dr. Garth and Mr. Addison, at the Devil Tavern(6) by Temple Bar, and Garth treated; and 'tis well I dine every day, else I {{should be}} longer making out my letters: for we are {{yet in a}} very dull state, only inquiring every day after new elections, where the Tories carry it among the new members six to one. Mr. Addison's election(7) has passed easy and undisputed; and I believe {{if he had a}} mind to be chosen king, he would hardly be refused. An odd {{accident}} has happened at Colchester: one Captain Lavallin,(8) coming from Flanders or Spain, found his wife with child by a clerk of Doctors' Commons, whose trade, you know, it is to prevent fornications: and this clerk was the very same fellow that made the discovery of Dyot's(9) counterfeiting the stamp-paper. Lavallin has been this fortnight hunting after the clerk, to kill him; but the fellow was constantly employed at the Treasury, about the discovery he made: the wife had made a shift to patch up the business, alleging that the clerk had told her her husband was dead and other excuses; but t'other day somebody told Lavallin his wife had intrigues before he married her: upon which he goes down in a rage, shoots his wife through the head, then falls on his sword; and, to make the matter sure, at the same time discharges a pistol through his own head, and died on the spot, his wife surviving him about two hours, but in what circumstances of mind and body is terrible to imagine.
