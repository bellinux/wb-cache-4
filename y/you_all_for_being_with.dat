40|$|To my family, Acknowledgements It must be {{the curiosity}} about how things work and the joy of {{learning}} that put me through this fun and fulfilling journey. The journey of my PhD was full of excitement, challenges and learning experiences. The interactions with professors, colleagues, friends and family have been very valuable and I would like thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> me through my journey. I would like to start with my adviser Roel, who provided {{me an opportunity to}} do research in this world-class group. I am indebted for his trust and support to quite independently carry out my research. I learned from him how to macro manage research activities with a positive attitude. The photonics dinners in his garden and later in the botanic garden were always special evenings. Thanks to my committee members who showed interest in my re-search and willingness to serve on my thesis committee despite thei...|$|E
5000|$|Commenting on {{the album}} title and cover, Lipa said, [...] "I'm so excited to share my album artwork with you and thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so patient and supportive. The reason it is self-titled is because this album is me. It's a pure {{representation}} of who I am {{as a person and}} as an artist". The standard album cover has been described as [...] "minimal yet smoldering", featuring Lipa in a scaly jacket and she stares longingly into the camera with wet hair covering one side of her face with shades of purple and blue. The deluxe album cover features the same picture of Lipa, just with the difference in the shades, now being pink and green.|$|R

40|$|As I {{conclude}} {{this chapter}} in my life, I {{reflect on the}} {{many people who have}} assisted in helping me achieve a dream come true. First and foremost, I would like to thank my wife Angie. She never questioned or doubted my ambitious journey. Thank you and I love you.

40|$|There are so {{many people}} that I could thank and {{recognize}} for helping me through this thesis writing process, but considering the length of this paper I will keep it short. First I would like to thank my committee chair, Dr. Erica Irlbeck, <b>for</b> <b>being</b> on board with this out of the box topic and her willingness to listen to all of the Duck Dynasty knowledge I acquired along the way. I {{would also like to thank}} her <b>for</b> <b>being</b> there to help me work my way through this process, and not making me feel like an idiot for any of the million questions I had along the way. How she could read the multiple drafts I sent her, will never cease to amaze me. Next I would like to thank my office mates and fellow cave dwellers. I made amazing friends along this process, and never would have made it through without them. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> there to listen to me vent about all of the articles I had to read or formatting issues I could not figure out. Amber Krause, thank you for sitting in the desk behind me for 12 days straight until all hours of the night while we slaved away on these theses.

40|$|To my husband, Todd, who has {{inspired}} me to accomplish goals that I had never thought attainable. “You have supported me throughout our lives together as a wife, mother, student, and professional. All that I have and have accomplished is because of your love and support. You are {{the love of my}} life, and I am the person I have become because of your partnership. I will love you forever. To my children, Haiden and Gable, who have accommodated their lives when their mother had class or had to accomplish her work. I hope you feel that in some, simple way, I’ve provided a role model for both of you and have demonstrated the importance of advancing your education, working hard, balancing life, and achieving your goals. Haiden, <b>you</b> will accomplish <b>all</b> the goals that you set for yourself, and I am so proud of how you’ve grown to support the family throughout my journey in accomplishing this goal. Gable, you have always been the one to bring laughter to any situation. You have made me see stressful situations from a different viewpoint filled with laughter. I am so proud to have the both of you and am priviledged to be your mother. I love you both very much. To my mother, father, and brother.

5000|$|On June 15, 2010, Derek {{posted the}} {{following}} on YouTube:"Self Recorded Demo coming soon. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so patient while Chad and I {{took time to}} deal with the loss of Nathan and took our time deciding if we would play again as Watership Down and release what work we had done with Nathan including some new music we had written together." [...] In addition to some songs recorded for Let Us Sleep Awhile, confirmed songs on the album are [...] "Come Back" [...] and [...] "Seven Months". The former is where Derek announced the above, and can be viewed here The latter was featured in Derek Pardoe's tribute to Nathan Slade, which can be viewed here On August 27, 2010, an article about the group was featured in the South Mississippi newspaper the Sun Herald.

People have asked me to play in other projects, but I don’t think I’m ever going to stand on a stage again without Chad," [...] Pardoe stated when asked if he will play live. [...] "The way to beat anxiety is by realizing that you cause it. I had some hard times, and there was a period when people thought all I did during the day was panic. But things become more important than anxiety. You become stronger for the experience, though." [...] Touring bassist Roy Williams is involved in the making of the new album, which was set to be released in 2012.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to {{acknowledge}} the input that the following people had in the completion of this thesis: Firstly I {{would like to}} thank Hein Neomagus for the guidance, assistance and persistence with this project. Thank you for erasing the line between mentor and friend by being both. Without the funding provided by Anglo Research this project would never have seen the light. I express my appreciation to Neville Plint and Roger Leighton for their interest in this project. I would like to thank Oom-Jan Kroeze and Henk Venter for their contribution on the technical side of the experimental setup. Oom-Jan was always willing to help and to give general advice, which was always accompanied with a decent cup of coffee. The process control had a few gremlins and I would like to thank Henk for doing that bit extra that was necessary to get the system up and running. I would like to thank Dr. Tiedt for his enthusiastic help with the SEM analysis and the excellent photographs that he provided. I would like to thank Philane Fourie and Anka Oberholzer for their part in generating the experimental data used as part of this study. Lastly I would like to reflect my gratitude to all my family and friends. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> <b>being</b> there when I needed it most, not only regarding this project but throughout my entire life.

5000|$|A {{very short}} time ago I {{was sitting in the}} cockpit of an {{aeroplane}} flying towards an almost mythical place called Melbourne. It had seemed to us as we started about 5 centuries ago, and that Melbourne as soon as we caught up one mile, receded two! So that made our journey very much longer than we had previously supposed. Particularly though it seems remarkable that only two hours ago one was in such a mental state, and now one is in a very different mental state, terribly embarrassed by your enthusiasm and yet very gracious to <b>you</b> <b>all</b> indeed <b>for</b> <b>being</b> so kind and welcoming us here this afternoon.Actually I wouldn't know I was here only somebody gave me a paper, and I see that it has my name on it, and of course as we all know, the press never lies! So, I don't think that I better say any more because I’ve talking too much to Campbell Black the last three days and I've got quite husky, I've been roaring at him ! He hasn't been roaring quite so much so I'm going to get him to talk. Scott's speech Movietone Black insisted that he had never made a speech in his life and that if he were going to say anything that it would only be [...] "Thank you". Celebrations followed and when all the qualifying back markers had arrived in Melbourne they were all paraded through the streets in open top cars C.W.A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black {{at the front of the}} procession with other competitors like the popular young Australian Jimmy Melrose following behind.|$|R
