40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was the {{selection}} of appropriate indigenous <b>yeasts</b> <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> Tested <b>yeasts</b> were isolated from the grapes from the winery Maňák Žádovice. The yeasts isolated within theses in 2009 – 2012 have been also tested, and commercial wine yeast have been tested for comparison. In the theoretical part {{the focus is on}} the technology of wine, in particular fermentation. The work is also focused on yeasts metabolism and taxonomy. There was described the principle of PCR-RFLP, and methods used to characterize the properties of isolated yeasts. In the experimental part was made isolation of yeasts, theirs identification using PCR-RFLP and to select the most suitable yeast in wine making proces were performed physiological tests...|$|R
40|$|Suitability of guava {{pieces for}} the {{preparation}} of immobilized <b>yeast</b> biocatalyst <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> was investigated by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae in repeated batch fermentation. The fermentation rate and other parameters were compared with free yeast cells at different temperatures. The volatile compounds, methanol, ethyl acetate, 1 -propanol, isobutanol and amyl alcohols which, formed during fermentation were analyzed {{with the help of}} GC-FID. The concentrations of ethyl acetate and methanol were not more than 100 mg L - 1 in all cases, indicating an improvement in the product. There are no changes in cell metabolism of immobilized yeast. Preliminary sensory tests established the fruity aroma, fine taste and the overall improved quality of the produced wines...|$|R
30|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae is {{the most}} {{important}} micro-organism employed in the production of bioethanol. This is due to several characteristics such as high ethanol productivity, tolerance to production stresses and resistance to fermentation by-products (Zaldivar et al. 2002; Zheng et al. 2013). A study of the resistance to different types of stress carried out in <b>yeast</b> strains used <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> (Ivorra et al. 1999) was used as a basis for understanding the physiology of ethanol-producing strains isolated from Brazilian sugarcane mills. The study conducted by (Della-Bianca and Gombert 2013) compared the physiology of the main strains used in the production of fuel ethanol in Brazil with some well-known laboratory strains, evaluating their tolerance in relation to the classic stress factors and the specific ones faced in the industrial process of fermentation.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{monitoring}} of the yeast's impact to the chemical and sensorial characteristics of produced wine. The aim of experimental part was obtaining of the aroma-active substances in the fermenting must and wine Hibernal and wine Pinot Blanc. SPME-GC-MS methods were used <b>for</b> identify <b>wines</b> and must aroma. The same autochthonous <b>yeasts</b> were used <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production.</b> This <b>yeast</b> was isolated from surface of grapes in our laboratory. It was found that both wines have a similar aromatic profile. The next aim was the monitoring of chemical parameters of samples and their changes. For this measurement were used spectrophotometric methods and HPLC methods. The last goal of the thesis was the isolation and identification of yeasts from wine Pinot Blanc by PCR-RFLP. These yeasts were then compared with yeasts isolated from Hibernal must. Identification of yeasts were done by amplification 5, 8 S-ITS DNA stretches using primers ITS 1 and ITS 4. Restriction endonuclease HaeIII, HinfI, HhaI and TaqI. were used for restriction analysis then...|$|R

Mycoflora were more in the rotten fruits than in the fresh fruits. Botryodiplodia theobromae was isolated only from the rotten fruits (skin) while Trichoderma viride was isolated only from the fresh fruits. Penicillium sp., was the most dominant in all the fruit part of fresh soursop fruit with Rhizopus stolonifer having the highest percentage occurrence (36. 39 %) in the rotten fruit. Most of the isolated fungi indicated occurrence of such common airborne fungi on soursop fruits and the potential to induce rot in fresh healthy fruits of soursop in storage. Soursop juice was fermented for 10 days and wine was obtained. There was a significant difference (P &lt;&nbsp; 0. 05) in the alcoholic content of the wines obtained from the indigenous and commercial yeasts. The wine obtained from the pasteurized, ameliorated soursop juice inoculated with propagated indigenous yeast yielded the highest alcoholic content. Based on the level of the nutritional composition of soursop juice, the ability to support yeast growth, the high alcoholic content and palatability of the wine, the Annona muricata is good source <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>production</b> and single-cell protein.
