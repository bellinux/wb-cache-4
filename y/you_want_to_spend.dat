Goldman admitted that while he [...] "never had any interest in the many stories of forensics investigators and the various bodily fluids they can use to solve crimes," [...] he found [...] "new series engaging and fun." [...] Goldman particularly praised Caan's performance in the episode, stating he [...] "is very good, bringing a lot of humor to the part and finding an easy chemistry with O'Loughlin. Per usual {{for this type of}} story, McGarrett and Danny don't get along initially and Caan is able to add a lot of charm to small moments like Danny saying to himself, 'I hate him.

2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, I mean if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> a million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E

Chuck’s dad Roger just asked one time “Are you sure this is what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> your money on?” No question it was that Cat mini bike at the auto parts store. Bruce Brown’s movie “On Any Sunday” made Malcolm Smith an icon in off-road motorcycle racing and would ignite in Chuck an indistinguishable passion for racing. At age 14 Chuck entered his first motocross race and fell trying to pass everyone in the first turn. Chuck had learned his first lesson of racing “balance of patience and desire”.|$|E

5000|$|Castlevania {{received}} generally {{positive to}} mixed reviews. It has {{an average of}} 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, and 72.71% at GameRankings. At the release, most critics considered the game {{to be a good}} transition to the series, despite many changes in gameplay. GameSpot praised the graphics, audio and gameplay, saying [...] "The developers have done a fantastic job of capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the series, while providing a well-balanced, challenging gameplay experience that's filled with pretty visuals, awesome (though limited) music, plenty of secrets, and some incredible bosses (just wait until you see Death... whew!)", while IGN highlighted the sound better than the graphics, saying [...] "Outstanding sound effects with lots of bass. Good music, even if it's a bit simple at times", and Game Pro said [...] "Is Castlevania fun? It depends on what kind of game you're looking for and how much energy <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> playing it. Fans of the old Castlevania will marvel at this version's familiar sites and environments and will appreciate the dedicated tack of the gameplay. Novices will be chilled to the bone at the thought of replaying a huge level after an untimely fall (fortunately, there are numerous save points). Castlevanias a 3D platform spectacle that definitely warrants a good look from N64 owners everywhere—you won't find better hauntings than this one". This sentiment was not shared by GameRevolution, who instead said that [...] "The gameplay, arguably the mainstay of the Castlevania series, just doesn't match up to its predecessors", and Nintendojo who said [...] "It's not horrendous or even bad; just extremely disappointing in execution". Game Informers Tim Turi felt that it was frustrating and flawed; it had a [...] "special place" [...] for him however due to its [...] "desperate lonely atmosphere." ...|$|E
