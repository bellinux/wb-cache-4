This limitation, and a need for greater tractive effort, lead to the development of the larger and more power X200 class.|$|E
5000|$|A {{switching}} and terminal railroad is {{a freight}} railroad company whose primary {{purpose is to}} perform local switching services or to own and operate a terminal facility. Switching {{is a type of}} operation done within the limits of a yard. It generally consists of making up and breaking up trains, storing and classifying cars, serving industries within <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> and other related purposes. These movements are made at slow speed under special yard rules.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} {{crosses the}} Animas {{one last time}} before entering <b>yard</b> <b>limits.</b> The train slows to 10 mph and blows a long station call on the whistle before passing the depot. After the train arrives, passengers deboard the train and the crew backs the train down to the wye for servicing. An ashpit was recently constructed for use and to aid in heavier repairs if needed, which do happen on occasion. After shoving the train uptown for boarding passengers, the engineer will oil and inspect the engine once again and the crew will perform another brake test for the return trip to Durango.|$|E

50|$|The {{site of the}} <b>yard</b> <b>limited</b> {{its ability}} to launch larger ships. It was only the {{installation}} of the marine railway that allowed the shipyard to launch modern ships. The ships were pulled sideways from launching ways {{on the west side of}} the river onto a railway cradle and from there were lowered into the water. Canadian winters prevented the launching of ships from December to March.|$|R
50|$|Scheduled trains on the Durango & Silverton {{operate on}} {{authority}} by timetable, though on occasion may be annulled for special trains or other circumstances. A train leaving Durango will depart at 5 mph until {{the train is}} off the platform, then advance to 10 mph until leaving <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> where track speed is 15 mph. The 15th Street bridge is {{just east of the}} Durango <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> and maintenance-of-way crews also have a storage area here, where track patrolmen will inspect the train rolling by. The grade is fairly flat until 32nd Street, where a small hill will have the engine work a little until 36th Street. The train will then roll downgrade about 1/4 mi and use that to accelerate to 20 mph, which is the track speed between 36th St. and Hermosa. Home Ranch is the first siding past Durango. A new wye has recently been built just east of here to turn trains for the Polar Express and other event trains. As the train runs through the valley, it is traveling on the longest tangent on the railroad, since most of the railroad meanders through the canyon following the river. Motorists can drive alongside the train through here and watch the engine work harder and harder as it starts to climb towards Hermosa. Passing Trimble Lane, the engine will start to pick up some work as the grade stiffens. A scheduled train takes 40 minutes to reach Hermosa from Durango.|$|E
50|$|A {{goods train}} had left Toowoomba {{on the night}} of 29 January 1913, and had derailed near the Murphys Creek railway station on the Main line, about one mile from the station <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> on the range side near the 84-mile (139 km) mark. No members of the crew were injured, but a {{considerable}} amount of damage was caused to the goods vehicles and the track. A breakdown gang was sent from Toowoomba and breakdown trains were also despatched from Brisbane and Toowoomba to clear wreckage from the line. The spot where the derailment had taken place was in a relatively inaccessible area and workers had to prise the wreckage apart. Several trips were made by breakdown trains to the derailment site.|$|E
50|$|The {{small size}} of the {{railroad}} obviates the need for high running speeds, as do the short distances spanned. Operating speeds are therefore low as compared to longer railroads. The maximum speed for both passenger and freight trains on the “main line” of the Mulberry Island and James River Subdivisions therefore was 25 mph with the maximum speed on the Industrial Subdivision being 15 mph. On all subdivisions, the maximum speed through sidings, within <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> on spurs and through switches was also 15 mph. There were more restrictive maximum speeds specified for dead engines (engines not under power while being towed), which were 15 mph, rail mounted derricks and cranes run between 5 mph and 10 mph, and track motor cars travel to about 2 mph and 15 mph.|$|E

5000|$|The yard {{owes its}} name to the property's prior and current use as a freight rail yard. However, only a 28-acre portion of the site has been {{retained}} for intermodal rail use, with rail traffic to and from the <b>yard</b> <b>limited</b> to municipal solid waste shipment. [...] Beginning in the late 1990s, Harlem River Yards has been the site of substantial commercial development, including a New York Post printing plant, a waste treatment plant, and a Federal Express distribution center.|$|R
50|$|The {{railroad}} line {{is approximately}} 16 mi long. A typical round trip {{ride on the}} train takes about 3 hours. There are {{a total of four}} passing sidings outside of the Heber <b>yard</b> <b>limit.</b> Notable landmarks seen from the train include Mount Timpanogos, Cascade Mountain, Deer Creek Dam and Reservoir, Provo River, Sundance Ski Resort, Tate Barn, and Soldier Hollow. A variety of wildlife including deer, eagles, fox, moose, turkeys, hawks, mountain lions (cougars), and beavers, have all been seen from the train as well.|$|R
5000|$|It {{consisted}} of an island platform which was set into a cutting and public access was via a footbridge and steps. The station's building was constructed from prefabricated concrete, {{consisted of}} a Station Masters office with a signal box and booking office, a waiting room, male & female toilets. The platform was 165 metres long or long enough to hold an 8 car Sydney suburban train. Points within Dunheved <b>yard</b> <b>limits</b> were operated by levers in the Station Masters Office as were the signals. Most of the yard signals were lower quadrant signals as well as ground or [...] "dolly" [...] signals, lighting to the lower quadrant signals was both electric and kerosene lamps. Mainline signals were Sydney suburban double light 2 aspects type and the line was track circuited through Dunheved.|$|E

Internally, EMD referred to these units as model FS.|$|E
50|$|The {{trackage}} {{was part}} of a line between Richmond and Logansport, completed by the Cincinnati and Chicago Railroad in 1857. This eventually became part of the system of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated it as the Richmond Branch, the southern half of a main line between Cincinnati and Chicago. It last saw passenger service in 1971 as part of the Penn Central Transportation Company, and survived as a continuous freight line until the formation of Conrail in 1976. At that time, the Norfolk and Western Railway acquired most of the line south of New Castle. Much of the remainder, including the present Indian Creek Railroad, remained with the trustees of the bankrupt Penn Central. However, thanks to local funding, Conrail operated the short piece between the ex-New York Central Railroad Dow Secondary north of Anderson and Frankton under contract as the Indian Creek Secondary Track, named for a minor tributary of the White River that it crosses. (The first 2.2 mi, mostly within <b>yard</b> <b>limits,</b> was acquired outright by Conrail, and went to the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1999.) The Indian Creek Railroad took over operations on July 20, 1980.|$|E

50|$|Restricted {{speed or}} {{line of sight}} {{operation}} implies that trains will control themselves {{so that they can}} come to a stop within half the range of the engineer's vision or line of sight. There are many types of Restricted speed operations with slight variations, such as <b>Yard</b> <b>Limit</b> rules or Industrial Track rules depending on specific operational circumstances. They all have the same basic working theory, that two trains, approaching head on, will each be able to come to a complete stop upon seeing one another. Restricted speed operation generally works with a maximum speed of 15 or 20 mph and a typical speed governed by length of train and visual conditions.|$|R

Part of the pack hunted down the ridge in full cry, while the rest lay in wait to spring at the flying game as it came on and drive it out of the paths into the deep snow, where it would speedily be at their mercy. At the thought I gripped the club hard, promising to stop that kind of hunting for good, if only I could get half a chance.|$|R

50|$|The Fridley {{station is}} at the {{westbound}} <b>yard</b> <b>limit</b> of the BNSF Railway Northtown classification yard. There are multiple rail sidings in the area {{on both sides of}} the double track main line. The current station has only one side of the platform in use, requiring the Northstar train to be on that track when traveling inbound to or outbound from Minneapolis. Trains cross to and from that track at Coon Creek Junction. The eventual plan is that BNSF will construct a third main line in the area, running from East Interstate (the bridge over Interstate 694) to Coon Creek Junction in Coon Rapids. This is a Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant application submitted to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The third main line would improve capacity on the busiest rail corridor in the Twin Cities metropolitan area. In July 2009, this segment hosted 63 trains per day, before the 12 daily trips for Northstar are added. At Coon Creek Junction, 12 trains per day cut off to the Duluth line. The completion of the third main line will include construction of the Foley Boulevard station and allow for 22 more passenger trains per day for Northstar, the proposed Northern Lights Express, Amtrak, and possibly other services.|$|R
