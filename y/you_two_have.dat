500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they {{do well in school}} and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left for us to go but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The abrupt {{change in}} Prince Henry's {{somewhat}} carefree life {{up to that}} point was made clear by the new King on the very first evening of his reign. [...] "If you two think that, now that I have taken this new job on, you can go on behaving just as you like, in the same old way, you are very much mistaken! <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> to pull yourselves together", the King warned his two brothers at dinner.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hallo!" [...] he said. [...] "Then <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> {{trouble when}} <b>you</b> split? Now, Damer {{was telling me}} he'd got kind of tired of saw milling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} told her that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> had your little game of play, like two children, and {{that there must be}} an end of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might do, but you won't, my lad; for {{if you did}} {{you would}} {{probably}} start your wound bleeding afresh. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> best take your shoes off directly you get on deck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What? <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> {{talked the}} matter over? No doubt you have. And the foolish child {{considers}} himself bound in honour--of course he does, the gaby!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> defended this place alone, and killed sixteen of the enemy, besides some I see lying farther up the road?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of all these {{troubles}} he went down to dinner. [...] "Lady Mabel," [...] said the Duke, [...] "tells me that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> been to see Sir Guy's look-out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim, do {{you lead}} your master's horse, while the constable takes the other; and then <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> better ride on, and help Mrs. Donald get things ready. Get a bed up at once, for Captain Whitney; {{and get some}} clean straw in the outhouse, {{with one of the}} rugs over it, for the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate exclaimed with glowing eyes: [...] "And {{all this}} change in <b>you</b> <b>two</b> men <b>has</b> come about through the {{influence}} of a pretty girl!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will have}} to go by {{yourself}} to-morrow. I ... No, I think I mustn't come. Better not. What <b>you</b> <b>two</b> will <b>have</b> to say to each other--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stella tells me," [...] he went on, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> {{entered into}} a {{marriage}} engagement. She tells me also that she loves you, and that {{you say that you}} love her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Adelaide kept repeating, with coy slyness: [...] "Isn't it too bad <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> {{me in the}} way!" [...] and: [...] "Don't mind poor me. Auntie {{will turn}} her back any time you want her to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It'll 'ardly pay {{me for my}} trouble," [...] he said, {{shaking his}} head. [...] "It's very dull over 'ere all alone by myself. By the time <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> 'ad your share, besides taking wot I owe you, there'll be 'ardly {{anything}} left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I live," [...] he declared, [...] "this is {{the first}} time that any money {{consideration}} has induced me to break away from our principles. Count von Hern had powerful friends who were our friends, and he gave me the word, straight, that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> an appointment down below which was considerably overdue. I don't know, even now, why I consented. I guess it isn't much use apologising." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, I will try," [...] said Mark, quickly. [...] "We {{shall be}} {{starved to death}} at this rate. Yonder is a line of bushes that runs close out to the brute. I'll stalk it. When close I will make a dash at it, get as near as I can, clap the muzzle against its ribs if possible, and--well, we shall see! <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>had</b> better stop here and look on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{get even}} somehow without Redmond, {{and to that}} end <b>you</b> <b>two</b> will <b>have</b> to run Gaspard's Trail," [...] I said. [...] "I'm going down to Montreal with Carolan's cattle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There you are, you see," [...] {{broke in}} Jimmy Silver triumphantly, [...] "it's all a misunderstanding. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> got {{no right to}} be cutting one another. Why on earth can't you stop all this rot, and behave like decent members of society again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Bertie,' {{interposed}} his mother, 'I'll {{not have}} you teasing and running down your sister, though I do {{say it is}} a shame and a slight to pick out the youngest, when poor Ida is so delicate, and both of <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> ever so much better a right to favours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Cheriton," [...] I said warmly, {{longing to}} kiss her as I spoke, [...] "I shall never forget how kind <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> been to me. I do wish so much I hadn't to leave you like this. But it's quite inevitable. I don't see really how I could ever endure--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our Sophia Antonovna {{wishes to}} be made known to you," [...] he {{addressed}} me, in his guarded voice. [...] "And so I leave <b>you</b> <b>two</b> to <b>have</b> a talk together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] {{said the}} old gentleman, [...] "we {{began to think that}} <b>you</b> <b>two</b> must <b>have</b> been out canoeing and got yourselves drowned in good earnest this time. What have you been doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mustn't go yet," [...] said Mrs. Walshingham, {{rising and}} taking his hand. [...] "I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>two</b> must <b>have</b> heaps {{to say to}} each other," [...] and so she escaped towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me, how <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> grown! You {{big things}} {{how dare you}} get head of me in this way!" [...] she said, {{standing}} on tiptoe to pat the curly pates before her, for Will and Geordie had shot up like weeds, and now grinned cheerfully down upon her as she surveyed them in comic amazement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she said. [...] "I {{talked to}} my uncle about it, and he was quite nice. He says {{that he does not}} want to see Stella again for a short time, but if <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> made up your minds to be married--that is how he put it--he is going to give Stella a million dollars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> {{found one}} another again, I see, but I have still a {{surprise}} left for you. Don't hesitate, Princess, {{to tell your}} devoted shepherd how dearly you love him, as he is the very Prince your father sent you to marry. So come here both of you and let me crown you, {{and we will have}} the wedding at once.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think," [...] said Bridge, after {{a moment}} of general silence, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> crooks <b>had</b> better beat it. Do you get me?" [...] and he looked from Dopey Charlie to The General and back again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nevertheless, don't {{imagine that}} I don't {{appreciate}} what <b>you</b> <b>two</b> lads <b>have</b> done for me," [...] went on Mr. Dawson, earnestly. [...] "It {{was a fine}} thing to do, and I'll not forget it in a hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you mean, and it's all very well. After your {{different}} fashions <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> been true to me, and I don't care how much you see of my hand. That man's insolence angers me {{to such an extent}} that I cannot refrain from speaking out. He hasn't spirit enough to go out with me, or I would shoot him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The yellow hen we {{reckoned}} {{was lost}} is sittin' in the hayloft, and mustn't be disturbed," [...] said Mrs. Beasley, with decision; [...] "and ye'll {{have to take}} the hay from the stack to-night. And," [...] with an arch glance at the deputy, [...] "as I don't see that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> done much either, you're just in time to help fodder down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then part," [...] she cried, [...] "part. If {{you don't}} want a smashing up,--part! <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>have</b> {{got to be}} parted. You've got never {{to see each other}} ever, never to speak." [...] There was a zest in her voice. [...] "We're not {{circulating}} stories," [...] she denied. [...] "No! And Curmain never told us anything--Curmain is an EXCELLENT young man; oh! a quite excellent young man. You misjudged him altogether."...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{the former}} remarked, rising to his feet, [...] "I think I'll go and turn in. I dare say <b>you</b> <b>two</b> still <b>have</b> some {{business}} to talk about, especially if Mr. Meyer is leaving us shortly." ...|$|R
