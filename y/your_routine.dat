It is not necessary, however, to have a friend in organizations to experience Dialectical contradictions. Stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose. Impartiality vs. Favoritism: Friends within organizations desire to provide each other with special support and assistance but organizations strive for equitable treatment and discourage bias. Openness vs. Closedness: It is a tendency of close friends to be open and honest with one another, but organizations often expect a level of confidentiality that places strain on friendships that value the sharing of information.

40|$|Some PDP 6 LISP {{users have}} felt {{a need for}} a way to {{incorporate}} MIDAS subroutines into LISP. LISP has been changed to let you do this, using files found on the LISP SYSTEM microtape. You write a routine for LISP {{in much the same way}} that you write any other MIDAS relocatable subroutine. You must, however, observe the constraints imposed by LISP's allocation and use of accumulators, and its methods of handling input, output, and interrupts. In addition, you require linkage to LISP before <b>your</b> <b>routine</b> can operate properly: The entry point(s) of the subroutine must be put on the property list(s) of the appropriate atom(s), and the address fields of the instructions pointing to other routines, to list structure, or the other LISP data structures must be set properly. This is done when LISP begins operation??er allocation, but before going into its listen loop. We provide eight macros to ease the job of creating such linkages: SUBR, FSUBR, MACRO, QUOTE, E, SPECIAL, and SYM. If you write "SUBR name" at a location a in <b>your</b> <b>routine,</b> LISP will subsequently ascribe the property SUBR to the atom name, with entry location a. Similar remarks apply to the use of FSBUR, LSBUR, and MACRO. The significance and use of other four macros is perhaps best communicated through examples: 1. An instruction like "MOVEI A,QUOTE(X Y Z) " will be assembled as "MOVEI A,O". At link time, however, LISP will insert the location of list (X Y Z) into the address field of the instruction. 2. 2. Suppose that the atom FOO has the properties shown in Figure 1. Then the instructions "MOVEI A QUOTE FOO", "MOVEM B, SPECIAL FOO", "PUSHJ P, SYM FOO", and "CALL E FOO" will each be assembled with a zero address field, which will be modified at link time to be b, c, 106, and 101, respectively.
