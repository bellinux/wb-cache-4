6000|$|Lister laughed. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I believe I did shout {{you to go}} back. Anyhow, {{you were}} some way behind. Did Willis come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he admitted, [...] "there's a {{good deal}} in what you say, Penelope. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> all as though you were a diplomat yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} know the way, Mr. Fitzgibbon? It is so dark here I can {{scarcely}} see my hand. And if {{we get into the}} fog <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> will be as black as ink." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gorn!" [...] ses George. [...] "Gorn! My {{box with}} twenty-five pounds in, wot I trusted you with, gorn? Wot are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It</b> can’t be—it’s too crool!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Jealous!' says I. 'Why, man, {{what are}} <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It</b> {{makes me think}} ten times as much of you as I did before I knew about it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Chris Halverson, son of Fellowship co-founder Richard C. Halverson, {{said that}} a culture of {{pastoral}} confidentiality {{is essential to the}} ministry: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> would destroy that fellowship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, old fellow," [...] Holderness interrupted, [...] "it's all splendid, of course, and I'm {{dying to}} hear <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but come along now and be {{introduced}} to Miss Van Teyl. Molly's over there, waiting, and we're all half starved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't {{reflect upon}} her unless <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and {{both you and}} Mrs. Chisholm have sense enough to refrain from doing that," [...] he {{answered}} dryly. [...] "I can't flatter myself that Evelyn will grieve over me." [...] Then his manner changed. [...] "Now we'll get down to business. I don't purpose to call in that loan, which will, no doubt, be a relief to you." ...|$|E
60|$|CATHERINE [springing energetically {{out of bed}} and seating {{herself on}} the edge of it]. Flogged! I! A Liberal Empress! A philosopher! You are a barbarian, Naryshkin. [She rises and turns to the courtiers.] And then, as if I cared! [She turns again to Naryshkin.] You should know by this time that I am frank and {{original}} in character, like an Englishman. [She walks about restlessly.] No: what maddens me about all this ceremony is that I am the only person in Russia who gets no fun out of my being Empress. You all glory in me: you bask in my smiles: you get titles and honors and favors from me: you are dazzled by my crown and my robes: you feel splendid when you have been admitted to my presence; and when I say a gracious word to you, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to everyone you meet for a week afterwards. But what do I get out of it? Nothing. [She throws herself into the chair. Naryshkin deprecates with a gesture; she hurls an emphatic repetition at him.] Nothing!! I wear a crown until my neck aches: I stand looking majestic until I am ready to drop: I have to smile at ugly old ambassadors and frown and turn my back on young and handsome ones. Nobody gives me anything. When I was only an Archduchess, the English ambassador used to give me money whenever I wanted it--or rather whenever he wanted to get anything out of my sacred predecessor Elizabeth [the Court bows to the ground]; but now that I am Empress he never gives me a kopek. When I have headaches and colics I envy the scullerymaids. And you are not a bit grateful to me for all my care of you, my work, my thought, my fatigue, my sufferings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Syme as he sank wearily {{back in the}} {{cushions}} of his carriage; [...] "but if it is, it's one of the jokes <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It's</b> a good-natured one." ...|$|R
6000|$|COLONEL. It {{had been}} better had <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> less <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Sergeant, get ready. (Gives purse to PETER.) Here, you {{cheating}} rascal! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, when I {{think how}} {{it would have been}} without you? No, I will not tease <b>you</b> by <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> but <b>you</b> know how we shall always feel for you. Are you in much pain now?" ...|$|R
5000|$|When <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> now it {{apparently}} conveys nothing. I {{know of no}} one in the younger generation who has the faintest idea what the Depression was. They think it was a hard time and so forth. It was murderous. For awhile I lived outside the city. I dreaded coming home, because as I approached Grand Central Station, I would pass well-dressed young men more or less my age. Every now and then I saw friends of mine from Yale, selling lead pencils, and with an expression of shame on their faces. They had no name for shame, but they felt it. The city was full of that whole sense.|$|E
5000|$|A piece such as tlakwa {{speaks to}} a more {{ambiguous}} kind of oppression, whereby matrices of race, power and servility are made visible in something as seemingly innocuous as a commemorative coin. Robert Enright, curator of a survey show of Drever's work entitled, Everything {{is going to be}} OK again soon, says of Drever: [...] "Dean’s main interests are issues of power, violence and racism. Those are pretty heavy topics, but we believe art is serious business and if you can’t talk about some of our greatest challenges and the things that influence most directly as a society with art, how can <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> Art is free to talk about everything." ...|$|E
5000|$|Depay's {{first goal}} since the World Cup {{came in a}} {{friendly}} at the Amsterdam Arena on 5 June 2015, deflecting Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's shot to put the Netherlands 3-1 up against the United States, although the team eventually lost 4-3. In October of that year, {{he was involved in}} a fight with teammate Robin van Persie at an international training camp; manager Danny Blind stated to the media, [...] "There are sometimes situations in training where players think different. Then <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> That's what happened and then it's over." [...] The following month, both Depay and Van Persie were dropped from the Dutch squad for friendlies against Wales and Germany, with Blind stating of Depay, [...] "In football you must function in a team. He doesn't always do that. That's something he has to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{mean you}} were afraid I'd get after you about your crank notion of finding the old man's lode? As <b>you</b> haven't <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for some time, I'd begun to hope you had given that folly up. Are you going?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; that's another word. But you can't get any farther. God made electricity, or {{whatever}} it is, and when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> explaining <b>it,</b> <b>you</b> only get to something that is. You know it is, and you can't get any farther,' he repeated.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is <b>you</b> that <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I only <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> because I {{want to give}} it you;--yes, {{all that}} I have. When I first knew what was the real meaning of my husband's will, my only thought was to be of {{assistance}} to you." ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary art {{trade in}} the Czech Republic has been {{regarded}} as a private area accessible only to a few insiders. So far no adequate literature about this field has existed, the marketing strategies used within it were, {{not only from the}} outside perspective, quite unclear. This work shows {{that it is not a}} secret sphere. On the contrary, it is a part of the market, which has the effect that the more <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> openly, the better impact it has on the whole society. The author presents the current situation in this field, its historical context, and openly discusses the long-term marketing strategies of gallerists who work with contemporary artists. On the basis of case studies from abroad she also shows other possible ways how to bring society closer to contemporary art by means of some specific marketing tools...|$|E
6000|$|... "You speak like a girl," [...] said Mr. Ferrars, [...] "and a headstrong girl, {{which you}} always have been. You know not what <b>you</b> are <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> <b>It</b> {{is a matter of}} life or death. Your decorous {{marriage}} would have saved us from absolute ruin." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{follow-up}} episode, the same Indian berates the narrator for discussing cannibalism {{in the opening}} recap, but Rocky counters that <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> just not do it on TV. The Indian then says, [...] "That sound like network alright-all talk, no do." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There {{were lots}} of hacks out there who said we couldn't do it anymore", remarked Mick Jagger. [...] "But maybe what they meant was they couldn't do it anymore. Anyway, once we started playing, all that died down. <b>You</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> - but, once we're onstage, the {{question}} is answered." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Farnes said I'm {{very proud}} of having fought in the Battle of Britain, it is thought of as being a {{considerable}} achievement. Whether {{we like it or}} not, and the Navy do not, but if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> sensibly <b>about</b> <b>it</b> people accept it as an iconic occurrence.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Mrs. Walker, [...] "I {{have just}} said that I would rather <b>you</b> would not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Papa will be in directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad it {{was only}} you and the doctor that saw my foolishness," [...] {{continued}} the other, still in a low voice. [...] "Other people might have talked, but I knew {{that you were a}} reliable man, Smith. And <b>you</b> won't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in the future, I'm quite certain of that. Good afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He lied," [...] said Edith. [...] "When <b>you</b> and I <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> together, {{we should}} tell the simple truth. We have pardoned him his lie;--but he lied." ...|$|R
5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it....</b> n his own way, the man integrated football the right way – {{and no one was}} going to stop him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And instead, {{you have}} driven through the town, I suppose, where {{everybody}} will see <b>you</b> and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But," [...] she added, raising {{her dark eyes}} suddenly to his, [...] "where else have you been? The train gets into Warensboro at six, and it's only half an hour's drive from there. What have you been doing, Edward?" ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{promote his}} film The Love Letter, Selleck {{was invited to}} be on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 19, 1999. Unexpectedly, he found himself {{defending}} an ad in which he appeared supporting the National Rifle Association (NRA) and his position on gun ownership. After questions from O'Donnell, Selleck said, [...] "It's your show, and <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> after I leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If my fortune {{is really}} gone," [...] she said, [...] "why do <b>you</b> let people <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and write <b>about</b> {{me in the}} papers as though I were still so rich?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; {{there was}} nothing else to see. Why do you ask? But <b>you</b> mustn't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> worship. <b>It</b> is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "ORB?" [...] says I. [...] "Why, {{what are}} <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about,</b> young man? <b>It</b> ain't an orb; it's a country; it's a continent. Columbus {{discovered}} it; I reckon likely you've heard of HIM, anyway. America--why, sir, America--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Money--money; {{and he is}} to sell {{himself for}} money? Oh, Trichy! do not <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> money. <b>It</b> is horrible. But, Trichy, I will grant it--I cannot marry him; but still, I love him. He has a name, {{a place in the}} world, and fortune, family, high blood, position, everything. He has all this, and I have nothing. Of course I cannot marry him. But yet I do love him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In another minute," [...] Molyneux exclaimed, {{waking up}} with a start, [...] "I should have been asleep. Whatever have <b>you</b> two been <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It</b> was the most {{soothing}} hum I ever heard in my life." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull led to speculation that LaBeouf {{will take over}} the franchise from Ford. In an interview with IGN, [...] "Spielberg indicated that LaBeouf has to make multiple Transformers movies before he can move over and take on the fedora and bullwhip of Indiana Jones." [...] The actor himself said, [...] "Am I into it? Who wouldn't be? I don't think that's reality. It's a fun rumor." [...] Ford said he would return for a fifth film {{if it does not}} take another twenty years to develop, while Spielberg responded it would happen [...] "only if you [...] want more". [...] In an interview with Time, when asked about passing the fedora to LaBeouf in the next film, Ford said, [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about?</b> <b>It's</b> mine. I would love to do another Indiana Jones movie. George Lucas is working on an idea now. Shia can get his own hat. I earned that hat." ...|$|R
