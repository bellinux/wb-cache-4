500|$|In 2006, Constantine and Woodall {{moved from}} the BBC to ITV in a deal reputedly worth £1.2 million {{to start a new}} show, Trinny & Susannah Undress..., on 3 October. The second series of Trinny & Susannah Undress... was {{transmitted}} in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage. [...] Constantine found it warming that people could open up to them as confidantes, and also said [...] "It's been fascinating to see how looking good and having faith in <b>your</b> <b>appearance</b> makes you into a sexier person, which makes you attractive to your partner again." [...] Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying. The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme. On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.|$|E
500|$|In 1976, Ripken {{finally reached}} the major leagues when the Orioles named him their bullpen coach. Halfway through 1977, he became the third base coach for the Orioles when Billy Hunter was hired to be {{the manager of the}} Texas Rangers. Ripken served in this role through the 1986 season. During this time, and even later when he became a manager, he would pitch batting {{practice}} and hit fungoes before games. He {{would be one of the}} last members of the team to leave after games. Ripken could be tough on the players he coached, enjoying using the term [...] "lunkhead" [...] when talking to them, but he would always make time to answer any questions they had about the game. Doug DeCinces, who played under him through the 1981 season, recalled, [...] "He was the dictator of that regimen, instructing us on everything down to how to wear our socks. He said, `Take pride in <b>your</b> <b>appearance</b> and you'll take pride in your game.'" [...] The Orioles experienced great success during this time, reaching the World Series in 1979, which they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates in seven games. Four years later, Ripken earned a World Series ring as the Orioles won the 1983 World Series in five games over the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

2500|$|By this point, Li Kui {{also had}} the {{additional}} office of deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang). [...] He was displeased with how the officials {{in charge of the}} imperial examinations at the time were making their testing questions test highly obscure facts, and he believed that this led to the selection of examinees who were not necessarily talented or capable in writing. [...] He therefore, at the examinations, made the Confucian classics, histories, and qieyun references available to the examinees for them to look through the books during examination. [...] He was much praised for this reform. [...] It was also said that Li Kui was handsome in appearance and capable in rhetoric. [...] Emperor Suzong once told him, [...] "You, sir, are the highest grade in your clan's prominence, in <b>your</b> <b>appearance,</b> and in your writing." ...|$|E
