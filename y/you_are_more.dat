The lighting is kept low, drawing attention to the visuals on the LED curtains used throughout the tour and obscuring much of the band members' facial features in shadow. Courtes and Fougerol explained: [...] "we wanted to reflect the mood we've seen at the concerts, so we played with that lighting knowing that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> blinded from a light if it was darker before".|$|E
500|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Palestine Police Force, al-Qassam's funeral, which {{was held at the}} Jerini Mosque, attracted at least 3,000 mourners, mostly members of the peasant and working classes. His coffin and those of his slain comrades were draped in the flags of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, the only three independent Arab countries at the time. In reaction to al-Qassam's death, strikes were held in Haifa and several Palestinian and Syrian cities. Al-Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, now Nesher, a Jewish suburb of Haifa. An obituary for al-Qassam was published in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram on 22 November, eulogizing him as a [...] "martyr" [...] with the following statement: [...] "I heard you preaching from up in the pulpit, summoning to the sword ... Through your death <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> eloquent than ever you were in life." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then had to worry about how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E

2500|$|The {{explicit}} {{notion of}} such a thing was first introduced by a Newsweek article entitled [...] "The Hillary Doctrine" [...] and published in March 2011 by journalist Gayle Tzemach Lemmon. In it, Clinton is quoted as saying that she believes [...] "that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century." [...] To strengthen her argument for women's rights, Clinton situates this issue within the context of national security, in that, [...] "where women are disempowered and dehumanized, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} version of TLC {{did not put}} weights on the links between nodes. This version performed comparably to humans in many tasks, but failed to predict that people would respond faster to questions regarding more typical category instances than those involving less typical instances. Collins and Quillian later updated TLC to include weighted connections to account for this effect. This updated TLC is capable of explaining both the familiarity effect and the typicality effect. Its biggest advantage is that it clearly explains priming: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to retrieve information from memory if related information (the [...] "prime") has been presented a short time before. There are still a number of memory phenomena for which TLC has no account, including why {{people are able to}} respond quickly to obviously false questions (like [...] "is a chicken a meteor?"), when the relevant nodes are very far apart in the network.|$|E
2500|$|The verdict by Maurice Willson Disher in The Times Literary Supplement of 14 June 1941 was positive: [...] "To {{maintain}} {{a place at}} the head of detective-writers would be difficult enough without the ever increasing rivalry. Even Miss Christie cannot stay there unchallenged though she has a following which will swear her books are best without reading the others. Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now". After summarising the plot, the Mr. Disher concluded: [...] "Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody is well aware that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> discerning than you really are. Then she springs her secret like a land-mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative). She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – [...] "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" [...] – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present Nujood Ali and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age. At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but because I see it as [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me." ...|$|E
