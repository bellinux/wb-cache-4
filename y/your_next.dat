Together, Lane and Bedlam Productions organised {{a reading of the}} play in Pleasance Theatre, a small house in north London, to a group of Australian expatriates, among whom was Tom Hooper's mother. She called her son and said, [...] "I've found <b>your</b> <b>next</b> project".|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the song, Harrison {{delivers}} a spoken dedication to Frank Sinatra, adding: [...] "we love you, Frank, and we hope you include this one at Caesars Palace on <b>your</b> <b>next</b> live album." [...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers. Unlike on the Wood recording, Harrison's slide guitar appears only midway through the Dark Horse version (overdubbed onto his rhythm guitar part), in a solo that author Elliot Huntley describes as [...] "wonderfully complement" [...] by Scott's [...] "bachelor-pad saxophones".|$|E

500|$|... "Party" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Melissa Locker of Vanity Fair described [...] "Party" [...] as [...] "wildly catchy" [...] and deemed {{it the best}} song of {{the second week of}} July 2015. Casey Lewis, writing for Teen Vogue, characterized it as a [...] "perfect-for-summer synth-pop anthem" [...] and compared the song's music styles to works of American singer Katy Perry. Jeff Benjamin from Fuse described the song as [...] "addictive" [...] and felt that it would [...] "get a ton of plays at <b>your</b> <b>next</b> gals' night out." [...] He also named it the best song of the summer of 2015. A reviewer from The Malay Mail wrote a positive review, saying [...] "If Korean super girl group Girls' Generation's new upbeat, bubble-gum pop single doesn't brighten up your day, we don't know what will." ...|$|E
500|$|Erika Berlin of Rolling Stone {{said that}} the song proves that Robyn [...] "can crank out catchy jams as fast as pop's biggest hitmakers." [...] Tyler Grisham of Pitchfork noted Robyn's ability to {{synthesize}} [...] "disparate moods and feelings in a single track." [...] He concluded by saying that [...] "it would take lesser pop artists an entire album to explore the wide spectrum of emotions that she can express {{in less than four}} minutes." [...] Robert Ballantyne of music website Popjournalism described it as [...] "both a peppy pop track and a ballad", and called it Robyn's best single yet, stating, [...] "Producer and long-time Robyn collaborator Klas Åhlund adds {{just the right amount of}} au courant electro-pop into the mix, but not too much to doom the track to the dance-club ghetto." [...] Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, and wrote that [...] "What began life as a subdued-but-beautiful strings 'n' piano ballad is now a strident electropop tune that percolates as enviably as <b>your</b> <b>next</b> door neighbour's brand new coffee maker." ...|$|E
500|$|Released to {{positive}} reviews, with aggregated scores of 87/100 on Metacritic and 88.7% on GameRankings, some journalists considered Super Monkey Ball {{the highlight of}} the GameCube's launch lineup. The staff of Edge praised the main game as [...] "absorb" [...] due to its high level of difficulty, noting that the trial and error required to complete challenging levels forces one to learn the nuances of its [...] "reductive control system" [...] and eventually enables the player to perform seemingly impossible tasks with increasing ease: [...] "Once a level falls, the mysticism around it vanishes. It's beatable; it's an afterthought on the route to <b>your</b> <b>next</b> impossible hurdle." [...] Writing for GameSpy, Ben Turner commented on the [...] "excellent progression of difficulty" [...] engendered by three distinct difficulty modes and thoughtful stage design, expounding [...] "most levels introduce some new idea or concept to the game" [...] and [...] "every single level played adds to your skill." [...] IGN's Matt Casamassina commended the [...] "great level variation", with [...] "well created mazes and puzzles that must be completed using a combination of physics calculations, careful planning and a huge helping of patience." [...] Turner complimented the frequent introduction of incentives to keep playing such as additional continues and hidden levels, adding that a high [...] "ceiling of mastery" [...] enhanced the game's longevity through a [...] "simple but well conceived" [...] scoring system and the ability to test strategies in practice mode. Edge and Casamassina thought similarly, with the latter stating [...] "there are shortcuts that can be carved out by the crafty player, physics to be considered when navigating and more." [...] N-Sider's Tim Knowles pointed out that [...] "the latter levels in the game get extremely difficult and you will often get frustrated", while Casamassina felt [...] "it may be a little too difficult for the casual gamer." [...] However, N-Sider's Mark Medina called the learning curve [...] "perfectly spot on": [...] "Any falling off the platforms feels entirely your fault and at the same time, you always get the sense that you're just that little bit closer to that elusive goal." [...] Edge and N-Sider's Jason Nuyens and Will Stevenson agreed with this sentiment, with the latter emphasizing the addictive quality of the gameplay. On a technical note, GamePros Four-Eyed Dragon faulted the camera system, which [...] "can get out of position, making it hard to maneuver in tight spots." [...] In The Japan Times, Steven L. Kent described the game as [...] "a test of nerve" [...] requiring [...] "advanced eye–hand coordination." [...] Turner reflected on the game's ability to evoke feelings of [...] "nervous excitement", [...] "intensity", and [...] "electrifying, stomach-wrenching fear": [...] "It's a thrilling feeling to be winding down a paper-thin path with ten seconds on the clock, hoping against hope that you can keep your balance for just a few more seconds and make it to the goal before time expires." [...] Edge opined that the game is [...] "defined" [...] by [...] "unrefined and angular" [...] emotions: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the media}} uproar that followed, Richards' manager {{said that the}} anecdote had been meant as a joke; Beaumont told Uncut {{magazine}} that the interview had been conducted by international telephone {{and that he had}} misquoted Richards at one point (reporting that Richards had said he listens to Motörhead, when what he had said was Mozart), but that he believed the ash-snorting anecdote was true. Musician Jay Farrar from the band Son Volt wrote a song titled 'Cocaine And Ashes', which was inspired by Richards' drug habits.. The incident was also referenced in the 2017 song [...] "Mr Charisma" [...] by The Waterboys, featuring the lyrics: [...] "Hey Mr Charisma, what will <b>your</b> <b>next</b> trick be?

2500|$|However, {{while he}} enjoyed the {{confidence}} of Queen Mary of Modena, {{it was clear that}} he was growing uncomfortable under the recently enthroned James: the violently hostile reception he got from the public when he gave evidence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops left him badly shaken. When he urged James to put away his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, James said that he had not realised Sunderland was his confessor, and told him to mind his own business for the future. Sunderland's unpopularity was now almost universal: Burnet wrote that it was [...] "the wonder of all mankind" [...] that James continued to employ him. He was summarily dismissed at last in October 1688, with the remark, [...] "You have your pardon; much good doe it you. I hope you will be more faithful to <b>your</b> <b>next</b> master than you have been to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The oral {{evaluations}} {{are intended}} to also help the evaluator improve {{his or her ability}} to give constructive feedback to other Toastmasters. Learning to give feedback develops many skills, some of which include: effective listening; how to motivate, encourage and support other members; and how to develop and present a short evaluation with minimal preparation. Language is an important element of effective evaluation and so too is the structure. The structure of a Toastmaster Evaluation might be referred to as the [...] "feedback sandwich," [...] the [...] "PIP" [...] (praise, improve, praise) method, or the [...] "CRC" [...] (commend, recommend, commend) method. [...] One particularly effective technique is to couch a suggestion for improvement as a compliment, as in: [...] "You have an important and powerful message; it deserves to be heard {{in the back of the}} room. [...] Consider increasing your volume when you give <b>your</b> <b>next</b> speech." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, she {{released}} her second album, Now Is the Time, a ballad-driven record that featured less glitzy production than Alanis and contained more thoughtful lyrics. Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She {{said of the}} album, [...] "people could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it ... people will like <b>your</b> <b>next</b> album if it's a suck-ass one." [...] As with Alanis (1991), Now Is the Time (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"An Emotion Away", the minor adult contemporary hit [...] "No Apologies" [...] and [...] "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". It was a commercial failure, however, selling {{only a little more}} than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract.|$|E

[...] The dog is found by a teenage Lois Lane and brought to the Kent farm. In the final scene when the Kent family and Lois are deciding on a name, Lois drapes a red towel around the dog after giving it a bath, which mimics a cape. Clark [...] considers naming him [...] "Krypto". When Lex asks the meaning behind the name, Clark says that it's because of his [...] origins. Lois dislikes the name, telling him, [...] "You can't name <b>your</b> <b>next</b> dog Krypto." [...] He eventually names the dog [...] "Shelby" [...] after one of Martha's old dogs.

The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. [...] King said LePage was [...] "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" [...] and demanded that LePage [...] "man up and apologize". [...] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating [...] "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said."
