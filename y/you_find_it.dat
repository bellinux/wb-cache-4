5|$|This is not {{the world}} of Ally McBeal. It is not about finding love remedially. This is {{a world in which}} too many of us are asking what use is love if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> too late. Yet somehow, {{probably}} because the moral judgments are lightly made, superannuated singletons such as myself can look on and see an advertisement for, rather than a warning against, that famously honourable estate—just as we do when we gaze at the more benign marriages of our friends. In Vanity Fair, Thackeray deliberately wrote a novel without a hero. We respond to Cold Feet because it, on the contrary, does not despise its characters.|$|E

25|$|The Interior, {{except for}} its screen, has more congruity; the tracery {{of the windows}} and the Gothic network of the roof bear one another company, and are only {{disturbed}} by the proportions of the whole, which have more of Trinity Chapel than {{is in keeping with}} the interior of a building in the Perpendicular style. This same roof, or rather ceiling, has given rise to much speculation, and in almost every book on the Chapel <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> stated that it came from St. Mary's College, and that it does not fit the building. This, however, is true only in part. The facts appear to be these. The old Chapel of St. Mary's College possessed a fine open-timbered hammer-beam roof. When this was pulled down the roof was transported and housed, not in St. Mary's Churchyard, but in the College, under sheds, till the walls were ready to receive it. It was then put up over the new Chapel, one of the hammer-beams being secured with irons. The trusses were carefully spaced out to suit the windows and the length of the antechapel, which is so proportioned that it is equal, from east to west, to two bays of the Chapel itself, there being a very narrow strip over the organ, with a pair of brackets on either side, instead of one. This is not due to a misfit, but is intentional, otherwise the key of the vault at the centre of the bay would not come opposite the centre of the window. The brackets, which are all that can be seen of the old roof, do not come exactly in the centre of the piers between the windows, possibly because the windows are not opposite one another, or more probably because the old trusses had become distorted in moving.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, Best {{stated that}} Epstein drove {{them both to}} Blackpool one evening where Epstein {{expressed}} his [...] "very fond admiration." [...] Epstein then supposedly said, [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> embarrassing if I ask you {{to stay in a}} hotel overnight?" [...] Best replied that he was not interested, and the two never mentioned the incident again. There were reports of a brief sexual encounter between Lennon and Epstein during a four-day holiday in Barcelona, in April 1963. Lennon always denied the rumours, telling Playboy in 1980: [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated... but we did have a pretty intense relationship." [...] Lennon's first wife Cynthia also maintains that Lennon's relationship with Epstein was platonic. A fictionalised account of the Spanish holiday is featured in the 1991 film The Hours and Times.|$|E
500|$|After {{developing}} {{a name for}} himself as a female impersonator known for [...] "trashy" [...] behavior in his early John Waters films, Divine capitalized on this image by appearing at his musical performances in his drag persona. In this role, he was described by his manager Bernard Jay, as displaying [...] "Trash. Filth. Obscenity. In bucket-loads". [...] Divine described his stage performances as [...] "just good, dirty fun, and if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> offensive, honey, don't join in." [...] As a part of his performance, he constantly swore at the audience, often using his signature line of [...] "fuck you very much", and at times got audience members to come onstage, where he would fondle their buttocks, groins, and breasts. Divine and his stage act proved particularly popular among gay audiences, and he appeared at some of the world's biggest gay clubs, such as Central London's Heaven. According to Divine's manager Bernard Jay, this was not because Divine himself was gay, but because the gay community [...] "openly and proudly identified with the determination of the female character Divine".|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. I wrote to Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|That same year, deHavilland {{made two}} more period films, {{beginning}} with The Great Garrick, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor's encounter with jealous {{players from the}} Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass {{him on his way}} to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to get the last laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland's Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes {{to be one of the}} players. With her refined demeanor and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is [...] "lighthearted and thoroughly believable", according to Judith Kass. Variety praised the film, calling it [...] "a production of superlative workmanship". Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. Her final film that year was Michael Curtiz's romantic drama Gold Is Where <b>You</b> <b>Find</b> <b>It,</b> a film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in three-strip Technicolor.|$|E
2500|$|... "Wolf fence" [...] algorithm: Edward Gauss {{described}} this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: [...] "There's one wolf in Alaska; how do <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it?</b> First build a fence {{down the middle}} of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf." [...] This is implemented e.g. in the Git version control system as the command git bisect, which uses the above algorithm to determine which commit introduced a particular bug.|$|E
2500|$|Boros {{also studied}} pitchers, looking for tipoffs that they {{intended}} to throw to first base. He said, [...] "There's always some tipoff. The head, the shoulder, the hip, the knee, the toe – every pitcher has something that gives away his pickoff move. When <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it,</b> you've got the upper hand on the base baths." [...] With the benefit of Boros' scientific approach, the Royals led the American League in stolen bases in both 1978 (216) and 1979 (207). The 1978 team had eight players (led by Willie Wilson, Freddie Patek, Amos Otis, George Brett, and Hal McRae) who stole at least 10 bases and won the American League West pennant {{with a record of}} 92–70.|$|E

The song has a [...] "simple, pleasant melody" [...] {{and has been}} described as an [...] "upbeat track tinged with full good electronica". The music used was deadmau5's [...] "Brazil (2nd Edit)", which was re-edited for the vocals by Stargate. In explaining the song, Jordan revealed it is about [...] "finding love in yourself before <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in someone else, {{because a lot of people}} lose themselves when they fall in love, and they forget who they are, and that's what you've gotta do. You've gotta find someone who loves you for you". Songwriter Autumn Rowe has said in an interview that [...] "Happiness" [...] has an African influence.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time Hewitt and Williams decided to hold a contest in the Orlando Sentinel {{newspaper}} to get names for their new franchise. Out {{of a total of}} 4,296 submitted entries, the names were subsequently narrowed to four, [...] "Heat", [...] "Tropics", [...] "Juice", and [...] "Magic". The last one, which had been submitted by 11 people, was picked after Williams brought his 7-year-old daughter Karyn to visit in Orlando. On July 27, 1986, it was announced that the committee chose the Magic to be the new name of the Orlando franchise in the NBA. The name [...] "Magic" [...] alludes to the area's biggest tourist attraction and economic engine Walt Disney World, along with its Magic Kingdom. Hewitt added that [...] "You look at all the aspects of Central Florida, and <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> really is an exciting place, a magical place." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} fools enter the synagogue, and seeing people occupying {{themselves}} with the law, ask how a person learns the law. They answer that first a person reads from children’s materials, then from the Torah, then from the Prophets ( [...] , Nevi'im), and then from the Writings ( [...] , Ketuvim). Then the person learns the Talmud, then the law ( [...] , halachah), and then the Midrash ( [...] , haggadot). Hearing this, fools ask themselves when they can learn all that, and turn to leave. Rabbi Jannai compared this to a loaf suspended in the air. The fool exclaims {{that no one can}} bring it down. But the wise person says that someone put it there and takes a ladder or stick and brings it down. So fools complain that they are unable to read all the law. But wise people learn a chapter every day until they read all the law. God said in [...] "it is not too hard for you," [...] but if <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> too hard, it is your own fault, because you do not study it.|$|E

2500|$|Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was {{inconsistent}} {{with his own}} ideas of some five years ago. After all, the Vekhi authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful) anti-Vekhi tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: Saratov bishop Dolganov even demanded his excommunication after the book Sick Russia [...] was published in 1910. For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a [...] "decadent pariah" [...] any-more, suddenly turned a [...] "well-established Russian novelist" [...] and the [...] "pride of the European literature." [...] Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved {{in the long run}} to be prophetic: [...] "The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several phrases are echoed {{throughout}} the play. In Act I, for example, Fred describes Mrs. Van Brugh as [...] "beloved, honoured, and courted by all" [...] – {{a phrase that}} Mrs. Van Brugh will repeat in her Act II scene with Smailey (as seen in the quote to the right): [...] "Woman—loved, honoured, courted by all. Woman—shunned, loathed, and unutterably despised, but still—Woman", foreshadowing the change in status that she will undergo {{by the end of}} the play. Ruth, in her Act I description of people who claimed to be trying to help her, describes people who have claimed to be trying to help her before: [...] "There's ladies come odd times. I call to mind one—come in a carriage she did. [...] Same story—poor, miserable, lost one—wretched, abandoned, fellow-creetur, and that." [...] This gets echoed in Mr. Smailey's catchphrase, [...] "I have no desire to press hardly on any fellow creature" [...] (also seen in the quote), which becomes more and more ironic in usage as the play goes on, finally being uttered by Fitz-Partington as he informs Mr. Smailey: [...] "I desire to press hardly on no fellow-creature, but your own policeman is without, and he will be happy to walk off with you whenever <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> convenient to be arrested." ...|$|E
