5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> a huge {{difference}} in the way the older generation performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

25|$|To sum up in a {{few words}} {{the result of this}} Instruction, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see,</b> from what I have stated, that the British Government demands from that of China {{satisfaction}} for the past and security for the future; and does not choose to trust to negotiation for obtaining either of these things; but has sent out a Naval and Military Force with orders to begin at once to take the Measures necessary for attaining the object in view.|$|E

The demand {{is greater than the}} supply, and collectors facilitate a high demand for these artistically made baskets.|$|E

A Marine by Lhote {{who invented the}} cubistic water. A figure nue by de la Fresnaye, which seems made with wooden bricks, and a mind-boggling Essai pour trois portraits by Fernand Léger. There too, Gleizes, a Chasse and a Portrait, which I find deeply regrettable, because the author, once, proved he had talent.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between a sedge and a deadgrass is that the deadgrass shades contain no significant amount of red, while the sedge shades do have red. Coat and texture also play {{a factor in the}} perception of color. The self-color pattern is preferred by the standard (One color with or without lighter and darker shadings of the same color). <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> dogs with varying degrees of other markings such as: masking on top of the skull, striping effect of light & dark through the body and on legs, distinct & indistinct saddle markings, agouti coloring and tan points. All are acceptable, they are just not preferred.|$|E
25|$|St James Park, {{most likely}} named after its road frontage, is {{predominantly}} used for croquet, cricket and soccer. It {{is probably one}} of the most beautiful parks in the city with tree lined walkways and gardens. The park in the heart of Papanui is probably the best location to see over-wintering monarch butterflies. On a warm sunny late autumn or early winter's day head to the children's play ground and look into the largely leafless old trees. There <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> monarchs clustering together often holding on to the remaining leaves for support. It ís a great spot for a picnic beneath the trees with monarchs fluttering in the air above.|$|E

I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> that we look good.

Their work carries on a tradition of Scandinavian bubble-gum artistry that stretches from Abba to Max Martin". Sisario added that, unlike other's producers in the United States, [...] "Stargate signature is more difficult to detect, because to some degree the duo's style is an adaptable method, not a specific sound". Steve Lunt, an A executive at Atlantic Records, pointed out, however, that [...] "if you put a bunch of Stargate songs together <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> the thread running through them".|$|E
500|$|Yi {{was named}} to Milwaukee's {{starting}} lineup by head coach Larry Krystkowiak in place of Charlie Villanueva to begin the 2007–08 season. He recorded nine points and three rebounds in a debut loss to the Orlando Magic. He played his first home game in Milwaukee three days later and scored 16 points while grabbing eight boards in a 78–72 win over the Chicago Bulls. The game was also Yi's first game to be televised nationally in China, where it was watched by an estimated 100 million viewers.
