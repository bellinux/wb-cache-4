2500|$|Richardson was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. In January 1890, he spoke out against players like teammate John Clarkson who had joined the Brotherhood but remained with their old clubs. [...] Richardson said he would remain loyal to the Players' League even if it could only pay him $10 a week and added: [...] "I held up my hand and swore that I would stick to the brotherhood... I respect my word and regard my oath as sacred. [...] <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> hot it makes me to think of the way some of these players have acted." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>how</b> difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got {{a story that is}} possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out you would need a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E
