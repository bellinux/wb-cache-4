500|$|In 1859, Rockefeller {{went into}} the produce {{commission}} business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised $4,000 ($ in [...] dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, [...] "God gave me money", {{and he did not}} apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, [...] "gain all <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>save</b> all you can, and give all you can." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{those cases}} {{they did not}} manage to conceal, however, the GDR's media was subject to {{stringent}} controls by the Stasi {{as well as the}} Socialist Unity Party of Germany, using Neues Deutschland, the GDR's second largest daily newspaper, as their zentralorgan. Through its own television station, the GDR government controlled the content shown in television broadcasting as well. The GDR border troops‘ actions were being portrayed as legitimate border defense and the people who were killed while trying to escape were defamed both in official statements as well as in reports of the state-controlled media. In 1962, East German journalist Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler commented on the death of Peter Fechter in the television program Der schwarze Kanal: [...] "The life of every single one of our brave boys in uniform is worth more than the life of a lawbreaker to us. Staying away from the border, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>save</b> yourself blood, tears and screams." [...] SED newspaper Neues Deutschland claimed Fechter was driven into suicide by [...] "front city bandits" [...] as well as accusing him of being homosexual. [...] In similar fashion, Günter Litfin was falsely depicted as being a homosexual, a prostitute as well as a criminal. In 1966, the Berliner Zeitung depicted Eduard Wroblewski as antisocial and being wanted as a Foreign Legionnaire for serious crimes in the district of Halle. These cases were exemplary of representatives of the press constructing false allegations in order to defame killed escapees.|$|E

2500|$|His own organisation, The Life <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Save,</b> also {{recommends}} {{a selection of}} charities deemed by charity evaluators such as GiveWell {{to be the most}} effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYC was founded after Singer released his 2009 eponymous book, in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay [...] "Famine, Affluence and Morality", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take {{a significant portion of the}} money that we spend on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.|$|E

[...] Liu Bei's facial expression turned serious and he said, [...] "So Kong Rong knows that Liu Bei exists in this world!" [...] He then sent 3,000 troops to follow Taishi Ci back to Duchang. When the rebels heard that reinforcements had arrived, they fled and the siege of Duchang was automatically lifted. Kong Rong regarded Taishi Ci even more highly after this event. He told Taishi Ci, [...] "You are a young friend of mine." [...] When Taishi Ci returned home and told his mother about it, she said, [...] "I am very happy that you can repay Kong Rong's kindness in this way." ...|$|E
