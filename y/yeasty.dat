25|$|Mammals are not {{generally}} {{thought of as}} pollinators, but some rodents, bats and marsupials are significant pollinators and some even specialise in such activities. In South Africa certain species of Protea (in particular Protea humiflora, P. amplexicaulis, P. subulifolia, P. decurrens and P. cordata) are adapted to pollination by rodents (particularly Cape Spiny Mouse, Acomys subspinosus) and elephant shrews (Elephantulus species). The flowers are borne near the ground, are <b>yeasty</b> smelling, not colourful, and sunbirds reject the nectar with its high xylose content. The mice apparently can digest the xylose and they eat large quantities of the pollen. In Australia pollination by flying, gliding and earthbound mammals has been demonstrated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{potential}} for {{quality sparkling wine}} has attracted Champagne houses to open up wineries in California. These include Moët et Chandon's Domaine Chandon, Taittinger's Domaine Carneros and Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate. Despite being made with mostly the same grapes and with the same production techniques, California sparkling wines do not {{set out to be}} imitators of Champagne but rather to forge their own distinctive style. Instead of having the [...] "biscuity", <b>yeasty</b> quality that distinguishes most high quality Champagnes, premium California sparkling wines show clarity of fruit flavors without being heavily [...] "fruity". The wines strive for finesse and elegance. The optimal climate condition allows most sparkling wine producers to make a vintage dated wine every year while in Champagne this would only happen in exceptional years.|$|E

60|$|In {{a little}} {{time there was a}} down-draw in the water behind the embankment--a sucking whirlpool, all yellow and <b>yeasty.</b> The water had smashed through the skin of the earth and was pouring into the old shallow {{workings}} of Twenty-Two.|$|E
6000|$|The {{case was}} hopeless. All strangers {{plunged into the}} sea,--the popular way of landing in East Africa,--the anchor was weighed, the ton of sail shaken out, and the [...] "Reed" [...] began to dip and rise in the <b>yeasty</b> sea laboriously as an {{alderman}} dancing a polka.|$|E
60|$|His rage was a madness. His {{lips were}} flecked with a soapy froth, and {{sometimes}} he choked and gurgled and became inarticulate. And through it all, calm and impassive, leaning on his elbow and gazing down, Wolf Larsen seemed lost in a great curiosity. This wild stirring of <b>yeasty</b> life, this terrific revolt and defiance of matter that moved, perplexed and interested him.|$|E
60|$|Another {{scene of}} stupendous and {{changing}} awfulness. Countries were sinking, cities crashing down, volcanoes were spouting fire; {{the end of}} the earth seemed to be at hand. We could see human beings running to and fro in thousands like ants. Then in huge waves hundreds and hundreds of feet high, the ocean flowed in and all was troubled, <b>yeasty</b> sea.|$|E
60|$|Kit looked seawards. Two short moles {{enclosed}} a {{break in}} the lava rocks, but their ends were lost in phosphorescent foam, and a white turmoil marked the gap between. Now and then most part of a wall vanished and a <b>yeasty</b> flood ran far up the beach. Kit saw a group of indistinct figures standing about a boat and left the party.|$|E
60|$|The {{children}} were very bright; {{for they were}} fed on the best kinds of oatmeal and Graham bread, with very little white bread or hot cakes to spoil their young stomachs. Hearty, happy boys and girls they were, and their <b>yeasty</b> souls were very lively in them; for they danced and sang, and seemed as bright and gay as if acidity, heaviness, and mould were quite unknown.|$|E
6000|$|The cubless tigress in her jungle raging [...] Is dreadful to the {{shepherd}} and the flock; [...] The ocean when its <b>yeasty</b> war is waging [...] Is awful to the vessel near the rock; [...] But violent things will sooner bear assuaging, [...] Their fury being spent {{by its own}} shock, [...] Than the stern, single, deep, and wordless ire [...] Of a strong human heart, and in a sire.|$|E
6000|$|... “I wouldn’t {{stand for}} that,” he replied. “Couldn’t see the {{necessity}} for it, nor the common sense. I cut out the race and the children. I would sacrifice nothing for them. It’s just so much slush and sentiment, and you must see it yourself, at least for one who {{does not believe in}} eternal life. With immortality before me, altruism would be a paying business proposition. I might elevate my soul to all kinds of altitudes. But with nothing eternal before me but death, given for a brief spell this <b>yeasty</b> crawling and squirming which is called life, why, it would be immoral for me to perform any act that was a sacrifice. Any sacrifice that makes me lose one crawl or squirm is foolish,—and not only foolish, for it is a wrong against myself and a wicked thing. I must not lose one crawl or squirm if I am {{to get the most out}} of the ferment. Nor will the eternal movelessness that is coming to me be made easier or harder by the sacrifices or selfishnesses of the time when I was <b>yeasty</b> and acrawl.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Thursday, August 4. We {{drove to}} the cathedral. I shall not recapitulate Murray, nor give {{architectural}} details. I was satisfied with what I saw and heard, and wished that so magnificent a conception, so sublime a blossom of stone sculpture, might come to ripe maturity, not as a church, indeed, {{but rather as a}} beautiful petrifaction, a growth of prolific, exuberant nature. Why should not the <b>yeasty</b> brain of man, fermenting, froth over in such crestwork of Gothic pinnacle, spire, and column? ...|$|E
60|$|She was {{standing}} a little {{apart from the}} other Japanese girls. Henry was on her with a bound. Now was his time. He felt keyed up, full of persuasive words. In the interval which had elapsed since their last conversation <b>yeasty</b> emotions had been playing the dickens with his self-control. It is practically impossible for a novice, suddenly introduced {{behind the scenes of}} a musical comedy, not {{to fall in love with}} somebody; and, if he is already in love, his fervour is increased to a dangerous point.|$|E
60|$|The {{ordinary}} golfer, whose scores per hole seldom exceed {{those of}} Colonel Bogey, {{does not understand}} the whirl of mixed sensations which the really incompetent performer experiences {{on the rare occasions}} when he does strike a winning vein. As stroke follows stroke, and he continues to hold his opponent, a wild exhilaration surges through him, followed by a sort of awe, as if he were doing something wrong, even irreligious. Then all these <b>yeasty</b> emotions subside and are blended into one glorious sensation of grandeur and majesty, as of a giant among pygmies.|$|E
60|$|There {{was also}} {{something}} to see ahead—a dim, forest‐shrouded littoral across which the vapors were streaming, and a faint white line of beach. In the foreground were broad streaks of froth, {{and the long}} blur of a jutting point with a <b>yeasty</b> seething {{about the end of}} it. Away on the other hand lay a smear of dusky trees, and the gap between them and the point was, he surmised, the bay they had been looking for. It held no shelter for them that he could see. Then Harper called the Spaniard Rosendo.|$|E
6000|$|So I {{was left}} alone again with {{forgotten}} Fanny, and that night I dreamed of her. Nothing to be seen but black boiling waves flinging their <b>yeasty,</b> curdling crests into the clouds, and every crest the face of my ferrety [...] "herrand-boy." [...] And afloat {{in the midst of}} the welter beneath, a beloved shape whiter than the foam, with shut eyes, under the gigantic stoop of the water. Who hangs these tragic veils in the sleeping mind? Who was this I that looked out on them? I awoke, shuddering, breathed a blessing--disjointed, nameless; turned over, and soon was once more asleep.|$|E
60|$|He {{inserted}} the firing-plug; {{and a moment}} afterward the sea opened some distance ahead and rolled back from {{a gap in the}} bottom of which shattered timber churned about. Then a foaming wave rose suddenly from the chasm, tossing up black masses of planking and ponderous beams. A few, rearing on end, shot {{out of the water and}} fell with a heavy splash among fountains of spray, while a white ridge swept furiously toward the sloop. It broke before it reached her, but she flung her bows high as she plunged over the troubled swell, and the yacht rolled heavily with a <b>yeasty</b> wash along her side.|$|E
60|$|His sister {{raised her}} hands in protest, and Chillingham withdrew with a chuckle, but she was rather more gracious to Ormsgill than usual that day, and during the next one {{accompanied}} him with her daughter {{and one or two}} acquaintances in a launch he had borrowed to look at the wreck of a steamer which had gone ashore a night or two earlier. The unfortunate vessel afforded a somewhat impressive spectacle as she lay grinding on the reef with the long <b>yeasty</b> seas washing over her, and the little party spent some time watching her from the launch which swung with the steep, green swell.|$|E
60|$|Encouragement {{and advice}} were freely tendered, and Jock Horner, the quiet, self-spoken hunter who {{looked as though}} he would not harm a mouse, advised me to leave the ribs alone and to thrust upward for the abdomen, at the same time giving what he called the “Spanish twist” to the blade. Leach, his bandaged arm {{prominently}} to the fore, begged me to leave a few remnants of the cook for him; and Wolf Larsen paused once or twice at the break of the poop to glance curiously at what must have been to him a stirring and crawling of the <b>yeasty</b> thing he knew as life.|$|E
60|$|It was now blowing viciously hard, the boat, half-buried {{in a white}} smother, would {{scarcely}} steer, and {{the bright}} light from a window ahead beat into my eyes, bewildering my vision. I could, however, dimly make out pines looming behind it, and the beat of <b>yeasty</b> surges, which warned me it would be risky to attempt a landing on that beach. There would be shelter on the leeward side of the island, but {{a glance at the}} balloon-like curves of the lifting mainsail showed that we could not clear its end upon the course we were sailing. We must jibe, or swing the mainsail over, which might result in a capsize.|$|E
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was wearing through, {{but it was}} still almost insufferably hot when Jefferson stood with his hand upon the valve of the Cumbria's forward winch. She lay with her bows wedged into the mangrove forest, which crawled on high-arched roots over leagues of bubbling mire to the edge of one of the foulest creeks in Western Africa. It flowed, thick and <b>yeasty,</b> beneath the steamer's hove-up side, for she lay with a list to starboard athwart the stream. There was a bend close by, and her original crew had apparently either failed to swing her round it, which is an accident that sometimes happens in that country, or driven her ashore to save her sinking.|$|E
60|$|They drew breath, and toiled on again. Their {{progress}} was not reassuring {{in view of}} the fact that the troops were close at hand, but they made a little, and in front of them the spray beyond which lay the Palestrina whirled in a filmy cloud. Every now and then there was a thunderous roar in the midst of it, and part of the beach was hidden in a tumultuous swirl of foam. Gasping, straining, slipping, but grimly silent, they toiled on, moving her a foot with every desperate effort, until at last a <b>yeasty</b> flood surged past them knee-deep, and hove her away from them grinding one bilge in the sand. Then Desmond raised a hoarse voice.|$|E
60|$|In class recitation or {{spelling}} match his father's millions did not aid him in competing with Patsy Halloran, the mathematical prodigy {{whose father was}} a hod-carrier, nor with Mona Sanguinetti who was a wizard at spelling and whose widowed mother ran a vegetable store. Nor were his father's millions and the Nob Hill palace of the slightest assistance to Young Dick when he peeled his jacket and, bareknuckled, without rounds, licking or being licked, milled it to a finish with Jimmy Botts, Jean Choyinsky, {{and the rest of}} the lads that went out over the world to glory and cash a few years later, a generation of prizefighters that only San Francisco, raw and virile and <b>yeasty</b> and young, could have produced.|$|E
60|$|Kwaseekho the shelldrake leads {{a double}} life. In winter {{he may be}} found almost {{anywhere}} along the Massachusetts coast and southward, where he leads a dog's life of it, notwithstanding his gay appearance. An hundred guns are roaring at him wherever he goes. From daylight to dark he has never a minute to eat his bit of fish, or to take a wink of sleep in peace. He flies to the ocean, and beds with his fellows on the broad open shoals for safety. But the east winds blow; and the shoals are a <b>yeasty</b> mass of tumbling breakers. They buffet him about; they twist his gay feathers; they dampen his pinions, spite of his skill in swimming. Then {{he goes to the}} creeks and harbors.|$|E
60|$|The Institutions of this country, {{like the}} Institutions {{of all other}} countries, are but half-truths; they are the working daily {{clothing}} of the nation; no more the body's permanent dress than is a baby's frock. Slowly but surely they wear out, or are outgrown; and in their fashion they are always thirty years at least behind the fashions of those spirits who are concerned with what shall take their place. The conditions that dictate our education, the distribution of our property, our marriage laws, amusements, worship, prisons, and all other things, change imperceptibly from hour to hour; the moulds containing them, being inelastic, do not change, but {{hold on to the}} point of bursting, and then are hastily, often clumsily, enlarged. The ninety desiring peace and comfort for their spirit, the ninety of the well-warmed beds, will have it that the fashions need not change, that morality is fixed, that all is ordered and immutable, that every one will always marry, play, and worship {{in the way that they}} themselves are marrying, playing, worshipping. They have no speculation, and they hate with a deep hatred those who speculate with thought. This is the function they were made for. They are the dough, and they dislike that <b>yeasty</b> stuff of life which comes and works about in them. The <b>Yeasty</b> Stuff--the other ten--chafed by all things that are, desirous ever of new forms and moulds, hate in their turn the comfortable ninety. Each party has invented for the other the hardest names that it can think of: Philistines, Bourgeois, Mrs. Grundy, Rebels, Anarchists, and Ne'er-do-weels. So we go on! And so, as each of us is born to go his journey, he finds himself in time ranged on one side or on the other, and joins the choruses of name-slingers.|$|E
60|$|It {{occurred}} to Frank that considering {{the nature of}} the country it would be singularly inconvenient if the cañon went on for another league or two, particularly as they had only a handful of provisions left, but he followed his companion, and they stumbled and floundered forward all the afternoon. There was now no trail to follow, and where they were not forced to scramble over slippery rock, fallen trees and thorny brakes barred their way. Still, there was nothing to indicate that the cañon was dying out, and where they could have reached the water it either foamed furiously between rocky ledges or spun round in horrible black eddies {{on the verge of a}} wild, <b>yeasty</b> turmoil. They looked at these spots and abandoned any thought of swimming.|$|E
60|$|These {{words were}} spoken by Paul to Israel. Israel did as ordered. In a few minutes, bucket in hand, begrimed with powder, sixty feet in air, he hung like Apollyon from the extreme {{tip of the}} yard over the fated abyss of the hatchway. As he looked down between the eddies of smoke into that slaughterous pit, it was like looking from {{the verge of a}} {{cataract}} down into the <b>yeasty</b> pool at its base. Watching, his chance, he dropped one grenade with such faultless precision, that, striking its mark, an explosion rent the Serapis like a volcano. The long row of heaped cartridges was ignited. The fire ran horizontally, like an express on a railway. More than twenty men were instantly killed: nearly forty wounded. This blow restored the chances of battle, before in favor of the Serapis.|$|E
6000|$|They inhabit [...] The dim {{land that}} gives shelter to the wolf, [...] The windy headlands, perilous fen paths, [...] Where, under {{mountain}} mist, the stream flows down [...] And floods the ground. Not far hence, but a mile, [...] The mere stands, over which hang death-chill groves, [...] A wood fast-rooted overshades the flood; [...] There every night a ghastly miracle [...] Is seen, {{fire in the}} water. No man knows, [...] Not the most wise, {{the bottom of that}} mere. [...] The firm-horned heath-stalker, the hart, when pressed, [...] Wearied by hounds, and hunted from afar, [...] Will rather die of thirst upon its bank [...] Than bend his head to it. It is unholy.

60|$|Moreover, {{together}} with this hypertrophy {{there is an}} immigration of elements that have never understood and never will understand the great tradition, wedges of foreign settlement embedded {{in the heart of}} this <b>yeasty</b> English expansion. One day I remember wandering eastward out of pure curiosity--it must have been in my early student days--and discovering a shabbily bright foreign quarter, shops displaying Hebrew placards and weird, unfamiliar commodities and a concourse of bright-eyed, eagle-nosed people talking some incomprehensible gibberish between the shops and the barrows. And soon I became quite familiar with the devious, vicious, dirtily-pleasant eroticism of Soho. I found those crowded streets a vast relief from the dull grey exterior of Brompton where I lodged and lived my daily life. In Soho, indeed, I got my first inkling of the factor of replacement that is so important in both the English and the American process.|$|E
60|$|Urged by Sybil's entreaties the cab-driver hurried on. With all {{the skilled}} {{experience}} of a thorough cockney charioteer he tried to conquer time and space by his rare knowledge of short cuts and fine acquaintance with unknown thoroughfares. He seemed to avoid every street which was the customary passage of mankind. The houses, the population, the costume, the manners, the language through which they whirled their way, were of a different state and nation to those with which the dwellers in the dainty quarters of this city are acquainted. Now dark streets of frippery and old stores, new market-places of entrails and carrion with gutters running gore, sometimes the way was enveloped in the <b>yeasty</b> fumes of a colossal brewery, and sometimes they plunged into a labyrinth of lanes teeming with life, and where the dog-stealer and the pick-pocket, the burglar and the assassin, found a sympathetic multitude of all ages; comrades for every enterprise; and a market for every booty.|$|E
6000|$|... [" [...] Now was {{come about}} Holy-Cross Day, and now must my lord [...] preach his first sermon to the Jews: {{as it was}} of old cared for in the [...] merciful bowels of the Church, that, so to speak, a crumb at least [...] from her {{conspicuous}} table here in Rome should be, though but once [...] yearly, cast to the famishing dogs, under-trampled and bespitten-upon [...] beneath {{the feet of the}} guests. And a moving sight in truth, this, of [...] so many of the besotted blind restif and ready-to-perish Hebrews! now [...] maternally brought-nay (for He saith, 'Compel them to come in') haled, [...] as it were, by the head and hair, and against their obstinate hearts, [...] to partake of the heavenly grace.

6000|$|Afterwards I {{looked at}} many of the {{pictures}} of the old masters, and found myself gradually getting a taste for them; at least, they give me more and more pleasure the oftener I come to see them. Doubtless, I shall be able to pass for a man of taste by the time I return to America. It is an acquired taste, like that for wines; and I question whether a man is really any truer, wiser, or better for possessing it. From the old masters, I went among the English painters, and found myself more favorably inclined towards some of them than at my previous visits; seeing something wonderful even in Turner's lights and mists and <b>yeasty</b> waves, although I should like him still better if his pictures looked in the least like what they typify. The most disagreeable of English painters is Etty, who had a diseased appetite for woman's flesh, and spent his whole life, apparently, in painting them with enormously developed busts. I do not mind nudity in a modest and natural way; but Etty's women really thrust their nudity upon you with malice aforethought, [...] . and the worst of it is they are not beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... “We {{were talking}} about this yesterday,” he said. “I held that life was a ferment, a <b>yeasty</b> {{something}} which devoured life that it might live, and that living was merely successful piggishness. Why, if there is anything in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and it’s life eats life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.” ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her, with a faint, unhappy, bitter smile, {{but he said}} nothing. He seemed far off from her. A wild {{unhappiness}} beat inside her breast. She went down the corridor, away from him, to avoid this new agony, which after all was not her agony. She listened to the chatter of French and Italian in the corridor. She felt the excitement and terror of France, inside the railway carriage: and outside she saw white oxen slowly ploughing, beneath the lingering yellow poplars of the sub-Alps, she saw peasants looking up, she saw a woman holding a baby to her breast, watching the train, she saw the excited, <b>yeasty</b> crowds at the station. And they passed a river, and a great lake. And it all seemed bigger, nobler than England. She felt vaster influences spreading around, the Past was greater, more magnificent in these regions. For {{the first time the}} nostalgia of the vast Roman and classic world took possession of her. And she found it splendid. For the first time she opened her eyes on a continent, the Alpine core of a continent. And {{for the first time she}} realized what it was to escape from the smallish perfection of England, into the grander imperfection of a great continent.|$|E
6000|$|We {{live now}} in these days, when the Great Change {{has been in}} most things accomplished, {{in a time when}} every one is being educated to a sort of {{intellectual}} gentleness, a gentleness that abates nothing from our vigor, and it is hard to understand the stifled and struggling manner in which my generation of common young men did its thinking. To think at all about certain questions was an act of rebellion that set one oscillating between the furtive and the defiant. People begin to find Shelley--for all his melody--noisy and ill conditioned now because his Anarchs have vanished, yet {{there was a time when}} novel thought HAD to go to that tune of breaking glass. It becomes a little difficult to imagine the <b>yeasty</b> state of mind, the disposition to shout and say, [...] "Yah!" [...] at constituted authority, to sustain a persistent note of provocation such as we raw youngsters displayed. I began to read with avidity such writing as Carlyle, Browning, and Heine have left for the perplexity of posterity, and not only to read and admire but to imitate. My letters to Nettie, after one or two genuinely intended displays of perfervid tenderness, broke out toward theology, sociology, and the cosmos in turgid and startling expressions. No doubt they puzzled her extremely.|$|E
