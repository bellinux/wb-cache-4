25|$|The chroniclers of the First Crusade {{documented}} the chance interception {{of a message}} warning the duke of Caesarea of {{the coming of the}} Crusader armies when a carrier pigeon was felled by a hawk over a Crusader military encampment in May 1099. The message, written in Arabic, read as follows:Greetings from the king of Acre to the duke of Caesarea. A generation of dogs, a foolish, headstrong, disorderly race, has gone through my land. If you value your way of life, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> of the faith should bring harm to them, since you can easily do what you wish. Transmit this message to other cities and strongholds. Carrier pigeons were regularly used in this period. For example, Edward Gibbon notes that during the siege of Acre (1189–1191) by the Crusaders, the inhabitants of the besieged city kept a regular correspondence with the Sultan's forces by way of carrier pigeon.|$|E

[...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>others</b> aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
