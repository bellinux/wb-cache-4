40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the yarn guide openings (33) at the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> is lowered. As the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer.</b> The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the yarn guide openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the yarn guide slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many {{biodegradable}} synthetic polymers {{have been}} used as tissue-engineered scaffolds. The major problem of these polymers to be used in bone tissue engineering is their poor mechanical strength. It is well known that we can deposit hydroxyapatite, a material with strong osteoconductivity, onto a surface using electrochemical methods. These polymers, again, lack electrical conductivity so that deposition of hydroxyapatite onto these polymers is very challenging, if not impossible. Here we presented a novel scaffold for bone tissue engineering based on textile technology. First, we fabricated 316 L stainless steel/poly(lactic acid) composite ply yarn by wrapping stainless steel wires and poly(lactic acid) yarn together. A 16 -spindle braiding machine was then used to braid the composite <b>yarn</b> <b>layer</b> by layer into a 3 -dimensional scaffold for bone tissue engineering. Furthermore, due to the electrical conductivity of 316 L stainless steel wires in the composite yarn, we employed an electrochemical method to induce hydroxyapatite deposition on the braid.

40|$|The {{advent of}} three {{dimensional}} (3 D) reinforcements has been mainly {{to overcome the}} issue of delamination and improve upon the damage tolerance properties by introducing fibres in the thickness direction for advanced composite applications. 3 D preforms can be developed using various techniques. Angle-interlock weaving is one of them. This paper details about the efforts being put at CSIR-NAL for developing angle-interlock woven preforms. Four types of angle-interlock structures viz., layer-to-layer and through thickness (both with and without stuffer yarns) were developed using 6 K, 400 Tex TC- 33 grade Carbon tows on a custom designed handloom. The preforms without stuffer <b>yarns</b> had 4 <b>layers</b> of warp and were of 1. 5 ± 0. 2 mm thick. Preforms with stuffer <b>yarns</b> had 6 <b>layers</b> of warp (including 2 stuffer <b>yarn</b> <b>layers)</b> and were of 2. 3 ± 0. 1 mm thick. Thermoset composites were prepared from these preforms using EPOLAM 2063 (an epoxy based resin system) by RTM process. The fibre weight fraction for these composites ranged from 0. 53 to 0. 58 and they were subjected to mechanical tests such as tensile, flexural and interlaminar shear strength. Test results showed improved response (in the warp direction) with respect to shear properties while the tensile and flexural properties were equivalent {{to that of the}} plain woven composites...|$|R

30|$|For better {{understanding}} of the damage evolution in quasi-static flexural testing, Umer et al. (Umer et al. 2016) utilised X-ray CT scans of the failed specimens after testing. Three different architectures “ORT, LTL, AI” were tested along the warp and weft directions. A significant difference between the weft and warp modulus (~ 1.7) and strength (~ 1.4) was attributed to the higher fibre volume fraction in the weft compared to the warp for LTL architecture. This effect was less in the case of ORT (~ 1.14) and AI (~ 1.1) in which the difference between the fibre volume fraction in the weft and warp was not significant. X-ray CT scans revealed that damage initiated at resin-rich areas and around the z-binding yarns. Authors reported that cracks propagation followed the z-binder yarns leading to final failure. Labanieh et al. (Labanieh et al. 2017) has recently investigated the effect of adding biased layers (+θ°/−θ°) to classical ORT architecture on the interlaminar shear response using short-beam testing configuration. The two multiaxial ORT architectures were different from the stacking sequence point of view. One of them (referred to as IMA) had the biased layers (+θ°/−θ°) adjacent to each other while they were separated by a 0 ° layer in the second architecture (referred to as MA). Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to obtain full strain field across the thickness of the specimens during testing. Locations of macroscopic cracks initiation were captured and analysed successfully. For all the tested architectures, the z-binding yarns reduced the delamination growth. In addition, authors concluded that insertion of the biased layers, {{especially in the case of}} the MA architecture, improved the delamination resistance compared to a classical ORT architecture. This was justified by the reduction of the relative angle between successive <b>yarn</b> <b>layers.</b>|$|R

30|$|Similar to (Warren et al. 2015 b), all {{architectures}} failed, non-catastrophically, in {{a bearing}} failure mode. However, X-ray CT scans revealed {{the effect of}} the z-binder path on the damage mechanisms and delamination propagation. The dominant damage mechanisms were found to include matrix crushing, extensive delamination, transverse cracking and z-binder induced damage. When specimens are loaded up to failure, a clear difference in the bearing stress/strain response was observed (see Fig. 10 b). The study reported that the ORT architecture in the off-axis direction displayed an enhanced ability to carry higher loads after damage onset until ultimate failure followed by AI and finally LTL which is directly reflected by the energy absorption of ORT being the highest followed by AI and finally LTL. This suggested that in addition to the unit cell size effect, having a through-thickness binder (ORT and AI) can suppress delamination and delay final failure. However, delamination progression is guided by the z-binding <b>yarns</b> between <b>layers</b> which led to final failure of the LTL architecture as proven by the X-ray CT scans.|$|R

Analysis of the geometry of a 12 K carbon fibre 2 × 2 twill weave at the meso- and macro-scales showed the prevalence of the yarn path variations at the macro-scale over the meso-scale variations. Numerical analysis of yarn path variability showed that it is responsible for a Young’s modulus reduction of 0. 5 % and CoV of 1 % which makes this type of variability in the selected reinforcement almost insignificant for an elastic analysis. Finite element analysis of damage propagation in laminates with layer shift showed good agreement with the experiments.

50|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{woven fabrics}} are fabrics {{that could be}} formed to near net shape with considerable thickness. There {{is no need for}} layering to create a part, because a single fabric provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement. The 3-D woven fabric is a variant of the 2D weaving process, and it’s an extension of the very old technique of creating double and triple woven cloth. 3D weaving allows the production of fabrics up to 10 cm in thickness.Fibers placed in the thickness direction are called z-yarn, warp weaver, or binder yarn for 3D woven fabrics. More than one layer of fabric is woven at the same time, and z-yarn interlaces warp and woof <b>yarns</b> of different <b>layers</b> during the process. At the end of the weaving process, an integrated 3D woven structure, which has a considerable thickness, is produced.

Engineering fabrics with desirable thermo-physiological properties suited for specific applications such as active wear, intimate wear is a big challenge for textile manufacturers as gamut of fibre, yarn and fabric parameters are known to influence the thermo-physiological properties.

Categorical variables i.e. outer <b>layer</b> <b>yarn</b> type and inner layer fibre linear density were found to affect the thermal, moisture vapour and liquid moisture transfer properties of developed test samples. Fabrics knitted with carded yarn and polyester fibre of high linear density showed high thermal resistance and would feel warmer on initial skin contact owing to low thermal absorptivity. However, the air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate increased with combination of combed cotton yarn in the outer and coarse polyester fibre in the inner <b>layer.</b> Combed <b>yarn</b> fabrics were superior in trans planar wicking compared to carded yarn fabrics which showed higher water absorbency and would be slow drying fabrics.|$|R

Warp yarn properties (type, count, and density) were the same at all the fabrics. Percentage reflectance values of the fabrics changed according to yarn density, weave pattern, and filament fineness in accordance with fabric layer numbers during reflectance measurement. Percentage reflectance values gradually increased as fabric layer numbers increased. The highest reflectance values were obtained at 16 layers of fabric.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{reinforcement}} for unidirectional natural fiber composites has been developed, where a paper layer is assembled {{with a layer of}} unidirectional flax <b>yarns.</b> The paper <b>layer</b> chemically and mechanically bonds to the loose yarns to maintain their alignment and enables better manipulability of the reinforcement during stacking in the mold. Unfortunately, the paper layer adversely affects the permeability of the whole reinforcement to liquid resin and thus limits the impregnation quality of the final part. In this paper, a technique is adopted to increase the impregnation performance by modifying the architecture of the fibrous network in the paper layer. In particular, a method has been developed to replace a proportion of the Kraft fibers by short flax fibers in the paper layer, in an attempt to open the structure and increase the paper permeability. Permeability measurements show a major improvement in global reinforcement permeability. Basic mechanical properties of resulting composites were also analysed. Results show a slight decrease in modulus and strength when the paper layer is present. This is compensated by an important reduction in variability. Furthermore, increasing the flax proportion in the paper layer limits the loss of mechanical properties, while reducing variability even further...|$|R

Fabric samples of areal densities ranging from 310 - 495 g/m 2 were knitted using yarns of three different cotton/polyester blends, each of two different linear densities by systematically varying knitting loop lengths for achieving different cover factors.

Spinning of carbon nanotube-loaded fibres, printing with conductive inks and the deposition of metals onto textile surfaces are just a few examples.

The latter is directly correlated to the obtained layer thickness and hence to the yarn’s electro-conductive properties. Furthermore, the electro-conductive properties change on a long term basis, which was investigated by washing tests.

However, the mean absolute percentage error in the prediction of air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated fabrics were on slightly higher side. The input parameters selected for the network construction namely back <b>layer</b> <b>yarn</b> linear density, filament fineness, loop length and total yarn linear density influence the fabrics bulk properties like thickness, fabric weight which are the determinants of thermal properties. The selected input parameters were found to be sufficient for prediction of thermal properties. However, air permeability depends on the openness of the fabric structure or the free inter yarn spaces in the fabric and hence fabric porosity. The exclusion of porosity as one of the input parameters might be the reason for high mean absolute percentage error in prediction of air permeability. Moisture vapour transmission rate through fabrics depend on free air spaces in the fabric for moisture diffusion and moisture diffusivity of the fibres. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the fibre can affect the moisture diffusion through textiles significantly. The inclusion of constituent fibres as one of the input parameter to neural network may result in lowering the error percentage in prediction of moisture vapour transmission rate.|$|R

A number of prediction tools like mechanistic, statistical and stochastic (artificial neural network) models are finding application in textiles for reasonable prediction of various aspects of textiles before the actual commencement of fabric production and testing. In this study, thermo-physiological {{properties of}} polyester–cotton plated fabrics were predicted by two approaches: artificial neural network and response surface equations. A multilayered back propagation artificial neural network was developed with four input nodes corresponding to four selected input parameters: back <b>layer</b> <b>yarn</b> linear density, filament fineness, total yarn linear density and loop length and one output node corresponding to the predicted thermo-physiological property. Four individual networks working in tandem with common set of input parameters and each giving an individual output were developed such that the outputs of four networks were thermal resistance, thermal absorptivity, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate respectively. Network architecture gave good prediction performance with low values of mean absolute percentage error and high coefficient of determination. Response surface equations were developed to predict the thermo-physiological properties and good agreement between experimental and predicted values for all the properties was found with coefficient of determination over 0.9. Artificial neural network predicted the thermal resistance and air permeability of plated fabrics with good accuracy. However, the response surface equations served better prediction tool for thermal absorptivity and moisture vapour transmission rate prediction.|$|R
40|$|This work explores {{effects of}} {{selected}} sources of variability on mechanical properties of textile composites. Current modelling approaches rely on an idealised {{representation of the}} geometry and properties of composites while in reality the properties are not uniform and the structure has local variations. Existing approaches to model these variations showed that they can affect manufacturing processes for textile composites and compressive strength of unidirectional composites. This work {{is an attempt to}} extend existing methods for modelling of idealised composites and combine them with stochastic approaches in order to predict variability of strength and Young’s modulus of textile composites. Three sources of variability were selected for this study: single fibre strength variability, <b>yarn</b> path and <b>layer</b> shift variability. All three were analysed experimentally for selected textile reinforced composites. Statistical models were derived for fibre strength and yarn path variabilities using the experimental data. The effect of layer shift was estimated by means of mechanical testing. A multi-scale framework was developed for modelling of composites with single fibre strength variability, closing the gap between micro- and macro-scale variability. An approach based on a Gaussian random field was successfully employed for modelling of yarn path variability and its effect on mechanical properties of textile composites. It was found that the variability of single fibre strength introduces small variability in the final composite strength, which results in decrease of the strength with increase of macro-scale length. The variability of yarn paths was found to have minimum effect on variability of Young’s modulus but severely reduces the strength of composites. Layer shift was found to be responsible for changes {{in the shape of the}} stress-strain curve...|$|R
40|$|The article {{reports on}} the {{successful}} processing of flax-reinforced poly(lactic acid) (PLA) profiles by thermoplastic pultrusion into sandwich' structures consisting of commingled <b>yarns</b> as outer <b>layers</b> and layers of nonwoven material in the core section. The results showed that a good quality matrix impregnation was obtained. The profiles produced from only commingled yarns had higher impact strengths due to yarns {{in the middle of}} the profiles; the matrix of which did not melt during pultrusion. The flexural properties of the composites improved with increasing nonwoven layers. Good PLA impregnation improved the flexural properties. The tensile strength of the sandwich' structures was much lower than that of commingled yarn-based composites, this being attributed to the poor distribution of flax fibres and poor interfacial adhesion leading to poor stress transfer from matrix to fibres. Crystallinity decreased as the number of nonwoven layers increased presumably due to blockage of nucleating sites essential for crystal growth. The storage modulus of composites reinforced with commingled yarns was greater than that of the composites reinforced with sandwich' material, confirming effective transfer of stress from matrix to the commingled flax yarns and indicating that increasing nonwoven layers decreased adhesion between reinforcement and the matrix. The effects of a wide range of pultrusion process parameters on the mechanical properties of resulting profiles were investigated. Higher die temperatures (290 degrees C) and lower pulling speeds (0. 5 mmin(- 1)) improved the mechanical properties due to better melting and lower viscosity of the matrix, enabling increased penetration within the reinforcement. Flexural and tensile properties of microwave-heated samples were very low due to fibre degradation. Scanning electron microscopic images showed that fibre impregnation was good in sandwich' systems, but fibre distribution remained a challenge...|$|R
30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal denier filament fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer <b>layer</b> <b>yarn</b> type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
