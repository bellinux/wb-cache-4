500|$|... "Novacane" [...] {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{and has been}} described as the best song on Nostalgia, Ultra. Pitchfork editor Tom Breihman made the song [...] "Best New Track" [...] and commented that the song had a [...] "stripped-back melodic construction with Ocean crooning over a synthetic backing that practically fades into nonexistence" [...] and that [...] "it draws its power from tiny little details, like throwaway observations or catches in Ocean's voice. Andrew Noz of NPR also praised the details in Ocean's song writing, stating [...] "in 'Novacane,' Ocean sings about falling for a porn star {{who wants to be a}} dentist, it's easy to believe that he's more enticed by her dentistry aspirations than her day job. The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica described the song as a [...] "story of meeting a cute girl at Coachella, tripping hard on intoxicants and getting quickly to love that he may or may not remember the next day", and called the song [...] "bliss." [...] Ology writer JT Langley noted that though the song was [...] "massively depressing" [...] and that [...] "Frank makes a foul mouth sound sweeter than <b>your</b> <b>usual</b> R through his brand of crooning ... Tricky Stewart's production adds yet another morose element to provide the more macabre side of the drugs-for-love-lost genre." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} listed {{as one of the}} best songs of the year by several publications. The New York Times placed the song amongst the best tracks of 2011.

[...] Pitchfork named the song the 41st best song of the year, musing that [...] "he might be fronting like the Drakes and post-"808s" [...] Kanyes of the world, but there's too much self-effacement happening for Ocean not to realize the inherent humor in his own drama. If Ocean really is on that visionary Kubrick shit like he claims, then [...] "Novacane" [...] could very well be his Dr. Strangelove. Zimbio placed the song at number 2 on their best hip-hop songs of the year list, writing [...] "while every track on his mixtape, nostalgia, Ultra, warrants a listen, it's the radio-friendly [...] "Novacane" [...] that stands out as his most mature and enjoyable song to date." [...] Spin named the song the fifth best of the year, describing the track as [...] "a fully evolved Drake song, where you're slyly immersed in youthful, aww-shit decadence, while simultaneously watching your dreams of recreational stripper booty and complimentary cocaine breakfasts get methodically dismantled." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Verdi had {{not lost}} sight of Corsaro at all, as is {{demonstrated}} in a letter he wrote to Piave. [...] Impatient because of the delays, Piave had asked for his libretto {{to be returned to}} him in order that he might fulfill another commitment. Verdi was shocked: [...] "Give you back Il corsaro, that Corsaro which has always fascinated me and which I've thought about so much, and which you've put into verse with more than <b>your</b> <b>usual</b> care?" [...] The composer continues to explain details of the work on the music he has already done, but notes [...] "I still have to write the opera for Lucca." [...] Piave relented, and he moved ahead on Macbeth 's libretto. But, {{by the end of the}} year, when Lucca and the British impresario, Benjamin Lumley were raising the issue of the London contract, Verdi replied that he found Il corsaro [...] "dull (freddo) and theatrically ineffective".|$|E
