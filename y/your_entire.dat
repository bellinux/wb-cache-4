It happens quite often to people in their 90s who have been very ill, even famous people, but I'm sure that doesn't lessen the sadness for many of us. I never met the man but, on balance, I {{came to the conclusion that}} he was a force for good rather than ill. I think I came to that rather banal and broad brush conclusion twenty years ago, or maybe fifteen. So, I'm sorry he's dead, I wish it were otherwise.|$|E

"'Till the World Ends' {{was already}} the best Britney single since 'Toxic', an ecstatic Euroclub floor-filler {{about wanting to}} dance until the world ends and other {{important}} matters. Then they added the Nicki Minaj verse. In her 45-second evisceration, Nicki manages to squeeze in chicken noises and the words 'poultry', 'Epsom salt', and 'Ricki Lake'-- {{not to mention the}} immortal diss 'Sniff, sniff, criiiies/ I done slayed <b>your</b> <b>entire</b> fucking liiiiife.' (Fact: In 2011, pretty much any song in the world could be made infinitely better by the addition of a Nicki Minaj verse.) Sprinkle a little bit of Ke$ha, the song's co-writer, on the chorus, and you've got a three-headed diva Hydra that sums up the recent changing of the femme pop guard from airbrushed and perfect to (relatively) weird and chaotic. It's the year's greatest quickie cash-in remix created to boost the chart position of a floundering single. Considering the ubiquity of the practice, that's saying something." ...|$|E
500|$|Virtue {{ethics is}} a form of ethical theory which {{emphasizes}} the character of an agent, rather than specific acts; many of its proponents have criticised Kant's deontological approach to ethics. Elizabeth Anscombe criticised modern ethical theories, including Kantian ethics, for their obsession with law and obligation. As well as arguing that theories which rely on a universal moral law are too rigid, Anscombe suggested that, because a moral law implies a moral lawgiver, they are irrelevant in modern secular society. In his work After Virtue, Alasdair MacIntyre criticises Kant's formulation of universalisability, arguing that various trivial and immoral maxims can pass the test, such as [...] "Keep all your promises throughout <b>your</b> <b>entire</b> life except one". He further challenges Kant's formulation of humanity {{as an end in itself}} by arguing that Kant provided no reason to treat others as means: the maxim [...] "Let everyone except me be treated as a means", though seemingly immoral, can be universalized. Bernard Williams argues that, by abstracting persons from character, Kant misrepresents persons and morality and Philippa Foot identified Kant as one of a select group of philosophers responsible for the neglect of virtue by analytic philosophy.|$|E

GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R. Conklin of The Wisconsin State Journal said, [...] "It'd be very easy to be turned off by the first mundane chapters of the game's sprawling plot.... Stick with it: Once your party hits Neverwinter (and reaches level seven or so), the proceedings become significantly more interesting—especially in terms of character interaction and development.... NWN2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope."

500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change <b>your</b> <b>entire</b> understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are the same things that happen <b>your</b> <b>entire</b> life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E

[...] Sarah Fitzmaurice of Daily Mail also gave a positive review for the video praising its simple and energetic concept accompanied by the [...] "fierce outfits". A writer of OK! compared the video with Will Smiths work in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air adding that Beyoncé [...] "has gone back to video basics." [...] A writer of The Huffington Post called the video a [...] "fresh take on a New Edition classic" [...] and concluded that it was a [...] "lot more simple than it sounds." [...] Lisa Potter of Marie Claire also praised the energy and Beyoncé's figure in the video, writing, [...] "The pregnant superstar puts on another energetic performance during the video, showing off her fabulous figure in a skimpy black leotard complete with a military fetish cap and Isabel Marant sneakers, before changing into a series of tailored suits." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the video was similar to Michael Jackson's Dangerous era adding, [...] "While some might say the basic concept of Beyoncé's [...] 'Love On Top' video is too straightforward, we actually think it's amazing – just let Beyoncé sing, dance, look fuhLAWless and wear a cute hat! What else do you people need?!" [...] Maura Johnston of The Village Voice described the video as a direct homage to New Edition's [...] "If It Isn't Love" [...] but added that when the song's key changes start, [...] "Beyoncé and her posse of backup dancers get a bit brassier and fancier".

500|$|Of more {{importance}} to the science fiction and fantasy genres were several other magazines that debuted in 1939. [...] The first to appear, from Standard Magazines, were Startling Stories and Strange Stories, launched in January and February respectively as companions to Thrilling Wonder Stories; Mort Weisinger edited all three. [...] Startling included a lead novel and a [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] reprint section in every issue; the latter was possible because the publisher, Standard Magazines, owned the back catalog of Wonder Stories. [...] At that time no other sf pulp was including novels; readers approved, and Startling quickly {{became one of the}} most popular sf magazines. [...] Strange Stories was launched as a direct competitor to Weird Tales, and the first issue featured many of Weird Tales most popular authors, including Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Henry Kuttner and Manly Wade Wellman. Bloch, Derleth, and Kuttner were all frequent contributors over the magazine's life, but Ashley regards it as a poor imitation of Weird Tales, fewer of its stories having been anthologized since. [...] At the end of 1938 Weird Tales owner, B. Cornelius, sold his interest in the magazine to William J. Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, a general fiction magazine. [...] Delaney's offices were in New York, and Weird Tales editor, Farnsworth Wright, moved there from Chicago. [...] Delaney made several changes to page count and frequency to try to increase circulation, but none were successful. [...] While this took place, another competitor to Weird Tales was launched, this time by Street & Smith. [...] The new magazine, titled Unknown, was a companion to Astounding and was also edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Campbell's declared policy for the magazine was to [...] "offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as to change <b>your</b> <b>entire</b> understanding of the term"; the goal was to bring [...] "the science fiction rationale to fantasy", in Ashley's words. [...] Unknowns first issue was dated March 1939, with L. Ron Hubbard and L. Sprague de Camp soon among the most frequent contributors.|$|E
