500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a listen as a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or flanger pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E

[...] Hitchens took special umbrage with Falwell's alignment with [...] "the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers", and his declaration that 9/11 represented God's judgment on America's sinful behaviour; deeming it [...] "extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'" [...] Hitchens also mentioned that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell [...] "kept saying to his own crowd, yes, {{you have got to}} like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime". Appearing on CNN a day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, [...] "The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'."
