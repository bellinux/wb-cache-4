500|$|By February 18, {{the film}} {{had been cut}} to 9,204 feet. It had two advance previews in January 1938, where it {{received}} either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards. Producer Pandro S. Berman wanted to cut five more minutes, but relented when Hawks, Grant and Cliff Reid objected. At the film's second preview, the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit. The film's musical score is minimal, primarily Grant and Hepburn singing [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> But Love, Baby". There is incidental music in the Ritz scene, and an arrangement of [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> But Love, Baby" [...] during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb.|$|E
500|$|... "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love" [...] was {{released}} {{as the second}} single from the album on August 19, 2014. Gaga announced the release on Twitter, accompanied by the single's cover art. An official music video for the song {{was released}} on August 26, 2014. The video {{was shot in the}} recording studio and the first half showed Gaga in numerous outfits and wigs, while recording the song and roaming around. Bennett joins the studio sessions later on, singing the song. The final chorus finds the two singers belting together, described as [...] "join forces for a peculiar, yet potent blend of styles that transcends generations and genres". Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone complimented the video, saying that it [...] "proves [...] exude a unique, adorable brand of musical chemistry". After its release, [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love" [...] debuted at number-one on the Jazz Digital Songs chart of Billboard, on the week ending September 6, 2014, and the French Singles Chart at number 173.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{initially}} {{scheduled to begin}} on September 1, 1937 and wrap on October 31, but was delayed for several reasons. Production {{had to wait until}} mid-September to clear the rights for [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love, Baby" [...] for $1,000. In August Hawks hired gag writers Robert McGowan and Gertrude Purcell for uncredited script rewrites, and McGowan added a scene inspired by the comic strip Professor Dinglehoofer and his Dog in which a dog buries a rare dinosaur bone. RKO paid King Features $1,000 to use the idea for the film on September 21.|$|E
500|$|Imelda says in one {{vignette}} {{that she}} had met United States Army General Douglas MacArthur during his landing in Tacloban {{at the end of}} World War II, and that McArthur insisted that she should perform for the composer Irving Berlin, She sang [...] "God Bless the Philippines" [...] and when Berlin asked her why she sang the lyrics incorrectly she said, [...] "what's the difference between America and the Philippines?" [...] The assassination attempt on Imelda and the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr. are featured in the film. Footage from parties held by the Marcos couple, including one during which actor George Hamilton sang [...] "I can't give <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> but love, Imelda", are also used in the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{day before}} his wedding, David meets Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) by chance {{on a golf}} course. She is a free-spirited young lady, and (unknown to him at first) Mrs. Random's niece. Susan's brother, Mark, has sent her a tame leopard from Brazil named Baby (Nissa) to give to their aunt. (The leopard is native to Africa and Asia but not to South America.) Susan thinks David is a {{zoologist}} (rather than a paleontologist), and persuades David {{to go to her}} country home in Connecticut to help bring up Baby (which includes singing [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> But Love" [...] to soothe the leopard). Complications arise since Susan has fallen in love with David and tries to keep him at her house as long as possible to prevent his marriage.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, Gaga {{released}} a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. The inspiration behind the album {{came from her}} friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood. Before the album was released, it produced the singles [...] "Anything Goes" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love". Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews, with The Guardians Caroline Sullivan praising Gaga's vocals and Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich writing that [...] "Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish". The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. The duo recorded the concert special , and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from December 2014 to August 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Next to You" [...] was {{directed}} by Colin Tilley and filmed at the Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and upper Manhattan. On May 10, 2011, Bieber's manager confirmed plans for a music video via Twitter. In an interview with MTV News, Tilley spoke briefly about the video, saying [...] "Tomorrow, I'm shooting New Boyz and Chris Brown... then Justin Bieber and Chris Brown, together... I can't tell <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> about that yet, but it's going to happen. It's gonna be big. It's gonna be big. I can't say anything else." [...] On May 21, 2011, Brown posted two photos from the shoot via Twitter, showing him and Bieber standing among overturned cars in a path of destruction. However, the unfinished version of the music video leaked onto the internet on June 6, and the final cut was premiered on June 17, 2011.|$|E
500|$|Bennett and Gaga {{performed}} {{a total of}} 13 songs from the album, including the number one singles on Billboards Jazz chart [...] "Anything Goes" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love". Before the concert was aired, a number of promotional videos from the show were released. Additionally, PBS announced that the concert was filmed in 4K resolution. On January 20, 2015, the DVD and Blu-ray was released, and later for digital download on iTunes Store. It reached the top-ten of the record charts in many countries, reaching {{number one in the}} US and Belgium. Bennett and Gaga partnered with LG Electronic, who aired the concert across all retail chains in the United States, on LG's 4K Ultra High-definition TV screens. Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live! became the first concert to be streamed in 4K resolution. The show received positive reviews, with critics praising Gaga and Bennett's vocals and their camaraderie on stage.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the first}} episode to feature Mr. McFeely's second Special Delivery song, which is titled as [...] "Is there <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want?/Is there <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> need?". This song was {{frequently}} used from 1991 {{until the end of}} the series in 2001.|$|R

500|$|The track {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Ken Barnes of USA Today described the song {{as being a}} [...] "hopelessly sappy ballad oozing with fuzzy sentiments. I'd say it's more like caterpillars." [...] Frank Kogan of The Village Voice, citing the lyrics, [...] "I would give <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> baby, just make my dreams come true/Oh baby you give me butterflies" [...] wrote [...] "so, would he give her, like, caterpillars in exchange? birds?" [...] and added that what grabs his attention about a song like [...] "Butterflies" [...] is not the [...] "melody but the weirdly ringing wrench-against-faucet clang on the backbeat." [...] Christie Leo of the New Straits Times gave the track a more positive review, calling the song a [...] "luxuriant" [...] ballad. Pop music critic Robert Hilburn, writing for the Los Angeles Times, described [...] "Butterflies", and another song from Invincible ("Speechless"), as being [...] "as woefully generic as their titles". A journalist of the same publication felt that track was about romantic [...] "jitters".|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, it was {{announced}} by both artists and started recording, after Gaga recovered from her hip surgery. The album was recorded in New York City, where Bennett and Gaga were accompanied by a live band and jazz musicians associated with both artists. Gaga deviated from her previous contemporary pop albums, while wanting instead to create a jazz record. The release date of the album was delayed multiple times, and the final date {{was announced}} by Bennett and Gaga on The Today Show. The full-length track listing and the cover artwork was released thereafter; including the track lists for many alternate editions. The artists promoted Cheek to Cheek through multiple performances in and around New York, a [...] "behind the scenes" [...] program detailing the recording of the album on Home Shopping Network (HSN), and a televised concert, titled , which aired on PBS in October 2014. The album was preceded by the release of two singles: [...] "Anything Goes" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love". They both reached number one on Billboards Jazz Digital Songs Chart.|$|E
500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' And I just thought how the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E

500|$|In March 1937 Howard Hawks {{signed a}} {{contract}} at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's [...] "Gunga Din", which had been in pre-production since the previous fall. When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of [...] "Gunga Din" [...] was delayed, Hawks began {{looking for a new}} project. In April 1937 he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in Collier's magazine called [...] "Bringing Up Baby" [...] and immediately wanted to make a film from it, remembering that it made him laugh out loud. RKO bought the screen rights in June for $1,004, and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film's treatment. Wilde's short story differed significantly from the film: David and Susan are engaged, he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur, intercostal clavicle or museum. However, Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby's favorite song, [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love, Baby".|$|E
500|$|Bennett and Gaga {{performed}} thirteen songs. The concert {{started with}} Bennett and Gaga appearing before {{the crowd and}} singing [...] "Anything Goes", then {{moving on to the}} title track, [...] "Cheek to Cheek". A costume change ensues, and Gaga and Bennett appear on stage to sing [...] "Nature Boy". Bennett continues with [...] "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?" [...] following which Gaga appears on stage in Menkes' red jumpsuit and a big wig to sing her solo rendition of [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)". Following a standing ovation, the duo come together to perform the Billy Strayhorn penned [...] "Firefly" [...] and Gaga disappears for a third costume change. She appears in Vogels' crown hat and a Valentino gown and together they sing [...] "I Won't Dance" [...] and [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love", wearing Cavalli. Gaga stays on stage for solo rendition of [...] "Lush Life", followed by Bennett with his solo performance of [...] "Sophisticated Lady". After another costume change, the duo sing [...] "Let's Face the Music and Dance" [...] and [...] "But Beautiful". The final performance is aided by the full band and dancers, as they sing [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)". After taking a bow, Bennett and Gaga disappear behind the curtains.|$|E
500|$|Three {{songs from}} the album were used by ESPN during the {{advertisements}} for the 2014 Tennis US Open. The channel's vice president Jamie Reynolds explained that their decision to incorporate the [...] "classic swing vibe of New York" [...] led them to use the Cheek to Cheek songs. Universal Music provided the videos for the songs, which were then mixed with tennis shots and used in the ads. It also used original content like Bennett in his Manhattan apartment, and Gaga on tour in Australia with [...] On September 13, 2014, Bennett joined Gaga onstage at the ArtRave tour in Tel Aviv, Israel to sing selected tracks from the album. Gaga's vocals on [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love" [...] drew praise for her range and control. On September 22, Bennett and Gaga performed a short set list of songs from Cheek to Cheek at the Grand Place of Brussels, Belgium. Their performance received positive reviews, with The Daily Telegraphs Anne Bilson giving it {{four out of five}} stars, complimenting their vocals saying [...] "Bennett had the lungs to compensate, and Gaga had the moves." [...] Promotional videos were released for [...] "Anything Goes" [...] (from Brussels performance) and [...] "Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)" [...] (from the PBS special) on September 27, 2014.|$|E

500|$|In their pantomimes, the {{diminutive}} Leno {{and the massive}} Campbell were a visually comic duo. They would often deviate from the script, improvising freely. This was met with some scepticism by producers, who feared that the scenes would not be funny to audiences and observed that, in any event, they were rarely at their best until a few nights after opening. George Bernard Shaw wrote of one appearance: [...] "I hope I never again have to endure anything more dismally futile", and the English essayist and caricaturist Max Beerbohm stated that [...] "Leno does not do himself justice collaborating with the public". [...] He noted, however, that Leno [...] "was exceptional in giving each of his dames a personality of her own, from extravagant queen to artless gossip". In Sleeping Beauty, Leno and Campbell caused the audience to laugh even when they could not see them: they would arrive on stage in closed palanquins and exchange the lines, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> to do this afternoon, my dear?"– [...] "No, I have nothing on", before being carried off again. Leno and Campbell's pantomimes from 1889 were Jack and the Beanstalk (1889 and 1899), Beauty and the Beast (1890 and 1900), Humpty Dumpty (1891 and 1903), Little Bo-Peep (1892), Robinson Crusoe (1893), Dick Whittington and His Cat (1894), Cinderella (1895), Aladdin (1896), Babes in the Wood (1897) and the Forty Thieves (1898).|$|E
500|$|The first song, [...] "Anything Goes", was {{recorded}} by Bennett for his 1959 collaboration with Count Basie and his Orchestra, Strike Up the Band, and Gaga {{first came to}} know about it when she was 13 years old. Gaga thought that [...] "Anything Goes" [...] was a funny track with a [...] "real sexy, powerful vibe to it, and it's just because we're having fun singing it." [...] The version on Cheek to Cheek finds Bennett and Gaga swapping the lyrics between themselves, and was described by Bobby Olivier, from The Star-Ledger, as [...] "smooth as silk". The syllables are pronounced strongly by Gaga in syncopation while her vibrato complemented Bennett's characteristic jazz vocals and swing. Olivier added, [...] "Gaga's voice, when stripped of its bells and whistles, showcases a timelessness that lends itself well to the genre." [...] "I Can't Give <b>You</b> <b>Anything</b> but Love" [...] was originally written in 1928 by Jimmy McHugh and Dorothy Fields for the Broadway revue, Blackbirds of 1928. The version on Cheek to Cheek opens with the sound of high-hat and an electronic organ. Gaga alters the lyrics to sing [...] "Gee, I'd like to say you're looking swell, Tony", who later rejoins with the line [...] "Diamond bracelets won't work, doesn't sell, Gaga". [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was first released as a single in 1948 by Cole, and it became a commercial success for him. Written by eccentric songwriter eden ahbez, the song about a [...] "strange enchanted boy" [...] features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. A loungier version, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character.|$|E
500|$|The film, however, was {{not without}} its criticisms. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice was more {{critical}} of the film. While praising Ejiofor's work, she stated: [...] "It's a picture that stays {{more than a few}} safe steps away from anything so dangerous as raw feeling. Even when it depicts inhuman cruelty, as it often does, it never compromises its aesthetic purity." [...] Peter Malamud Smith of Slate criticized the story, saying, [...] "12 Years a Slave is constructed as a story of a man trying to return to his family, offering every viewer a way into empathizing with its protagonist. Maybe we need a story framed on that individual scale in order to understand it. But it has a distorting effect all the same. We're more invested in one hero than in millions of victims; if we're forced to imagine ourselves enslaved, we want to imagine ourselves as Northup, a special person who miraculously escaped the system that attempted to crush him." [...] Describing this as [...] "the hero problem", Malamud Smith concluded his review explaining, [...] "We can handle 12 Years a Slave. But don't expect 60 Years a Slave any time soon. And 200 Years, Millions of Slaves? Forget about it." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club opined that McQueen is [...] "essentially tone-deaf when it comes to performance, and skirts by on casting". The film [...] "lacks a necessary emotional continuity. I don't think it's something the movie is denying in the way it intentionally denies so many other conventions; it's still structured around an ending that's supposed to function as a release, but because it can’t organize that sense of catharsis it so badly needs, it just feels as though McQueen is scurrying for an exit. Also: The cast is wildly uneven." [...] At The Guardian, black Canadian author Orville Lloyd Douglas said he would not be seeing 12 Years a Slave, explaining: [...] "I'm convinced these black race films are created for a white, liberal film audience to engender white guilt and make them feel bad about themselves. Regardless of your race, these films are unlikely to teach <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> you don't already know." ...|$|E
