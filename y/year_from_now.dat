He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly glad to have broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here.

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E

500|$|Several of Jackson's songs {{have been}} leaked onto the Internet without gaining an {{official}} release. One example involved the song [...] "A Place with No Name", a 24-second snippet {{of which was}} leaked by website TMZ.com following Jackson's death in 2009. At {{the time of the}} leak, it was claimed that there were [...] "hundreds" [...] of unreleased songs by the musician, and that they could be issued for several years to come. Commenting on the subject, the curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, noted that any future releases would garner significant attention. [...] "I {{think we are going to}} see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on." [...] On March 16, 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a record-breaking $250million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017 and release ten posthumous albums—some of which will feature unreleased material—over the next decade.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. I think we are going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I look back on it in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

[...] "to provide {{educational}} {{assistance to}} the dependents of Federal law enforcement officials who are killed or disabled {{in the performance of}} their duties." [...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one <b>year</b> <b>from</b> <b>now,</b> we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually wanted to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E

The publisher was simultaneously shopping it around for a film sale. That's how it wound up in my hands. I was reading it and somewhere on page three I said yes.
