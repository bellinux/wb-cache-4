25|$|The {{first phase}} of the study was {{designed}} mainly by Christopher Gillberg and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers in all areas of Gothenburg were asked to answer a questionnaire with a series of <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no</b> questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (The questionnaire was based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.|$|E
25|$|Special affirmative and {{negative}} words (particles) are {{often found in}} responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no</b> respectively, in French oui, si and non, in Swedish ja, jo and nej, and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as Welsh) it is more common to repeat the verb or {{another part of the}} predicate, with or without negation accordingly.|$|E

500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no,</b> stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I wonder whether Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E

However, the {{director}} did not want the film to be serious or preachy: [...] "I also realise that when you preach via cinema nobody wants to hear it". [...] "The film has a message, if you get it, great. If you don’t, no problem, sit back, relax and enjoy the film", he said about making Dostana a romantic comedy. In February 2008, Johar announced the film's title; the producer named it after a 1980 film produced by his father, Yash Johar. Asked if his film was also a love triangle, he replied: [...] "Well, <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no.</b> Though it's a love story, there's a never-before twist in the tale. All I can say on record is that we've never had a love triangle like this before." [...] The gay storyline was not disclosed until the trailers were released. Manan Sagar was hired to edit the film, and the duo Salim–Sulaiman composed the background score.|$|E

[...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time.

2500|$|Bartlett's poetry {{came to the}} {{attention}} of leading poets, writers, and critics as diverse as Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens, Mark Van Doren, Conrad Aiken, Allen Tate, Alfred Kreymborg, Robert Hillyer, Louis Untermeyer, Rolfe Humphries, John Ciardi, Richard Eberhart, Richard Wilbur, Maxine Kumin, Robert M. Hutchins, Kenneth Rexroth, William Stafford, and others. [...] Over the years, Bartlett maintained an active and extensive correspondence with eminent poets, writers, and literary critics; evident throughout this collected literary correspondence are strong statements attesting to the importance of her work. About her first book of poetry, Poems of <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>No,</b> published in 1952, Marianne Moore wrote: [...] "I surely find good in the Poems of <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>No....</b> The clearness of the book is certainly beautiful." [...] Wallace Stevens was impressed by Poems of <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>No</b> and wrote: [...] "Your poems give one a sense of intelligence and sensibility." [...] Alfred Kreymborg was enthusiastic about the book: [...] "You have found a style of your own and developed it. I say yes to your poems of <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no.</b> This is a distinguished volume as a whole. I wish you well with this warm book. Any poet might envy the courage and artistry of what you say, or rather sing, there." [...] Further commendation came from Robert Hillyer, who wrote: [...] "Your poems are moving and unusual.... A distinguished achievement!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{pleaded guilty}} to {{attempted}} assassination {{and was sentenced to}} life in prison. At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: [...] "Am I sorry I tried? <b>Yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no.</b> Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I'm not sorry I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger." [...] In 1979, Moore escaped from the Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia, but was captured hours later. After her return, she was transferred to a more secure facility, and she served the remainder of her term at the federal women’s prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the Unicor Prison Industry for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant. Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.|$|E

The polls tightened further after the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, stated in February that the UK government was opposed to a currency union; the average yes support increased to 43%, once 'don't knows' had been excluded. There was little movement in the following months, with the average continuing to show 43% <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> 57% <b>no</b> (excluding don't knows) in July 2014 and August 2014.|$|R

Wilber, who was involved in the plot to remove Mossadegh from power, in early August, Iranian CIA operatives pretending to be socialists and nationalists threatened Muslim leaders with [...] "savage punishment if they opposed Mossadegh," [...] thereby giving the impression that Mossadegh was cracking down on dissent, and stirring anti-Mossadegh sentiments within the religious community. A referendum to dissolve parliament and give the prime minister power to make law was submitted to voters, and it passed with 99 percent approval, 2,043,300 votes to 1300 votes against. According to Mark J. Gasiorowski, [...] "There were separate polling stations for <b>yes</b> <b>and</b> <b>no</b> votes, producing sharp criticism of Mosaddeq" [...] and that the [...] "controversial referendum...gave the CIA's precoup propaganda campaign an easy target". On or around 16 August, Parliament was suspended indefinitely, and Mosaddeq's emergency powers were extended.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{not known}} exactly which {{complexity}} classes contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It {{is known to be}} in both NP and co-NP. This is because both <b>YES</b> <b>and</b> <b>NO</b> answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of YES can be certified by exhibiting a factorization [...] with [...] An answer of NO can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of N into distinct primes, all larger than M. We can verify their primality using the AKS primality test and that their product is N by multiplication. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees {{that there is only one}} possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both UP and co-UP. It is known to be in BQP because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and co-NP-complete. It is therefore a candidate for the NP-intermediate complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-Complete or co-NP-Complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many people have tried to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked whether}} the members {{consider}} Believer a [...] "Christian band" [...] Daub replies {{in an interview with}} Metal Covenant in 2009: [...] "Well, <b>yes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>no...</b> this is a difficult subject to approach for us. Ever since we formed Believer, Kurt Bachman and myself despised being limited to a certain belief or style of music. We did not like to be labeled or numbered. Whether it was our personal spiritual journey, or the type of music we played. We were called thrash, death metal, technical death metal etc. The key focus for us then and now is to just encourage people to think for themselves." [...] Daub comments about the lyrics that [...] "We always wrote about what was near and dear to our heart. On Extraction, we used Bible based themes and stories to express our intentions, but {{we did not want to}} preach." [...] "Well we never wanted to be known as a Christian band for one [...] It was one of these things where it got out of control. With promoting records it was one of those things where the record company was like “Hey, here’s a slant. Something different. [...] Something new and unique. Let’s go for that”. I’ve always tried to stay away from labeling the band. For me it’s a band, it’s entertainment. We even get called death metal some times even though I don’t think we resemble anything death metal-ish out there, but then again I have my own opinions on what death metal is. We just don’t want it to be one of those things where someone’s like “oh I hate thrash music, so I won’t like Believer”. You get labeled and we’re going to have to go through labels but we’re not really comfortable with any." [...] says Bachman in an interview on MetalSucks.|$|E
