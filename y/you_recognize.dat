500|$|When {{choosing}} the songs, Gunn revealed he [...] "started {{the process by}} reading the Billboard charts {{for all of the}} top hits of the '70s", downloading [...] "a few hundred" [...] songs that were [...] "semi-familiar — ones <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> but {{might not be able to}} name off the top of your head" [...] and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. He added that he [...] "would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house — sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song, and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." [...] Most of the songs were played on set to help [...] "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with David Bowie's [...] "Moonage Daydream" [...] the only song chosen and added during post-production. Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with [...] "Hooked on a Feeling" [...] in mind; however once Gunn discovered [...] "Come and Get Your Love", the song used in the sequence, Gunn felt it was a [...] "better fit." ...|$|E

500|$|Being There was {{received}} positively by critics. AllMusic editor Jason Ankeny gave the album a four-and-a-half stars {{and referred to}} it as [...] "the group's great leap forward." [...] He praised the band's ability to juxtapose psychedelia and power pop with tracks that [...] "wouldn't sound at all out of place on Exile on Main Street". Greg Kot, writing for Rolling Stone, gave the album four stars and lauded how it [...] "venture out into an anxiety-ridden world sure thing... the solace they continue to find in rock and roll." [...] Robert Christgau was more modest, writing [...] "there's no point in denying Jeff Tweedy's achievement as long as <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> its insularity." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called the album [...] "massively improved as both a band and as songwriters" [...] but also noted that [...] "the two-disc set seems {{a little more than a}} marketing scheme." [...] In 2003, Pitchfork named it the 88th best album of the 1990s. Critics at The Village Voice named Being There the 14th best of the year on its Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1996.

[...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength".

Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type.

2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the murder of Witzel, Haarmann killed a 14-year-old named Heinz Martin, who was last seen by his mother on 9 May and who is {{believed}} to have been abducted from Hanover station. All his clothing was later found in Haarmann's apartment. Less than three weeks later, on 26 May, a 17-year-old travelling salesman from the town of Kassel named Fritz Wittig, whom Haarmann would later state he had killed upon the insistence of Grans as he had worn a [...] "good new suit" [...] Grans coveted, was dismembered and discarded in the Leine River.

His murder would be followed less than two weeks later by that of 16-year-old Friedrich Koch, who was approached by Haarmann on 5 June as he walked to college.

2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.'

You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> {{that this is going}} to remain an unsolved [...] problem. We live with that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a [...] potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick [...] the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something [...] will happen and resolve it." [...] He also noted that he had recently received a call from a former U.S. Secretary of State who had suggested that there might be a prospect for accord after the Palestinian elections. Romney made clear in his remarks at the fundraiser that he was opposed to the U.S. exerting any pressure on Israel to help reach a compromise: [...] "The idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to [...] get the Palestinians to act is the worst idea in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mutant Vehicles, often motorized, are {{purpose-built}} or creatively altered {{cars and}} trucks. Participants {{who wish to}} bring motorized mutant vehicles must submit their designs in advance to the event's own DMV or [...] "Department of Mutant Vehicles" [...] for approval and for physical inspection {{at the time of}} the event. Not all designs and proposals are accepted. The event organizers, and in turn the DMV, have set the bar higher for what it deems an acceptable MV each year, in effect capping the number of Mutant Vehicles. This is in response to constraints imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which grants permits to hold the event on federal property, and to participants who want to maintain a pedestrian-friendly environment. Vehicles that are minimally altered, and/or whose primary function is to transport participants, are discouraged and rejected. One of the criteria the DMV employs to determine whether an application for a proposed Mutant Vehicle is approved is [...] "can <b>you</b> <b>recognize</b> the base vehicle". For example, if a 1967 VW van covered with glitter, dolls' heads, and old cooking utensils can still be recognized as a VW van, it is considered to be [...] "decorated not mutated" [...] and is less likely to be approved. This criterion led to the exclusion of some [...] "Art Cars", [...] which historically have been a staple of the event. There were over six hundred approved Mutant Vehicles at the event in 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Awesome Mix Vol. 1 : In February 2014, {{director}} James Gunn {{revealed that}} Guardians of the Galaxy would incorporate {{songs from the}} 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in protagonist Peter Quill's Walkman, which acts {{as a way for}} him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.
