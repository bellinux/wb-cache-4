Would <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> time?" [...] – which according to contemporary sources was the only Polish he knew). As a consequence after the battle, Rochebrune was promoted to the rank of general and considered for the role of the overall leader of the uprising (ultimately rejected for political reasons).|$|E

6000|$|... "Louis Glotte," [...] said James Morris sternly, [...] "I want <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> truth, do <b>you</b> hear? If <b>you</b> do not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> plain truth, <b>you</b> shall suffer." ...|$|R
