That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

Its lead-off single was [...] "I Never Knew Love", which spent two weeks at No.2 on the country singles charts and accounted for his only entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No.81. The album's next two singles were the No.4 [...] "Addicted to a Dollar" [...] and the title track, which Stone wrote with Gary Burr, at No.6. Tom Roland of New Country magazine criticized the album for [...] "continu to mine the drippy side of Stone" [...] through [...] "manipulative" [...] ballads, but cited [...] "Addicted to a Dollar" [...] and [...] "Love, <b>You</b> <b>Took</b> Me by Surprise" [...] as being [...] "tougher" [...] than Stone's previous works.|$|E
500|$|Colonel William H. Powell was {{commander}} of the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry regiment, and second {{in command of the}} brigade. Powell also performed well in the Kanawha Valley Campaign, leading (as a major) the advance guard of the 2nd Loyal (West) Virginia Cavalry that successfully attacked a larger rebel cavalry and drove it away. If the rebel cavalry had not been removed from its position, the entire Union army in the Kanawha River Valley would have been surrounded and prevented from retreating to safety. During November 1862, Powell led a group of 22 men that captured an entire rebel camp in {{what became known as the}} Sinking Creek Raid. For this action, Powell was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Powell, who had been told by General George Crook to not return from the Sinking Creek Raid without good results, received a letter from Crook in 1889 that said [...] "...I have always regarded the part <b>you</b> <b>took</b> in that expedition as one of the most daring, brilliant and successful of the whole war." ...|$|E

Hopkins, however, having earlier learned that Sara was in Lavenham, has set a trap to capture Marshall. Hopkins and Stearne frame Marshall and Sara as witches and take them to the castle to be interrogated. Marshall watches as needles are {{repeatedly}} jabbed into Sara's back, but he refuses to confess to witchcraft, instead vowing again to kill Hopkins. He breaks free from his bonds and stamps on Stearne's face, {{at the same time that}} his army comrades approach the castle dungeon. Marshall grabs an axe and repeatedly strikes Hopkins. The soldiers enter the room and are horrified to see what their friend has done. One of them puts the mutilated but still living Hopkins out of his misery by shooting him dead. Marshall's mind snaps and he shouts, [...] "You took him from me! <b>You</b> <b>took</b> him from me!"

500|$|Hubbard was {{commissioned}} as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists. The Church of Scientology presents {{him as a}} [...] "much-decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded". Scientology publications say {{he served as a}} [...] "Commodore of Corvette squadrons" [...] in [...] "all five theaters of World War II" [...] and was awarded [...] "twenty-one medals and palms" [...] for his service. He was [...] "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" [...] to a military hospital, where he [...] "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe". He said that he had seen combat repeatedly, telling A. E. van Vogt that he had once sailed his ship [...] "right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the Dutch East Indies. His attitude was that if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> your flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days." ...|$|E
500|$|As soon {{as editor}} Julian Clarke began {{selecting}} shots for the film, they were color graded by EFILM's Tim Stipan {{to ensure that}} they matched with each other. Stipan colored the characters slightly differently, such as giving Deadpool a [...] "dark, modern touch" [...] and Colossus a [...] "particular vibrancy and substance". Clarke edited each scene focusing on humor, choosing between alternate takes of jokes. He removed jokes made after Vanessa is kidnapped because they felt inappropriately timed, and cut down other scenes with less jokes such as Wilson being tortured as they were [...] "too much. <b>You</b> <b>took</b> too long to recover [...] get back in the irreverent spirit of the movie.". During editing, a linear version of the film was produced. They decided to go with interweaving the timelines to balance the different serious and silly tones. A sequence removed from the film saw Wilson and Vanessa travel to Mexico looking for a cure after he turned down the recruiter. It was removed for pacing reasons, and was replaced with a short scene of Wilson sitting beside his window that was originally filmed to show him thinking about his diagnosis, but in the new context implies him re-thinking the recruiter's offer.|$|E

Ultimately he concluded that [...] "it felt okay to say goodbye because it was the right atmosphere." [...] James Poniewozik of Time {{wrote that the}} finale was [...] "touching, sweet, funny, messy, a little manipulative. And in the end, it worked." [...] He found that [...] "The stuff that was like latter-seasons Office", such as Andy and Dwight's antics, were [...] "all right" [...] but that [...] "the stuff that recalled the sweep of the whole series was wonderful." [...] Poniewozik was slightly critical of Pam and Jim's story, noting that {{in the grand scheme of}} the show it was successful, but that it makes slightly less sense when one examines it closely; however, he felt that even [...] "if the details don't add up, the emotions do". He concluded that the episode [...] "worked mostly as an epilogue" [...] and allowed the cast of the series to have their final moments.|$|E

The coalition said it portrayed loggers unfairly and is [...] "allowing itself to be used by environmental extremists." [...] In an open letter to The Simpsons executive producer James L.

[...] Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in Stayton, Oregon, said: [...] "The Simpsons portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people.

The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when <b>you</b> <b>took</b> an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?"

[...] Dinh pointed out similarities between [...] "Part of Me" [...] and Perry's previous single [...] "California Gurls", noting that [...] "the tune's steady beat amplifies" [...] as the chorus starts. Andrew Hampp of Billboard described the song as a [...] "dance-floor rave up", and compared the song's composition to Jessie J's [...] "Domino". Edna Gundersen from USA Today stated: [...] "Katy Perry could be addressing her ex or her detractors on this defiant slapdown, a gleaming [...] "Firework"-like pop torpedo propelled by slick beats and a brazen chorus." [...] Chris Ryan, also of MTV, inferred that the song was aimed at Perry's ex-boyfriend Travie McCoy, while New York magazine journalist Amanda Dobbis described it as [...] "another break-up anthem". Fans and media noted differences in the lyrics between the demo and the single, and claimed that the changes redirected the song's subject from McCoy to Perry's ex-husband Russell Brand, from whom she had recently divorced.
