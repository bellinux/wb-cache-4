25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. <b>You</b> <b>write</b> about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|Fleming wrote Diamonds Are Forever at his Goldeneye {{estate in}} Jamaica in January and February 1955.

I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, <b>you</b> <b>write</b> 2,000 words a day."

Efforts from inside the city failed, though, and Aratus quietly retreated, hoping to remain unnoticed. Cleomenes {{nonetheless}} discovered the plan and {{sent a message to}} Aratus asking about the goal of his expedition. Aratus replied that he had come to stop Cleomenes from fortifying Belbina.

500|$|Whale met Franz Waxman at a {{party and}} asked him to score the picture. [...] "Nothing will be {{resolved}} in this picture except the end destruction scene. Would <b>you</b> <b>write</b> an unresolved score for it?" [...] asked Whale. Waxman created three distinctive themes: one for the Monster; one for the Bride; and one for Pretorius. The score closes, at Whale's suggestion, with a powerful dissonant chord, intended to convey the idea that the on-screen explosion was so powerful that the theater where the film was being screened was affected by it. Constantin Bakaleinikoff conducted 22 musicians to record the score in a single nine-hour session.|$|E

When Metro questioned Brown about her feelings towards the group's ownership of the song, she responded: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>write</b> songs for other people you’ve got to let it go, it becomes their property, they have to interpret {{it in the way}} they feel.

500|$|In May 1963 Fleming wrote a {{piece for}} Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, <b>you</b> <b>write</b> 2,000 words a day." [...] Benson identified what he described as the [...] "Fleming Sweep", the use of [...] "hooks" [...] at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next. The hooks combine with what Anthony Burgess calls [...] "a heightened journalistic style" [...] to produce [...] "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".|$|E
500|$|In {{discussing}} his lyrics, Jimi Hendrix was characteristically enigmatic. [...] In a 1967 interview, he explained [...] "Most ballads come across in different ways. [...] Sometimes you {{see things in}} different ways than other people see it. [...] So then <b>you</b> <b>write</b> it in a song. [...] It could represent anything". [...] In different interviews, he acknowledged an American Indian-influence on his songs [...] "I Don't Live Today", [...] "May This Be Love", and [...] "Little Wing". [...] He described [...] "Little Wing" [...] as being [...] "based on a very, very simple Indian style", perhaps referring to some Native American mythologies in which spirits inhabit nature and animals, including birds. [...] In one interview, he saw it as self-explanatory: [...] "That's exactly what it's about, like 'She's walking through the clouds'", ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming had {{previously}} mentioned to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} early 1952, to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials, that he began to write Casino Royale at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on 17 February; he typed out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination, and finished work on the manuscript in March 1952. It was a pattern he retained for future Bond books. In May 1963 he wrote a piece for Books and Bookmen magazine in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written... By following my formula, <b>you</b> <b>write</b> 2,000 words a day." ...|$|E

Then one guy looked at us and said, 'But we need a hit song.' And we said, 'But you've got eleven songs, and if you can't find a hit in one of them then you're shit out of luck because that's what we're giving you.' So we're like saying to them, 'Right, <b>you</b> <b>write</b> the fucking hit song and we'll record it.'

500|$|Pratchett {{believed}} he owed [...] "a {{debt to the}} science fiction/fantasy genre which he grew up out of" [...] and disliked the term [...] "magical realism" [...] which, he said, is [...] "like a polite way of saying <b>you</b> <b>write</b> fantasy and is more acceptable to certain people ... who, on the whole, do not care that much." [...] He expressed annoyance that fantasy is [...] "unregarded as a literary form", arguing that it [...] "is the oldest form of fiction"; he described himself as [...] "infuriated" [...] when novels containing science fiction or fantasy ideas were not regarded as part of those genres. He debated this issue with novelist A. S. Byatt and critic Terry Eagleton, arguing that fantasy is fundamental {{to the way we}} understand the world and therefore an integral aspect of all fiction.|$|E
500|$|After Frittie's death, Alice {{attached}} herself {{more closely}} to her only surviving son, Ernest, and her newborn daughter Marie. In 1875 she resumed her public duties, including fund-raising, medical and social work, which had always held her interest. She maintained active correspondence with the social reformer Octavia Hill. However, in these years, relations with her husband deteriorated. In late 1876, she travelled to England for treatment due to an internal complaint caused by a backward curvature of the womb, and remained at Balmoral while she recovered. From Balmoral, she wrote to her husband criticising the childishness of his letters: [...] "f my children wrote me such childish letters – only short accounts – of where and what they had eaten or {{where they had been}} etc., and no opinions, observations and remarks, I should be surprised – and how much more so when <b>you</b> <b>write</b> like that!"
