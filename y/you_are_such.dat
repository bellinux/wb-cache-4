But Spotted Tail, you cannot read or write. You claim that the government has tricked your people and placed the lines of your reservation a long way inside of where it was agreed that they should be. [...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. Do you intend to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. Why do {{you look}} so enigmatic about it? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a sphinx: I {{never know what you}} mean.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} will not do that,' said the little creature,' <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a very old gentleman, and walk so slow yourself.' ...|$|E
60|$|AUNT JUDY. I'd no notion <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> an orator, Mr Broadbent.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> {{an awfully}} good friend. I {{thought we were}} very well as we were.|$|R
60|$|FERSEN. We {{thought we}} tell <b>you</b> now. <b>You</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> {{a good friend}} to us and our families.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, don't {{you suppose}} it's because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> {{a child in}} some respects that I like you, dear?" [...] she demanded, without relenting.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One day,' he said, softly, {{looking up}} at her, 'I shall destroy YOU, as you stand looking at the sunset; because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a liar.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{would be}} a difficulty, no doubt; still <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a {{complete}} Seacombe in appearance, feature, language, almost manner, I wonder they should disown you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not help it!' cried Albinia, {{looking at}} him with her clear indignant eyes. 'How can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a poor creature, Gilbert?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Katie, how can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a tease?' said Mrs. Woodward; 'you'll make Harry {{hate the}} island, and you too. I wonder <b>you</b> can <b>be</b> so selfish.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a naughty boy {{and your}} poor mother just laid in her grave this very day?" [...] demanded Marilla despairingly.|$|R
6000|$|She was answered, [...] "Oh la! what harm can it do? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a proud peat! Grand-dame {{and sister}} {{like to know}} all about His Royal Highness." ...|$|E
60|$|Isa. Come, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> {{a jealous}} coxcomb: I warrant you suspect there's some amour between 'em; {{there can be}} nothing in't, it is so open: Pray observe.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have prayed your ladyship {{to offer}} my humble excuses to His Royal Highness. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a perfect hostess, I {{do not think}} I shall be missed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a silly thing,' replied Dora, {{slapping}} my hand, 'as to sit there, telling such stories? I'll make Jip bite you!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, Babie," [...] {{said her}} brother, [...] "I didn't think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> a Babie {{as not to}} know that things go by contraries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Blandois! How can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a fool as {{to provoke}} him! By Heaven, {{and the other}} place too, he'll tear you to bits! Lie down! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will;--whatever you please. But kiss me." [...] Then {{he kissed}} her, {{as he stood}} among Mr. Soames's cabbage-stalks. [...] "Dear Hugh; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a god to me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That you--what, sir?" [...] exclaimed little Mr. Crampton, {{bouncing}} off his chair. [...] "You don't {{mean to say}} that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a fool as to decline the place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do go on, Duchess!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Anything in {{the nature}} of a {{personal}} confession is so fascinating, and you know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> an enigma to all of us." ...|$|E
60|$|AMAH. [Roughly tearing {{her hands}} away.] Don't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>such</b> a big fool, Daisy. You go to Chung-king and Harry know everything. Maybe he kill you.|$|R
6000|$|... "But if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> {{a man as}} I, {{with neither}} love for your {{vocation}} nor faith in it, should you not cease to be a priest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> a fool as to pay {{without asking}} {{if there were any}} more detainers?" [...] roared Walker to his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, I'll tell you," [...] said Stryver, coming {{slowly into}} a sitting posture. [...] "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you, because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> an insensible dog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a {{great success}} in your profession!" [...] she observed. [...] "You carry the melodramatic {{instinct}} with you, day by day. You see everything through the dramatist's spectacles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} that Rosemary West won't marry your pa because she thinks <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a wild lot? She's afraid she couldn't bring you up right and so she turned him down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mr. Crocker," [...] said Mrs. Cooke; [...] "I {{had given}} up all hope of ever seeing you again. Why have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a stranger?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot ’ave <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>such</b> a {{long time}} for?" [...] ses Ginger, in a low, fierce voice, as Isaac stopped {{underneath}} the winder and nodded up to ’em.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had not {{the least}} idea <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> an {{energetic}} person," [...] remarked Mrs. Easterfield, [...] "and I think <b>you</b> <b>were</b> entirely too rash. But how about Mr. Lancaster? Do you {{know if he was}} listening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sorry <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> an unpresentable bridegroom," [...] {{said the}} Trader, {{when they were}} about to separate. He {{referred}} to the cuts and bruises with which poor Dan's countenance was temporarily disfigured.|$|E
6000|$|... "The idea {{of wanting}} an {{anaconda}} tickled me so, I couldn't help it. I dare say you'd have got me one if I {{had asked for}} it, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> an obliging chap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has not denied it," [...] she answered--"very {{likely he}} will not do so before the magistrate--but neither has he {{admitted}} it. Mr. Ruff, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>such</b> a clever man. Can't you see the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In danger!" [...] cried Ezra, looking {{round the}} clear sky and placid sea. [...] "Where is the danger? I {{did not think}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> an old woman, Miggs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> {{a perverse}} creature, {{as the old}} lady said. I {{am not sure that}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not right, because a girl does so often raise herself in her lover's {{estimation}} by refusing him half-a-dozen times. But <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not up to that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{you know}} you made me, and I {{think it is a}} shame. She said she was glad she wasn't one of them, for <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>such</b> a {{peculiar}} child.' ...|$|R
