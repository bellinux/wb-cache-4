"This is {{an amazing}} time of celebration for us all {{and we are very}} excited to join forces with the unique and {{creative}} individuals at MTV2 to present what we hope {{will be one of the}} most exciting tours of the fall... Welcome to the Universe. With a powerful line up of phenomenally talented opening bands and having an environmentally acceptable 'green' tour, we are looking forward to yet another chance for us to share something unique with our family of fans that have supported us so passionately and also invite and introduce many others to the world of Thirty Seconds to Mars. Taking this approach gives us the opportunity to set an example and share with others the possibilities of real alternatives for a safer, cleaner world. We will see <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> soon for what will be an exciting, chaotic circus of insanity, and an unforgettable tour." ...|$|E

6000|$|Then {{there was}} a {{momentary}} silence, and Tom, who, with his brother, had been feeling very uncomfortable, although rather inclined to laugh, seeing that {{he was expected to}} say something, said, [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much; but we'd much rather you hadn't done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{know what}} you are talking about,' said Katie, yawning, 'and I think <b>you</b> are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> stupid; so I'll go to bed.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{can pass}} {{the night in}} this seat very comfortably, so please don't worry about me. It is warm here, you know, and I won't mind a bit the sitting up. Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much for your kindness, and good-bye. I'll be all right, never fear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am satisfied. I've {{done what}} I undertook, and it's {{not my fault}} that it failed. I comfort myself with that," [...] said Amy with a little quiver in her voice. [...] "I thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much for helping me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will speak}} to <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> soon," [...] said Clewe. [...] "I can't tell you {{anything}} now. Margaret, let us go. I shall {{want to talk to}} you directly, but not until I have been to my office. I will meet you at your house in a very few minutes." [...] And with that he left the building and fairly ran to his office.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> {{rich and}} successful, are you not, {{and are going}} to be much richer and much more successful--next week. Now what I want to ask you is--how is it done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think they}} have seen {{something}} to frighten them. I believe that the soldiers are behind us. They have given the order to fill the waterskins, and be ready for a start when the darkness comes. But I am ordered to gather you together, for the Moolah is coming to convert <b>you</b> <b>all.</b> I have already told him that <b>you</b> are <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much inclined to think the same with him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much," [...] she said. [...] "I am {{very happy}} indeed {{to be in}} London, {{because it is the}} capital city of the most generous country in the world--the country that is always ready to protect and help her weaker neighbors. I am a Servian, and I love my country, and therefore," [...] she added, with a little break in her voice,--"therefore I love you all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Francesca did not renew her speech-making; a chill {{seemed to}} have fallen over all efforts at festivity, and she {{contented}} herself with refilling her glass and simply drinking to her boy's good health. The others followed her example, and Comus drained his glass with a brief [...] "thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much." [...] The sense of constraint which hung over the company was not, however, marked by any uncomfortable pause in the conversation. Henry Greech was a fluent thinker, {{of the kind that}} prefer to do their thinking aloud; the silence that descended on him as a mantle in the House of Commons was an official livery of which he divested himself as thoroughly as possible in private life. He did not propose to sit through dinner as a mere listener to Mr. Thorle's personal narrative of philanthropic movements and experiences, and took the first opportunity of launching himself into a flow of satirical observations on current political affairs. Lady Veula was inured to this sort of thing in her own home circle, and sat listening with the stoical indifference with which an Esquimau might accept the occurrence of one snowstorm the more, in the course of an Arctic winter. Serena Golackly felt a certain relief at the fact that her imported guest was not, after all, monopolising the conversation. But the latter was too determined a personality to allow himself to be thrust aside for many minutes by the talkative M.P. Henry Greech paused for an instant to chuckle at one of his own shafts of satire, and immediately Thorle's penetrating voice swept across the table.|$|E
60|$|About George's pictures, {{perhaps you}} better wait till I hear from him, before sending them. I remain well as usual. The poor fellow I {{mentioned}} {{in one of}} my letters last week, with diarrhoea, that wanted me to ask God's blessing on him, was still living yesterday afternoon, but just living. He is only partially conscious, is all wasted away to nothing, and lies most of the time in half stupor, as they give him brandy copiously. Yesterday I was there by him a few minutes. He is very much averse to taking brandy, and there was some trouble in getting him to take it. He is almost totally deaf the last five or six days. There is no chance for him at all. Quite a particular friend of mine, Oscar Cunningham, an Ohio boy, had his leg amputated yesterday close up by the thigh. It was a pretty tough operation. He was badly wounded just a year ago to-day at Chancellorsville and has suffered a great deal; lately got erysipelas in his leg and foot. I forget whether I have mentioned him before or not. He was a very large, noble-looking young man when I first see him. The doctor thinks he will live and get up, but I consider [it] by no means so certain. He is very much prostrated. Well, dear mother, you must write and Jeff too--I do want to see <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much. How does Mat get along, and how little Sis and all? I send my love to you and Jeff and all. We are having a very pleasant, coolish day here. I am going down to post office to leave this, and then up to my old friends the O'Connors to dinner, and then down to hospital. Well, good-bye, dear mother, for present.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall love to {{hear about}} that," [...] she assented. [...] "How much sugar, please, and will you pass those hot muffins to the Princess? And please touch that bell.

60|$|Washington, Oct. 6, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--Your {{letter and}} George's came safe--dear brother George, one don't more than {{get a letter}} from him before {{you want to hear}} again, {{especially}} as things are looking pretty stormy that way--but mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in Kentucky, at or near where George last wrote; but of course that is only my guess. I send George papers and occasionally letters. Mother, I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him; but I sent it. Mother, I think Rosecrans and Burnside will be too much for the Rebels down there yet. I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of friends, and such friends too--they will fight and fight up to the handle, and kill somebody (it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed). Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, and tell me about Andrew, if there is anything different with him--I think about him every day and night. I believe I must come home, even if it is only for a week--I want to see <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much. Mother, I know you must have a great deal to harass and trouble you; I don't mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, and do anything to nourish him, but about the children and Nancy--but, mother, you must not let anything chafe you, and you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little Georgy too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older); and while you are pleasant with Nancy you must be sufficiently plain with her--only, mother, I know you will, and Jeff and Mat will too, be invariably good to Andrew, and not mind his being irritable at times; it is his disease, and then his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness--and always do anything for him that you can in reason. Mat, my dear sister, I know you will, for I know your nature is to come out a first-class girl in times of trouble and sickness, and do anything. Mother, you don't know how pleased I was to read what you wrote about little Sis. I want to see her so bad I don't know what to do; I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island--but I hope it will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt, I hope, has heart and gizzard big enough for both his little nieces and as many more as the Lord may send.|$|E

Colonel Kyanda acknowledged that [...] "in {{the process of trying to}} arrest terrorists at times you find people who are innocent. As <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> well know, a terrorist does not have any boundary. So, operations against a terrorist are complicated.

5000|$|Reid's bravery in {{defending}} the position, and isolated bridgehead was vital, and crucial, allowing {{enough time for}} reinforcements to cross the river. The manouevre allowed General Sir Stanley Maude to outflank the Turks and to effect entry into Baghdad on 11 March 1917. Captain Reid was granted leave that summer 1917 returned to Johannesburg. The town's first winner of the Victoria Cross was given a rapturous welcome, reported a local newspaper. [...] "Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much. It's {{all a matter of}} luck", said Reid in all due modesty - soldierly and professional to the last. [...] Reid left South Africa to return to the regiment on Monday 13 August 1917. He had already been made Acting Major on 10 May. On 31 August 1917 it was announced that the Italian government had awarded him the Silver Medal for Military Valour. In October 1917 he suffered a recurrence of the Rugby injury to a cartilage in the knee, and was invalided out. In December the General's Report mentioned him in despatches. He returned home to recover from his injuries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} Cliff Richard's name change from Harry Webb {{was seen as}} a partial tribute to his musical hero Little Richard and singer Rick Richards. Several members of The Beatles were heavily {{influenced}} by Little Richard, including Paul McCartney and George Harrison. McCartney idolized Little Richard in school and later used Little Richard's recordings as inspiration for his uptempo rockers, such as [...] "I'm Down.". [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the first song McCartney performed in public. McCartney would later state, [...] "I could do Little Richard's voice, which is a wild, hoarse, screaming thing. It's like an out-of-body experience. You have to leave your current sensibilities and go about a foot above your head to sing it." [...] During the Beatles' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Harrison commented, [...] "thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>very</b> much, especially the rock 'n' rollers, an' Little Richard there, if it wasn't for (gesturing to Little Richard), it was all his fault, really." [...] Upon hearing Little Richard's [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] in 1956, John Lennon later commented that he was so impressed that he [...] "couldn't speak". Rolling Stones members Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were also profoundly influenced by Little Richard, with Jagger citing him as his first induction to R&B music and referring to him as [...] "the originator and my first idol". Little Richard was an early vocal influence on Rod Stewart. David Bowie called Little Richard his [...] "inspiration" [...] stating upon listening to [...] "Tutti Frutti" [...] that he [...] "heard God".|$|E
