It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> when you're writin' songs.|$|E
2500|$|When {{one wants}} to find a gesture, when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> how to act onstage, {{all you have to}} do is [...] to the music. The {{composer}} has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not [...] much also—you will find every gesture there.|$|E
2500|$|Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old {{woman and}} her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, while searching for an ammo can in 2012. Rochester Fire Department {{spokesman}} Lt. Ted Kuppinger said, [...] "It's difficult because you're invested in it <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> something like that so people will probably try to push themselves more than they should {{but you need to}} be prudent about what you're capable of doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{as it is}} good. I 'aven't {{said nothing}} about any good, Mr. 'Oward. What <b>you</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> is them diamonds?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] she answered, [...] "and so you {{can tell}} it to me. And now, that I think of it, you can tell me, at the same time, why <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> my cousin Junius. You refused once to tell me that, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{does not}} very often come up here," [...] {{one of the}} sailors said. [...] "Sometimes she is months between her visits. As likely as not, {{she may have been}} {{captured}} on her way down. Her port is Bordeaux and, if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> her, <b>you</b> had much better have gone straight there than come to this place." ...|$|R
2500|$|On CBS Sunday Morning in December 2006, he said, [...] "You know, the cup {{is there}} to be filled... with {{whatever}} you want to fill it with. For those people looking for Cat Stevens, they'll probably find him in this record. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> [...] Islam, go a bit deeper, you'll find him." [...] He has since described the album as being [...] "over-produced" [...] and refers to An Other Cup as being a necessary hurdle he had to overcome before he could release his new album, Roadsinger.|$|E
2500|$|Fifty years earlier, in an {{open the}} flap book titled See the Circus, {{published}} January 1, 1956, H. A. Rey illustrated a man who {{looks very much like}} the Man with the Yellow Hat, wearing a blue and white polka dotted kerchief. The caption for the page reads, [...] "Ted has a tricycle, so very small, He cannot ride it, because he's so tall. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out WHO the rider will be, Just open the flap, and then you will see." [...] Opening the flap reveals two monkeys riding a tricycle.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{regard the}} protagonists in Beckett's novel Mercier and Camier as prototypes of Vladimir and Estragon. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the origins of}} Godot," [...] he told Colin Duckworth once, [...] "look at Murphy." [...] Here we see the agonised protagonist yearning for self-knowledge, or at least {{complete}} freedom of thought at any cost, and the dichotomy and interaction of mind and body. Mercier and Camier wander aimlessly about a boggy, rain-soaked island that, although not explicitly named, is Beckett's native Ireland. They speak convoluted dialogues similar to Vladimir and Estragon's, joke about the weather and chat in pubs, while the purpose of their odyssey is never made clear. The waiting in Godot is the wandering of the novel. [...] "There are large chunks of dialogue which he later transferred directly into Godot." ...|$|E

5000|$|Chuck Taylor was an {{exceptional}} representative for Converse. Joe Dean, {{who worked as}} a sales executive for Converse for nearly 30 years before becoming the athletic director at Louisiana State University, told Bob Ford of The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "It was impossible not to like him, and he knew everybody. If you were a coach and <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a job, <b>you</b> called Chuck Taylor. Athletic directors talked to him all the time when {{they were looking for a}} coach." ...|$|R
2500|$|At NYC Media Group (since rebranded as NYC Media), Wierson was vocal {{critic of}} {{traditional}} public broadcasting for second-tier [...] stations in heavily saturated markets like New York City. In 2005, Wierson disbanded the station's long-held PBS status, enabling NYC TV's original shows {{to take over}} prime-time [...] "It was smart {{not to be the}} 'fifth channel,' said Dalton Delan, executive vice president of WETA in Washington and producer of the PBS News Hour. You don't want to be the triple-A team. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a new ballpark where you can be No. 1." [...] In August 2006, Wierson, Unger and Bloomberg appeared in the NBC studios, joined WNBC General Manager Francis X. Comerford and former NBC Station Group President Jay Ireland in announcing a partnership between NYC TV and NBC flagship station WNBC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who began Bloomberg Television as part of his media empire, knew better than most the value of a city television station, his aides said." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Rogers won a Grammy Award for [...] "Best Country Collaboration with Vocals" [...] with Ronnie Milsap— [...] "Make No Mistake, She's Mine." [...] In the 1990s Rogers {{continued}} to chart with singles such as [...] "The Factory" [...] and [...] "Crazy In Love," [...] another selection that Kim Carnes provided him with, [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Find</b> Love," [...] and [...] "The Greatest." [...] His second Christmas album, titled Christmas in America, {{was released in}} 1989 for Reprise Records. From 1991–94, Rogers hosted The Real West on A, and on The History Channel since 1995 (Reruns only on The History Channel). He visited Miller's during this time period. From 1992–95, Rogers co-owned and headlined Branson, Missouri's 4,000 seat Grand Palace Theatre. In 1994, Rogers released his [...] "dream" [...] album titled Timepiece on Atlantic Records. It consisted of 1930s/1940s jazz standards, the type of music he had performed in his early days with The Bobby Doyle Three in Houston.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of {{the plot}} were also mixed. IGN's Dave Zydrko thought the story was [...] "good enough <b>to</b> keep <b>you</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out more." [...] AllGame's J.C. Barnes was less impressed, writing [...] "while there are hints of talent behind some of the story elements, {{there needs to be}} more {{emphasis}} on creative, original storytelling if Dark Cloud is going to become a franchise capable of going head to head with The Legend of Zelda." [...] Game Revolution's Johnny Liu called the plot and characters [...] "ho-hum." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The road is as open {{to you as}} to me," [...] said Birch, {{turning from}} him in ill-concealed disgust. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the refugees, you know well where they lay." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{shook his}} hair {{from his eyes}} {{to look at him}} for a moment, and then, {{twisting}} round his legs and wrestling with him, broke again into his repetition of [...] "You let me go, will <b>you?</b> I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the woman." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{tetrahedron}} {{of state}} is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The image to the right shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the f(t) and then integrate it to get q(t). More examples of equations can be seen below.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are in a}} museum. The {{figures in}} the cases are {{specimens}} like yourself.

6000|$|... "I know it," [...] said Mary. [...] "And you've {{been very}} foolish.

6000|$|... "Riddough's Hotel?"

5000|$|One final {{assumption}} {{worth mentioning}} {{is the assumption}} of pure insertion in fMRI. The assumption of pure insertion {{is the assumption that}} a single cognitive process can be inserted into another set of cognitive process without effecting the functioning of the rest. For example, if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the reading comprehension area of the brain, you might scan participants while they were presented with a word and while they were presented with a non-word (e.g. [...] "Floob"). If you infer that the resulting difference in brain pattern represents the regions of the brain involved in reading comprehension, you have assumed that these changes are not reflective of changes in task difficulty or differential recruitment between tasks. The term pure insertion was coined by Donders as a criticism of reaction time methods.|$|R
