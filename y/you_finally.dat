500|$|A reader's choice poll {{organized}} by GameSpot placed Sephiroth {{as the best}} boss of all time, as he received five times more votes than Bowser, who finished in second place; most of the comments noted {{the difficulty of the}} final fight against Sephiroth, as well as its distinctive elements when compared to other games. In 2005, Electronic Gaming Monthly listed him as number one in their list of top video game bosses. Game Informer ranked the [...] "top-notch" [...] fight against Sephiroth in Final Fantasy VII at third place on their 2008 list of top boss battles. PlayStation Official Magazine included him on their 2012 list of ten best boss fights ever, commenting that [...] "after potentially 100 hours of chasing the murdering swine, <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> catch up with Cloud’s nemesis Sephiroth, and it’s one of the most epic battles in PlayStation history." ...|$|E

500|$|Tom Robinson is {{the chief}} example among several innocents {{destroyed}} carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel. However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: [...] "Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does {{in the beginning of}} the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'—that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished." [...] The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, [...] "when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things... Atticus, he was real nice," [...] to which he responds, [...] "Most people are, Scout, when <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> see them." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that you can get a little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the second}} season premiere aired in September 2009, co-creator J.R. Orci hinted that the {{audience}} was going to meet [...] "many Observers", {{and that in the}} season's eighth episode, [...] "You're going to find out their role in the world, what they're named after, and their connection to some of these characters." [...] Later on, when still leading up to the airing of [...] "August" [...] in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that [...] "Individuality {{will be one of the}} things that they will be fanatically struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a year. <b>You</b> <b>finally</b> get to open the toy box and really play with those toys". Actor Michael Cerveris, who plays September, commented in an interview that as a result of the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers [...] "are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that [...] "it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once".|$|E

[...] The Nashville, Tennessee native said he was ready to make a return to music, whether a part of G-Unit or not. Young Buck's last album was the 2010 independent release, The Rehab. The negotiations may not lead to a new deal between Young Buck and G-Unit, but the rapper remains optimistic.|$|E
2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. I was there for awhile, and at that moment in time, when <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good.

2500|$|Indiana players wear {{warm-up pants}} that are striped red and white, like the stripes of a candy cane. They were first {{worn by the}} team in the 1970s under head coach Bob Knight. At {{the time they were}} in keeping with the fashion trends of the 1970s, but despite {{changing}} styles they have since become an iconic part of playing for Indiana. IU star guard Steve Alford said, [...] "As you watch television and you watch the IU games, that's the first thing you saw, was the team run out in the candy stripes. So when <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> got to put those on, those are pretty special." [...] Rusty Stillions, Director of Indiana's Equipment Operations, said the pants were originally available only for team members. However, changes in licensing agreements permitted the general public to buy them as well. They have since become a staple at games and other Indiana basketball events. Beginning in 2014, during Hoosier Hysteria, former IU basketball players have presented to the new players their first pair of candy striped pants. This practice symbolizes a [...] "passing-of-the-torch" [...] and carrying on the rich tradition and responsibilities of playing for Indiana University.|$|E

2500|$|Since its release, {{the first}} X-COM has often {{appeared}} in top video game lists by various publications. Computer Gaming World (CGW) ranked {{it as the}} 22nd (1996) and third (2001) best computer game of all time; the magazine's readers also voted it for tenth place in 2001. It was ranked as the 26th top game of all time by Next Generation in 1996 ("breathed new live into turn-based strategy genre"), the 35th best video game of all time by GameSpy in 2001 ("stellar game design can withstand the test of time"), as the second best video game since 1992 by Finnish magazine Pelit in 2007, and as the 78th best video game [...] "to play today" [...] by Edge in 2009. Polish web portal Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 13th best Amiga game, {{as well as the}} third most addictive game [...] "that stole our childhood"; it was also retrospectively ranked as the eight best Amiga game by the Polish edition of CHIP. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun listed it as their 6th [...] "Best Strategy Games Ever Made" [...] ("in the thick of a terror mission, with chrysalids seeming to pour out of the walls, or in those last hours when <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> seem capable of taking the fight to the aliens, there’s nothing else quite like X-COM") ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage's fight {{style in}} the series was called [...] "smack-fu" [...] by Coker, {{referring}} {{to the way he}} tried not to punch anybody since that would probably kill them with his super strength. To film the effect of bullets bouncing off of Cage, remote controlled devices were attached to Colter and operated by somebody behind the cameras. The devices had the ability to [...] "burn the skin if not attached properly to clothing, and [...] once almost lost hearing in one ear when he forgot to insert the required ear pieces." [...] The third episode begins with a couch coming out of the window of the fictional Crispus Attucks complex in Harlem. This was a tease of a large fight scene shown in full later in the episode, on which Coker said, [...] "You're already anticipating what's going to happen, so when <b>you</b> <b>finally</b> do get to that moment and then the music kicks in, it takes on this new energy." [...] The fight itself is the series' version of the 'superhero hallway fight' made famous in Daredevil, with Coker explaining, [...] "We wanted to do something that, while in the same realm, was its own thing ... That's what this whole show is about, ultimately, being able to do the superhero thing with flavor." [...] Filming for the fight was influenced by [...] "Arnold Schwarzenegger’s invading the police station in Terminator", {{and was one of the}} toughest sequences for the crew to shoot; it took a 14-hour day, and Colter attributed the successful completion of the sequence, including the couch shot, to director Guillermo Navarro. Colter also called the fourth episode particularly difficult to film, taking around 12 or 13 days to shoot. The episode was written by executive producer Charles Murray, [...] "a geek bar none" [...] who looked to organically transition the character's origin story from the original comics into the modern world of the series for the episode. This involved flashback sequences with Colter in makeup and different costumes, and each scene was shot by director Vincenzo Natali in many camera setups.|$|E
