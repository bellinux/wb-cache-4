500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side of my bed.

The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass."

500|$|There is some {{evidence}} that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion {{at the end of the}} tenth century.

500|$|The Pickford {{brothers}} {{included a}} couple of easter egg references. One of them revolved around {{the name of one}} of the tavern keepers, Newton N. Ridley, which is a play off the brewery Newton and Ridley from the British soap opera Coronation Street. Another easter egg reference was made to Dragon Warrior with regards to the princesses Kuros must save during the game. Upon saving a princess, she asks Kuros to marry her, prompting a yes/no response for the player; if the player selects [...] "no", the princess responds with [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>refuse,</b> my heart will surely break!" [...] and prompts the yes/no response again - similar to the [...] "but thou must" [...] response in Dragon Warrior. In addition, as all three princesses will have committed to marrying all three forms of Kuros, the original plan for the game's ending was for the three princesses to come together and see their heroes whom they were going to marry, only to find out all three princesses promised to marry the same person. To rectify the situation, Pickford called for what he referred to as [...] "the ultimate cheapo cop-out", where a UFO abducts Kuros with a teleport beam, sending him into the future and setting the stage for the next sequel which would have been called Lasersword. However, this never came to be.|$|E

[...] Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke, receiving their own bishop, Henry of Lund (also known as [...] "the Fat"), who was appointed sometime prior to 1035. The greatest source of Scottish influence after the appointment of the Scottish earls in the 13th century was probably through the church, although {{it is clear that}} Scots influence on the culture of Orkney and Shetland was fairly limited until the close of the 14th century or later. An influx of Scottish entrepreneurs helped to create a diverse and independent community that included farmers, fishermen and merchants that called themselves Communitas Orchadensis and who proved themselves increasingly able to defend their rights against their feudal overlords, be they Norwegian or Scots. This independence of mind may have been fostered by the influence of Norwegian government which was essentially communal and federal by contrast with Scotland. It was not until the mid 16th century that the Norse institutions were replaced by Scottish systems following large-scale immigration from the south [...] and the islanders were probably bi-lingual until the 17th century.|$|E

500|$|While the {{official}} conversion of Scandinavian Scotland {{took place at}} the end of the tenth century, there is evidence that Christianity had already made inroads into the Viking controlled Highland and Islands. There are a large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a [...] "hermit's" [...] or [...] "priest's isle" [...] from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that Christianity had begun to spread before {{the official}} conversion. According to the Orkneyinga Saga, not written down until around 1230, the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson, king of Norway, in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the local jarl Sigurd the Stout and said [...] "I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If <b>you</b> <b>refuse,</b> I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel". The story may be apocryphal, but the islands became officially Christian, receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. The bishopric appears to have been under the authority of the Archbishops of York and of Hamburg-Bremen at different points before the twelfth century and from then until 1472 it was subordinate to the Archbishop of Nidaros (today's Trondheim). Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century, followed by a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079. One of the major effects of the conversion of the Vikings was to bring an end to plundering raids on Christian sites, which may have allowed them to recover some of their status as cultural and intellectual centres. It also probably curbed the excesses of Viking violence and led to a more settled society in northern Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|Australian Major General Jim Molan (retired), {{who served}} as chief of {{operations}} of the Iraq multinational force in 2004–05, stated that [...] "The Goldstone report is an opinion by one group of people putting forward their judgments, with limited access to the facts, and reflecting their own prejudices. The difference in tone and attitude in the report when discussing Israeli and Hamas actions is surprising." ... "as a soldier who has run a war against an opponent not dissimilar to Hamas, facing problems perhaps similar to those faced by Israeli commanders, my sympathies tend to lie with the Israelis." ... "But having stated my prejudice, I think I may be more honest than Goldstone, who seems to pass off his prejudices in a report that cannot be based on fact, and uses judicial language and credibility to do so. It comes down to equality of scepticism: if <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> to believe anything the Israelis say, then {{you have no right}} to unquestioningly accept what Hamas says." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, 22-year-old Melinda Duckett {{committed}} suicide following an interview conducted by Grace concerning {{the disappearance of}} Duckett's 2-year-old son Trenton.

2500|$|The Islamic prophet, Muhammad's first {{interaction}} {{with the people of}} Egypt occurred in 628, during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma).

But if <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> to do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi was attacked, Muhammad sent Zayd ibn Haritha to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched Zayd ibn Haritha with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and 100 women and boys. The new chief of the Banu Judham who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} [...] "and it bred worms and rotted" [...] in [...] a Midrash asked whether {{anything}} exists that first produces worms and then rots (implying that surely, rot precedes worms). Answering in the negative, the Midrash taught that God wished to reveal to people the deeds {{of those who}} disobeyed and saved the manna, so God caused many worms to breed during that night so that the sinners should {{not be able to}} smell the staleness of the manna in the evening and throw it out. The Midrash told that Moses became so angry with them that he forgot to tell them to gather two omers for each person on the sixth day. So when they went out and gathered on the sixth day and found a double portion, the princes told Moses, as [...] reports, [...] "And all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses." [...] The Midrash noted that Moses told them (in [...] ), [...] "This is that which the Lord has spoken," [...] not [...] "which I have spoken," [...] because Moses had forgotten. For this reason, the Midrash taught, in [...] God asked, [...] "How long will <b>you</b> <b>refuse</b> to keep My commandments and My laws?"

2500|$|The United States Senate finally {{ratified}} the Treaty of Payne's Landing in April 1834. The treaty {{had given the}} Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 {{to talk to them}} about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, [...] "the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead." [...] General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, [...] "Should <b>you</b> ... <b>refuse</b> to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force." [...] The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move {{until the end of the}} year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.|$|E
