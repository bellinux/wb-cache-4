5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Bellaire's {{population}} had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population {{explosion in the}} post-World War II building boom. On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marion High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished {{to make way for}} the right of way of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman played shortstop collegiately at the University of Arizona and {{was drafted}} in the 11th round by the Cincinnati Reds. After not having much success batting, Hoffman was {{converted}} to a pitcher, as {{he was able to}} throw up to 95miles per hour (mph). The Marlins acquired him in the 1992 expansion draft, and he pitched in Florida until he was traded to the Padres mid-season in 1993 in a deal that sent star Gary Sheffield to the Marlins. Hoffman recorded 20 saves in 1994 in his first season as Padres closer, and in the following years, he became the face of the franchise after Tony Gwynn retired. He collected at least 30saves each <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 14years, except for 2003 when he missed most of the year recovering from shoulder surgery. After San Diego did not re-sign him following the 2008 season, Hoffman pitched for two years with the Brewers before retiring after the 2010 season.|$|E

5|$|Roma's {{difficult}} {{start to}} the 2008–09 season and continued struggles {{at the start of}} the 2009–10 season saw Spalletti resign after his four-year reign and he was replaced by Claudio Ranieri. Totti performed well in the inaugural UEFA Europa League; he scored two hat-tricks in the competition that season, first in a 7–1 away win against Gent in the third qualifying round and then another in the same scoreline against MFK Košice at the Stadio Olimpico in the play-off round. In Serie A, he also scored three goals against Bari on 22 November 2009, seven years on from his last hat-trick in Serie A. Eight days later, Totti confirmed he had signed a new five-year playing contract which would see him at the club until 2014, after which he stated he would become a club director for a further five years. Roma offered him an annual salary of €8.9million for 2009–10 and €8.6million a <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> four seasons.|$|E
5|$|In {{their native}} habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor {{importance}} as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, {{compared with other}} pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not {{play a part in}} the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of infesting healthy trees. They thus mostly act as saprobiontics. Pine monocultures in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex woodwasp (Sirex noctilio), which was introduced there and which is associated with A.areolatum. The wasp's phytotoxic secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80%. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S.noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s (decade); in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex–Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $254 million per <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 20 years.|$|E
