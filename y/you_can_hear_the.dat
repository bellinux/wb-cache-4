Despite King's statement, [...] "Eyes of the Insane" [...] won Slayer their first Grammy award. The Slayer guitarist has also stated; [...] "I like playing 'Jihad' because I'm back changing my guitars, and Jeff starts it and he starts it quietly so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> fans go crazy about it and you can't always hear that {{at the beginning of}} a song." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{episode of}} The Simpsons {{featured}} multiple references to animation and Hollywood. Pixar is referenced in the episode as [...] "Mixar". In the 1999 {{era of the}} studio <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> song [...] "Bye Bye Bye" [...] by NSYNC. The short film Condiments serves as a parody of the Pixar film Toy Story, and the song [...] "You've Got an Enemy" [...] (sung by Castellaneta impersonating Randy Newman) references [...] "You've Got a Friend in Me". Willis and Crumble parodies Wallace and Gromit, and uses the same style of stop-motion animation. Nick Park, the creator of Wallace and Gromit, has a voice cameo as himself. Multiple other short film fragments further lampooned other movies including The Triplets of Belleville and Persepolis. The episode also references Ricky Gervais's controversial hosting stunt at the 68th Golden Globe Awards, with a sign featuring {{a picture of him}} alongside a caption reading [...] "Do Not Allow This Man To Host".|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E

During his acceptance speech he reflected on the important influence of traditional European music and the melancholy of the Swedish soul on ABBA's brand of pop music. [...] "If {{you live in a}} country like Sweden, with five, six months of snow, and the sun disappears totally for like two months, that would be reflected in the work of artists," [...] he said. [...] "It's definitely in the Swedish folk music, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it in <b>the</b> Russian folk songs, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> in <b>the</b> music from Jean Sibelius or Edvard Grieg from Norway, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see it in the eyes of Greta Garbo and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> it in <b>the</b> voice of Jussi Björling.

500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I have been reading some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, I wrote this song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E
500|$|Lamb of God's Chris Adler said: [...] "If {{anybody who}} plays heavy metal {{says that they}} weren't {{influenced}} by Black Sabbath's music, then I think that they're lying to you. I think all heavy metal music was, in some way, influenced by what Black Sabbath did." [...] Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford commented: [...] "They were and still are a groundbreaking band..you can put on the first Black Sabbath album and it still sounds as fresh today as it did 30-odd years ago. And that's because great music has a timeless ability: To me, Sabbath {{are in the same}} league as the Beatles or Mozart. They're on the leading edge of something extraordinary." [...] On Black Sabbath's standing, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello states: [...] "The heaviest, scariest, coolest riffs and the apocalyptic Ozzy wail are without peer. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> despair and menace of the working-class Birmingham streets they came from in every kick-ass, evil groove. Their arrival ground hippy, flower-power psychedelia to a pulp and set the standard for all heavy bands to come." [...] Phil Anselmo of Pantera and Down stated that [...] "Only a fool would leave out what Black Sabbath brought to the heavy metal genre".|$|E
500|$|Davis {{played his}} trumpet sparsely {{throughout}} the concert, often sounding {{obscured by the}} rhythm section. His presence on Agharta reflected what John Szwed called [...] "the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death". Drawing on Theodor W. Adorno's commentary of Ludwig van Beethoven's late works, Szwed said [...] "the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all {{that he had been}} witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful." [...] After Lucas' first and only solo of the show climaxed the [...] "Ife" [...] segment, Davis introduced [...] "Wili (= For Dave)" [...] with a few organ chords, culminating in Cosey's final solo and a trumpet passage by Davis, which Paul Tingen characterized as plaintive and introspective. According to him, live music shows typically developed toward reaching a final climax, but Davis' concerts [...] "often dissolved into entropy". On Agharta, Tingen said, a [...] "deep sadness" [...] hung over the music as the energy of the [...] "Wili (= For Dave)" [...] piece [...] "slowly drained away" [...] to the record's fade out. The Japanese CD edition ended with nine more minutes of atmospheric feedback, percussion, and synthesizer sounds. Tingen wrote that {{by the time of the}} second concert, the band's level of energy had diminished significantly, and Davis sounded particularly absent. As Mtume recalled, [...] "he became ill in the evening, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> difference in the energy." ...|$|E

500|$|Since its release, Mulholland Drive has, {{according}} to film scholars Jay R. Letzner and Donald R. Ross, [...] "garnered both {{some of the}} harshest epithets {{and some of the}} most lavish praise in recent cinematic history". It received acclaim from many critics; even Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who had up til that point been primarily dismissive of Lynch's work, awarded the film four stars and commented, [...] "David Lynch has been working toward Mulholland Drive all of his career, and now that he's arrived there I forgive him for Wild at Heart (1990) and even Lost Highway (1997). At last his experiment doesn't shatter the test tubes. The movie is a surrealist dreamscape {{in the form of a}} Hollywood film noir, and the less sense it makes, the more we can't stop watching it." [...] Ebert subsequently added Mulholland Drive to his [...] "Great Films" [...] list in November 2012. In The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote that the film [...] "ranks alongside Fellini's 8½ and other auteurist fantasias as a monumental self-reflection" [...] and added, [...] "Looked at lightly, it is the grandest and silliest cinematic carnival to come along in quite some time: a lurching journey through one filmmaker's personal fun house. On a more serious level, its investigation into the power of movies pierces a void from which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> screams of a ravenous demon whose appetites can never be slaked." [...] Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle called it [...] "exhilarating... for its dreamlike images and fierce, frequently reckless imagination" [...] and added, [...] "there's a mesmerizing quality to its languid pace, its sense of foreboding and its lost-in-time atmosphere... it holds us, spellbound and amused, for all of its loony and luscious, exasperating 146minutes [...] proves that Lynch is in solid form—and still an expert at pricking our nerves." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some authors {{started using}} metaphors: Dawn for Socialism, Spring for Revolution, Vampire for Policeman, etc., which {{made some of}} the works unintentionally poetic, {{something}} that is today remembered with some nostalgia (even today, specially {{in some of the}} smaller newspapers, we can find an overly elaborated prose in everyday subjects). David Mourão Ferreira wrote in the poem that was later sung by Amália Rodrigues as [...] "Fado de Peniche", [...] "At least <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> wind! - At least <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> sea!", in a reference to the political prisoners held in the Forte de Peniche (Peniche fortress), not to the fishermen of the town (fisheries and fish canning have been the most important activity in Peniche for decades).

A movement to preserve iconic gasometers across Britain has emerged in recent years with the one visible from The Oval often cited as a landmark example.

2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790).
