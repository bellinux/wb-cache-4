500|$|The {{starting}} point for analysing ouster clauses and their effects is the landmark decision Anisminic Ltd. v. Foreign Compensation Commission (1968). In that case, the House of Lords is regarded as having abolished the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law when it was considering the effect of an ouster clause. In Anisminic, their Lordships were faced with a provision which stated that [...] "the determination by the Commission of any application made to them under this Act shall not be called in question in any court of law". In his judgment, Lord Reid differentiated between the arguments put forth by the parties. He held that while the respondents had argued that the provision clearly denied the court the ability to question the determination made by the Foreign Compensation Commission, the question at hand did not even involve the questioning of the purported determination and instead focused on whether there {{was in fact a}} valid determination. He pointed out that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>seek</b> to show that a determination is a nullity you are not questioning the purported determination– you are maintaining that it does not exist as a determination". He then held it was a well-established principle that a provision ousting the ordinary jurisdiction of the court must be construed strictly– if such a provision is reasonably capable of having two meanings, the meaning which preserves the ordinary jurisdiction of the court should be taken. If Parliament had intended to introduce a new kind of ouster clause that would protect such nullities from being questioned, better drafting of the provision would be required.|$|E

500|$|The Lord Protector, in his proclamations, {{appealed to}} the common people. To his colleagues, whom he hardly consulted, he {{displayed}} a distinctly autocratic and [...] "increasingly contemptuous" [...] face. By autumn 1549 the same councillors who had made him Protector were convinced that {{he had failed to}} exercise proper authority and was unwilling to listen to good counsel. Dudley still had the troops from the Norfolk campaign at his disposal, and in October 1549 he joined the Earl of Southampton and the Earl of Arundel, prominent religious conservatives, to lead a coup of councillors to oust the Protector from office. They withdrew from court to London, meeting in Dudley's residence. Starting with the Protector, each side issued proclamations accusing the other of treason and declared to act in defence of the King's safety. Somerset tried in vain to raise a popular force and entrenched himself with the King at the fortress Windsor Castle. Military force near King Edward's presence was unthinkable and, apparently, Dudley and Archbishop Cranmer brokered an unofficial deal with Somerset, who surrendered. To keep appearances, the 12-year-old King personally commanded his uncle's arrest. For a moment there was hope of a conservative restoration in some quarters. However, Dudley and Cranmer secured the Reformed agenda by persuading Edward to appoint additional Reformed-minded members to the Council and Privy Chamber. In December 1549 Southampton tried to regain predominance by charging Dudley with treason, alongside Somerset, for having been an original ally of the Protector. The scheme misfired when Dudley invited the Council to his house and baffled the plotters by exclaiming, with his hand at his sword and [...] "a warlike visage": [...] "my lord, <b>you</b> <b>seek</b> his [...] blood and he that seeketh his blood would have mine also".|$|E
500|$|However, {{despite these}} {{occasional}} supply ships, the French garrison was rapidly {{running out of}} food. To conserve resources, the French forced the civilian population out of the city; the civilian population dropped from 45,000 in 1799 to 9,000 by 1800. Nelson himself took nominal command of the blockade, while Ball was made president of the Maltese National Congress. As liaison between the Maltese military and civilian commanders, he directed the distribution of supplies to the Maltese population, which was beginning to suffer from disease brought about by food shortages. He was replaced on Alexander by his first lieutenant, William Harrington. On 1 November Nelson again offered terms of surrender to Vaubois, and was again rebuffed, with the reply [...] "Jaloux de mériter l'estime de votre nation, comme vous recherchez celle de la nôtre, nous sommes résolus défendre cette fortresse jusqu'à l'extrémité" [...] ("Keen to deserve the esteem your nation, as <b>you</b> <b>seek</b> that of ours, we are resolved to defend this fortress until the end"). By this point, Nelson was conducting the blockade at a distance, based at the Neapolitan court in Palermo. There he indulged in gambling and social engagements, becoming {{closer and closer to}} Emma, Lady Hamilton, wife of the ambassador Sir William Hamilton. His behaviour was heavily criticised, not just by his commanding officer Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, who had recently replaced Earl St Vincent, but also by old friends such as Thomas Troubridge, who wrote to him [...] "If you knew what your friends feel for you I am sure you would cut out all the nocturnal parties [...] [...] [...] I beseech your Lordship, leave off". In December 1799, Erskine was replaced by Lieutenant-General Henry Edward Fox, who immediately redistributed 800 troops from the garrison at Messina to Malta under Brigadier-General Thomas Graham. These troops filled the gap left by the withdrawal of Portuguese forces, which had been ordered to return to Lisbon. Disease began to spread within the city as rations became scarcer. The arrival of an aviso in January 1800 with the news of the events of 18 Brumaire that made Bonaparte First Consul of France prompted a brief respite and a public statement from Vaubois that the city would never be surrendered, although conditions continued to deteriorate.|$|E
