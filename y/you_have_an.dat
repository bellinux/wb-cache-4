25|$|Isothermal - This model {{assumes that}} the {{compressed}} gas remains at a constant temperature throughout the compression or expansion process. In this cycle, internal energy {{is removed from the}} system as heat at the same rate that it is added by the mechanical work of compression. Isothermal compression or expansion more closely models real life when the compressor has a large heat exchanging surface, a small gas volume, or a long time scale (i.e., a small power level). Compressors that utilize inter-stage cooling between compression stages come closest to achieving perfect isothermal compression. However, with practical devices perfect isothermal compression is not attainable. For example, unless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> infinite number of compression stages with corresponding intercoolers, you will never achieve perfect isothermal compression.|$|E

25|$|In a {{time when}} defense was defined as “an individual's effort to stop or stymie the {{opposing}} team's counterpart”, Toyota's playing style {{was considered one of}} the most glamorous and worthy to watch. With team defense hardly known back then, Toyota was a typical run-and-gun team that depended heavily on their rebounding prowess. Hence, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Andrew Fields, Bruce King, John Irving, Abe King, Ramon Fernandez and even a Bobby Jaworski collaring the rebounds, the most common (and very entertaining) spectacle was to see a baseball pass by the rebounder to a streaking player on the break for an easy twinner. Notables among the recipients of the baseball pass over the years in the Toyota lineup included Segura, Cortez, Tuadles, Arnaiz, and Legaspi. In the halfcourt, it was not uncommon to see a similar play that Fernandez and Jaworski employed in the recent Crispa-Toyota reunion game where Fernandez would post up, Jaworski would stay at the top of the arc and wait for Fernandez to be double-teamed. Once the double team is consummated, Jaworski either waits at the 3 point line or makes a straight cut in the middle of the lanes waiting for the blind pass of Fernandez for an easy two. Another common sight was to see Jaworski mapping out the play, cuts in the middle and makes the interior defense commit to him. He then throws a behind-the-back blind pass to cutting slotmen like Fernandez or King for an easy layup or throws it back to good buddy Arnaiz for a long range bomb shot from the arc. Hence, it wasn't a surprise to see Jaworski, Arnaiz and Fernandez (in that order) being the first 3 PBA players to dish off 2,000 assists in their careers.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{earliest}} mainstream exposure came in {{the prime}} time sketch comedy program The Dana Carvey Show. While only lasting seven episodes in early 1996, it provided Colbert with roles that would help forge his future onscreen persona. This was largely due to its format of delivering sketch performances directly to the camera. Although they did not air, several sketches inspired by The Onion also had Colbert playing a deadpan anchor delivering the news. In an interview with The New York Times regarding The Dana Carvey Show, Colbert noted, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to give it right to the audience, there’s a special connection that you make {{by looking at the}} camera." ...|$|E

500|$|Writer Simon Moore {{finished}} his spec script for The Quick and the Dead in late 1992, writing it as a {{homage to the}} Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, particularly the Dollars Trilogy starring Clint Eastwood.

[...] "When you introduce women {{into that kind of}} world, something very interesting happens and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> interesting dynamic straight away," [...] Moore commented. The names of the lead villain (Herod) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible.

500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E

500|$|During development, Mahito Yokota, who was {{in charge}} of the musical direction, {{originally}} wanted Super Mario Galaxy to have a Latin American style of music; and even had composed 28 tracks in that style. Latin American percussion instruments had already been featured in previous Super Mario instalments, such as steelpans, bongo drums, and congas. For Super Mario Galaxys theme, Yokota used Latin American instruments and a synthesiser to replicate the sounds featured in old science fiction films. The composition was approved by Yoshiaki Koizumi, the game's director and designer, but when Yokota presented it to the game's sound supervisor, Koji Kondo, he stated that it was [...] "no good". When asked why his music was rejected, Kondo responded: [...] "if somewhere in your mind <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> image that Mario is cute, please get rid of it". Incensed by the rejection, Yokota almost resigned from his job, but Kondo implied that Mario's character was [...] "cool" [...] and instructed him to try again.|$|E
500|$|In England, Wenger {{has used}} his {{extensive}} {{knowledge of the}} European transfer market and rulings – particularly in his native France – to recruit players. His first purchase as Arsenal manager was Anelka from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000, a deal which upset the French club as they received little remuneration. The player's subsequent sale to Real Madrid just two years later for £23.5million highlighted Wenger's shrewdness in the transfer market. He remained in contact with Guillou's Abidjan-based academy, where he discovered future Arsenal players Touré and Emmanuel Eboué, and successfully persuaded Fàbregas and Hector Bellerín, amongst other La Masia graduates, to leave Barcelona and join him. Wenger's recruitment of young players came under criticism from Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who disputed it was tantamount to child trafficking. Wenger refuted the analogy and said: [...] "Look at Santa Cruz at Blackburn. Ask him what age he came to Bayern Munich. Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> answer for Rummenigge." ...|$|E

Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> artist that will make it look great.

Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own?

500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets you know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opening and when to run".|$|E
