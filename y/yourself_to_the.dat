500|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1980s, Hill had {{remained}} a traditionalist, but after her 1986 trip to Europe, she started adopting many sport climbing techniques. For instance, she had resisted hang-dogging (hanging {{on the rope}} at any point during the climb), holding with the philosophy that it was cheating, but after experimenting with it during her ascent of Vandals, she found it a useful way to learn challenging climbs. During the mid-1980s, there was great tension in the climbing community between traditionalists and new sport climbers. There was even a [...] "Great Debate" [...] in 1986 at the American Alpine Club at which a panel of all-star participants—including Hill—were invited to discuss {{the merits of the}} two different styles, especially sport climbing that required the insertion of fixed bolts into the rock. Hill has argued that [...] "the purpose of climbing is to adapt <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rock. You work on yourself to overcome the obstacle of the rock... I believe climbers should leave the rock as unaltered as possible... you have a responsibility not only to put in safe bolts but to put them in logical places—to do the least possible alteration of the rock to establish the best possible experience for others".|$|E

Scott [...] had a daily routine of walking along the beach until an idea came into his head and he would then turn round and develop it on the way home." [...] Demo versions of the songs were subsequently recorded by Scott during his stay in Crail.|$|E

2500|$|The Man Who Fell in Love {{with the}} Moon {{is a book}} in the [...] "dangerous writing" [...] style of fiction {{actively}} promoted by author Tom Spanbauer. According to Spanbauer, this is a style of writing which is deeply personal and which directly addresses issues difficult to confront for the author. [...] He explains: [...] "Dangerous writing means putting a piece of yourself in a work, going to the 'sore spot,' and discussing taboo topics, particularly sex and violence. It means writing for yourself, a concept that in the literary world was thought to make you go broke. It means exposing <b>yourself</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tiger, not physically, but mentally." [...] The book also features a writing style Spanbauer calls [...] "going on the body". [...] As author Chuck Palahniuk, a student of Spanbauer's, has explained: [...] "Story can be a succession of tasty, smelly, touchable details. What Tom Spanbauer and Gordon Lish call 'going on the body,' to give the reader a sympathetic physical reaction, to involve the reader on a gut level." ...|$|E
