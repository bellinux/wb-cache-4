2500|$|To reach Liebenberg from Vienna, Chamberlain had {{to first}} {{take the train}} to Berlin, and then board another train to Liebenberg. Chamberlain's meeting with the Kaiser was {{considered}} so important that when Chamberlain reached Berlin, he was met by the Chancellor Prince Bernhard von Bülow, who joined him on the trip to Liebenberg. During the train ride, Bülow and Chamberlain had a long discussion about The Foundations and then French literature. Upon reaching the gates of Liebenberg in the evening, Chamberlain and Bülow were met by Wilhelm and Eulenburg who were surrounded by servants carrying torches. [...] When he met Chamberlain for the first time, Wilhelm told him: [...] "I thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done for Germany!". The next day, Eulenburg wrote to a friend that the Emperor [...] "stood completely {{under the spell of}} this man , whom he understood better {{than any of the other}} guests because of his thorough study of The Foundations".|$|E
2500|$|Tudor Wilkinson, {{as far as}} is known, was not detained. After the war, the American Office of Strategic Services Art Looting Investigation Unit {{wrote that}} he kept a watch on the Paris art market for Sepp Angerer, Hermann Göring's art agent, and that Dolores had been {{released}} from Vittel after Göring made a personal visit to the Wilkinsons' apartment. In his life of Göring, David Irving wrote that the visit took place in 1940, and that Wilkinson wrote to Göring a year later {{to thank him for}} interceding, and telling him that he should keep a painting of Juliana von Stolberg that he had admired in their apartment: [...] "We both agreed that we wanted you to have 'Juliana' always, to thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> so modestly did for [...]" [...] In 1946, Tudor Wilkinson was placed on the OSS [...] "red flag" [...] list of people and organisations that were involved in the art trade under the Nazis, with the caveat that police reports indicated that he was active in the resistance.|$|E

2500|$|However, when he {{was asked}} by Cardinal Jean-Marie Villot if he {{accepted}} his election, Luciani replied, [...] "May God forgive <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done" [...] but accepted election. After his election, when Cardinal Sin paid him homage, the new pope said: [...] "You were a prophet, but my reign will be a short one". [...] On the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, protodeacon Cardinal Pericle Felici announced that the cardinals had elected His Eminence, Albino Cardinal Luciani, Patriarch of Venice as Pope John Paul I. The regnal name John Paul {{was the first time in}} papal history that a pope had chosen a double name. In a subsequent Angelus message the new pope explained that the double name was taken to gratefully honour his two immediate predecessors: John XXIII, who had named him a bishop, and Paul VI, who had named him Patriarch of Venice and Cardinal. He was also the first pope to designate himself [...] "the First" [...] with the name. [...] (Pope Francis, elected in 2013, also took a previously-unused papal name but explicitly refused to be called [...] "the First".) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cardinal}} electors {{were looking}} {{not for a}} Curial bureaucrat, but rather a warm, pastoral figure {{along the lines of}} Pope John XXIII. They also wanted an Italian, given the influential papal role in Italian politics. Among the papabili, or likely candidates to be elected pope, were Giuseppe Siri of Genoa, Corrado Ursi of Naples, and Giovanni Benelli of Florence. However, Benelli actually favoured Albino Luciani, the Patriarch of Venice, who was eventually elected as a candidate of compromise after four ballots; during the third ballot, Johannes Willebrands and António Ribeiro, who sat {{on either side of the}} Venetian patriarch, whispered words of encouragement to him as he continued to receive more votes. Jaime Sin told Luciani [...] "You will be the new pope". Luciani had previously said to his secretary that he would decline the papacy if elected, however after Jean-Marie Villot officially asked Luciani whether he accepted his election he humbly exclaimed, [...] "May God forgive <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done," [...] and accepted his election. In honor of his two immediate predecessors, he took John Paul as his regnal name. [...] After the election when Cardinal Sin paid him homage, the new pope said: [...] "You were a prophet, but my reign will be a short one".|$|E
