500|$|Nick Duerden of Q {{magazine}} {{remarked that}} Black Eye [...] "sounds {{like a cross}} between The Stooges and Courtney Love. And despite boasting the musical dexterity of Status Quo, it's a short, sharp shock that dispatches its venom with a tireless guile." [...] Similarly, critic Roy Wilkinson of Select compared some songs favourably to The Stooges and early-Siouxsie and the Banshees. However, he noted that the band [...] " [...] intent on falling short of PJ 's black-bordered presence. When was the last time <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Yeovil delta blues sound enlivened by such Carry On Riffing-isms as 'I've rocketed to Uranus' ('Nothing') and 'When the kids scream, there is a racket/You've got a magnificent packet' ('Too Famous')?" ...|$|E
500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including your partner at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the production, the {{creative}} styles of Anderson and Parrish came into conflict. Anderson remembered that on several occasions Kanter was called on to mediate: [...] " [...] both knew how important the picture was to our careers, and we both desperately {{wanted to be in the}} big time." [...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot. When Anderson reminded Parrish of his contractual responsibilities, the director announced to the cast and crew, [...] "Hell, <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> producer. If I don't shoot these scenes which I don't really want, don't need and will cut out anyway, I'll be in breach of contract. So what we'll do is shoot those scenes next!" [...] Anderson discussed how the production of Doppelgänger presented new challenges, explaining, [...] "I had worked for so many years employing directors to do what I told them... Suddenly I came up against a Hollywood movie director who didn't want to play and we ended up extremely bad friends." [...] In his 2002 biography, Anderson stated that his sole regret about the film [...] " [...] that I hired Bob Parrish in the first place." [...] Sylvia Anderson comments that Parrish's direction was [...] "uninspired. We had a lot of trouble getting what we wanted from him." ...|$|E

500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and you could see the flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E
2500|$|Maurice and Barry alone {{comprised}} the Bee Gees on the 1969 album Cucumber Castle during Robin's absence as a soloist. They sang the hit [...] "Don't Forget to Remember" [...] (which reached number {{two on the}} UK chart while Robin's first solo single, [...] "Saved By The Bell", also reached number two) and follow up singles; [...] "IOIO" [...] and [...] "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" [...] with Barry taking lead and Maurice providing harmony vocals, but the duo version of the group enjoyed dwindling success. A supergroup in 1969 called The Fut was formed at a Tin Tin session and they recorded [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>the</b> Word" [...] while Gibb was still a Bee Gee, and released later as a single, the band consisting of Gibb on vocals/bass/guitar, Steve Kipner and Steve Groves on vocals with Billy Lawrie also providing background vocals. [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>the</b> Word" [...] features Gibb impersonating John Lennon by singing the song, and the Beatles fans {{thought that it was}} the lost Beatles song which was not released. In 1985, Yoko Ono attempted to register the song as Lennon's composition.|$|E
2500|$|The {{present perfect}} has an {{iterative}} sense {{unique to the}} Galician-Portuguese language group. It denotes an action or a series of actions {{that began in the}} past and are expected to keep repeating in the future. For instance, the sentence Tenho tentado falar com ela would be translated to [...] "I have been trying to talk to her", not [...] "I have tried to talk to her". On the other hand, the correct translation of the question [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> latest news?" [...] is not *Tem ouvido a última notícia?, but Ouviu a última notícia?, since no repetition is implied.|$|E

2500|$|Gibb's {{influences}} were The Beatles, The Everly Brothers, Cliff Richard, Paul Anka and The Mills Brothers. According to Maurice {{himself when}} he was a young kid, he listened to The Beatles' early records. He was also influenced by Paul McCartney's bass guitar playing. Talking about the song [...] "Have <b>You</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>the</b> Word" [...] on which he played bass, [...] "We were just getting ready to do some tracks and we were just doing nothing and I was fartin' around on the bass. I was a big Paul freak. He was a great teacher for me".|$|E
