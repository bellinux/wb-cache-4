500|$|Reviewing {{the episode}} for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen said that Timicin {{served as an}} [...] "excellent foil" [...] for Lwaxana and made her [...] "seem less ridiculous". [...] The {{relationship}} between Lwaxana and Timicin [...] "has a believable core", {{even if it is}} [...] "broad and arguably rushed", writes Handlen. [...] "There are some powerful moments... and it's pleasant for once to see Lwaxana adding, rather than subtracting, from a storyline." [...] Handlen, however, criticizes the setup of Timicin's situation, as it reduced the characterization available to some of the Enterprise crew. In spite of its flaw, Handlen decides that [...] "the episode largely redeems itself by staying true to its main point: No matter how much time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>left,</b> it's never enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Wright had {{attended}} a lecture by Dr Frederick G.

2500|$|Around 1173, Peter went to England {{to take up}} a post {{as chief}} letter-writer for Richard of Dover, Becket's {{successor}} as Archbishop. He also entered the service of Henry II, acting as a diplomat in his negotiations with Louis VII of France and the Papacy. His arrival in England approximately coincided with the rupture of the ruling family and the eruption of civil strife all over the Angevin Empire, carefully fomented by the French monarchy. Peter wrote an open letter to the Queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, to [...] "deplore publicly and regretfully that, while you are a most prudent woman, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> your husband." [...] However, when in 1183 Henry the Young King died during the revolt against his father, Peter wrote to Eleanor a letter of reasoned consolation.|$|E
2500|$|However, all was {{not well}} within the group. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been {{completed}} in November 1985), and Marr {{was beginning to feel}} the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: I was extremely ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous. I was just drinking more than I could handle." [...] Meanwhile, Rourke was fired from the band in early 1986 due to his use of heroin. [...] He allegedly received notice of his dismissal via a Post-it note stuck to the windscreen of his car. It read, [...] "Andy – <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> the Smiths. Goodbye and good luck, Morrissey." [...] Morrissey himself, however, denies this.|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} The Audacity of Hope {{was derived from}} a sermon {{delivered}} by Obama's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright. Wright had attended a lecture by Dr. Frederick G. Sampson in Richmond, Virginia, in the late 1980s, on the G. F. Watts painting Hope, which inspired him to give a sermon in 1990 based {{on the subject of}} the painting - [...] "with her clothes in rags, her body scarred and bruised and bleeding, her harp all but destroyed and with only one string left, she had the audacity to make music and praise God ... To take the one string <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>left</b> and to have the audacity to hope... that's the real word God will have us hear from this passage and from Watt's painting." [...] Having attended Wright's sermon, Barack Obama later adapted Wright's phrase [...] "audacity to hope" [...] to [...] "audacity of hope" [...] which became the title for his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, and the title of his second book.|$|E
2500|$|Barry Commoner {{has criticized}} Ehrlich's 1970 {{statement}} that [...] "When {{you reach a}} point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself and your friends and enjoy what little time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>left.</b> That point for me is 1972." [...] Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book Famine 1975!. They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
