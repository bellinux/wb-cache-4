500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Annie Barrett {{opined that}} Stritch and Alda [...] "really made this episode great." [...] Meredith Blake, a {{contributor}} for the Los Angeles Times, opined that television Christmas episodes [...] "are a sitcom staple, but... they're also a risky proposition {{for a show}} like 30 Rock. Just how do <b>you</b> <b>maintain</b> the right balance between holiday cheer and year-round irreverence? It's a delicate formula, and on Thursday night 30 Rock got it just right. That is, they leaned toward the former, delivering a Christmas episode full of cynicism – but topped with just a sprinkle of sweetness." [...] In addition, Blake was complimentary toward Stritch's role on the show. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote that this episode of 30 Rock [...] "wasn't the best Christmas episode that [...] has had. Past episodes like 'Ludachristmas,' 'Christmas Special' and 'Secret Santa' were put together better and had more heart". Sassone noted that the problem with [...] "Christmas Attack Zone" [...] was Tracy's subplot [...] "as it wasn't very funny" [...] {{and the one that}} dragged the episode down.|$|E

The Washington Posts Sarah Godfrey classified [...] "Love a Woman" [...] {{as one of the}} best tracks on the album adding that [...] "The ballad, with its cheesy, delightful... R production, blasts the notion that MJB is all raw power and Beyoncé is all chilly technique — the women are both bold and great here, with a slight advantage going to Blige." [...] Becky Bain of the website Idolator commented that Garrett who served as a writer for the song [...] "clearly knows how to love a woman right". A writer of Rap-Up magazine noted that Blige and Beyoncé [...] "showcase their powerful pipes" [...] as they tell their men what they want from a relationship. Brooklyne Gipson of Black Entertainment Television {{wrote that the}} song was one of the most appealing on the album, further describing it as a [...] "breathtaking duet". Martyn Young of the website musicOMH described the song as [...] "a classy duet between two of contemporary RnB’s most striking voices". Siobhan Kane of the website Consequence of Sound noted that Blige and Beyoncé obviously enjoyed [...] "the soaring nature of the song", while Alex Young of the same publication described it as a [...] "lesson in love". Nathan S. of DJBooth described the song as an [...] "inter-generational diva duet that sounds so ‘90s I half expected Keith Sweat to jump in". Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush graded the song with four out of five stars and commented, [...] "'Love a Woman' is a melodic song with a ’90s-sounding feel that will surely get spins on urban radio and quiet storm formats. Forget Dr. Phil, MJB and Ms. B is all you need to help <b>you</b> <b>maintain</b> a loving relationship with your partner." ...|$|E
2500|$|The word [...] "loxodrome" [...] is {{from the}} Greek: [...] "λοξος (loxos), {{slanting}} + δρόμος (dromos), course". When sailing on a constant bearing – if <b>you</b> <b>maintain</b> a heading of (say) north-east, you will eventually wind up sailing around the north pole in a logarithmic spiral. On the mercator projection such a course is a straight line, as {{the north and south}} poles project to infinity. The angle that the loxodrome subtends relative to the lines of longitude (i.e. its slope, the [...] "tightness" [...] of the spiral) is the argument of k. Of course, Möbius transformations may have their two fixed points anywhere, not just at the north and south poles. But any loxodromic transformation will be conjugate to a transform that moves all points along such loxodromes.|$|E
