500|$|Adenhart {{made his}} Major League debut as the {{starting}} pitcher against the Oakland Athletics at home in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and walked five in two innings, earning a no-decision in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, [...] "I let down the team first. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go out and prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." [...] His second start was against the Kansas City Royals, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager Mike Scioscia saying that [...] "it was definitely a start in the right direction." [...] Adenhart earned his only career decision, a victory, on May 12, 2008, against the Chicago White Sox in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings {{en route to a}} 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He {{spent the rest of the}} 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.|$|E

Did you throw your gun, swift, like you have so often? Naw; you froze. An' why? Because here's a man {{with the kind of}} nerve you'd love to have. Because he's great--meetin' us here alone. Because you know he's a wonder with a gun an' you love life. Because you an' I an' every damned man here had to take his front, each to himself. If we all drew we'd kill him. Sure!

His 'chaff' with its utter want of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung earnest condition, nothing short of brutal, {{and for a few}} seconds produced a feeling of repellence. But it is in the nature of things that opposition of any kind arouses the fighting instinct of a naturally dominant nature. She lost sight of her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose; and as this was to win the man to her way of thinking, she took the logical course of answering his argument. If Leonard Everard had purposely set himself to stimulate her efforts in this direction he could hardly have chosen a better way.

For the sweetest craft that slips her {{moorings}} in the Round Pond is what is called a stick-boat, because she is rather like a stick until she is in the water and you are holding the string. Then as you walk round, pulling her, you see little men running about her deck, and sails rise magically and catch the breeze, and you put in on dirty nights at snug harbours which are unknown to the lordly yachts. Night passes in a twink, and again your rakish craft noses for the wind, whales spout, you glide over buried cities, and have brushes with pirates and cast anchor on coral isles. You are a solitary boy while all this is taking place, for two boys together cannot adventure far upon the Round Pond, and though you may talk to yourself throughout the voyage, giving orders and executing them with dispatch, you know not, when it is time to go home, where you have been or what swelled your sails; your treasure-trove is all locked away in your hold, so to speak, which will be opened, perhaps, by another little boy many years afterward.|$|E
