5|$|The {{title was}} the first LucasArts {{adventure}} game to incorporate voice work on release. The game was not originally planned to include voice work, as at the time, the install base for CD-ROM was too low. As they neared the end of 1992, CD-ROM sales grew significantly. The general manager of LucasArts, Kelly Flock, recognizing that the game would not be done in time {{by the end of}} the <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the holiday release, suggested that the team include voice work for the game, giving them more time to complete the title.|$|E
5|$|After {{making their}} debut with Shavukar (1950), B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani of Vijaya Vauhini Studios signed Kadiri Venkata Reddy {{later in the}} <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{folklore}} film. The film {{was based on a}} story from Kasi Majilee Kathalu, written by Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu. Pingali Nagendrarao adapted the content and wrote the film's story. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao and Venkata Reddy worked on the film's screenplay. Nagendrarao was also inspired from the story of Aladdin. Vijaya Vauhini Studios team worked for three to four months on the film's script and Ujjain in the state of Madhya Pradesh was chosen as the story's backdrop. Pathala Bhairavi was made as a bilingual film, shot in Telugu and Tamil simultaneously with both the versions having the same title. The Tamil version's dialogues were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the Central Electricity Generating Board {{had planned}} to {{demolish}} the station and sell the land for housing, {{but because of the}} building's then Grade II listed status, they had to pay the high-cost of preserving the building. In 1983 they held a competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site. It was won by a consortium led by developer David Roche and which included John Broome, owner of Alton Towers Ltd. This consortium proposed an indoor theme park, with shops and restaurants. At an estimated cost of £35million, the scheme was risky and would require over 2million visitors a <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any profit. The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £1.5million in 1987. Work on converting the site began the same year.|$|E

5|$|The first European American {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Chingleclamouche Township in about 1793, {{and the first}} sawmill in Clearfield County began operating in 1805. Settlers initially occupied land along the river and creeks, as these provided a means of transportation. Some settlers would harvest timber and float it downstream once a <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> money for items they could not produce themselves, but by 1820 the first full-time lumbering operations began in the region. The white pine was the most sought after tree, yielding spars for ships and timber for buildings. Hardwoods were also harvested, and eventually hemlocks were cut for their wood and their bark, which contained tannins used in tanning leather.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Danielle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} storm that made landfall on Virginia in the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth storm of the season, Danielle {{was one of two}} tropical cyclones in the <b>year</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> landfall in the United States, the other being Hurricane Andrew. It formed out of a stationary trough of low pressure on September 18 near the coast of North Carolina.

Tropical Storm Danielle reached a peak of 65mph (105km/h) winds before weakening and hitting the Delmarva Peninsula. The storm quickly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|There were no hits in {{the seventh}} inning, as both {{pitchers}} retired the first three batters they faced.

Lockman then reached first base on an error and was able to advance to third base, but Mays and Hearn both struck out to keep the score intact. No Dodgers managed a hit {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, though the Dodgers brought in Jim Russell to use as a pinch hitter for Branca. In the ninth inning, Alvin Dark doubled for the Giants, but he was the only player on either team to earn a hit; Hearn retired all three Dodgers hitters to end the game with the 3–1 victory, earning a complete game win after allowing five hits to the Dodgers.
