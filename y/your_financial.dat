He was called [...] "cold and brutal" [...] by sportswriters, and told players to be [...] "ready to fight for <b>your</b> <b>financial</b> lives". [...] "When I signed with Paul, he felt that $1,000 was $10 million", said Gene Hickerson, a guard who played for the Browns in the late 1950s and 1960s. Brown's stingy approach to salaries frustrated his players and was a motivating force behind {{the formation of the}} National Football League Players Association, which represents players' interests in dealings with the league. Browns players including Dante Lavelli and Abe Gibron helped found the union in 1956 along with lawyer and former Browns assistant coach Creighton Miller. Brown was so annoyed by the union that he had a 1946 team photo in his office touched up to remove Miller.|$|E

[...] The book outlines his moral and political philosophies, and it provides an autobiographical sketch. [...] It provides analysis on the link between race and economics from colonial America to the present with a vision for the future. [...] In addition to the analysis, it provides eight proposed constitutional amendments that Jackson sees as essential to pursuit of broader social and economic opportunity. [...] Since the publication of this book, Jackson has refined these and formally proposed these constitutional amendments.|$|E
