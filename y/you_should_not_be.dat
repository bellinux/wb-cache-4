25|$|Critics {{assert that}} naked CDSs should be banned, {{comparing}} them to buying fire insurance on your neighbor’s house, which creates a huge incentive for arson. Analogizing {{to the concept}} of insurable interest, critics say <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to buy a CDS—insurance against default—when you do not own the bond. Short selling is also viewed as gambling and the CDS market as a casino.|$|E
500|$|Squab pie {{has been}} the subject of poetry. In [...] "The Squab-Pie. A Devonshire Tale" [...] {{published}} in 1827, John Taylor uses verse to tell of the captain of a ship in Plymouth who forgot to get meat for his trip. A boy on the ship goes into town to claim a large squab pie from the bakery for a penny, though it was not meant to be his. Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> still having a big meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E

500|$|Wiedemann and Lammers had {{provided}} assurances that Hess {{would not be}} harmed. In August 1940, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, issued {{a letter to the}} Düsseldorf Gestapo ordering that Hess should not be [...] "inopportuned in any way whatsoever". Noting that Hess had been [...] "both in the same company as the Führer and briefly the Führer's company commander", Himmler instructed that Hess should be granted [...] "relief and protection as per the Führer's wishes" [...] and asked that he be informed if Hess should leave Düsseldorf. A follow-up letter was sent by Lammers in November 1940, informing Hess that [...] "it is, however, the Führer's wish that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> subject to any further restrictions because of your ancestry beyond those required by law." [...] Lammers expressly informed Hess that he was to use the letter for his protection: [...] "I give you this letter, if necessary, to make use [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should do your best to serve the Administrator. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> thinking of rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E
