5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> other members of the band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought {{it was some kind of}} gang slaying.|$|E

500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. You could tell he wasn't going anywhere, but you could never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|After {{viewing the}} pilots, CBS {{executives}} immediately signed the 30-minute show to its fall 1954 schedule. Pal retired after filming the two pilots, and his son, Lassie Junior (who {{was three years}} old and had been in training for a couple of years), stepped into the television role. [...] Pal would come to the show's studio home at Stage One of KTTV in Los Angeles every day with his son during filming. [...] He had a bed behind the set, and was respectfully termed The Old Man. [...] Series star Tommy Rettig later recalled, [...] "When Rudd would ask Lassie, Jr. to do something, if you were behind the set, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>The</b> Old Man get up from his bed and go through the routine back there." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore {{said he had}} a {{great fear}} of heights, and to do the {{climbing}} in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves. Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling {{off the side of the}} cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E

500|$|While {{ultimately}} an Israeli victory, the Battle of the Chinese Farm has {{an especially}} infamous legacy among Israeli participants, {{and it is}} remembered {{as one of the}} most brutal battles of the war—and for the heavy losses incurred by both the Egyptians and Israelis. After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as far as the eye could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager Mourinho was {{primarily}} concerned with the fitness of his squad {{in the aftermath of}} the match, in particular Ballack, who was substituted with an injury early in the match: [...] "He had a kick in the muscle and he couldn't run but I hope he will be back soon, we have quite a few players not in condition and we need players back, so I hope it's not a big deal." [...] He felt that the fitness of the two squads was the decisive factor in the match: [...] "Today our bench was not very good, with some kids, Liverpool could inject fresh blood at the same time as some of my players became really tired. They were broken. They were in better condition than us, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> difference between Frank Lampard and Sissoko." [...] Mourinho was also unconcerned about his team's form heading into the start of the season: [...] "Liverpool had more intensity and pace, qualities that make a team better. They had that and we didn't. We had a big percentage of the ball possession, but Liverpool defended with intensity and looked dangerous when they counter-attacked. I keep saying they are a difficult team to beat and they can go to every game with an ambition to win. They are a good team but over 10 months of competition we will be there." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there. Then you heard the explosion and felt the blast and saw the fire and smoke." [...] Another witness, Eric Peterson, looked up when he heard the plane, [...] "It was low enough, I thought you could probably count the rivets. You could see more of the roof of the plane than you could the belly. It was on its side. There was a great explosion and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> flames. It was a massive, massive explosion. Flames and then smoke and then a massive, massive mushroom cloud." [...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion. Ten years after 9/11, a video of the rising smoke cloud filmed by Dave Berkebile (deceased by 2011) from his yard located eight miles away from the crash site was published on YouTube.|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked until our shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an earlier}} time, one person had {{described}} the transparency of the water: [...] "I remember the time, gentlemen, {{when you could}} go in twelve feet of water and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> pebbles {{on the bottom of}} this river." [...] As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as photosynthesizing seagrass) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful oyster beds in the waters around the city, and the over-fishing of menhaden, or mossbunker, a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops - however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the purse seine was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed. [...] Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as bluefish, striped bass and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden. [...] The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore. [...] The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water [...] New York's water consumption per capita was twice that of Europe [...] indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{investigators}} and psychics such as Annette Martin and Jeanne Borgen and paranormal teams {{have sought to}} [...] "contact spirits" [...] at Alcatraz. KGO Radio Morning News anchor Ted Wygant, a skeptic of the paranormal, visited Alcatraz in 1982 with psychic Jeanne Borgen and spent the night there. Wygant said {{for most of the}} duration of the visit they found nothing, but around 3 am in the utility corridor, the place where three of the men of the 1946 Battle of Alcatraz were shot dead, he said that although it was pitch black, he suddenly got a [...] "tremendous feeling of anger" [...] and felt an evil presence lying on the floor at the place where the men had died. He started cursing and said that he felt a strong compulsion to fire a gun at people. Borgen said that it left Wygant quite out of character, and said that when they turned on the light, [...] "his face was changed, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> anger and hate in his eyes". Wygant has said though that it is quite difficult for him to believe there was something really there, but he is certain that he felt that something had happened. In 1984, paranormal investigator and writer Michael Kouri claimed that he visited the prison and in a trance was spoken to by the spirit of a dead prisoner who told him that he had been beaten and had his legs broken and was placed in solitary confinement. According to the Los Angeles Times, one woman, who claimed to be psychic, began speaking German in a child's voice {{on a tour of the}} prison hospital, and said that Alcatraz was frequented by spirits.|$|E

60|$|Another {{thing that}} was against the show was that the animals were fed after it was out, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> tigers tearing their prey when the great lumps of beef were thrown them.

2500|$|The stadium {{has also}} been criticized for its lack of fan noise. During a Sunday Night Baseball {{telecast}} in 2012, commentator and former Red Sox manager Terry Francona spoke about the different atmospheres in {{the old and new}} stadiums saying that [...] "As a visiting team, especially for the Red Sox, by the time the (national) anthem was over, you couldn't wait {{to get back in the}} dugout. Now (there is) a little different (kind) of fan sitting around down there by the dugout." [...] Games at the new stadium do not feature the same deafening crowd moments and often sound eerily silent. The lack of fan noise was noticeable in the 2012 playoffs as well, with thousands of unsold seats for Game 5 of the ALDS and Games 1 and 2 of the ALCS. [...] "This is a very easy place to play now", said Quintin Berry of the Detroit Tigers, the Yankees' ALCS opponents. [...] "Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here." [...] In his autobiography [...] "The Closer", the Yankees' longtime relief pitcher Mariano Rivera wrote these comments about the new stadium's atmosphere: [...] "It doesn’t hold noise, or home-team fervor, anywhere near the way the old place did. The old Stadium was our 10th man—a loud and frenzied cauldron of pinstriped passion, with a lot of lifers in the stands. Maybe I’m wrong, but it's hard to see that the new place can ever quite duplicate that. Derek Jeter echoed this sentiment in a September 2014 article in New York magazine, Jeter said he missed the original Yankee Stadium: [...] "It was a different feel. The new stadium, it's second to none—all the amenities. For the players, it really doesn’t get any better. The old stadium, if you were at the stadium, in the stands, the only place <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> game was in your seat. Now there's so many suites and places people can go. So a lot of times it looks like it's empty, but it's really not. The old stadium, it was more intimidating. The fans were right on top of you." ...|$|E
