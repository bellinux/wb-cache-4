2500|$|Philo {{considers}} Caligula's plan {{to erect}} a statue of himself in the temple of Jerusalem to be a provocation, asking, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>making</b> war upon us, because you anticipate {{that we will not}} endure such indignity, but that we will fight on behalf of our laws, and die in defence of our national customs? For you cannot possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our temple." [...] In his entire presentation, he implicitly supports the Jewish commitment to rebel against the emperor rather than allow such sacrilege to take place.|$|E
2500|$|When O'Reilly {{appeared}} on The Daily Show {{before the second}} episode of The Colbert Report aired, he commented, [...] "Before we get started, somebody told me walking in here, you got some French guy on after <b>you</b> <b>making</b> fun of me?", and made several references in the following interview to 'the French Guy'. In a subsequent Newsweek interview, O'Reilly said that he [...] "feels it's a compliment" [...] to have Colbert parody him because Colbert [...] "isn't mean-spirited" [...] and does not [...] "use [...] platform to injure people". Later, Colbert replied on-air, [...] "I like you too. In fact, if it wasn't for you, this show wouldn't exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a {{visit to}} Russia by French President Jacques Chirac, Louis Schweitzer noted that at Lada and Renault dealerships the €6,000 Ladas were selling very well while the €12,000 Renaults stayed in the showroom. [...] "Seeing those antiquated cars, I found it {{unacceptable}} that technical progress should stop <b>you</b> <b>making</b> a good car for €6,000." [...] (He later revised this target to €5,000). [...] "I also drew {{up a list of}} specifications in three words – modern, reliable and affordable – and added that everything else was negotiable." [...] The cheapest version of the car is €5,900, and the price can reach €11,200, depending on equipment and customs duty. (The base model for Western Europe, where it is badged as a Dacia but generally sold in Renault dealerships, is somewhat more expensive).|$|E

2500|$|Turner was big for his day ( [...] , [...] ); however, he {{was smart}} and very fast. Turner later boasted about his talent as a blocker: [...] "I {{was such a good}} blocker, that the men they put in front of me – and some were stars who were {{supposed}} to be making a lot of tackles – they would have their coaches saying, 'why ain't <b>you</b> <b>making</b> any tackles?' they'd say, 'that bum Turner is holding.' Well that wasn't true[...] [...] [...] I could handle anybody that they'd put in front of me." [...] According to George Halas, Turner was [...] "perhaps the smartest player" [...] he had in 40 years as the Bears' coach, a player who [...] "knew every assignment for every player on every player." [...] Teammate George Musso once said of Turner, [...] "Who knows what kind of player he would have been if he ever got to rest during a game?" ...|$|E
