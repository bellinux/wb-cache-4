500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive. Anna Smith of Empire called it [...] "formulaic and all-American", commenting that many scenes [...] "appear functional rather than inspirational", and that the film focused on the racial issue [...] "a little too heavily". Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character." [...] Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying [...] "on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly." [...] Nick Schager's of Slant Magazine lamented that the [...] "clichés are too numerous to mention", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has [...] "as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings." [...] Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it [...] "virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a [...] "shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good [...] "visual flair" [...] it [...] "is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation." [...] New York Posts Kyle Smith deemed it as [...] "uplifting but unimaginative", suggesting that [...] "Akeelah and the Bee is so warm and well-meaning that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> wanting to like it more than you really do." ...|$|E

[...] Daphne Gordon of the Toronto Star gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "One of the strongest releases from Disney in years, thanks to the work of Andrew Stanton, possibly {{one of the most successful}} directors you've never heard of." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Finding Nemo isn't quite up there with the company's finest work -- there's finally a sense of formula setting in -- but it's hands down the best family film since Monsters, Inc." [...] C.W. Nevius of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That's in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film's subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, Finding Nemo is the best big-studio release so far this year." ...|$|E

5000|$|Thirteen Conversations About One Thing was {{generally}} well received by critics, who praised {{the quality of}} the cast and the treatment of the films themes. Roger Ebert described the movie as [...] "brilliant ... It is philosophy, illustrated through everyday events." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times called the film [...] "both straightforward and enigmatic" [...] and said that [...] "the quiet naturalism of the acting balances the artifice of the script and the almost finicky precision of Ms. Sprechers frames". For Scott, the film is [...] "thrillingly smart, but not, like so many other pictures in this vein, merely an elaborate excuse for its own cleverness. As you puzzle over the intricacies of its shape, which reveal themselves only in retrospect, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> also <b>find</b> <b>yourself</b> surprised by the depth of its insights."

The poor devil deserved that you should take no notice of him when he looked at you just now. Are you one of the few women who dislike an ugly man? Women in general, I can tell you, prefer ugly men. A handsome man matches them on their own ground, and they don't like that. 'We are so fond of our ugly husbands; they set us off to such advantage.' Oh, I don't report what they say; I speak the language in which they think.--Mr. Roylake, does it strike you that the Cur is a sad cynic? By-the-by, do you call me 'the Cur' (as I suggested) when you speak of me to other people--to Miss Cristel, for instance? My charming young friends, you both look shocked; you both shake your heads. Perhaps I am in one of my tolerant humors to-day; I see nothing disgraceful in being a Cur. He is a dog who represents different breeds.
