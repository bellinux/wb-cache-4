5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland {{aligned with the}} Democratic Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of the}} Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to <b>yield</b> <b>up</b> to $40,000 (US$ today) over the two-year term.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} area {{of research}} {{has been on the}} use of plasma polymer films as permeation membranes. The permeability characteristics of plasma polymers deposited on porous substrates are different than usual polymer films. The characteristics depend on the deposition and polymerization mechanism. Plasma polymers as membranes for separation of oxygen and nitrogen, ethanol and water, and water vapor permeation have all been studied. The application of plasma polymerized thin films as reverse osmosis membranes has received considerable attention as well. Yasuda et al. have shown membranes prepared with plasma polymerization made from nitrogen containing monomers can <b>yield</b> <b>up</b> to 98% salt rejection with a flux of 6.4 gallons/ft2 a day.

Axially chiral vinylallenes are important structural motifs present in natural products and are versatile chiral synthons attributed to axial-to-point chirality transfer. In this work, a series of axially chiral vinylallenes were successfully synthesized and two subsequent reactions: enantioselective silver(I) catalyzed Diels-Alder reaction and aerobic oxidation of vinylallenes, are described. A series of axially chiral vinylallenes (up to 98 % ee) were generated in good <b>yields</b> (<b>up</b> to 81 %) by reacting chiral propargylamines in acetonitrile at 40 °C. The optically active vinylallenes underwent silver-catalyzed cycloaddition with maleimines and azodicarboxylates in water at 40 °C to form different cycloadducts as single diastereomers in excellent <b>yields</b> (<b>up</b> to 82 %) with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 97 % ee). The chiral vinylallenes also underwent silver-catalyzed aerobic oxidation in acetonitrile at 40 °C and light-induced oxidative cyclization via singlet oxygen in toluene at room temperature upon irradiation by a 300 W xenon lamp. For aerobic oxidation, a series of achiral cyclopentenones were synthesized in good <b>yields</b> (<b>up</b> to 79 %).

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the synthesis of}} novel heterocyclic sulfoximines. Being aware the enormous application potential of heterocyclic sulfoximines (e. g. as bioactive compounds or as ligands), we were inspired to expand the existing protocols for the synthesis of this class of compounds. In {{the first part of}} the thesis the regioselective synthesis of sulfoximidoyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles is described. Sulfoximidoyl-alkynes with various substitution patterns were synthesized and were used as substrates in Huisgen- 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition reactions with organic azides. The corresponding sulfoximidoyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles were obtained in <b>yields</b> <b>up</b> to 73 %. The regioselectivities were examined by use of 1 H-NOESY-spectroscopy. It became apparent that only 1, 4 -disubstituted (referring to the azide substituent and the sulfoximidoyl group) regioisomers could be isolated. Moreover, chiral sulfoximidoyl- 1, 2, 3 -triazoles were prepared from N-propargyl-sulfoximines and organic azides in <b>yields</b> <b>up</b> to 92 % and with excellent regioselectivities. The second part of the thesis {{describes the}} investigation of the ring-closing enyne metathesis (RCEYM) reaction of doubly unsaturated sulfoximines leading to heterocyclic sulfoximines. It soon became apparent that the outcome of this reaction is highly dependent on the substrate structure (such as substitution pattern and tether length). By use of RCEYM reactions, seven-membered heterocyclic sulfoximines could be synthesized in <b>yields</b> <b>up</b> to 79 %. These heterocyclic products were converted to tricyclic sulfoximines in <b>yields</b> <b>up</b> to 99 % by sequential Diels-Alder-reactions and aromatizations...|$|R

2500|$|The {{production}} process {{is long and}} delicate. The maguey plant needs 12 years of maturation before the sap, or aguamiel, can be extracted, but a good plant can produce for up to one year.

This liquid is collected twice a day from the plant, yielding {{about five or six}} liters per day. Today, this liquid is collected with a steel scoop, but in the past, an elongated gourd was used as a tube to suck the juice out. Between gatherings, the plant's leaves are bent over the center where the juice collects to keep out bugs and dirt. This center is regularly scraped out to keep the plant's production of sap active.
