500|$|The smog {{brought into}} focus the {{complexity}} and interdependency of environmental problems and other issues of urban life. Attempts by city government {{to react to the}} smog had unintended negative side effects of their own; as Mayor Lindsay reflected in his 1969 book The City, [...] "very time <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> down an incinerator, you increase the amount of garbage on city streets." [...] Efforts to address a given environmental problem can cause undesired side effects, sometimes unforeseeable, which are often related to a city's limited resources.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} the {{original}} author ever has {{anything to say about}} how their book is treated, Allen replied: [...] "Not if I can help it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, you go to the bank, <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Rabbi Aharon Dov Halprin, {{the editor}} of Chabad’s Israeli {{magazine}} (Kfar Chabad) prepared an article that explained why the Rebbe was worthy of being considered Messiah. When the Rebbe got word of this he responded sharply, [...] "If you, God forbid, [...] do anything even remotely similar, it is preferable that <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> down the periodical completely".|$|E

2500|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence that psychosocial stressors {{are among the}} most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance. Cosmonaut Valery Ryumin wrote in his journal during a particularly difficult period on board the Salyut 6 space station: [...] "All the conditions necessary for murder are met if <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> two men in a cabin measuring 18 feet by 20 and leave them together for two months." ...|$|E
2500|$|... ¿Por qué no te callas? ( [...] , English: [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> up?") is {{a phrase}} that was uttered by King Juan Carlos I of Spain to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, at the 2007 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago, Chile, when Chávez was {{repeatedly}} interrupting Prime Minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's speech. The phrase became an overnight sensation, gaining cult status as a mobile-phone ringtone; spawning a domain name; a contest; T-shirt sales; a television program; and YouTube videos.|$|E

2500|$|The bridge {{has become}} a symbol of the {{transition}} from Devon to Cornwall. In the Great Western Railway's The Cornish Riviera travel guide, SPB Mais regarded it as an almost magic means of transporting travellers from a county, which, if richer than others, is yet unmistakingly an English county, to a Duchy which is in every respect un-English. <b>You</b> <b>shut</b> your eyes going over the Saltash Bridge only to open them again on a foreign scene. However, Cornish people look at it in the other way; in the song [...] "Cousin Jack", English folk duo Show of Hands sing I dream of a bridge on the Tamar, It opens us up to the East.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about <b>you,</b> <b>shut</b> up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I think it just sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind of does it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. I think it does something to a woman when they look good".|$|E
2500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR) recorded the captain excusing himself {{to go to the}} lavatory, followed thirty seconds later by the first officer saying in Egyptian Arabic [...] "Tawkalt ala Allah," [...] which translates to [...] "I rely on God." [...] A minute later, the autopilot was disengaged, immediately followed by the first officer again saying, [...] "I rely on God." [...] Three seconds later, the throttles for both engines were reduced to idle, and both elevators were moved three degrees nose down. [...] The first officer repeated [...] "I rely on God" [...] seven more times before the captain suddenly asked repeatedly, [...] "What's happening, what's happening?" [...] The flight data recorder reflected that the elevators then moved into a split condition, with the left elevator up and the right elevator down, a condition which is expected to result when the two control columns are subjected to at least 50 pounds (23kg) of opposing force. At this point, both engines were shut down by moving the start levers from run to cutoff. The captain asked, [...] "What is this? What is this? Did <b>you</b> <b>shut</b> the engines?" [...] The captain is then recorded as saying [...] "get away in the engines" [...] (this is the literal translation that appears in the NTSB transcript), followed by [...] "shut the engines". The first officer replies [...] "It's shut". The final recorded words are the captain repeatedly stating, [...] "Pull with me" [...] but the FDR data indicated that the elevator surfaces remained in a split condition (with the left surface commanding nose up and the right surface commanding nose down) until the FDR and CVR stopped recording. There were no other aircraft in the area. There was no indication that an explosion occurred on board. The engines operated normally for the entire flight until they were shut down. From the presence of a western debris field about [...] from the eastern debris field, the NTSB concluded that the left engine and some small pieces of wreckage separated from the aircraft before water impact.|$|E
