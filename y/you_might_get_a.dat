6000|$|... "Be careful, Larry," [...] {{warned the}} captain. [...] "If a case should shift {{with the ship}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> crushed leg. You had better take a candle along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, lad, that wouldn't do; though I {{thank you}} for your offer. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ship back to England, but I should have very little chance of getting one for France." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will be well, Maria, but {{you will}} have to keep your tongue quiet. These savages have ears like those of wild animals, and if you were to raise your voice <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> arrow in the brain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, then? At {{any rate}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> answer from her. She {{would tell you}} {{something}} of her intention. Mother, I shall never go away till I know more about it than I do now. The governor says that he will turn me out. Let him turn me out. That won't make me go away." ...|$|R
5000|$|Various ukay-ukay {{stores in}} Bag-ong Lungsod {{is a good}} place to shop for second hand fashion items. Befriend the saleslady and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> just <b>get</b> <b>a</b> discount.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Purday at last, [...] "if pigs was reasonable, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{nice little}} one to fat, at Kattern Hill fair, somewhere about ten shillings, or maybe twelve--{{sometimes}} more, sometimes less." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> man his tea, Ethel," [...] said Lewisham, {{sitting down}} suddenly; [...] "anyhow." [...] He drummed {{on the table}} with his fingers. [...] "I have to get to Walham Green by a quarter to seven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid you}} will find but few chances in Mossvale. Times are dull here--ever since the hat factory moved away. I guess the stores have all the help they want. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> place {{on one of the}} farms." ...|$|E
50|$|Moore also hosted {{his regular}} {{internet}} show, Frank Moore’s Shaman’s Den. Moore {{describes it as}} a show that “will arouse, inspire, move, threaten you, not with sound bites, but with a two-hour (usually longer) feast of live streaming video. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> in-studio concert of bands from around the world...or poetry reading...or an in-depth conversation about politics, art, music, and LIFE with extremely dangerous people! But then you may see beautiful women naked dancing erotically. You never know, because you are in The Shaman’s Den with Frank Moore.” Video and audio archives {{of all of these}} Shaman's Den shows are available online.|$|R
6000|$|... "We thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{possibly}} <b>get</b> <b>an</b> {{offer from}} Porton or Crapsey, {{or both of}} them, to return the miniatures for a certain amount," [...] went on Dave. [...] "But you say no such offer has come in?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{so there}} was such a {{jam-making}} as had never been seen before, and if you like to go and help in it, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> perhaps <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little, for they must surely be making jam still to this very day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nobody in the {{neighborhood}} would let you have a cottage. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> laborer's job in the town, but {{you would have to}} work hard, and I don't know about your father. He's rheumatic and old. None of the farmers would engage you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{not set up}} a school, I say? You {{might have}} had this of mine, had you been a little older; but once in, fast in, with me. Still, schools are wanted, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{tolerable}} good recommend. I dare say your tutor would furnish a certificate." ...|$|E
6000|$|Father Herman {{thought for}} a few minutes and then resumed: [...] "A small {{schooner}} is loading at a beach not far off and I know the patron. He would take you to Arenas, where the president has supporters and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ship. I think he sails to-night, but I will send a message." ...|$|E
50|$|If {{you could}} imagine Commissioner Gordon with {{his back against the}} wall, a fire axe, and a score to settle, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> idea of the {{position}} Stenton finds himself in {{with the arrival of the}} shadowmen. Having been persuaded by his family to check into the hospital overnight for chest pains, the aging policeman awakes to find everything taken away from him - including his chances of survival when he is critically injured by a shadowman. Now he has no reason to hold back, and no desire to lose to the infestation, whatever the cost. Like Ridley, Stenton is a gentle person hardened by circumstance, but age has reduced his compassion for their aggressors.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> {{chance to}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> proper good licking for not holding your tongue," [...] said Norman, which hint reduced Harry to silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes," [...] {{she added}} more hopefully, [...] "I have been {{thinking}} that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> on as <b>a</b> schoolmaster, and rise that way, since you really are determined to hate the course you were pursuing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, napkins and tablecloths {{and sheets}} and pillowslips, and such things. And <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good set of china. You know it'll come {{hard for her}} to settle down to this sort of thing. You can freight them in by steamer around by Bering Sea. And, I say, what's the matter with a piano?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't budge," [...] {{he cried}} at last. [...] "Just {{run into the}} Hit or Miss at the corner, mate, and borrow a hammer; and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pint o' hot beer when ye're at it. Here's fourpence. I was with three that found a quid in the Mac,* end of last week; here's the last of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Southerness; they'll light up, soon," [...] Andrew said. [...] "I {{know one}} of the light-keepers and I'll walk across and ask him about the {{entrance}} to Rough Firth. There's a flock of duck up the channel, Jim, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> shot at them from the dinghy when it's a bit darker. Will you stay on board, Dick?" ...|$|E
60|$|TOPPING. Well, in my belief, we {{all have}} a vice about us somewhere. But if I were you, Miss, I wouldn't touch bettin', not with this other on <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> to feel <b>a</b> bit crowded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could do}} that, easily enough," [...] Walter said. [...] "The {{mouth of the}} river is quite beyond our lines. But it is very risky for <b>you,</b> John. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> shot, if <b>a</b> sentry were to see you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bridgetown is {{the seat}} of the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes and the centre of a {{productive}} agricultural district. Many buildings in the town centre are over a century old. The town has a Jigsaw Gallery and Museum, which claims to host the only jigsaw collection {{of its kind in the}} Southern Hemisphere, and also a primary school (1870) and high school (1962), district hospital, telecentre, shire offices, roadhouse, agricultural showground, shopping facilities, accommodation for travellers (hotel/motel, B&Bs, caravan park) and numerous picnic spots along the Blackwood River. The rural residential area of Kangaroo Gully to the town's east has grown since the 1990s.Bridgetown also allows students from Safety Bay Primary School to visit the very fun and adventurous camp. At the camp there are lots of fun activities like milking cows, riding horses, canoeing, cycling and visit a nearby farm where <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to feed baby animals.Each year, Bridgetown hosts these and many other events: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Twas Doctor Sitgreaves; {{he never}} knows the {{countersign}} himself. Now, blackey, {{had it been}} Captain Lawton {{he would not have}} sent you here, close to a sentinel, without the countersign; for <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pistol bullet through your head, and that would be cruel to you; for although you be black, I am none of them who thinks niggers have no souls." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd get visions. They wouldn't be divine visions. If {{you took}} small {{quantities}} very discreetly <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> temporary quickening. But the swift {{result of all}} repeated drug-taking is, I can assure you, moral decay--rapid moral decay. To touch drugs habitually is to become hopelessly unpunctual, untruthful, callously selfish and insincere. I am talking mere textbook, mere everyday common-places, to you when I tell you that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of your countrymen in the deepest poverty, Dias; you could secretly help those in distress; a single ingot, ten pounds in weight, would be a fortune to them. And when you die <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> respectable lawyer to make out a will, leaving your treasure to some charity for the benefit of Indians, giving, of course, instructions where the treasure is to be found." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was about}} a week after the Bargees' match that the rules {{respecting}} bounds were made stricter, much to the popular indignation. The penalty for visiting Stapleton without leave was increased from two hundred lines to two extra lessons. The venomous characteristic of extra lesson was that it cut into one's football, for the criminal was turned into a form-room from two till four on half-holidays, and so had to scratch all athletic engagements for the day, unless he chose to go for a solitary run afterwards. In the cricket term the effect of this was not so deadly. It was just possible that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> innings somewhere after four o'clock, even if only at the nets. But during the football season--it was now February--to be in extra lesson meant a total loss of everything that makes life endurable, and the School protested (to one another, {{in the privacy of their}} studies) with no uncertain voice against this barbarous innovation.|$|R
50|$|Kleon {{responds}} by writing, “the {{reason to}} copy your heroes and their style is so that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> somehow <b>get</b> <b>a</b> glimpse into their minds". Kleon reminds throughout his book that “nothing is original… all creative work builds on what came before.” This sentiment {{is also a}} foundation for effective ELA teaching: From our past experiences as readers and writers, we can design better learning conditions for our students.|$|R
5000|$|Abul Hussain, {{a former}} member of Respect's {{national}} council, posted antisemitic comments on Facebook and was expelled for his comments in September 2010. The councillor joked about chopping off a Jewish person's sidelocks and confiscating their kippah. He also wrote about Jews, [...] "Here's a penny go put it in the bank and <b>you</b> just <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> pound after ten years interest!". The Respect Party stated that [...] "such views are demonstrably incompatible with party membership".|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not a d--d fool," [...] {{said the}} boss. [...] "But I'll say this, that he half meant it. Krebs has a {{head-piece}} on him, and I {{tell you if}} any of this reform dope is worth anything his is. There's some sense in what he's talking, and if all the voters was like him <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> man like me for mayor. But they're not, and I guess they never will be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{very old}} beast might please you better," [...] said he; [...] "but really, Mrs. Cliff, {{that is not}} the sort of horse you should have. He would die or break down in a little while, and then you would have to get another. What you should do is to have a good horse and a driver. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> two-seated carriage, either open or closed, and go {{anywhere}} and everywhere, and never think of the horse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the {{sergeant}} said slowly, [...] "I was afraid {{you would say}} that, ma'm. Besides, though you are good enough not to say it, I know {{that there must be}} other objections. I know you must be surprised at my wanting her to be with a lady like yourself. So far as money goes, I could afford to pay fifty pounds a year, and perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> girl who could look after Aggie while you are busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are wrong," [...] Mistress Dowsett said gravely. [...] "My husband tells me how clever you are at figures, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> some day <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good post {{in the house of}} one of our great merchants." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 3 April 2017 it was {{revealed}} that Moyes had made a controversial remark after a post-match interview after Sunderland's goalless draw with Burnley on 18 March. After the interview with the BBC's Vicki Sparks, while the microphone was still audible, Moyes, said: [...] "It was <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. <b>You</b> still <b>might</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> slap even though you’re a woman. Careful the next time you come in". Moyes apologised for the incident. The FA wrote to Moyes to ask for his observations on the incident.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Lawrence, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>get</b> {{yourself}} into <b>a</b> {{lot of trouble}} by endeavoring to repair the mischief. Before I leave here, we may think of some plan of disposing of the little trotters. It might be well to give them back to Aunt Patsy and tell her to restore them." ...|$|R
