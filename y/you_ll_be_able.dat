40|$|Hennepin County Library {{will open}} two new, larger {{libraries}} without {{the ability to}} increase FTE. We are developing a pilot plan {{to see if a}} video service can address the need to provide reference service in a busy library as part of an overall staffing strategy. A coordinated video reference service may be a tool that can help libraries continue to provide core services with reduced in-building staff. The purpose of a video-based reference service is to supplement reference staffing in buildings. In a small library, video reference could be used in the absence of on-site reference staff; in a larger library it may be used to provide access to reference service while in-library reference staff are engaged in other service functions - programming, outreach, class visits, etc. Web Services staff at Hennepin County Library began investigating the technical aspects of providing video reference service in early 2009, with an eye toward determining if there were any technical issues that would prohibit the introduction of a service. The library has no additional funds that can be spent on the purchase of equipment or software; work done to date is based on freely available software and low cost equipment.

Last Monday I called the hospital to see if he was still there and I was transferred to his ward and <b>was</b> <b>able</b> to talk to him personally. He told me that he was hobbling around but that it seemed so good to get out of bed. I had intended to get a forty-eight hour pass and visit him this week as I have it due me but thought that I 2 ̆ 7 d let it lay-over another week or so. Prior to visiting John I received a letter from Dr. Wilbur with whom I have been writing ever since entering the Army that he had finally arrived in the UK. I immediately answered his letter and planned to meet either in London or at his station. He decided that he would prefer coming to London and seeing the sights. We spent twenty-four hours together and had several photos taken which incidentally didn 2 ̆ 7 t come out. He hasn 2 ̆ 7 t changed a bit since the days when we were back in Bryant. We planned to get together again but he was 2 ̆ 2 alerted 2 ̆ 2 and then moved across the Channell to France. It is now 8 : 00 in the evening, Washington 2 ̆ 7 s birthday at that, and I find myself attempting to get caught up on correspondence.

40|$|L-Lactate (<b>LL)</b> <b>is</b> an {{essential}} cellular metabolite {{which can be}} used to generate energy. In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that <b>LL</b> <b>is</b> used for inter-cellular signalling. Some LL-sensitive receptors have been identified but we recently proposed that there may be yet another unknown G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) sensitive to LL in the brain. Olfactory receptors (ORs) represent the largest family of GPCRs {{and some of them are}} expressed outside the olfactory system, including brain, making them interesting candidates for non-olfactory LL signalling. One of the "ectopically" expressed ORs, Olfr 78 in mice (Olr 59 in rats and OR 51 E 2 in humans), reportedly can <b>be</b> activated by <b>LL.</b> This implies that both rodents and humans should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to detect the LL odour. Surprisingly, this has never been demonstrated. Here we show that mice can detect the odour of LL in odour detection and habituation-dishabituation tasks, and discriminate it from peppermint and vanilla odours. Behaviour of the Olfr 78 null mice and wildtype mice in odour detection task was not different, indicating that rodents are equipped with more than one LL-sensitive OR.

Pharr, (706) 542 - 5172 UGA AND IRISH LAW STUDENTS DEBATE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DISPUTE ATHENS, Ga. [...] The {{advocacy}} {{skills of}} University of Georgia and Irish law {{students will be}} put to the test on Friday, September 15 at 3 : 30 p. m. in the law school 2 ̆ 7 s Hatton Lovejoy Courtroom when they square off in an argument over an international economic dispute. The friendly competition is open and free to the public. This marks the third moot court competition between students from the UGA School of Law and barristers from the Honorable Society of King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns in Dublin, Ireland. The exchange, created in 1996, complements the law school 2 ̆ 7 s older program with Gray 2 ̆ 7 s Inn of London, England, held in alternating years. UGA law students are thus exposed to international cultures and legal systems each fall. Up for hypothetical appeal before a panel of UGA law professors and their Irish counterparts is the fate of a developing country accused of violating international trade laws. The country recently underwent a massive revolution and swung open its doors to the global marketplace. When it was unexpectedly flooded with products from a larger, developed neighbor, however, it retaliated by nationalizing some industries and restricting free trade, particularly media products. The University of Georgia will be represented in the debate by three third-year law students, all members of last year 2 ̆ 7 s successful National Moot Court team: Anne Allen Westbrook, Charlie Bethel and Jennifer Auer. The Irish delegation is comprised of three young barristers and King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns 2 ̆ 7 director of education, Marcella Higgins. 2 ̆ 2 The educational experience of working and thinking through the problem is probably the most valuable part of the whole moot court experience, 2 ̆ 2 said Bethel. 2 ̆ 2 This exhibition {{will be a lot of}} fun for those of us who enjoy arguing the law, and we 2 ̆ 7 <b>ll</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to test ourselves against international competitors. 2 ̆ 2 The roots of King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns go back to the sixteenth century and the reign of Henry VIII. To become a barrister-at-law in Ireland, a student must have passed a diploma examination at the King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns. Therefore, all members of the Irish bar and judiciary belong to the society. During their stay in Georgia, the Irish guests will tour Athens and Atlanta and go whitewater rafting with the UGA students. In mid-November, the UGA competitors will reciprocate the visit and travel to King 2 ̆ 7 s Inns in Dublin. The exchanges are financed in part by the William Carroll Brown Fund. - 30...|$|R
