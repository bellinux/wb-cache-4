40|$|When youth create {{positive}} {{environmental change}} in their communities they typically act with adult guidance. The role of adults, however, is largely absent <b>in</b> literature around <b>youth</b> participation <b>in</b> environmental <b>action.</b> This research explored through phenomenological interviews with 33 practitioners (e. g., teachers, extension educators, community organizers) facilitating <b>youth</b> environmental <b>action</b> <b>in</b> formal and non-formal educational settings across the U. S. : (a) ways practitioners involved <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> environmental <b>action,</b> (b) purposes and goals motivating practitioners to engage <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> environmental <b>action,</b> and (c) methods practitioners used to facilitate youth environmental action. The study sought insight into successful and challenging experiences. It also inquired {{about the meaning of}} these experiences for participating youth through group interviews with 46 <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> 9 programs. Practice accounts included multiple forms of action among five types: physical improvements, community education, inquiry, advocacy, and contributions to community development. Practitioners described purposes integrating multiple individual, environmental, and community development goals. Most placed higher value <b>in</b> developing <b>youth</b> as citizens and change agents than in promoting environmental improvements. Evident in practitioners' narratives was a tension between encouraging youth autonomy while maintaining authority. Practitioners experienced and managed this 'autonomy-authority duality' differently but all described characteristics of youth-adult partnerships. Nine practice themes emerged: creating safe spaces; providing structure; building relationships; bridging differences; setting rigorous expectations; providing opportunities for meaningful contribution; supporting youth; expanding horizons; and connecting youth with community. <b>Youth</b> reported learning <b>in</b> physical (e. g., fitness), intellectual (e. g., technological skills), psychological (e. g., initiative), and social (e. g., teamwork) domains. Parallel themes with youth development literature suggest environmental action is a valuable context for positive youth development. The interplay of science education and community <b>action</b> evident <b>in</b> practitioner and <b>youth</b> interviews suggests the merit of a theoretical framework where environmental action occurs at the intersection of inquiry-based science education and youth civic engagement. Participation <b>in</b> environmental <b>action</b> enhanced some youths' capabilities in 'practical inquiry' and influenced some youths' perceptions of themselves from passive to active citizens. Environmental <b>action</b> concurrently involves <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> civic and scientific processes through which they can develop the critical dispositions and skills characteristic of both endeavors.

40|$|Youth-led action {{research}} {{can be a}} powerful means to inform and catalyze community organizing and revitalization. This article presents a case study of youth-led {{action research}} to improve educational and recreational resources in a diverse low-income neighborhood in San Francisco. It analyzes this case through a set of three matrices to evaluate the quality and impacts of <b>youth</b> participation <b>in</b> <b>action</b> research. The first matrix uses the dimensions of youth authority over decision-making and <b>youth</b> inclusion <b>in</b> successive phases of the action research to describe the scope and scale of the youth participation. The second matrix uses the alignment of the youth participation model with organizational capacity and community change objectives to assess the overall quality of the youth participation. Finally, impacts on youth participants and on community or policy change are measured to understand effectiveness of the participation. This analysis suggests that practitioners and scholars of participatory research carefully consider the resources and program design necessary to support sustainable and effective participatory action research over time. It also points to the need for long-term commitments by funders to efforts that engage <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> meaningful community change...|$|R

On behalf of the Cabinet Office, Ipsos MORI surveyed 2, 038 10 - 20 year olds in September 2014 to determine the proportion of young people involved <b>in</b> social <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the UK. The term 'youth social action', in this context, is defined as 'practical <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the service of others to create positive change' and covers a range of activities such as fundraising, supporting charities, tutoring and mentoring, supporting other people, and campaigning for causes. The 2014 survey provides a baseline measure of participation <b>in</b> <b>youth</b> social <b>action</b> <b>in</b> the UK, which will be tracked {{over the next six}} years. The surveys will inform, and help to measure the progress of, the #iwill campaign run by Step Up To Serve, which aims to raise the number of 10 - 20 year olds in the UK involved <b>in</b> meaningful social <b>action</b> by 50 per cent by 2020.
