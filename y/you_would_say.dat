500|$|Leaf {{missed his}} second season due to a {{shoulder}} injury suffered 20 minutes into the Chargers' first training camp workout on July 23, 1999. Leaf had surgery to fix a labral tear in his throwing shoulder. During an August training camp, a fan heckled Leaf: [...] "Hey, Ryan, you're the worst draft choice in NFL history. You make Heath Shuler look like an All-Star." [...] Leaf, accompanied by a coach and security guards, walked towards the fan and asked a question. The fan began walking closer to Leaf, and two coaches restrained Leaf, with another Chargers employee saying [...] "No, don't do it, Ryan. Don't do it." [...] Leaf later explained the incident: [...] "...what I {{wanted to do was}} say, 'Hey, look, I've grown up, I'm calm about it, I would like to understand why <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that about me.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 2008, Che was {{screened}} at New York City's {{sold out}} 1,100 person Ziegfeld Theater. Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether I agree with him or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died the way you would have him die. He was executed the way <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Conan sidekick Andy Richter {{left the}} show, and Weinberg became the [...] "second banana". Weinberg {{continued}} {{to present an}} obvious visual foil: as O'Brien said, [...] "If you looked at this guy you would never know he was the drummer in a huge rock 'n' roll band. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> {{he was the guy}} who did the band's accounting. But Max is the authoritative, buttoned-down adult {{in the midst of all}} this madness." [...] The drummer reveled in O'Brien's youthful audience: [...] "To be 49 and appreciated by 14-year-olds again? What a thrill!" [...] Weinberg engaged in stare-downs with O'Brien and gave scripted screeds about newsmakers. [...] Additionally, Weinberg was comically presented as a twisted character with sexual fetishes and homicidal tendencies in comedy bits. When Conan O'Brien was host of Saturday Night Live on March 10, 2001, his monologue featured a visit from the SNL studio to the Late Night studio (only a few floors apart in the same building, 30 Rockefeller Plaza), where Conan discovers Weinberg engaged in sexual intercourse with a woman on his desk (played by Max's real-life wife, Becky). [...] Weinberg says of his comic persona: [...] "t's playing against type. I've been happily married for nearly 30 years, with two wonderful children. It's not what I portray on the show, and that's funny." [...] Weinberg continued his one-man college shows, now titled [...] "E Street to Late Night: Dreams Found, Lost, and Found Again".|$|E

500|$|On 18 March 1941, the 2/3rd Battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard HMS Gloucester, {{arriving}} in Greece and {{landing in the}} port of Piraeus on the following day, after a 22-hour voyage during which their convoy had been attacked numerous times by Axis aircraft. After {{the invasion of the}} country on 6 April, they were moved north to attempt to turn back the German forces. The following day they occupied Veria, and on 12 April the 6th Division was grouped together with the 2nd New Zealand Division and a lone British brigade to form an Anzac Corps. This formation did not last long, however, as the Greek government requested Allied forces withdraw from Greece on 16 April before ceasing organised resistance on 18 April. Due to a series of withdrawals elsewhere, the battalion was forced to pull back from its positions at Veria and did not come into contact with the Germans until 18 April when they attempted to block passage of the Tempe Gorge. Fighting alongside the 2/2nd Battalion and New Zealanders, the rearguard action was successful and enabled the Allies to withdraw to the south. Brigadier Arthur Allen, commander of the 16th Brigade, later wrote of this encounter: [...] "it was a fantastic battle. Everyone was on top, with no time to dig in, and all in the front line, including artillery, Bren carriers and infantry, as well as headquarters, with transport only yards in the rear. Some confusion could be expected in the circumstances, with every weapon firing and aircraft almost continually strafing from above. If you saw it in the cinema <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the author had never seen battle." ...|$|E

"Simcha has no {{credibility}} whatsoever," [...] says Joe Zias, who was {{the curator}} for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. [...] "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy Cameron, who made Titanic or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were {{to write a book}} about brain surgery, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders.

2500|$|In Southey's {{personal}} appearance, {{there is}} something eccentric, even off-putting: he [...] "walks with his chin erect {{through the streets of}} London, and with an umbrella sticking out under his arm, in the finest weather." [...] "With a tall, loose figure, a peaked austerity of countenance, and no inclination to embonpoint, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> he has something puritanical, something ascetic in his appearance." [...] Hazlitt hopes the negative aspects of his character will dissipate, wishing that Southey live up to his own ideal as expressed in his poem [...] "The Holly-Tree" [...] so that [...] "as he mellows into maturer age, all [...] asperities may wear off...." ...|$|E
2500|$|During an April 11, 2010, {{appearance}} on CNN, host Candy Crowley {{asked if it}} had been insensitive for Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell to omit mentioning slavery in a proposed recognition of Confederate History Month.

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the awkwardness {{that takes place}} between two people after they break up. Chris Willman of Yahoo! Music thought the key lyrics of the song are [...] "I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how/I've never heard silence quite this loud" [...] and also [...] "I would lay my armor down, if <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> you'd rather love than fight." [...] In a {{different}} perspective, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly considered these couplets from the song, ("I used to know my place was the spot next to you / Now I’m searching the room for an empty seat / ‘Cause lately I don’t even know what page you’re on"), {{as one of the}} best couplets from Speak Now sheet.

5000|$|The sports talk in {{the show}} was mixed in with {{different}} pre-produced comedy bits and features which many times lead the show to commercial break. One of the first comedy segments within the show was the [...] "Nightly/Daily Sports Report", hosted by Ken Rudulph, a Daily Show-type satirical {{look at the latest}} sports news reported at an anchor desk, which soon became a daily staple in the show for its first year. The show would end with Tom Arnold's [...] "Things <b>You</b> <b>Would</b> Never <b>Say</b> To..." [...] A different athlete was highlighted each day, and Tom Arnold would belt out around 10 different lines <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>say</b> to that athlete.

2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, {{it will be hard to}} seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
2500|$|Many experts {{disagree}} with Kramer's assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell, John Barrett, Joe McCauley, Ted Schroeder, and Tony Trabert rank Laver {{as the best}} of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, [...] "You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver's the best player of all time." [...] Trabert said in January 2008, [...] "I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he's done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you've got to say Laver is the best player of all time." [...] Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, [...] "Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [...] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own." [...] Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a [...] "Professional Grand Slam" [...] by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship, and the Wimbledon Pro.|$|E
