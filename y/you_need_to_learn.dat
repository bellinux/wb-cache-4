Raised in Lebanon, his {{broadcasting}} career also began there as {{he got a job}} at hometown KLWT-AM in 1960, working for a dollar per hour. Following his graduation from Lebanon High School in 1962, Bohannon attended Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. While in college he continued to work in radio part-time at KWTO-AM as a news reporter, and at KICK-AM as a disc jockey. One event in 1964 helped set the tone for Bohannon's later career and ability to think on his feet. Presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater made a campaign appearance in Springfield, which KWTO was covering by live remote broadcast. However the Senator was running late, forcing the young Bohannon to ad lib on air for over an hour to fill the time. As he told Inside Radio in a 2003 interview: [...] "I called on everything I had in reserve. I was ad libbing and making comments about the campaign. It was like being dumped {{in the middle of the}} English Channel and told <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> swim. That sticks out as a time I was given a big test." [...] Another highlight for Bohannon while working in radio in those early years was taking three busloads of fans from Springfield to Kansas City, Missouri to see The Beatles in concert.|$|R

In this paper, we share our practical experiences of building an embedded inference engine using ARM Compute Library (ACL). The results show that, contradictory to conventional wisdoms, for simple models, it takes much less development time to build an inference engine from scratch compared to porting existing frameworks. In addition, by utilizing ACL, we managed to build an inference engine that outperforms TensorFlow by 25 %. Our conclusion is that, on embedded devices, we most likely will use very simple deep learning models for inference, and with well-developed building blocks such as ACL, it may be better in both performance and development time to build the engine from scratch.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for active inference, the selective acquisition of labels for cases at prediction time in lieu of using the estimated labels of a predictive model. The framework generalizes prior work on prediction time label acquisition. We develop techniques within this active inference framework for classifying streams, for example, for classifying web pages where online advertisements are being served. Such stream applications present novel complications; specifically, (i) we don't {{know at the time}} of any label acquisition decision what instances we will see, and (ii) instances repeat based on some unknown (and possibly skewed) distribution. To propose a solution, we combine ideas from decision theory, cost-sensitive learning, on-line density estimation, and on-line utility estimation. The resulting model tells which instances to label so {{that by the end of}} the budget period, the budget is best spent (in expectation). We test the method on streams from a real application and on partially synthetic streams. The main results show that: (1) active inference on streams can indeed reduce error cost substantially over not doing the on-line estimations, and (2) more sophisticated on-line estimation provides more reduction in error. We also discuss relationships with active learning: What if <b>you</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the model while doing the active inference?NYU Stern School of Business, Polytechnic Institute of New York Universit...|$|R
