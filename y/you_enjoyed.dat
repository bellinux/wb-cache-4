500|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Honey" [...] is a percussive, lighthearted love song that {{contains}} a sample of singer Nancy Wilson's 1978 song [...] "I'm in Love". The track opens with a reprise of [...] "Amerykahn Promise", with an announcer saying, [...] "We hope <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> your journey and now we’re putting control of you back to you", and a countdown leading to [...] "Honey". According to Badu, the song is about [...] "a lover, a fictitious character named Slim, who I'm chasing." [...] Allmusic's Andy Kellman commented that the song is included as an unlisted track as [...] "it doesn't fit into the album's fabric, what with its drifting, deeply sweetened, synth-squish-and-string-drift groove." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Segstack of GameSpot {{gave the}} game high marks, {{explaining}} {{that it is}} [...] "a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience. If <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> Myst, you'll thoroughly enjoy Riven." [...] Computer Gaming World stated that the graphics were the best they had seen in any adventure game. Laura Miller of Salon declared that [...] "Art [...] is what Riven approaches," [...] and praised the gameplay as having [...] "a graceful elegance that reminds [...] of a masterfully constructed novel." [...] The game's sound and graphics were consistently praised. Macworlds Michael Gowan highlighted the game's [...] "rich, engrossingly mysterious world", and {{he argued that the}} quality of its storytelling made Riven [...] "more like a good novel than a computer game." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) said there are no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy of your time. Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E

500|$|PC Zone {{stated that}} [...] "the taste {{left in the}} mouth is a bitter one", noting that [...] "Opposing Force is a few {{excellent}} ideas strung together by pedestrian Half-Life padding", but concluded that [...] "it was still a good weekend's worth of entertainment". Eurogamer stated that Opposing Force still had similar problems to other expansion packs, commenting that [...] "χ amount of new content has been created {{and it is going}} to be cut into the old content in a linear way to make it look like an all new game", but noted that [...] "fortunately though the new stuff in Opposing Force... is pretty damn good". Although praising the level design as the game's strongest point, the reviewer felt that [...] "towards the end of the game... they were running out of development time". Reviewing for IGN, Vincent Lopez stated that the game [...] "does a fantastic job of making you remember exactly why <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the original so much", but criticized this as the biggest drawback, commenting that [...] "you may find yourself wishing for a more original experience", but concluded that [...] "for good, and bad: it's good to be back".|$|E
500|$|... "Not Afraid" [...] was {{included}} on Eminem's set list {{as the final}} song before Eminem's [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] encore in his performance at the T in the Park festival, which took place on July10,2010. This would be his first European concert in five years. Eminem wore black shorts and a hoodie. He commented on the weather, saying, [...] "I know it's muddy and sloppy and shit but this is fun", and also thanked the crowd for supporting him. [...] "Everybody who's an Eminem fan, I just wanna say {{thank you so much}} for the support you've shown over the years, for not giving up on me," [...] he said, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the show as much as we did tonight. Peace." [...] At the end of the performance, Eminem said, [...] "Edin-borg, did you enjoy yourself tonight?" [...] That evening, members of the audience accused Eminem of lip syncing, but others defended him of such accusations. The T in the Park performance of [...] "Not Afraid" [...] is included as the second track on the [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] CD single. Eminem performed [...] "Not Afraid" [...] for a small audience in a small room at the beginning of the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards; he performed the song once again at the Los Angeles Nokia Theatre, the main site of the ceremony, and performed [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] with Barbadian singer Rihanna. The audience voted his performance the best with 34 percent of all votes.|$|E

2500|$|... 1UP.com's Ray Barnholt {{awarded the}} title an A rating and praised the single and {{multiplayer}} modes. Nick Chester of Destructoid {{called it a}} step up from Splosion Man. He noted that fans of the first will enjoy the game. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the developer's first incendiary platformer, you've got no excuse not to go pink for Ms. Splosion Man." [...] Official Xbox Magazines Tyler Cocke praised the wonderful levels, excellent humor and charm but criticized the long load times between levels and menus. Terry Terrones of GamePro praised the vast amount of content for the asking price. He stated it had [...] "a ton of great content to choose from, from concept art to videos and more." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2006, the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust {{posted a}} video of The Colbert Report on its website and sent out a mass email urging DeLay {{supporters}} to watch how [...] "Hollywood liberal" [...] Robert Greenwald [...] "crashed and burned [...] [...] [...] when promoting his new attack on Tom DeLay." [...] The video featured Colbert asking questions such as, [...] "Who hates America more, you or Michael Moore?" [...] The Trust's email describes its content as [...] "the truth behind Liberal Hollywood's" [...] , and characterizes the Colbert Report clip with the headline, [...] "Colbert Cracks the Story on Real Motivations Behind the Movie." [...] On June 8, 2006, Colbert responded by conducting an [...] "Exclusive Fake Interview" [...] on his show with DeLay. Three different interviews with DeLay on different networks were spliced for humorous effect, and Colbert ended the [...] "interview" [...] by saying [...] "I do hope <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> my manipulation of your words." [...] DeLay has since appeared as a guest on the program.|$|E
2500|$|Alan Brennert, {{one of the}} writer-producers {{who contributed}} to the series, wrote that the picture quality of the DVD set was [...] "NOT a 'bad transfer'" [...] but rather that the episodes were [...] "shot on film, but edited on video. In other words, the raw footage was 35mm film, which was then {{transferred}} to videotape. Editing, dubbing, special effects—everything was done on video. We were in fact the first drama series on television to do this. So unlike the original Rod Serling TZ, there are NO original film negatives from which Image could strike new prints for transfer. All that exist are the old one-inch master tapes, and the unfortunate reality is, videotape does deteriorate some over time. Image has, in my opinion, done a superb job packaging our series, {{and it is to}} them that I award the five stars in this review! If not for their interest in bringing this show to DVD, those one-inch masters might eventually have eroded into so much static (as my 3/4-inch tapes of the show already have)." [...] He concluded by saying [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> this series, just be grateful it's been preserved!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The overall {{reception}} of Art of Conquest was lukewarm. GameRankings averaged it at 66%, and Metacritic averaged it slightly lower, at 63%. IGN, {{who gave it}} a 7.8 out of 10, stated [...] "While it's a solid game, there's just not enough here to compel me to reawaken the substantial addiction the first game generated. Whether or not it's worth it for you to pick this one up depends almost entirely on how much <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the original game. With so few significant changes it plays almost exactly the same. For those who couldn't get enough of Empire Earth, the expansion should be a perfect fit. Just don't expect the breadth {{and scope of the}} first game." [...] Finally, GameSpot gave it a 5.2 out of 10, and said [...] "Ultimately, The Art of Conquest doesn't add enough to make much of a difference." [...] A notable criticism from GameSpot was regarding the way Space was implemented in the game. Spaceships were only available on certain maps and the gameplay was very similar to water—a dock-type building is built and spaceships travel much like naval ships. Other reviewers found fault with the game's price of 30 USD. The IGN reviewer said [...] "I like Art of Conquest enough but it just falls short of being worth the $30 price tag." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpot's Greg Mueller was {{extremely}} unimpressed, scoring the GameCube and PlayStation 2 versions 4.6 out of 10, and the Xbox version 4.3 out of 10. He accused {{the game of}} being [...] "so riddled with problems that {{it feels like it}} was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays." [...] He cited [...] "bugs that will make you randomly fall through the ground into a bunch of nothingness, bugs that make textures change when you {{get in and out of}} a car, bugs that cause you to inadvertently break a scripted sequence, thus making it impossible to complete a mission. There are also collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck on the edge of a platform. That's not all--the game will actually freeze up entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime: New York City should be avoided regardless of whether or not <b>you</b> <b>enjoyed</b> the first True Crime. The gameplay has a few almost-decent spots, but the technical problems far outweigh any faint hope this game ever had of being enjoyable. If you're curious about what a video game looks like before it goes through adequate testing and quality assurance, then by all means give this one a try." [...] He scored the PC version 5.2 out of 10, writing, [...] "while it manages to address some of the more egregious glitches that appeared in the console versions of the game, it still doesn't feel like a finished product." ...|$|E
