Everything you hear confounds <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> of how a pop song should be played, arranged and produced." [...] "The instrumental 'Touched' is especially startling", noted Martin Aston in Q, [...] "like a drunken fight between a syrupy Disney soundtrack and an Eastern mantra. All in all, Loveless amounts to a virtual reinvention of the guitar." ...|$|E

The Los Angeles Times Magazine, in a February 2011 online feature, named Cardinale among the 50 most beautiful women in film history. Cardinale said of her acting, [...] "I never felt scandal and confession were necessary to be an actress. I've never revealed my self or even my body in films. Mystery is very important." [...] In a 2014 interview, she revealed her secret of success: [...] "If you want to practise this craft, {{you have to have}} inner strength.

[...] However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game. Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. Linebacker Jack Ham told Cope, [...] "I think <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> stinks"; Ernie [...] "Fats" [...] Holmes was also against the idea.

500|$|In {{the debate}} over {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "redskin", team {{supporters}} frequently cite a paper by Ives Goddard, a Smithsonian Institution senior linguist and curator emeritus, who asserts that the term was a direct translation of words used by Native Americans to refer to themselves and was benign in its original meaning. In an interview Goddard admits that it is impossible to verify if the native words were accurately translated. Darren R. Reid, a history lecturer at Coventry University, contends that Native American usage was generally attributed to them by European writers. Reid states that the team logo works together with the name to reinforce an unrealistic stereotype: [...] "It is not up to non-Indians to define an idealized image of what it is to a Native American." [...] The [...] "positive" [...] stereotypes allow fans and supporters to honestly state that they are honoring Native Americans, but this is [...] "...forcing <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> of what it is to honour those people onto them and that, fundamentally, is disrespectful." ...|$|E

[...] C. W. Nevius of San Francisco Chronicle conveyed its [...] "funnier than the original." [...] Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide pronounced [...] "if this is <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> of fun, step right up." [...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as [...] "a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs." [...] Marc Savlov of Austin Chronicle admired how [...] "it is surprisingly good fun for {{the current crop of}} horror films, reasonably well-plotted and full of jaw-dropping, white-knuckle scares. That said, it’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended." [...] Nev Pierce of BBC saw that [...] "it's simple, but effective"; whereas Sheila Norman-Culp of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution proclaimed that [...] "what Final Destination did for the fear of flying, Final Destination 2 does for the fear of driving." ...|$|E

Madonna's {{publicist}} Liz Rosenberg showed concern at first due to [...] "what the parents of America's impressionable teens will soon be thinking" [...] but later said that it [...] "all depends on <b>your</b> <b>idea</b> of lovemaking, which in Madonna's case, should give {{new meaning to the}} word erotic".

2500|$|Soon {{after his}} return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was {{involved}} in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan {{that he was going to}} have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, [...] "Is this <b>your</b> <b>idea,</b> Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!" [...] After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, [...] "I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!" [...] This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the [...] "creative control" [...] clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, [...] "That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [...] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.|$|E
