500|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, the anti-German {{sentiment}} in Britain {{during the war}} is repeatedly referenced. General Melchett orders Blackadder {{to find out what}} is behind the leak in top-secret battle plans and immediately, though erroneously, pins it on a [...] "German spy" [...] (who is later discovered to be inadvertently one of their own). Blackadder takes the chance to [...] "interrogate" [...] Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is [...] "as British as Queen Victoria", to which Blackadder sarcastically replies [...] "So <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> German, you're half German and you married a German?". Blackadder's retort references the fact that Victoria {{was a member of the}} House of Hanover and that her husband was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria's grandson King George V changed the royal house name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings.|$|E
2500|$|Interpreting [...] the Gemara {{taught that}} until the time of Jacob, there was no illness (as one lived one's allotted years in health and then died suddenly). Then Jacob came and prayed, and illness came into being, as [...] reports, [...] "And one told Joseph, ‘Behold, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> sick'" [...] (reporting {{sickness}} {{for the first time}} in the Torah). Similarly, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer reported that from the creation of the Heaven and earth until then, no person had ever become ill. Rather, they would remain fit until the time they were to die. Then, wherever they would happen to be, they would sneeze, and their souls would depart through their noses. But then Jacob prayed, seeking mercy from God, asking that God not take his soul until he had an opportunity to charge his sons and all his household. And then, as [...] reports, [...] "And one told Joseph, ‘Behold, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>is</b> sick.'" [...] Therefore, a person is duty bound to say [...] "life!" [...] after another sneezes.|$|E
2500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{repeatedly}} {{spoke of}} forgiveness, [...] "Blessed are the merciful, for {{they will be}} shown mercy." [...] (NIV) [...] "Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift {{there in front of}} the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift." [...] (NIV) [...] "And when you stand praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins." [...] Mark 11:25 (NIV)* [...] "But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also." [...] Luke 6:27-29 (NIV) [...] "Be merciful, just as <b>your</b> <b>Father</b> <b>is</b> merciful." [...] Luke 6:36 (NIV) [...] "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven." [...] Luke 6:37 (NIV) ...|$|E

[...] She gave them food. [...] Then she said, [...] "Your father is , the Sun. [...] His dwelling is far to the east. [...] The way is long and dangerous. [...] Many monsters live between here and there. [...] And your father may try to harm you." [...] "Tell us how to go there," [...] said the twins.
