5|$|Of Human Feelings explores jazz-funk {{music and}} {{continues}} Coleman's harmolodic approach to improvisation with Prime Time, whom he introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in <b>Your</b> <b>Head.</b> He drew on {{rhythm and blues}} influences from {{early in his career}} for Of Human Feelings, which had shorter and more distinct compositions than Dancing in <b>Your</b> <b>Head.</b> Coleman also applied free jazz principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of funk.|$|E

5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking <b>your</b> <b>head</b> in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|Moon's {{friendship}} with Entwistle {{led to an}} appearance on Smash <b>Your</b> <b>Head</b> Against the Wall, Entwistle's first solo album and the first {{by a member of}} the Who. Moon did not play drums on the album; Jerry Shirley did, with Moon providing percussion. Rolling Stone's John Hoegel appreciated Entwistle's decision not to let Moon drum, saying that it distanced his album from the familiar sound of the Who.|$|E

5|$|Rock {{and metal}} festivals {{have become a}} {{constant}} for the band, that performed both in large open air meetings in Germany (Headbangers Open Air 2006, Bang <b>Your</b> <b>Head!!!</b> 2007, Wacken Open Air 2008 and Wacken Rocks 2009), France (Hellfest Summer Open Air 2009), England (Hard Rock Hell 2007 and 2009, Bloodstock Open Air 2009) and the USA (Power Box Festival 2007) and in smaller settings, like the Rock of Ages Fest in England in 2007 and the Metal Female Voices Fest in Belgium in 2008. Girlschool were opening act for Heaven & Hell in 2007, for Dio in 2008 and for Hawkwind and Motörhead in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Doro's album Fear No Evil was {{released}} in January 2009 and entered in many charts all over Europe. It was her last collaboration with guitarist Joe Taylor, who left to join Cycle of Pain. His place in the band {{was taken by the}} Dutch guitarist Bas Maas (ex-After Forever). The line-up of Pesch, Maas, Princiotta, Douglas and Dee went on a world tour for most of 2009 and 2010, reaching North and South America, Russia, China and, for the first time, Japan. Doro supported Saxon in their 2009 UK tour and Motörhead in Germany in 2010. During this prolonged time on the road, guitarist Princiotta was sometimes substituted by Robert Katrikh or by Harrison Young. Doro's band appeared at festivals all over the world, including Wacken Open Air and Metal Female Voices Fest 7 (where she dueted again with Tarja Turunen) in 2009, Hellfest in France, Bang <b>Your</b> <b>Head!!!</b> in Germany and Bloodstock Open Air in Great Britain in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese walking up tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E

And to look behind you, you've got to turn <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw.
