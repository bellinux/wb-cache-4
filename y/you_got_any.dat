Two of these featured his lyrics set to music by members of The Band: Danko wrote the music of [...] "This Wheel's on Fire"; Manuel, who composed [...] "Tears of Rage", described how Dylan [...] "came down to the basement with a piece of typewritten paper ... and he just said, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>any</b> music for this?' ... I had a couple of musical movements that fit ... so I just elaborated a bit, because I wasn't sure what the lyrics meant. I couldn't run upstairs and say, 'What's this mean, Bob: [...] "Now the heart is filled with gold {{as if it was a}} purse"? ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>any</b> of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope {{tell you what to}} do with the rest of your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} parties, one that {{supported}} the pretensions of King John I of Castile and the other, represented by the bourgeoisie of Lisbon, whose objective was to expel the foreigners from the government so that the kingdom would be governed only by the Portuguese. This party proposed the marriage of the dowager queen with the master of Aviz, the future King John I of Portugal, but Leonor rejected this proposal. In Lisbon, supporters of the master of Aviz who refused to recognize Beatriz as queen for fear of Portugal's loss of independence, organized a conspiracy to assassinate Juan Fernández de Andeiro. The first two attempts (one of them was organized by Leonor's brother, João Afonso Telo) failed. The third and last attempt took place on 6 December 1383. The master of Aviz gave him a thrust and once on the ground, Rui Pereira killed him. This happened in the royal palace next to Leonor's chamber. The master apologized for {{what had happened and}} asked her to prevent the Castilian king from entering the kingdom of Portugal. Leonor demanded that Andeiro be buried with dignity and said to him, [...] "And haven't <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>any</b> pity for that man lying there dead in such dishonor? Just for the sake of being a nobleman like you, take pity on him and have him buried; don't let him lie there so". He ignored her plea and Leonor was personally responsible for the burial of her friend that night in the Church of Saint Martin.|$|E

6000|$|... "You're {{just the}} same as all of them. You take all you can get, and you don't even say thank you. I've taught you {{everything}} you know. No one else would take any trouble with you.
