30|$|Imagine that {{somebody}} asks you the following question: “How successful has your occupational career been so far?” Would it {{be easy for}} you to answer this question or would you need considerable time to think about it? Which criteria would you apply? Would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> your bank-account, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> your reputation among colleagues, would <b>you</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> an ongoing project? Would you give a simple successful vs. unsuccessful answer or would you differentiate between several criteria? Which standard(s) of comparison would you use? Irrespective of how these questions will be answered people are no doubt concerned about their career success, they want to be successful and they want to feel successful. The meaning of career success is, however, not easy to grasp.|$|R

He seemed {{perfectly}} well-bred, but slightly heavy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now I wish {{to ask you}} {{one more}} question, which I wish you all to answer by your votes, honestly. It is this. Do you think that the real {{disorder}} which has been in this class, that is, the real cases which <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to,</b> when you stated to me, that you thought that the class was not in good order, have been now really exposed, so that I honestly and fully understand the case?

6000|$|... "No, no, dear Miss Henley," [...] she {{hastened to}} say; [...] "the inn {{is really a}} more clean and {{comfortable}} place than you suppose.

Do you know," [...] she continued, addressing herself to Mountjoy, [...] "that I was reminded {{of a friend of}} mine, when you spoke just now of the young gentleman whose adventures are in the newspapers. Is it possible that <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the brother of the present Earl of Norland? A handsome young Irishman--with whom I first became acquainted many years since. Am I right in supposing that you and Miss Henley know Lord Harry?" [...] she asked.|$|E

50|$|One {{may wonder}} why {{should there be}} yet another website for library as {{there is already a}} glut of sites for the same on internet. The most {{positive}} aspect of this library is that your reference to a particular book you are consulting is saved for your future reference. For example, if you are going through the author Ayatullah Sistani' Tauziul Masael, 'Fiqh' and left the book after flipping through 26 pages, this would be saved for your next reference. So if you log-in again after some time you need not bother to search the book and its pages <b>you</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> in your previous session again. You will automatically get down to the page you left unread in your earlier session that is page number 26 in the example here.|$|E
