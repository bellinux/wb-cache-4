The campaign's tagline was [...] "If {{you believe in the}} ability to destroy, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> in the ability to rebuild," [...] a saying of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, {{and by the end of}} October ten new members had joined. However, while all New Orleans synagogues lost membership after Katrina, as of 2007, Beth Israel was the only New Orleans synagogue that had not re-opened in its former location.|$|E
500|$|Producer and screenwriter David L. Paterson is the novel's author's son, and {{his name}} was {{featured}} on its dedication page. The story was based on his real life best friend, Lisa Hill, who was struck by lightning and killed {{when they were both}} eight years old. Paterson had asked his mother, Katherine Paterson, if he could write a screenplay of the novel, and she agreed [...] "not only because he's [...] son, but also because he's a very good playwright". Paterson had difficulty marketing the screenplay, mostly because of Leslie's death; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> this, I did meet with some companies that asked if I could just 'hurt' Leslie a little bit—put her in a light coma and then bring her out".|$|E
500|$|James Hunt, {{reviewing}} [...] "Sarek" [...] for Den of Geek in 2014, {{appreciated the}} episode's {{metaphor for the}} declining health of Gene Roddenberry. He {{felt that there was}} no follow-up to the emotional disturbances suffered by the crew, but said that despite this the episode worked {{because of the presence of}} Lenard as Sarek. He said that [...] "they cunningly build up [...] respect for Picard throughout the episode so that the proposed solution to his problem doesn't seem too far-fetched, and the rapport between Lenard and Stewart is so immediate that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> a literal mind-meld makes sense for the characters. It's not a perfect episode in terms of its writing, but the acting sells it far better than it could've." [...] In 2014, the episode was ranked as the 70th best out of the over 700 episodes in the Star Trek franchise by Charlie Jane Anders for io9.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe,</b> or almost believe, that you wish so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his review, Roger Ebert {{defended the}} artistic license of Russian roulette, arguing [...] "it is the {{organizing}} {{symbol of the}} film: Anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> about the game, about its deliberately random violence, about how it touches the sanity of men forced to play it, will apply to the war as a whole. It is a brilliant symbol because, {{in the context of}} this story, it makes any ideological statement about the war superfluous." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon Friedkin {{revealing}} his intentions to Clouzot, Clouzot was surprised Friedkin wanted to reimagine Wages of Fear because of enormous praise {{he had received}} at the time for his two recent pictures. Friedkin offered Clouzot {{a percentage of the}} film's shares, for which the French director was thankful. [...] In 2013, after a screening of Sorcerer at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Friedkin mentioned that he [...] "went to Georges Arnaud's home through his attorney, and he was very pleased to have this done because he didn't like Clouzot's film, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> that".|$|E
2500|$|About this time, John Phillips' new band, [...] "The New Journeymen", {{needed a}} {{replacement}} for tenor Marshall Brickman. [...] Brickman had left the folk trio {{to pursue a career}} in television writing, and the group needed a quick replacement for their remaining tour dates. [...] Doherty, then unemployed, filled the opening. [...] After the New Journeymen called it quits as a band in early 1965, Elliot was invited into the formation of a new band, which became [...] "The Magic Cyrcle". Six months later in September 1965, the group signed a recording contract with Dunhill Records. Changing their name to The Mamas & the Papas, the band soon began to record their debut album, If <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Believe</b> Your Eyes and Ears. The Mamas & the Papas song [...] "Creeque Alley" [...] briefly outlines this history.|$|E

This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's what I used to be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E

2500|$|Obama and Clinton {{were in a}} {{statistical}} dead heat in Texas, according to a poll released February 25, 2008. During Obama's sweep of February's post-Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, the March 4 primaries of Texas and Ohio were seen as a firewall for the Clinton campaign. In early polls for these states, Clinton held double digit leads in polls for those states, {{but by the end}} of February Obama had started to erode Clinton's lead in her key demographics, and her lead had been reduced to single digits in some polls. In response to Obama's increases, Clinton's campaign began to increase their attacks on him, including an accusation of plagiarism due to similarities in Obama's campaign speeches and campaign speeches of Obama's campaign's national co-chair and Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, although Patrick specifically stated he told Obama to use it. During the February 21, CNN-Univision debate in Austin, Texas Obama responded to the accusation by saying, [...] "The notion that I had plagiarized from somebody who's one of my national co-chairs, who gave me the line and suggested that I use it, I think is silly." [...] Clinton received a round of boos from the crowd when she responded, [...] "Lifting whole passages from someone else's speeches is not change <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> in; it's change you can Xerox." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{series has}} {{attracted}} mostly positive reviews, largely {{focused on the}} depiction of its two septuagenarian lead characters. Jane Shilling of The Daily Telegraph labelled the series [...] "a triumph against TV's ageism" [...] in {{an examination of the}} portrayal of elderly people in the media. Shilling singled out Jacobi and Reid's performances, stating that they provide a [...] "mixture of gravity and levity" [...] that [...] "brings a transcendent quality to their characters' resolute ordinariness". Lucy Harmer, an executive member of the charity Age UK, also praised the series for portraying two [...] "normal, healthy and sane" [...] older characters, citing the depiction of Internet use by the elderly as something ordinary. She compared the treatment of older characters in the series to Hilary Boyd's novel Thursdays in the Park and the film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2012). The Huffington Posts Caroline Frost thought the series was reminiscent of the dialogue and sensibility of the playwright Alan Bennett. She wrote the story was poignant and praised a central theme underlining [...] "how many people make do with their day-to-day business and responsibilities, while still holding on to their private dreams", Andrew Anthony of The Guardian had his [...] "low expectations... squarely confounded", giving particular praise to the dialogue and the central performances. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror felt that Last Tango in Halifax experienced a mid-series dip, though she praised what she felt was a triumphant finale. She also praised Wainwright's script and the lead quartet of Jacobi, Reid, Lancashire, and Walker for creating [...] "characters <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>believe</b> in even when they're behaving appallingly". The series was reviewed favourably by the American website AfterEllen, which reports on the depiction of gay and bisexual women in the media. Correspondent Jill Guccini stated that she [...] "started off watching this series thinking it was a cute little show about some oldies falling in love", {{but at the end of}} the series believed it was [...] "some of the finest television I've seen, anywhere, ever".|$|E
