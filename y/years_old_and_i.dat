5|$|He later {{spoke on}} the {{background}} of the album's sound, saying, I'm 28 <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> see that I'm kind of in this weird position. I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it did to me, and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E
500|$|Waxy first {{stood at}} Lewes {{for a fee}} of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings. In September 1803, Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot, an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian turfman John Tayloe. Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy, writing to Tayloe, [...] "he has lost an eye, and is {{thirteen}} <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think his health bad." [...] Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy's half-sister Keren Happuch who was covered by Waxy that year. It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye, its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803. Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804, and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket. Under the Duke's ownership, his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season.|$|E

500|$|No {{one in my}} {{large family}} wrote poetry. But the first Russian woman poet, Anna Bunina, was the aunt of my {{grandfather}} Erasm Ivanovich Stogov. The Stogovs were modest landowners in the Mozhaisk region of the Moscow Province. They were moved here after the insurrection {{during the time of}} Posadnitsa Marfa. In Novgorod they had been a wealthier and more distinguished family. Khan Akhmat, my ancestor, was killed one night in his tent by a Russian killer-for-hire. Karamzin tells us that this marked the end of the Mongol yoke on Russia. [...] It was well known that this Akhmat was a descendant of Genghiz Khan. In the eighteenth century, one of the Akhmatov Princesses – Praskovia Yegorovna – married the rich and famous Simbirsk landowner Motovilov. Yegor Motovilov was my great-grandfather; his daughter, Anna Yegorovna, was my grandmother. She died when my mother was nine <b>years</b> <b>old,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was named in her honour. Several diamond rings and one emerald were made from her brooch. Though my fingers are thin, still her thimble didn't fit me.|$|E
500|$|Van Leer's only {{comment to}} the media came on Saturday, December 3, 1955: [...] "I am 60 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have never broken a contract. I {{do not intend to}} start now". At a tense meeting of the Board of Regents on Monday, it was decided that Georgia Tech would be allowed to play in the Sugar Bowl. The new policy was that [...] "all laws, customs and traditions of host states would be {{respected}} but all games played in Georgia would be segregated", a policy that would remain until 1963. The regents, with the exception of Tech alumnus David Rice, condemned the [...] "riotous" [...] behavior of Tech students. Rice instead criticized Marvin Griffin, and was lauded by The Technique as the [...] "only man with the moral conviction to stand up against Griffin,... and co". Ironically, Tech defeated Pittsburgh 7–0 because of a pass interference call on the black player. Van Leer died six weeks after this incident, on January 23, 1956; the stress of the controversy was believed to have shortened his life.|$|E

2500|$|Starting on August 3, 1948, during further HUAC hearings, Bentley {{received}} corroboration from Whittaker Chambers, who, under subpoena by HUAC, {{testified that}} he knew at lest two of Bentley contacts, Victor Perlo and Charles Kramer as communists and members of his earlier Ware Group. He also supported her charge that Harry Dexter White, a prominent economist who {{had worked in the}} Treasury Department, was a Communist sympathizer. [...] Of his testimony compared to hers, Chambers wrote in his memoir: [...] I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. [...] The things that I had to tell were ten <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.|$|E

She gave an interview to The Guardian in which she lamented the lack of technique in young opera singers and the dearth of good teachers.

[...] The Cardiff Singer of the World competition was the one that Sutherland was most closely associated with after her retirement. She began her regular involvement with the event in 1993, serving on the jury five consecutive times and later, in 2003, becoming its patron.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Santos took on {{the lead}} role in Joel Lamangan's drama Sabel. Based in part on Joanne Woodward's The Three Faces of Eve, the film, under the {{manuscript}} of Ricky Lee, stars Santos as the titular lead who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder—eventually charged with murder. Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B. Zulueta of The Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked [...] "It [...] is absorbing to watch because of its assay at the riddle of sexuality {{as well as the}} performance of Santos". Asked about her significant career milestone, Santos stated [...] " [...] I feel that this is my transition film because {{this is the first time}} I did a film like this. I'm already 26 <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think it is hightime that I do films like this."

Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do you think you have a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in".
