500|$|Abbott is the {{inventor}} of a style of maze called logic mazes. A logic maze has a set of rules, ranging from the basic (such as [...] "you cannot make left turns") to the extremely complicated. These mazes are also called [...] "Multi-State mazes". [...] The reason for this name is that sometimes you can return to a position you were in before, but be traveling in a different direction. That change in direction can {{put you in a}} different state and open up different choices for you. One example, from the book SuperMazes, would be a rolling-die maze. Where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> from a particular square depends on what number is facing up on the die. If you return to that same square, the die may be in a different state, with a different number on top. Thus, you would have different options than the first time.|$|E
500|$|Drummer Mullen said of {{the song}} in 1983:"We're into the {{politics}} of people, we're not into politics. Like you talk about Northern Ireland, 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' people sort of think, 'Oh, that time when 13 Catholics were shot by British soldiers'; that's not what the song is about. That's an incident, the most famous incident in Northern Ireland and it's the strongest way of saying, 'How long? How long {{do we have to}} put up with this?' I don't care who's who – Catholics, Protestants, whatever. You know people are dying every single day through bitterness and hate, and we're saying why? What's the point? And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> that into places like El Salvador and other similar situations – people dying. Let's forget the politics, let's stop shooting each other and sit around the table and talk about it... There are a lot of bands taking sides saying politics is crap, etc. Well, so what! The real battle is people dying, that's the real battle." ...|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{performed}} [...] "All Around the World" [...] at the Capital FM Summertime Ball 2012. For the performance, he sported fingerless gloves, a Union Jack {{tank with}} matching vest, and jeans. The singer also performed the track during a promotional concert in Europe on June 4, 2012, along with [...] "Boyfriend" [...] and [...] "Die in Your Arms". Bieber also performed [...] "All Around the World" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend" [...] at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards on June 17. The song {{is also used}} as Bieber's 2012–13 Believe Tour's opening song. Entering from the upper portion of the arena, Bieber was lowered onto {{the center of the}} stage wearing a massive pair of charcoal-colored wings. He was quickly joined by a troupe of male backing dancers as the song was played. Fireworks exploded, laser lights shot wildly from the ceiling, confetti fell to the floor and plumes of smoke were released {{from the bottom of the}} stage. Sophie A. Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review for the performance and wrote that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> past Justin Bieber’s bizarre stage entrance, flying in on a set of ginormous metal wings to the tune of 'All Around the World', it's hard not to smile at his show".|$|E

500|$|Yuji Horii, {{a fan of}} {{time travel}} fiction (such as the TV series The Time Tunnel), fostered a theme of time travel in his general story outline of Chrono Trigger with input from Akira Toriyama. Horii liked the {{scenario}} of the grandfather paradox surrounding Marle. Concerning story planning, Horii commented, [...] "If there's a fairground, I just write that there's a fairground; I don't write down any of the details. Then the staff brainstorm {{and come up with}} a variety of attractions to put in." [...] Sakaguchi contributed some minor elements, including the character Gato; he liked Marle's drama and reconciliation with her father. Masato Kato subsequently edited and completed the outline by writing the majority of the game's story, including all the events of the 12,000 BC era. He took pains to avoid what he described as [...] "a long string of errands... 'do this', 'take this', 'defeat these monsters', or 'plant this flag'." [...] Kato and other developers held a series of meetings to ensure continuity, usually attended by around 30 personnel. Kato and Horii initially proposed Crono's death, though they intended he stay dead; the party would have retrieved an earlier, living version of him to complete the quest. Square deemed the scenario too depressing and asked that Crono be brought back to life later in the story. Kato also devised the system of multiple endings because he could not branch the story out to different paths. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita then wrote various subplots. They also devised an [...] "Active Time Event Logic" [...] system, [...] "where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> your character around during scenes, even when an NPC is talking to you", and with players [...] "talking to different people and steering the conversation in different directions", allowing each scene to [...] "have many permutations." [...] Kato became friends with composer Yasunori Mitsuda during development, and they would collaborate on several future projects. Katsuhisa Higuchi programmed the battle system, which hosted combat on the map without transition to a special battleground as most previous Square games had done. Higuchi noted extreme difficulty in loading battles properly without slow-downs or a brief, black loading screen. The game's use of animated monster sprites consumed much more memory than previous Final Fantasy games, which used static enemy graphics.|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, Jackson {{unveiled}} an edgier image, flaunting hennaed {{red hair}} and tattoos on her neck, wrist, foot, back, and lower thigh; also acquiring nipple, septum, and labia piercings. The transition was considered to risk alienation, though she was commended as [...] "a master at surprising and shocking her public". Jackson used {{a variation of the}} Akan Sankofa symbol throughout its artwork and imagery; representing the motif [...] "You cannot move into the future until you learn from your past". She tattooed the symbol onto her wrist, saying, [...] " [...] appeared on my album The Velvet Rope and it's very important to me. [...] It's about going into your past and dealing with it so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> forward". Jackson's tattoo artist later stated, [...] "I {{have a lot of people}} who fly in from all over the world to get something that has to do with Janet’s sacred tattoos... She's an inspiration to a lot of people, and when they see something on Janet that helps her be strong, they want that strength as well".|$|E

2500|$|Stuart now {{sought to}} take a useful role in the {{campaign}} and perhaps, according to some historians, to redeem his reputation and to secure the glory of another ride around the Union Army. On June 22, Lee gave Stuart discretionary orders for his movement to Pennsylvania with the important point being: [...] "If you find that he [...] is moving northward, and that two brigades can guard the Blue Ridge {{and take care of}} your rear, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> with the other three into Maryland, and take position on General Ewell's right." [...] Lee wrote to Stuart again on June 23 in an apparent effort to clarify his orders as follows: [...] "You will, however, be able to judge whether you can pass around their Army without hindrance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell's troops." [...] Lee's orders did not give Stuart a specific route to follow. Confederate Colonel Edward Porter Alexander, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, stated [...] "Stuart made to Lee a very unwise proposition, which Lee more unwisely entertained." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot, who {{awarded the}} GameCube version 6.5 out of 10 and the PS2 version 5.4. They found the technical {{issues of the}} game to be too significant; [...] "Bounty Hunter suffers from an array of technical problems that have plagued other third-person action games. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> the camera perspective using the right analog stick, but the camera will still cause you some major headaches when in tight corridors or when trying to draw a bead on a specific enemy. Often it'll automatically swivel to point you in entirely the wrong direction. Clipping and collision-detection issues also abound." [...] They also criticized the graphics and the overall gameplay, concluding that [...] "Star Wars Bounty Hunter may have all the basic ingredients needed for a solid third-person action game, but it falls flat in the execution and is far too often cumbersome, confusing, or {{in some other way}} un-fun to be recommendable on its own merits. Serious Star Wars aficionados should enjoy the game's story, but they'll be forced to slog through a lot of tedious action to see how it pans out." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Impossible" [...] is a midtempo R ballad {{written by}} Arnthor Birgisson and Ina Wroldsen, {{in the musical}} key of A♭ major with a time {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The melody is to be played in a moderate tone and tempo. The song's backing track consists of a simple chord progression of A♭E♭D♭Fm7. It was conceived after Shontelle stated that she felt that radio was currently missing a [...] "heartbreak ballad". In an interview with J-14 magazine she said [...] "I {{knew that there was}} no song out there for heartbroken people. I just wanted to put a song out that gave people hope - things may not work out the way you want them to, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> past it and everything is gonna be okay... draw the strength to carry on past a break up where you're the one in the embarrassing position." [...] Shontelle uses a vocal range from E♭3 to D♭5 in the song. Billboards Michael Menachem described her vocal precision as similar to that of Beyoncé's in [...] "Irreplaceable". Meanwhile, the production, helmed by Birgisson, was compared to Norwegian production team, StarGate who are, coincidentally, the team responsible for producing [...] "Irreplaceable".|$|E

Cao Cao is becoming increasingly arrogant and he'll eventually usurp the throne. The southern territories in Jing Province are accessible in terms of travelling by land or water. The western domain of the Empire lies there. Based on my observation of Liu Biao, he'll not last long while his sons are of inferior quality and cannot inherit his jurisdiction. My lord, you should take control of these lands soon, lest Cao Cao seizes them later. The best plan now is to attack Huang Zu first. Huang Zu is old and muddleheaded. He lacks funding and supplies, cheats those around them, and is only concerned with making personal gains. His subordinates are already unhappy with {{him because of his}} overbearing demands. His warships and military equipment are damaged and have not been repaired; he neglects agriculture; his army is ill-disciplined. If you attack him now, you'll surely win. After defeating him, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>move</b> west further and take control of Chu Pass (楚關) and expand your domain and influence.

When Abagnale is arrested by the feds in the opening scene, he takes the {{opportunity}} to tell his own story from the beginning in the style of a '60s TV show. Why a TV show and not a Broadway play? I have no idea. Perhaps composer Marc Shaiman is just accustomed to the idiom since '60s TV factored so largely in his Tony-winning hit Hairspray. Shaiman has also conceived the music as a pastiche of early '60s musical styles, all of them curiously pre-rock. Unfortunately, this makes the score seem even more old-fashioned than some of the musicals genuinely from that era (like the current hit revival How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying). Under the direction of Jack O'Brien, though, Catch Me If <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>moves</b> mostly in fits and starts. But the creators of Catch Me If <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> have rigged the game against them. What should have been a fun lark of a story seems almost stodgy, like your grandmother's idea of a good time." ...|$|R
