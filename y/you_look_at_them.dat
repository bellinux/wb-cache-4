2500|$|An {{exhibition}} of Doherty's paintings titled, [...] "Art of the Albion", {{took place at}} the Galerie Chappe in Paris from 25 April to 25 May 2008. The exhibit caused controversy due to artworks made with Doherty's own blood. According to newspapers, anti-drug campaigners were enraged and accused Doherty of glamourising illegal substance abuse. Art experts were similarly unimpressed. David West, the owner of London's Decima gallery, for example, slammed his work: [...] "It's not got any artistic merit. He's using his blood to make them interesting, but when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> they're what any four-year-old can do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keeping {{called his}} {{completed}} illustrations for The God Beneath the Sea [...] "a {{set of drawings}} much to my disgust not all awfully good." [...] He saw them as violent and cruel illustrations of violent and cruel people, and attempted to visually project this by taking [...] "a symbolic line, so if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> you will find there's a symbolic overtone in them." [...] At {{the time of the}} book's publication, Keeping was looking forward to working with the authors on the sequel The Golden Shadow, as he hoped [...] "to redeem some of the mistakes of the first one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Neighing at your lyrics, Pierre. Come, {{let us be}} off. Here, the shawl, the parasol, the basket: {{what are}} <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> so for?" ...|$|R
2500|$|He {{is remembered}} {{as both a}} genius and a [...] [...] One of his {{favorite}} insults was to refer to people he did not approve of as [...] "spherical bastards", because, he explained, they were bastards no matter which way <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} do you mean?" [...] he asked. [...] "You didn't get them back! Why, {{there they are}} before your eyes! We found <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> when we came in." [...] By this time I had {{recovered}} my surprise and had my wits about me.|$|R
2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think the longer <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> the thornier they get".|$|E
60|$|But all {{governments and}} rulers and ruling classes when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> closely are incredible....|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' he {{said with}} decision. 'I {{absolutely}} refuse to let <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> till the game is over. I know your temperament.' ...|$|E
60|$|Burchard {{had every}} nettle rooted up for three leagues round. Scarcely {{had they been}} torn from the soil when they sowed {{themselves}} afresh, and grew as <b>you</b> were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand towards the {{squatting}} negroes. [...] "Señores," [...] he said turning to the officers, [...] "I would ask <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and tell me if the thing appears reasonable." ...|$|R
6000|$|Margaret squealed in delight. [...] "Girls, look here. Valentines! Did <b>you</b> ever?... <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them....</b> And what's this?... 'Wonders of Nature--composition by Margaret Maynard.' Heavens! Did I write that? And what's this sear {{and yellow}} document?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; no; {{but there}} are men of whom you are sure, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> that they'll be successful. I don't suppose he was {{anything}} to begin with, but see where he is now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is necessary, you know, {{that the}} jury should hear you, and if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and speak to them, they would stand a better chance." [...] Kenneby for a moment allowed his eye to travel up to the jury box, but it {{instantly}} fell again, and fixed itself on the lawyer's face. [...] "You do remember that trial?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In like manner, a gentian {{does not}} produce the {{sensation}} of blueness if you don't look at it. But it has always the power of doing so; its particles being everlastingly so arranged by its Maker. And, therefore, the gentian and the sky are always verily blue, whatever philosophy may say to the contrary; {{and if you do}} not see them blue when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> it is not their fault but yours.[52] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was so {{beautiful}} in the spring," [...] Janet continued, dropping the coat she held into the drawer. [...] "And it wasn't just {{the trees and the}} grass with the yellow dandelions, it was the houses, too--I've often wondered why those houses pleased me so much. I wanted to live in every one of them. Do you know that feeling?" [...] Mrs. Maturin nodded. [...] "They didn't hurt your eyes when <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> and they seemed to be so much at home there, even the new ones. The new ones were like the children of the old." ...|$|R
60|$|HER HUSBAND. Yes. Would <b>you</b> like to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> {{a little}} closer? [He proffers them under Henry's nose].|$|R

60|$|So {{much for}} the {{eighteenth-century}} novelists. They have a shelf of their own in the case, and a corner of their own in my brain. For years you may never think of them, and then suddenly some stray word or train of thought leads straight to them, and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and love them, and rejoice that you know them. But let us pass to something which may interest you more.|$|E
6000|$|... 180. Here {{are five}} frames, {{containing}} the best representations I can get for {{you of the}} façade of the cathedral of Orvieto. I must remind you, before I let <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{of the reason why}} that cathedral was built; for I have at last got {{to the end of the}} parenthesis which began in my second lecture, on the occasion of our hearing that John of Pisa was sent for to Perugia, to carve the tomb of Pope Urban IV.; and we must now know who this Pope was.|$|E
60|$|Others, more {{recently}} {{reduced to the}} ranks of Rover's retinue, take their medicine sulkily and fiercely. They play the dog {{on the end of}} their line with the pleasure felt by the girl out fishing when she catches a sea-robin on her hook. They glare at you threateningly if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> as if it would be their delight to let slip the dogs of war. These are half-mutinous dogmen, not quite Circe-ized, and you will do well not to kick their charges, should they sniff around your ankles.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll do it, Judith; I'll do it," [...] {{returned}} the patient Deerslayer, [...] "but if there's many more letters to read, {{we shall see}} the sun ag'in afore you've got through with the reading of them! Two good hours have <b>you</b> been <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> bits of papers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] {{returned}} Thatcher with {{a slight}} yawn. [...] "I've got here some papers somewhere;"--he began to feel in his coat pocket languidly;--"but, by the way, this is a rather dreary and God-forsaken sort of place! Let's go up to Welker's, and <b>you</b> can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> over a bottle of champagne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>look</b> to <b>them</b> <b>at</b> South Kensington, to do {{something}} for you--a hundred a year or so, when your scholarship is up?" ...|$|R
60|$|From those {{peaceful}} homes, and {{the envy}} they inspire (two trunks and a walking-stick {{and a bit}} of pine forest in British Columbia are not satisfactory, any way <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them),</b> I turned me to the lake front of Buffalo, where the steamers bellow to the grain elevators, and the locomotives yell to the coal-shutes, and the canal barges jostle the lumber-raft half a mile long as it snakes across the water in tow of a launch, and earth, and sky, and sea alike are thick with smoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose there's a brown calf and a {{big brown}} dog, and an artist is making a picture of them. What is the MAIN thing that that artist has got to do? He has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> hain't he? Of course. Well, then, do {{you want him to}} go and paint BOTH of them brown? Certainly you don't. He paints one of them blue, and then you can't make no mistake. It's just the same with the maps. That's why they make every State a {{different}} color; it ain't to deceive you, it's to keep you from deceiving yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no such payment demanded for {{the things}} I am {{thinking}} of," [...] John assured his brother. [...] "Take art, for instance: We reach the fringe of it with our books. There are pictures, even here in London, which when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> especially with one who understands, give a new vigor to your understanding, a new resource to living. You become conscious of a new beauty in the world, a new garden, as it were, into which one can wander every day and yet not explore it in a lifetime. I have seen enough, Stephen, to {{make me want to}} go to Italy. It's a shameful thing to keep one's brain and taste unemployed!" ...|$|E
50|$|One {{of those}} bands was Refused 13 from Nakhipot, Lalitpur. The band had played their first gig opening for Dead Soul (on Metallica Anthology Concert, 2001). The band started {{creating}} a formidable {{reputation in the}} valley as a very “tight” metal band with an in-your-face attitude, conceived {{by many as the}} band to pick metal where Dead Soul had left and then elevate the scene into another level. During the band’s active years, the band organized another memorable gig “Keep Suffering” at Nakhipot. Anuraag Pokhrel, former vocalist of Albatross on the band says, “Refused 13 was definitely a force - the band and the persona of the band. I still remember that when they would walk into a concert, I would try to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> without getting caught, because they were Refused13 and they looked like hardcore badasses that would kill <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> wrong”.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>you</b> {{would have}} <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> more curiously yet, {{if you could}} have guessed what I have to tell you,' said her friend. 'One of those houses is mine.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my pet" [...] {{said the}} captain, seating {{her on his}} knee, [...] "here are some kickshaws from foreign parts for you; but before letting <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>'em,</b> I must explain why I asked you to meet me here {{instead of going to}} see you as usual in London. The fact is, I had bin longing to take you with me my next voyage, {{and it would have been}} handier to have you by me here when we're getting ready for sea, but--but, the fact is, things have taken a sudden turn, and--and--in short, {{circumstances}} have come about that I can't speak of just now; only I'm not quite so sure about going to sea as I was an hour ago. But you don't seem to jump at the notion, Polly. Surely you'd have liked to go--wouldn't you?" ...|$|R
60|$|If {{you look}} from some {{distance}} at these two engravings of Greek coins, (place the book open {{so that you}} can see the opposite plate three or four yards off,) you will find the relief on each of them simplifies itself into a pearl-like portion of a sphere, with exquisitely gradated light on its surface. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> nearer, you will see that each smaller portion into which they are divided--cheek, or brow, or leaf, or tress of hair--resolves itself also into a rounded or undulated surface, pleasant by gradation of light. Every several surface is delightful in itself, as a shell, or a tuft of rounded moss, or the bossy masses of distant forest would be. That these intricately modulated masses present some resemblance to a girl's face, such as the Syracusans imagined that of the water-goddess Arethusa, is entirely a secondary matter; the primary condition is that the masses shall be beautifully rounded, and disposed with due discretion and order.|$|E
60|$|Why do the beggars rap their chins constantly, {{with their}} right hands, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them?</b> Everything {{is done in}} {{pantomime}} in Naples, {{and that is the}} conventional sign for hunger. A man who is quarrelling with another, yonder, lays the palm of his right hand {{on the back of his}} left, and shakes the two thumbs--expressive of a donkey's ears--whereat his adversary is goaded to desperation. Two people bargaining for fish, the buyer empties an imaginary waistcoat pocket when he is told the price, and walks away without a word: having thoroughly conveyed to the seller that he considers it too dear. Two people in carriages, meeting, one touches his lips, twice or thrice, holding up the five fingers of his right hand, and gives a horizontal cut in the air with the palm. The other nods briskly, and goes his way. He has been invited to a friendly dinner at half-past five o'clock, and will certainly come.|$|E
6000|$|The {{collection}} {{is one of}} the most celebrated in the world, and contains between eight and nine hundred pictures, many of which are esteemed masterpieces. I think I was not in a frame for admiration to-day, nor could achieve that free and generous surrender of myself which I have already said is essential to the proper estimate of anything excellent. Besides, how is it possible to give one's soul, or any considerable part of it, to a single picture, seen for the first time, among a thousand others, all of which set forth their own claims in an equally good light? Furthermore, there is an external weariness, and sense of a thousand-fold sameness to be overcome, before we can begin to enjoy a gallery of the old Italian masters. [...] . I remember but one painter, Francia, who seems really to have approached this awful class of subjects (Christs and Madonnas) in a fitting spirit; his pictures are very singular and awkward, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> with merely an external eye, but they are full of the beauty of holiness, and evidently wrought out as acts of devotion, with the deepest sincerity; and are veritable prayers upon canvas. [...] .|$|E
6000|$|If {{you ever}} happen {{to meet with}} the two volumes of [...] "Grimm's German Stories," [...] which were {{illustrated}} by him long ago, pounce upon them instantly; the etchings in them are the finest things, next to Rembrandt's, that, as far as I know, have been done since etching was invented. <b>You</b> cannot <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> too much, nor copy them too often.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have told}} Markham,' said he presently, 'to send you my desk. There {{are all sorts}} of things in it, just as I threw them in when I cleared out my rooms at Oxford. I had rather nobody but you saw some of them. There is nothing of any importance, so <b>you</b> may <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> when <b>you</b> please, or not at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some have a {{great deal}} of money inside them, and some only a few pennies. Others are stuffed with cards and samples and papers," [...] said the Queen. [...] "I would take <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> but we should have to climb over a hill of lost needles, and I fear our overshoes would not protect us from their sharp points." ...|$|R
