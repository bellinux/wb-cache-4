5|$|Vonnegut {{published}} his first novel, Player Piano, in 1952. The novel was reviewed positively, {{but was not}} commercially successful. In the nearly 20 years that followed, Vonnegut published several novels that were only marginally successful, such as Cat's Cradle (1963) and God Bless <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rosewater (1964). Vonnegut's magnum opus, however, was his immediately successful sixth novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. The book's antiwar sentiment resonated with its readers amidst the ongoing Vietnam War, and its reviews were generally positive. After its release, Slaughterhouse-Five went {{to the top of}} The New York Times Best Seller list, thrusting Vonnegut into fame. He was invited to give speeches, lectures, and commencement addresses around the country and received many awards and honors.|$|E

25|$|In tiny villages {{where there}} was no {{permanent}} Nazi military presence, such as Dąbrowa Rzeczycka, Kępa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the lives of their communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue, was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used the threat of violence against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety. Polish-born Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Natan Gross, in his 2001 book Who Are <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grymek?, told of a village near Warsaw where a local Nazi collaborator was forced to flee when it became known he reported the location of a hidden Jew.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut based {{the title}} {{character}} of God Bless <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rosewater (1964), on an accountant he knew on Cape Cod, who specialized in clients in trouble and often had to comfort them. Eliot Rosewater, the wealthy son of a Republican senator, seeks to atone for his wartime killing of noncombatant firefighters by serving in a volunteer fire department, and by giving away money to those in trouble or need. Stress from a battle for control of his charitable foundation pushes him over the edge, and he is placed in a mental hospital. He recovers, and ends the financial battle by declaring the children of his county to be his heirs. Allen deemed God Bless <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rosewater more [...] "a cry from the heart than a novel under its author's full intellectual control", that reflected family and emotional stresses Vonnegut was going through at the time.|$|E
500|$|A book, {{entitled}} I'll Miss <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper {{and based}} upon the script for the episode, was published in 1984. [...] The book was also written by Stiles.

Rumfoord is described, [...] "he put a cigarette in a long, bone cigarette holder, lighted it. He thrust out his jaw. The cigarette holder pointed straight up." [...] William Rodney Allen, in his guide to Vonnegut's works, stated that Rumfoord foreshadowed the fictional political figures who would play major roles in God Bless <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rosewater and Jailbird.|$|E
500|$|When Debs was {{released}} from the Atlanta Penitentiary, the other prisoners sent him off with [...] "a roar of cheers" [...] and a crowd of 50,000 greeted his return to Terre Haute to the accompaniment of band music.

500|$|An't {{with a long}} [...] "a" [...] sound {{began to}} be written as ain't, which first appears in writing in 1749. By the time ain't appeared, an't was already being used for am not, are not, and is not. An't and ain't coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century—Charles Dickens used the terms interchangeably, as in Chapter 13, Book the Second of Little Dorrit (1857): [...] "'I guessed it was <b>you,</b> <b>Mr</b> Pancks," [...] said she, 'for it's quite your regular night; ain't it? ... An't it gratifying, Mr Pancks, though; really?'". In the English lawyer William Hickey's memoirs (1808–1810), ain't appears as a {{contraction}} of aren't; [...] "thank God we're all alive, ain't we..." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1926 Imperial Conference {{confirmed}} that Britain and her dominions were rapidly diverging in interests and that greater independence not greater cooperation {{was the most}} practical solution. Bruce recognised the empire had reached a turning point, but despite his optimism for a reinvigorated imperial system, there was little interest from other governments. His plan for greater economic and defensive cooperation was discussed, {{as well as a}} revival of imperial preference in trading arrangements, but such ideas were now politically unpalatable in Britain and failed to develop. His attitudes were almost the opposite of those held by the leaders of Canada, South Africa and the Irish Free State. As Prime Minister Baldwin remarked at the conference, [...] "If <b>you,</b> <b>Mr</b> Bruce, would use the word 'Empire' a bit less and <b>you</b> <b>Mr</b> McGilligan would use it a bit more, then we would make better progress." [...] Ultimately proposals for greater independence won out, and 1926 Imperial Conference recognised through the Balfour Declaration that dominions were essentially independent entities that freely associated as the British Commonwealth of Nations, though after much negotiation it stopped short of using the terms nation or state. Governors-General were redefined as representatives only of the British monarch, not the British government, and were obliged now to act only on the advice of their respective dominion governments. These changes were both symbolically and practically significant in the transformation of the dominions from colonies to independent nations. Bruce had mixed feelings about these developments; on the one hand he believed that the Empire was still a strong and vital international organization playing a positive role in international affairs, {{but on the other hand}} he was disappointed that other member nations did not share his vision or commitment to maintaining its integrity and unity. Bruce did have some successes at the conference, however, expanding the work of the Imperial Economic Committee and increasing inter-empire cooperation in technical and scientific areas.|$|E
500|$|During the over, another rising Larwood {{delivery}} {{knocked the}} bat out of Woodfull's hands. He batted for 89 minutes, being hit {{a few more}} times before Allen bowled him for 22. Later in the day, Pelham Warner, one of the England managers, visited the Australian dressing room. He expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see <b>you,</b> <b>Mr</b> Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
500|$|... "Ballad of a Thin Man" [...] {{is driven}} by Dylan's piano, which {{contrasts}} with [...] "the spooky organ riffs" [...] played by Al Kooper. Marqusee describes the song as one of [...] "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, [...] "disgusted by the old, excited by the new... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain [...] "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do <b>you,</b> <b>Mr</b> Jones?" [...] epitomizing the [...] "hip exclusivity" [...] of the burgeoning counterculture. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as [...] "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as [...] "a Philistine... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart {{about the things that}} count".|$|E

500|$|Working with Random House editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf {{to manage}} Sesame Streets book {{publishing}} program. During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit {{to become more}} involved with writing and composing music for the series, and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW during 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's seriess. As of 2001, {{there were more than}} 600 books available in the Sesame Street library, and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated, [...] "the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street". In one of these books, for example, the death of the Sesame Street character Mr. Hooper was featured in a book entitled I'll Miss <b>You,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hooper, published soon after the series featured it during 1983.|$|E
500|$|The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak {{prognosis}} of {{the situation}} in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were [...] "being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: [...] "Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but I have to tell <b>you,</b> <b>Mr.</b> President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon." [...] Phillips asserted that removing Nhu {{was the only way to}} improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Diệm's position a decade earlier, a proposal that Kennedy dismissed. Phillips recommended three measures: ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss <b>you,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E
