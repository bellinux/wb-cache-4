Este estudo teve como objetivo caracterizar isolados de L. theobromae associados a frutÃferas tropicais de diferentes regiÃes, avaliando o aspecto cultural, morfolÃgico e patogÃnico. Foram avaliados o crescimento micelial, coloraÃÃo da colÃnia, dimensÃes dos conÃdios e patogenicidade dos isolados em mudas de cajazeira, cajueiro, gravioleira e umbuzeiro. O trabalho foi realizado na Casa de VegetaÃÃo e no LaboratÃrio de Fitopatologia da Embrapa AgroindÃstria Tropical. Os dados de caracterizaÃÃo morfocultural mostraram haver alta diversidade na populaÃÃo do patÃgeno. As inoculaÃÃes {{realizadas}} nas quatro diferentes espÃcies hospedeiras apontaram alta variabilidade patogÃnica entre os isolados do fungo. Em mudas de cajueiro CCP 76 nÃo foi possÃvel observar especificidade patogÃnica, pois todos os isolados apresentaram similar nÃvel de agressividade, demonstrando a suscetibilidade deste clone ao patÃgeno, suscetibilidade essa, tambÃm observada em gravioleira. O umbuzeiro foi a espÃcie que apresentou maior resistÃncia ao fungo. Os dados mostraram que existe interaÃÃo entre as caracterÃsticas morfoculturais e a agressividade dos isolados de L. theobromae. De acordo com os resultados, a altitude dos locais de origem dos isolados nÃo influencia em suas caracterÃsticas morfoculturais e patogÃnicas. Lasiodiplodia theobromae is an ubiquitous, polyphagous and opportunistic fungus with {{a reduced}} pathogenic ability. Nevertheless, it may infect several plant species over tropical and temperate regions, causing {{many different kinds}} of symptoms. The increasingly expansion of diseases caused by L. theobromae in tropical fruit plants has been imposing severe losses both at orchard level and in post-harvest at market, threaten the fruit crop industry in Northeast Region of Brazil. Therefore there is an urgent need for research pursuing basic knowledge on population biology of the fungus and host-pathogen interactions. This study aimed to characterize a L. theobromae population which has been associated to tropical plant species growing under different ecosystems in northeastern Brazil. Colony growth in culture, color and size of conidia and ability to cause disease upon inoculation on cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale), soursop (Annona muricata), <b>yellow</b> <b>mombin</b> (Spondias mombin) and Brazil plum (Spondias tuberosa) were evaluated. He study was carried out at Plant Pathology Lab and screenhouse of Embrapa Agroindustria Tropical in Fortaleza, CearÃ State. Results showed a high diversity of morphology and hyphal growth among fungus isolates. Also, a very high variability on disease expression upon inoculation into four plant species was observed. However, it was found a lack of specificity of isolates as to infect cashew plants, since all isolates were able to infect cashew with similar high aggressiveness, which demonstrated a high degree of susceptibility of cashew clone used (CCP 76). Similar results were found also for soursop plants as host. Brazil plum showed a very high resistance to all isolates. The data points out for the existence of morphological and pathogenic interactions within L. theobromae population studied. According with the results, altitude and region of isolate origin has no effect on the studied features...|$|E
