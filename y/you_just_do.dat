He occasionally appears at film festivals and retrospectives and has continued to develop ideas for film projects. He {{was the subject of}} the 2010 documentary Stanley Donen: <b>You</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Do</b> It.|$|E

NME {{described}} the tracks as [...] "an experimental, heavy sounding 70s riff," [...] "a strong, melodic love song" [...] and [...] "an unexpected mix of big guitars and a bold horn section," ...|$|E

And, literally, every take became a more and more {{confident}} take, so that she could have fun with what was going on. Not being over-the-top sarcastic, but ... having a laugh at everything that was going on around her, with confidence. [...] The very last dance of the piece, she had her hair up, and I go, 'Can <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> one for me with your hair down?' She dropped her hair down. You'll see we intercut with her hair up and her hair down. That was the last piece. She just rocked it from her heart. She choreographed that last dance at the very end. She did that on her own and said, 'Let's go for it'".|$|E

500|$|Marvel Comics {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane {{marriage and}} returning Spider-Man to his roots {{was necessary to}} preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years. Quesada said he and other previous editors-in-chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider-Man stories, but had not found a reasonable way to do so. Quesada said, [...] "It's very easy to un-marry a character, or fix something like that: <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a huge universal retcon, and say a few events in history didn't happen. But that's really {{not the way we}} do it here at Marvel." [...] Quesada found an opportunity to address this in the events of the 2007 Civil War mini-series, which resulted in the unmasking of Spider-Man's identity to the public. Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer, so he personally approached Straczynski to propose [...] "One More Day" [...] as his final project.|$|E
500|$|On June 24, 2007, just a {{few hours}} before their concert at Deer Lake Park, The White Stripes kicked off their cross-Canada tour by playing a 40-minute set for a group of 30 kids at the Creekside Youth Centre in Burnaby. The Canadian tour was also marked by concerts in small markets, such as Glace Bay, Whitehorse and Iqaluit, as well as by {{frequent}} [...] "secret shows" [...] publicized mainly by posts on The Little Room, a White Stripes fan messageboard. Gigs included performances at a bowling alley in Saskatoon, a youth center in Edmonton, a Winnipeg Transit bus and The Forks park in Winnipeg, a park in Whitehorse, the YMCA in downtown Toronto, the Arva Flour Mill in Arva, Ontario, Locas on Salter (a pool hall) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and a famous one-note show on George Street in St. John's, Newfoundland. They played a full show later that night at the Mile One Centre in downtown St. John's. Video clips from several of the secret shows have been posted to YouTube. As well, the band filmed its video for [...] "You Don't Know What Love Is (<b>You</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Do</b> as You're Told)" [...] in Iqaluit.|$|E

She {{decided to pursue}} an art education after reading a fortune cookie. [...] "It was in the late '70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July streetfair in Eureka, California," [...] she said. [...] "I got a fortune cookie that said 'Art is your fate, don't debate.' That next January, I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco." [...] She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens, a popular nightclub, to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns, the Mutants, Crime, and the Avengers. She also formed the Mummers and Poppers, a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods, Charles Hagan and drummer Jay Derrah, [...] Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight: [...] "After seeing Patti Smith, I still had it {{in my mind that}} you had to be skinny to be up there , but after going to the Mabuhay [...] <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> whatever you want, be whoever you want, just make it happen." ...|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not just running out trying to chop people up." [...] Church recalled that [...] "the basic stealth model was [...] having the guard looking the other way and you going past pretty quickly. So Paul [...] had been pushing for a while that the thief side of it was the really interesting part and why not <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> a thief game." [...] A previously unreleased trailer for [...] Dark Camelot and its Stargate Engine was uploaded to YouTube in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on his collection, Hirst {{has said}} [...] "As a human being, {{as you go}} through life, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> collect. It was that sort of entropic {{collecting}} that I found myself interested in, just amassing stuff while you’re alive." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{a year as}} Babe, Baker voiced {{that her}} time as the {{character}} had been [...] "awesome!" [...] once she [...] "got [...] and got settled." [...] "I always {{wanted to live in}} New York City, so that was a dream come true!" [...] She added that [...] "New York has so much culture" [...] and she had been able to grow as a person and actor. [...] "It's good that you can be given a script and learn 40 pages and feel comfortable with that. You get to know so much about the character that you don't question things, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> it instantaneously," [...] she said.|$|E
5000|$|What Willow {{says when}} she first enters Buffys {{backyard}} with the gun is similar to, though not exactly what Warren says before he shoots Buffy in [...] "Seeing Red".

Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, Tru Calling, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant pulled out from under her, Tru is forced {{to take a job}} at a local morgue where she discovers her power to [...] "re-live" [...] the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of Buffy The Vampire Slayer which would have been about Faith. She has had many roles as a [...] "bad girl" [...] in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with Maxim in May 2001, Dushku says of her roles, [...] "It's easy to play a bad girl: <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> everything you've been told not to do, and you don't {{have to deal with the}} consequences, because it's only acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. I suppose it was one really small thing that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>do</b> and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
