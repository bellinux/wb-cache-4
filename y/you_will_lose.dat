25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I suggest that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|The story's central {{location}} {{was set at}} Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|The South African League, a new uitlander movement, {{prepared}} two petitions, {{each with}} more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking {{on the role of}} mediator. [...] "You must make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. [...] "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede... Should you not give in on this issue, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> all sympathy and all your friends." [...] Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was [...] "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not touch my independence", he said. [...] "They must be reasonable in their demands." ...|$|E

500|$|In debates {{leading up}} to the passage of the 1765 Stamp Act, both Hutchinson and Bernard quietly warned London not to proceed. [...] Hutchinson in {{particular}} wrote that [...] "It cannot be good to tax the Americans ... <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> more than you gain." [...] Hutchinson's letters even shaped the political discourse in Parliament. Isaac Barre, a prominent Member of Parliament, drew heavily on the themes presented in Hutchinson's letters: he proclaimed that [...] "Your oppressions planted them[...] [...] [...] They grew by your neglect[...] [...] [...] They have nobly taken up arms in your defense" [...] on the floor of Parliament in opposition to the Stamp Act. When the assembly met to draft a petition to London on the matter in October 1764, Hutchinson opposed the inclusion of the radicals' language, and eventually pushed through a more moderate statement of opposition. [...] However, the Massachusetts petition was seen as weak in comparison to those prepared by other colonies, and Hutchinson was claimed to be secretly seeking to promote the Stamp Act. [...] He was also accused of [...] "treachery" [...] and [...] "betraying his country". [...] News of the act's passage propelled one of the most vocal opponents of Parliamentary supremacy, Samuel Adams, into a larger role in provincial politics. [...] Hutchinson privately supported calls for its repeal, but his unwillingness to publicly oppose the act merely provided additional fuel for his opponents.|$|E
2500|$|Kofi Annan {{supported}} his deputy Secretary-General Mark Malloch Brown, who openly criticized the United States {{in a speech}} on 6 June 2006: [...] "he prevailing practice of seeking to use the UN almost by stealth as a diplomatic tool while failing {{to stand up for}} it against its domestic critics is simply not sustainable. <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the UN one way or another. [...] the US is constructively engaged with the UN [...] is not well known or understood, in part because much of the public discourse that reaches the US heartland has been largely abandoned to its loudest detractors such as Rush Limbaugh and Fox News." [...] Malloch later said his talk was a [...] "sincere and constructive critique of U.S. policy toward the U.N. by a friend and admirer." ...|$|E
2500|$|By the 12th century, {{the process}} of {{purification}} had acquired the Latin name, [...] "purgatorium", from the verb purgare: to purge. In that same century, around 1128, Diego Gelmírez, then Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, berated his enemy, Arias Pérez, saying to him, [...] "I fear, therefore, that if such that you are you leave this world, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> eternal life and incur the perpetual condemnation of your soul." [...] These words make no mention of an intermediate state, but deny its existence no more than does the Catechism of the Catholic Church, when it says: [...] "Immediately after death the souls of those who die {{in a state of}} mortal sin descend into hell, where they suffer the punishments of hell, 'eternal fire'. The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God, in whom alone man can possess the life and happiness for which he was created and for which he longs." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 214, {{after the}} warlord Liu Bei {{took control of}} Yi Province, he {{appointed}} Zhou Qun as acting Colonel of the Scholars (儒林校尉) in his administration. Around 217, when Liu Bei was planning to launch a campaign to seize control of Hanzhong Commandery from his rival Cao Cao, he consulted Zhou Qun {{and asked him to}} predict the outcome. Zhou Qun said, [...] "You will get the territory but you won't have its people. If you send a detachment of your main army to attack (instead of sending your main army), <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>lose</b> the battle. You should be very careful about this!" [...] At the time, Zhang Yu, another diviner serving under Liu Bei, also said, [...] "If you attack Hanzhong, your army will suffer a defeat." [...] Liu Bei ignored their advice and proceeded with the campaign. Just as Zhou Qun predicted, Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign and captured the territories but not its people because they had already migrated elsewhere. During the campaign, Liu Bei also ordered Wu Lan (吳蘭) and Lei Tong (雷銅) to lead a detachment of troops from his main army to attack Wudu Commandery (武都郡; around present-day Longnan, Gansu), but, as Zhou Qun warned him, this detachment ended up being completely destroyed by Cao Cao's forces.|$|E
