40|$|Wermland was {{affected}} by the Spanish flu like the Swedish national average, about a half percentage of Wermlands population would lose their lives to the flu during the autumn 1918. The flu has for many fallen into oblivion. This oblivion is so wide spread that it´s possible {{to talk about a}} "collective forgetfulness". The society have selected to remember 1918 for "when the guns went quiet on the western front" and not for the millions who died from the treacherous Spanish flu. The world had already suffered enough from the four years of war that had been fought, thus the victims of the flu would be honored but would soon fade in to oblivion.    When you investigate deeper <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> that the national average don´t do Wermland and its cities or rural areas any justice when a large variations seems to occur within regional areas. One of Sweden's hardest effected cities was Kristinehamn and some miles north of this city you could find Kroppa rural county.

During the autumn of 1918, Kroppa came in firsthand experience the Spanish flu and it´s expansion, which will get considerable effects how people in these areas could live their lives. As this wouldn´t be enough a diphtheria epidemic would also cause havoc and despair in Kroppa {{at the same time as}} the flu.

40|$|GPS signal {{blockage}} can {{be experienced}} in many environments a vehicle may encounter; a forested road, the urban jungle, a tunnel, road spaghetti – <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Inertial sensors complement GPS well, potentially bridging {{the gaps in}} GPS coverage and provide vehicle attitude information as a bonus. But there is a catch, the data streams from a GPS receiver and inertial sensors are independent and must be fused together to generate a useful stream of navigation (position, velocity, and attitude) data. In this article the hardware and software algorithms {{that have been developed}} at the University of New South Wales to do this fusing operation are presented along with an example of the capabilities of the system. The article concludes with a look at some applications presently being explored and ideas for future work. The complimentary nature of GPS and Inertial Navigation System (INS) is well known; GPS provides absolute XYZ coordinates at a low data rate, while INS essentially provides changes in XYZ (and attitude) at a high data rate. While GPS can suffer loss of satellite signals that can lead to no XYZ at all, INS just keeps on going but will drift as errors compound. So it’s a happy marriage; GPS can bound the INS errors and INS can fill the gaps between GPS fixes. Broadly speaking there are four parts to our GPS/INS system; the sensors, the synchronization component, the integration / fusion component and data output. The system can operate in real-time or post-processing mode, the data fusion algorithms for both modes are essentially the same. In the real-time mode the algorithms run on an embedded processor on the prototype hardware device. In the post-process mode, the algorithms run on a PC. The hardware and the system components will be detailed shortly, but first lets see what the system is capable of...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This article {{outlines}} {{a theory}} of subjectivity and social consciousness that complements prevalent debates in cultural studies about marginality and subjectivity. The article suggests that we can interpret the constitution of subjectivity sociologically as between the nation-state and global market integration. More broadly, we can think about social processes in global market capitalism through returning to class formation. The article draws upon research conducted in Morocco from 1995 – 97 and again in 2000 – 02 to illustrate social transformation in market reform. KEYWORDS globalization • marginality • mobility • Morocco See, we have lost a sense of creativity, the taste to create, to live without anxiety, because we are anxious. We think of our situation, {{that we do not}} have enough money. There are those who have a lot in their lives and there are those who have nothing. What do those people [the latter] think about? They think just about living. They don’t have the time to think about creating something. To do something, to do something a little out of the ordinary. Because of that, we don’t have the tendency to create [...] . We have to change ourselves. For example, we have to teach ourselves, take for a model those who have succeeded, like the Americans and the Japanese. Like this we will succeed in doing something. I don’t see an Arab country I would take as a model. I don’t see it. We talk about Tunisia as coming up, but this is just a rumour. I have never gone there and I can’t judge.

40|$|This {{syllabus}} {{was submitted}} to the Rhodes College Office of Academic Affairs by the course instructor. American government is, strictly speaking, an arrangement of institutions for enacting and enforcing laws. As with machines, if we study only the motions of these institutions, we will see but {{a small part of}} what they were doing and almost nothing of why they were doing it in this or that way. The arrangement of these mechanisms of government reflect an understanding of the purposes of government and of the characteristics of those who will be, directly and indirectly, running the government. A study of American government will, therefore, involve careful thinking about questions philosophical and psychological. What ought to be the ends of government, and how can human beings secure those ends? But we should not assume that desirable goals and human behavior are readily compatible. We will look at the mechanisms, institutions, of government as crucial means for reconciling goals and motives in political practice. Our study will, therefore, be about securing as much good, or as little harm, as is possible under the circumstances. That is the essence of politics. That is what makes political thinking so demanding and satisfying. Consequently, you should expect the study of politics in the United States to be very difficult. Our work will relate to {{what you see in the}} world, but only gradually. You should bring your immediate interests and opinions to the readings and to class, but be prepared to see their deficiencies. We cannot decide intelligently (as opposed to what most journalists do) whether George W. Bush has been a good president, or whether this Congress has been successful, without a thorough understanding of the context: what are reasonable expectations? A course of study should change your life, how you think about and address the world around you. It should not trade old prejudices for new ones, but rather turn prejudice into reasoned opinion. This requires three disciplines. One is that you must be willing to expose your opinions and examine them, to argue with the readings, with your classmates, myself included. Another discipline is that you doubt the sufficiency and soundness of your prejudices and opinions; as better evidence and reasoning is presented, you should be willing to modify or abandon them. The third discipline is crucial: careful reading. Much of what we will read is densely reasoned, strange, offensive, and, therefore, difficult. React to what you read, but also attend carefully to the argument. Defects in an argument are to be found not in its conclusions but in the evidence and logic that lead to the conclusions. Allow your distaste for a conclusion to drive you to find flaws in what supports it.
