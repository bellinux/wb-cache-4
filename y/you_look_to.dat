With Shawn Michaels beginning a four-year retirement after a WWF World Heavyweight Championship loss and back injury, Triple H was now the leader of D-Generation X (DX). He said he was forming a DX army and [...] "when you start an army, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> your blood... <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> your buddies... <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> your friends... <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>to</b> The Kliq." [...] Waltman appeared on the stage, commented on Bischoff and Hogan, and said if they weren't contracted to WCW, Hall and Nash would have also {{returned to}} the WWF.

2500|$|The {{march of}} the athletes showed a clear example of CCTV proudly {{emphasizing}} a cultural particularity that NBC strained to contain {{within the bounds of}} the acceptable. When the athletes entered the stadium, CCTV [...] pointed out that the banners carrying the names of the countries were written by brush in Chinese and English, reflecting another Chinese cultural particularity. NBC described the arrangement not as an expression of Chinese cultural pride, but in pragmatic terms that covered a sense of dismissiveness.

[...] In this way, the NBC commentators' coverage intoned that China was not doing things the way they were generally done, and as a viewer, you might be [...] "out of luck" [...] if not for the graphics that NBC provided.|$|E
