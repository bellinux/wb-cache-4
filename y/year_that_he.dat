5|$|In {{addition}} to baseball, Middlebrooks played American {{football and basketball}} in high school. A quarterback, placekicker and punter, he played on the school's football team, which also featured LaMichael James. He was named an All-State punter. Middlebrooks admits that he preferred football, until he realized during his junior <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had the opportunity to}} be selected in the Major League Baseball draft. In November 2006, he committed to attend Texas A University on a full scholarship to play baseball and football for the Texas A Aggies.|$|E
5|$|In early 2005, Miliband {{resigned}} his advisory role to HM Treasury {{to stand}} for election. Kevin Hughes, then the Labour MP for Doncaster North, announced in February of that <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be standing down at the next election due to being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Miliband applied for selection to be the candidate in the safe Labour seat and won, beating off a close challenge from Michael Dugher, then a SPAD to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon.|$|E
5|$|Malone took up {{the study}} of law, {{becoming}} a solicitor in 1894 and a barrister five years later. In 1903, the same <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and {{his family moved to}} New Plymouth, he formed a partnership dealing mostly with land transactions with James McVeagh and W. D. Anderson. The partners would open several law offices around the Taranaki region.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan to an American father and a Filipina mother. He {{attended}} Martin Luther King High School where he earned four varsity letters in basketball under head coach Benny White in the Detroit PSL basketball league.

5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque over the front door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the misalignment of the calendar, an intercalary month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that <b>year,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of which way the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
5|$|Martello {{claimed that}} {{in the summer of}} 1964, he moved to Tangier, Morocco, where he {{researched}} the history of the tarot, resulting in the publication of It's in the Cards (1964). Returning to the U.S. in 1965, he moved into an apartment in Greenwich Village, New York City, writing a book on astrology, It's Written in the Stars, and a book on psychic protection, How to Prevent Psychic Blackmail. He also began attending the Spiritualist gatherings that were operated by Clifford Bias at the Ansonia Hotel. At some point High Priestess Lori Bruno founded a witchcraft coven and church, Our Lord and Lady of the Trinacrian Rose, in which Leo was acknowledged as Elder. In 1969 he publicly revealed himself to be a practitioner of Witchcraft; claiming that he had gained the permission of his coven to do so. Intent on countering the negative publicity that Wicca had been receiving, he published The Weird Ways of Witchcraft in 1969, the same <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> also published The Hidden World of Hypnotism.|$|E
25|$|When he was 11, he {{was sent}} to the Ohr Hachaim yeshiva in Slabodka, headed by Rabbi Tzvi Levitan, a student of the Alter of Kelm. During the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied there, he was exposed to the musar teachings of the mashgiach, Rabbi Eliyahu Laicrovits.|$|E

In 1969, he was elected president of NCSC following Aime Forand's retirement.|$|E
25|$|In 1786, the <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died, Samuel {{published}} a short {{work that was}} titled On the utility of drawing and painting. It has been supposed that as his work {{does not appear to}} have ever fully developed (or that he retired), he died at a young age.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, {{the same}} <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> began his writing career as Yogi Ramacharaka, Atkinson was {{admitted}} to the Bar of Illinois.

Shackleton took 66 wickets for the county {{at an average of}} 33.59, with best figures of 5/20 against Surrey in 1977.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Browne {{informed}} {{the parents of}} 11-year-old Shawn Hornbeck, who had disappeared earlier that <b>year,</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been kidnapped by a dark-skinned Hispanic man with dreadlocks and was now dead. Hornbeck was found alive in 2007; his kidnapper was Caucasian and short-haired. In June 2008, UK television network ITV2 was sanctioned by Ofcom for reairing the Montel Williams episode featuring Browne's original prediction.|$|E

While winning a higher percentage of votes than any of Scherle's previous opponents, Harkin nevertheless lost the race.|$|E

Prior to a Quidditch match in his sixth year, Ron Weasley believed that Harry had slipped Felix Felicis into his morning juice to help him play perfectly.|$|E
25|$|The Waste Land {{is notable}} for its {{seemingly}} disjointed structure, {{indicative of the}} Modernist style of James Joyce's Ulysses (which Eliot cited as an influence and which he read the same <b>year</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was writing The Waste Land). In the Modernist style, Eliot jumps from one voice or image to another without clearly delineating these shifts for the reader. He also includes phrases from multiple foreign languages (Latin, Greek, Italian, German, French and Sanskrit), indicative of Pound's influence.|$|E
