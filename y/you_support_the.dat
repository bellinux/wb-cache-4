500|$|On May 14, 1995, a {{referendum}} {{was conducted in}} all regions of Belarus. Out of four questions, one was the following: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the new national symbols?" [...] With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new state symbols were approved by a ratio of 3:1 (75.1% to 24.9%). The way the referendum was carried out was heavily criticized by the opposition, including the exact wording of {{the question about the}} national insignia. Supporters of the Pahonia also criticize that the Pahonia and the former white-red-white flag were compared to ones, used by collaboration forces, in propaganda that was published during the run-up to the vote. The comparison was made due to the white, red, white flag and Pahonia being used on the patches and symbols of the Belarusian Central Rada, the Belarusian government under the control of Nazi Germany. Alexander Lukashenko claimed the selection of the Soviet-inspired symbols as a victory, especially to his Great Patriotic War veteran base, by saying [...] "we have returned to you the flag of the country for which you fought. We have returned to you both memory and a sense of human pride." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the latest}} poll in Finland about the question, 36 percent of Finns {{supported}} {{the return of}} ceded territories, compared to 51% who are opposed. The poll was conducted by the newspaper Karjala and the research institute MC-Info Oy on 13 October 2005. In August 2005, a poll by Helsingin Sanomat and Suomen Gallup, determined that 30% of Finns supported and 62% opposed the return. In a poll by Taloustutkimus and Karjalan Liitto conducted in May 2005, support was 26% while 58% were opposed. A year earlier, a poll by STT showed 38% supporting and 57% opposing. A poll by Taloustutkimus was criticized by ProKarelia for asking leading questions, such as, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> return of Karelia, even if it would mean more tense relations or even war with Russia?" [...] 5% of supporters and of those who declined to respond supported the return even under these circumstances (2.1% of all replies).|$|E

6000|$|Edith thanked you, in my name, {{for your}} {{valuable}} present of the 'Peninsular War.' I have read it with great delight: it is beautifully written, and a most interesting story. I {{did not notice}} a single sentiment or opinion that I could have wished away but one--where <b>you</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> notion that, if the Duke of Wellington had not lived and commanded, Buonaparte must have continued the master of Europe. I do not object to this from any dislike I have to the Duke, but from a conviction--I trust, a philosophic one--that Providence would not allow the upsetting of so diabolical a system as Buonaparte's to depend upon the existence of any individual. Justly was it observed by Lord Wellesley, that Buonaparte was of an order of minds that created for themselves great reverses. He might have gone further, and {{said that it is}} of the nature of tyranny to work to its own destruction.[71] ...|$|E
6000|$|Again: I {{will ask}} you, my friends, {{if you were}} elected members of the legislature, {{what would be the}} first thing you would have to do before {{entering}} upon your duties? Swear to support the Constitution of the United States. Suppose you believe as Judge Douglas does, that the Constitution of the United States guarantees to your neighbour the right to hold slaves in that Territory,--that they are his property,--how can you clear your oaths unless you give him such legislation as is necessary to enable him to enjoy that property? What do you understand by supporting the Constitution of a State or of the United States? Is it not to give such constitutional helps to the rights established by that Constitution as may be practically needed? Can you, if you swear to support the Constitution and believe that the Constitution establishes a right, clear your oath without giving it support? Do <b>you</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> Constitution if, knowing or believing there is a right established under it which needs specific legislation, you withhold that legislation? Do you not violate and disregard your oath? I can conceive of nothing plainer in the world. There can be nothing in the words [...] "support the Constitution," [...] if you may run counter to it by refusing support to any right established under the Constitution. And what I say here will hold with still more force against the Judge's doctrine of [...] "unfriendly legislation." [...] How could you, having sworn to support the Constitution, and believing that it guaranteed the right to hold slaves in the Territories, assist in legislation intended to defeat that right? That would be violating your own view of the Constitution. Not only so, but if you were to do so, {{how long would it take}} the courts to hold your votes unconstitutional and void? Not a moment.|$|E
