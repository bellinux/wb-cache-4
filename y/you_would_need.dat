25|$|Using the Land Books (jarðarbøkur) it is speculated, {{that the}} number of {{inhabitants}} in Sørvág in the 17th century was around fifty. In the first census in the Faroes in 1801 the number of inhabitants in Sørvág had risen to a mere 86. In 1855 the number of inhabitants was 163. The reason for this slow progress is due to the special requirements for marriage, that were law in the Faroes. The law said, that in order to marry <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> to own land or have demonstrated that you were a faithful servant to someone who owned land. It was only the wealthy farmers who had a substantial amount of land, and therefore the birthrate in the Faroes was very low until this law was abolished.|$|E

Wanderone is remembered for saying on his way out a pool room door, [...] "Boys, the only difference between me and everybody else is that everybody else drives around in a Volkswagen, and Minnesota Fats drives around in a Duesenberg." [...] Wanderone would go virtually anywhere to help promote the game, and he was a crowd-pleaser.|$|E

[...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home.

2500|$|Harding {{is first}} {{recorded}} in May 1751 {{when he played}} for All-England v Kent at the Artillery Ground. [...] All-England won by 9 runs and Harding made a significant contribution.

[...] Harding apparently made 50 of these himself and had one hit {{out of the ground}} and against a house on Bunhill Row opposite. [...] He was given four for this mighty effort.

And if you were to operationalize this you would be looking at 10 to 20 747s, at a billion and a half dollars apiece, and $100 million a year to operate. And there's nobody in uniform that I know who believes that this is a workable concept." ...|$|E

We would obviously be very keen to find out where she was, and who she was with, between then and 4.20pm on Sunday. She was last seen wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a white, long sleeved T-shirt and black Nike trainers... We will interview friends, her boyfriend and all her associates." [...] Ross Hemphill, who hadn't seen Nelson {{on the day of the}} murder, was interviewed by detectives and ruled out as a suspect. Police began checking CCTV and telephone records as well as interviewing friends and family and carrying out house-to-house enquiries. Witnesses reported seeing a fire on Monkey Hill at around 11.20pm on the night of the murder. D/Supt Robertson said: [...] "We know there was a fire at 11.20pm on Saturday in exactly the spot where Zoe was found. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> local knowledge to go there. We firmly believe the answers in this case lie in this community... It had only got dark at 10pm and it was the hottest day of the year so there must have been people around this area." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shubik {{began work}} and soon found that finding science fiction stories {{suitable}} for adaptation {{was a difficult}} task. She later recalled “I had to read hundreds of stories to pick a dozen. You {{have no idea how}} difficult some of these authors are to deal with, and it seems a special thing among SF writers to hedge themselves behind almost impossible copyright barriers, even when they have got a story that is possible to do on television. So many you can't. Either the conception is so way out <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>need</b> a fantastic budget to produce it, or the story is too short, too tight to be padded out to make an hour's television”. When working on Out of this World Shubik had made a valuable contact in John Carnell, a key figure in British science fiction publishing. He was the founder of science fiction magazine New Worlds and agent for many of Britain's science fiction writers. Carnell was able to suggest stories and authors for Shubik to consider. Shubik received copies of science fiction anthologies from British publishers and also sought advice from many authors including Frederik Pohl, Alfred Bester and Robert Silverberg. [...] The latter two admitted to Shubik that they had run into similar difficulties in finding suitable material for television adaptation. Shubik considered asking Nigel Kneale if he would write a new Quatermass story for the series, and contacted Arthur C. Clarke regarding the possibility of adapting his novel The Deep Range.|$|E
