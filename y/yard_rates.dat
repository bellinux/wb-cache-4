40|$|This report {{supplements}} Research Bulletin 18 (1975) of the Forest Research Laboratory, School of Forestry, Oregon State University. Bulletin 18 summarized {{analyses of}} {{data for the}} first field season of the Pansy Basin Study. This Bulletin extends those analyses to the second, and final, field season. Time-study observations during the second field season were made of three yarding systems: running skyline, balloon haulback, and heavy-lift helicopter. The running skyline was observed in a partial cutting, the balloon in a clearcutting, and the helicopter in both clearcuttings and partial cuttings. All of the cutting units were designed to reduce damage to {{the appearance of the}} landscape. Results of the analyses suggest that productive yarding time is a function of yarding distance, volume per turn and per log, chordslope, and numbers of logs or chokers per turn. For the running skyline and the balloon, lateral yarding distance was also an important determinant of productive yarding time. In addition, the number of men in the rigging crew was found to be a statistically significant predictor for the running skyline, as was tagline length for the balloon. For the running skyline system, the data in this study support the hypothesis that <b>yarding</b> production <b>rates</b> are significantly influenced by silvicultural treatment. For the helicopter, however, no significant difference appeared in <b>yarding</b> <b>rates</b> between the clearcutting and partial cutting treatments. The effect of cutting unit design on yarding efficiency for cable systems cannot be generalized, although it {{did not appear to be}} significant for the cutting units in the Pansy Basin Study. Certainly, cutting units can be designed for which unit shape is an important determinant of cable yarding productivity. Shape of cutting unit would not be expected to influence helicopter yarding productivity, however...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} data from a three-year gross time study of skyline, balloon, and helicopter yarding systems operating in Western Oregon. Data collection activities were designed and supervised by the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, U. S. D. A. Forest Service. The specific logging systems studied were running skyline, North Bend standing skyline, long-span standing skyline, balloon (inverted skyline, highlead, inverted skyline yo-yo, and highlead yo-yo), medium helicopter, and heavy helicopter. These systems were observed under {{a wide range of}} silvicultural and landscape design prescriptions, timber type, terrain, and weather conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop yarding production equations, to sumarize delays, road change times,and landing change times, and to compare yarding production estimates made from both gross and detailed time study data. This kind of information is useful for the comparison of alternative logging methods in environmentally sensitive, landscape-designed harvest units. The data were segregated according to the individual logging systems and analyzed via multiple regression. Then individual system data were combined into the categories of short-span skyline, long-span skyline, balloon, and helicopter. These combined data were also analyzed via multiple regression. Chi-square tests were performed to determine whether the equations developed from the combined data were significantly different from the set of equations developed from the segregated data. The results of these tests support a conclusion, at the 95 percent level of fiducial probability, that the equations developed from the combined data are as adequate for predicting <b>yarding</b> production <b>rates</b> for these logging systems as the equations developed from the individual-system data. The variables shown statistically to influence <b>yarding</b> production <b>rates</b> for all logging systems studied were yarding distance and number of logs per turn. In addition, helicopter yarding productivity was also found to be influenced by the type of cutting prescription, and short-span skyline yarding, by chordslope. A variable combining aspect and the season of work was found to be significant for both the running skyline and the heavy helicopter. Yarding delays were found to be affected by yarder, landing size, season, and crews' experience. In order to compare similar systems' delays, it was found important to segregate out weather-related delays. In a separate study, detailed time studies were made on four of the yarding systems analyzed in this paper. This allowed a comparison between the measurements of <b>yarding</b> production <b>rates</b> made during the detailed time study and those made during the gross tinte study. The gross time study rates were consistently lower than the detail time study rates. This suggests that the detailed method does not reflect the total downtime as accurately as the gross method. Thus the gross method appears better suited for developing information that is useful for appraisal purposes and the detailed method is better suited for evaluation of system efficiency...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} initial {{results of}} a yarding time study for the Pansy Basin Study, a cooperative research project designed to test the performance of skylines, balloons, and helicopters operating under various conditions of timber and terrain, and over a range of silvicultural and landscape design prescriptions. Observations during the first field season were limited to a single harvesting prescription (clearcutting) and to conventional cutting patterns. Six yarding systems were studied: highlead, North Bend skyline, Grabinski running skyline, shotgun skyline ("flyer"), balloon, inverted skyline, and helicopter. Results {{of this study suggest}} that productive yarding time is a function of yarding distance, volume per turn, number of logs per turn, and conditions at the hooking site. For the helicopter and balloon, productive time also is influenced by chord slope and tagline length. Delays and downtime are important segments of total yarding time for all systems and are unpredictable for the most part. Thus, future analysis of delays may lead to significant improvements in <b>yarding</b> production <b>rates.</b> The report includes a procedure for estimating direct yarding costs from time-study data gathered on a sampling basis.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was undertaken in northern Ontario {{in order to}} assess the magnesium status of beef cattle raised in the area. Magnesium status was assessed using several criteria including blood and urine magnesium levels, and bone biopsy samples. Eighteen groups each containing four pregnant Shorthorn beef cows were used. Each of the following three mineral feeds were offered to six groups throughout the experiment: a mineral feed without magnesium, a mineral feed containing 8 % magnesium in the form of magnesium oxide and the third containing sequestered magnesium with a magnesium level of about a tenth of that in the mineral feed containing magnesium oxide. During the winter, when the cows were housed indoors, they were fed grass silage. Six groups, two of each mineral feed, remained indoors throughout the summer. The other 12 groups were turned out to pasture on May 25 and continued receiving the appropriate mineral feed. There were no differences in serum magnesium owing to magnesium-supplementation treatments observed at any time during any experiment. Serum magnesium levels fell drastically in all groups before the cows were released to pasture, implying that the hypomagnesaemic condition was attributable to the stress of <b>yarding.</b> The <b>rate</b> of recovery from hypomagnesaemia was slower in the cows released to pasture than in those kept indoors. Urine samples from cows returned to the pasture were indicative of low magnesium status.

500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest <b>Yard</b> a positive <b>rating</b> of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is it bad? Does it matter? It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|R
