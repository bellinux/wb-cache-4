50|$|Burai Fighter is {{a single}} player two {{dimensional}} automatic sidescroller. It has three difficulty levels to choose from. At the start, the screen moves from left to right, but it can move in all four directions and even change directions in the same level. The player is expected to keep up, because getting stuck on the edge means you die. You {{start out with a}} basic gun that you can fire in all eight directions. You can hold the fire button to lock your firing position. You float through space blowing up robots that sort of look like animals most of the time. At the end of a level you must defeat a boss to continue to the next level. At times, you may find a gap {{at the side of the}} screen. If you time it right and push in that direction, the orientation of the screen will change and take <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> secret <b>room</b> with some power ups. However, the higher difficulty levels have fewer secret rooms and your timing also needs to be perfect. This means you can quite simply walk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> death trap. The game is fairly linear otherwise, but there are a few forks in the road where you can either travel on the left side or the right side of the screen for a little while. If you pick the wrong side, you need to be an exceptionally skilled player to make it out of there.|$|R

But though nonsense languages have a rich literary history, there is much less written on how we understand and process nonsense languages, those for which {{there is little or no}} existing mental framework. This thesis explores how this sort of linguistic input might be processed and understood, focusing in particular the case of Unamunda, the nonsense language created by David Ives in his short play “The Universal Language ” (1994). Unamunda consists of a combination of English words assigned new meanings, proper nouns (also assigned new meanings), plays on foreign words and phrases, and nonsense words. Its syntax is very nearly that of English, with occasional variations on word order. Though no one listening to Unamunda being spoken onstage has any prior familiarity with its lexicon or grammar, it is still possible to understand the utterances with little extra effort. After an overview of some theories and models of some various aspects of word recognition, including the effects of context on lexical decision-making, the clues to meaning supplied by syntactic structures, and phonotactic neighborhood activation, I move on to a discussion of my own experiment, in which subjects were asked to translate written, spoken, and video segments of Unamunda into English. ...|$|R

500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take <b>you</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> large <b>room,</b> beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in your own mind, in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|R
40|$|Fundamental motives {{have direct}} {{implications}} for evolutionary fitness and orchestrate attention, memory, and social inference in functionally specific ways. Motivational states linked to self-protection and mating offer illustrative examples. When selfprotective motives are aroused, people show enhanced attention to, and memory for, angry male strangers; they also perceive out-group members as especially dangerous. In contrast, when mating motives are aroused, men show enhanced attention to and memory for attractive {{members of the}} opposite sex; mating motives also lead men (but not women) to perceive sexual arousal in attractive members of the opposite sex. There are further functionally specific consequences for social behavior. For example, self-protective motives increase conformity among both men and women, whereas mating motives lead men (but not women) to engage in anticonformist behavior. Other motivational systems trigger different adaptive patterns of cognitive and behavioral responses.

60|$|So {{much had}} they {{addicted}} themselves to wicker-work, {{prompted by the}} ingenuity of the Indians, who assisted them, that when I viewed the Englishmen's colonies, they seemed at a distance {{as though they had}} lived like bees in a hive: for Will Atkins, who was now become a very industrious and sober man, had made himself a tent of basket-work round the outside; the walls were worked in as a basket, in pannels or strong squares of thirty-two in number, standing about seven feet high: in the middle was another, not above twenty-two paces round, but much stronger built, being of an octagonal form, and in the eight corners stood eight strong poles, round the top of which he raised a pyramid for the roof, mighty pretty, I assure you, and joined very well together, with iron spikes, which he made himself; for he had made him a forge, with a pair of wooden bellows and charcoal for his work, forming an anvil cut of one of the iron crows, to work upon, and in the manner would he make himself hooks, staples, spikes, bolts, and hinges. After he had pitched the roof of his innermost tent, he made it so firm between the rafters with basket-work, thatching that over again with rice-straw, and over that a large leaf of a tree, that his house was as dry {{as if it had been}} tiled or slated. The outer circuit was covered as a lean-to, quite round this inner appartment, laying long rafters from the thirty-two angles to the top posts of the inner house, about twenty-feet distant, so that there was a space like a wall between the outer and inner wall, near twenty feet in breadth. The inner place he partitioned off with the same wicker-work, dividing it into six neat apartments every one of which had <b>a</b> door, first <b>into</b> the entry of the main tent, and another into the space and walk that was round it, not only convenient for retreat, but for family necessaries. Within the door of the outer circle, there was a passage directly to the door of the inner house; on either side was a wicker partition, and a door, by which <b>you</b> go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> twenty-two feet wide, and about thirty long, and through that <b>into</b> another of <b>a</b> smaller length; so that in the outer circle were ten handsome rooms, six of which were only to be come at through the apartments of the inner tent, serving as retiring rooms to the respective chambers of the inner circle, and four large warehouses, which went in through one another, two on either hand of the passage that led through the outer door to the inner tent. In short, nothing could be built more ingeniously, kept more neat, or have better conveniences; and here lived the three families, Will Atkins, his companion, their wives and children, and the widow of the deceased. As to religion, the men seldom taught their wives the knowledge of God, any more than the sailors' custom of swearing by his name. The greatest improvement their wives had, was, they taught them to speak English, so as to be understood.|$|R

It made me homesick to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending as it was, <b>you</b> couldn't go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> but <b>you</b> would find an insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home over the door; and in the parlor we had nine. But here, even in my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions, even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably, after all his practice on those nightmares they call his [...] "celebrated Hampton Court cartoons." [...] Raphael was a bird. We had several of his chromos; one was his [...] "Miraculous Draught of Fishes," [...] where he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men <b>into</b> <b>a</b> canoe which wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting. I always admired to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.|$|R
