After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you {{with all my heart}} and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|The 808 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} inventions in popular music. According to Sound on Sound, the machine [...] "spawned an industry of clones and sample libraries"; samples of its sounds are common in modern music software. Flavorwire wrote that [...] "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own — you know the sounds even if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts." [...] The New Yorker wrote in 2015 that the 808 is the bedrock of the modern [...] "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that [...] "embraces and fetishizes... street music from the past." [...] According to Slate, it was instrumental in pop music's shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to [...] "thinking in terms of sequences, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, after a {{long period}} of radio silence, the {{official}} Cardiacs website relaunched with many pieces of merchandise for sale. Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET BUSINESS CONCERN wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties. [...] A message was also posted from Tim Smith's personal Facebook account: [...] Hello Kidz! (You will notice that I spelled the word kidz with a 'z'). I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> this means. Really though. While I would love to respond to each message, you are doubtlessly aware, my body is my enemy and my hands are cunts. Nonetheless it means the world to me, thank you all so much. I am truly blessed. [...] Sporadic status updates continue to be posted on Smith's Facebook page, which readily accepts friend requests of fans.|$|E
2500|$|Ruslan Obiang, {{a son of}} the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports {{minister}} and president of a top soccer club, the [...] "Panthers". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms {{to do business in}} his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since [...] "he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to." [...] After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: [...] "You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> {{is going to happen to}} you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives." ...|$|E
