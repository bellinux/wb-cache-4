40|$|Growth and {{condition}} of <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> were {{measured in the}} Wadden Sea (2 stations), in the North Sea (1 station) and in the laboratory (6 groups at three constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20 °C and two feeding levels: excess food and limited food). Growth of the <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> (0 -group and I-group) in the North Sea was much better (ca 1, 3 cm/month) {{as compared to the}} Wadden Sea (0, 9 cm/month). The condition of the plaice in both areas, however, was more or less the same. The condition increased in spring to a maximum in July-August, the water content showed an inverse relation to the condition. With excess food the <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> in the laboratory showed rapid growth at 15 and 20 °C (ca 1, 25 cm/month). With limited food growth appeared to be better at 15 °C (0, 9 cm/month) as compared to 20 °C (0, 3 cm/month). There was no direct correlation between growth {{and condition}} in plaice, differences in size between <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> from the Wadden Sea and the North Sea may have been due to selective migration...|$|E
40|$|The North Sea {{flatfish}} fisheries generate considerable {{numbers of}} discards, especially of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). Their survival is very low. To reduce discard mortality, a partially closed area was established (“plaice box”) in 1989. The beam trawl fishery {{in this area}} was prohibited for vessels larger than 300 hp. Because the Plaice Box encompassed the major nursery grounds of North Sea plaice, it was expected that, {{at the same rate}} of exploitation, the introduction of the plaice box would enhance recruitment, yield and spaw-ning stock biomass. During an evaluation of the plaice box in 1999, it became clear that since 1989, the yield and spawning stock biomass had declined by about 40 %. A possible explanation for this decline is {{that there has been a}} shift in the spatial distribution of North Sea plaice. It is possible that the <b>young</b> undersized <b>plaice</b> inhabit places further away from the coast so that the plaice box is not offering as much protection against discarding as originally supposed. The results showed that the spatial distribution of plaice has indeed changed in time...|$|R
40|$|Two {{surveys in}} the German Bight {{revealed}} a relatively good recruitment for plaice and cod. However, {{with the current}} high effort and uneconomic way of fishing, most of these fish will end as discards. To protect <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> {{during the winter months}} an increase of the mesh opening in beam trawls within the plaice box is suggested. Therefore, the fishermen are called upon to make a more considerated selection of their nets...|$|E
40|$|I ntroduction The sandy {{intertidal}} {{areas around}} the Scottish coast constitute important nursery grounds for flatfish, of which the plaice Pleuronectes platessa (L.) {{is the most important}} species. Studies on the distribution of <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> have revealed that the young fish, during their first year of benthic life, concentrate their feeding on the tidal flats (Edwards and Steele 1968; Kuipers, 1977). A first attempt to assess the importance of these feeding grounds, by describing the abundance and biomass of the food organisms, was made in the early 1970 s (Eleftheriou and Mclntyre, 1976) in a number of selected beaches on the north and west Scottish coasts and in the Outer Hebrides. However the work would have remained incomplete without the inclusion of the east coast Scottish beaches. The present paper reports on the results of the second part of this investigation, which aims to describe the range of variation of the fauna of the east coast beaches and investigate further the underlying causes of the observed variations (Eleftheriou and Nicholson, 1975). Previous work on the east coast beaches includes a number of faunisti...|$|E
40|$|Samples of <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> were {{examined}} {{to see if}} there was any relationship between growth rate and individual heterozygosity, screened across five polymorphic enzyme loci (Pgm- 1, Ada, Mdh- 2, Pgi- 2, Gpdh-l). Two out of 46 samples showed a significant negative correlation between growth rate and multi-locus heterozygosity; none showed a significant positive correlation. There was no overall tendency to negative or positive correlations. The largest sample (N= 689) showed no relationship between multi-locus heterozygosity and growth rate, although one of the five loci, Gpdh- 1, showed a significant positive correlation. The only significant correlation in the next largest sample (N= 248) was between multi-locus heterozygosity and growth rate, and that was negative. Fish of intermediate growth rate were not significantly different in heterozygosity from faster or slower growing fish. There was no relationship between variability in growth rate and multi-locus heterozygosity. These findings are discussed in the context of similar surveys from other species, and the conclusion drawn that the universality of a positive relationship between growth rate and multi-locus heterozygosity remains to be established...|$|E
40|$|To {{protect the}} main nursery area of plaice, an area called the `Plaice Box¿ {{was closed to}} trawl {{fisheries}} with large vessels in 1989, {{with the expectation that}} recruitment, yield and spawning stock biomass would increase. However, since then the plaice population has declined and the rate of discarding outside the Plaice Box has increased, suggesting an offshore shift in spatial distribution of juvenile plaice. Using research vessel survey data collected since 1970, the change in distribution of juvenile age groups was analysed in relation to the distance to the coast. Further, a comparison of the distribution of different length classes of plaice between three historic periods was made (1902 ¿ 1909; 1983 ¿ 1987; 1999 ¿ 2003). A shift towards deeper water of larger-sized plaice (20 ¿ 39 cm) is apparent already before the 1980 s and {{may be related to the}} decrease in the number of competitors or predators. An offshore shift in the distribution of <b>young</b> <b>plaice</b> occurred in the 1990 s most likely in response to higher water temperatures that may have exceeded the maximum tolerance range or increased the food requirements above the available food resources. A decrease in competition with larger plaice offshore, possibly in combination with increased inshore predation by cormorants and seals, may also have played a role. The offshore shift in distribution has reduced the effectiveness of the Plaice Box as a technical measure to protect the under-sized plaice from discarding, since an increased proportion of the population of undersized plaice is moving to the more heavily exploited offshore areas...|$|E
