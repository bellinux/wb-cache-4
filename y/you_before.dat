5|$|The reason I haven't {{spoken to}} <b>you</b> <b>before</b> now is this: You deserve the truth. And as {{frustrating}} as the waiting has been, I {{felt it was}} improper {{to come to you}} with sketchy reports, or possibly even erroneous statements, which would then have to be corrected, creating even more doubt and confusion. There's been enough of that.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Corea took a {{profound}} stylistic turn from avant garde playing to a crossover jazz fusion style that incorporated Latin jazz elements with Return to Forever. Named after their eponymous 1972 album, the band relied on both acoustic and electronic instrumentation and drew upon Latin American musical styles more than on rock music. On {{their first two}} records, Return to Forever featured Flora Purim's vocals, Corea's Fender Rhodes electric piano, Joe Farrell's flute and soprano saxophone, Airto Moreira on drums and percussion, with Stanley Clarke rounding up the group on acoustic bass. Drummer Lenny White and guitarist Bill Connors later joined Corea and Clarke to form the second version of the group, which expanded upon the earlier Latin jazz elements with a more hard-edged rock and funk-oriented sound inspired by Corea's admiration for Mahavishnu Orchestra, led by his Bitches Brew bandmate John McLaughlin. This incarnation of the group recorded the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy, before Connors' departure and replacement by Al Di Meola, who was present on the subsequent releases Where Have I Known <b>You</b> <b>Before,</b> No Mystery, and the best selling Romantic Warrior.|$|E
500|$|Brooks's 1923 self-portrait has a grimmer tone. Brookswho also {{designed}} her own clothespainted {{herself in a}} tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in The Cross of France. [...] Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, [...] "she's watching <b>you</b> <b>before</b> you {{get close enough to}} look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Timing" [...] {{was written}} by Pendleton Ward and Kent Osborne. They {{previously}} collaborated with Jack Pendarvis and Adam Muto {{to come up with}} the idea for the episode, with the former duo adapting that to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season. Osborne is the head of story. Alluding to the episode, for Hulu, Muto and Osborne summarized it as Lumpy confounding the concept of time travel. The writers related the episode to [...] "one of those situations where you run into someone from high school and you're like, 'Woah, why didn't I ever notice <b>you</b> <b>before?</b> Alluded to in this episode, the one it precedes involves time travel as well.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick <b>you</b> <b>before</b> they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E

[...] After returning from Europe, Talcott published editorials in The Englewood Economist strongly supporting approval for the League of Nations.|$|E
2500|$|Mozart's string quartets are {{considered}} the pinnacle of the classical art. The six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn, his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, [...] "I tell <b>you</b> <b>before</b> God as an honest man that your son is the greatest composer known to me either in person or by reputation. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition." ...|$|E

2500|$|William R.

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words, “You are {{standing}} this day all of <b>you</b> <b>before</b> the Lord your God,” in [...] {{should have been}} placed {{at the beginning of}} the Book of Deuteronomy, only the Torah does not follow chronological order.

2500|$|Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, {{and the two}} composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they {{sometimes}} played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K.387, K.421, K.428, K.458, K.464, and K.465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn in 1785 told Mozart's father: [...] "I tell <b>you</b> <b>before</b> God, and as an honest man, your son is the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeremiah 1:5 states that, [...] "Before I formed {{you in the}} womb, I knew <b>you,</b> <b>before</b> {{you were}} born, I set you apart; I {{appointed}} you as a prophet to the nations." [...] For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, {{is an indication that}} God is aware of the identity of [...] "developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb", or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Grant {{released}} Somewhere Down the Road, {{featuring the}} hit single [...] "Better Than a Hallelujah", which peaked at No. 8 on Billboard Top Christian Songs chart. When {{asked about the}} new album during an interview with CBN.com, Grant says, [...] "... my hope is just for those songs to provide companionship, remind myself and whoever else is listening what's important. I feel like songs {{have the ability to}} connect us to ourselves and to each other, and to our faith, to the love of Jesus, in a way that conversation doesn't do.
