Vanity Fair {{called it a}} contender for [...] "the worst restaurant in America", with different menus for different customers and [...] "steakhouse classics doused with unnecessarily high-end ingredients".

[...] Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave it 3 out of 5, while commenting, [...] "Agneepath, less of a remake, more of a tribute. The makers of Agneepath should have just called it Dharmapath." [...] Kunal Guha of Yahoo.com gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying that, [...] "The biggest dilemma of remaking a movie is how much to retain and what to retain. If the new story takes violent shifts, you lose the {{audience}} who came to revisit the original. If you photocopy scene-by-scene, you risk failing to connect with the audience who is accustomed to present sensibilities. The only safe bet: a ‘khichdi’ of the past and the present, like this one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Halcyon {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 69, based on 17 reviews. The Daily Telegraphs Neil McComick wrote that Goulding's voice is [...] "really something special", concluding, [...] "s luxuriously epic as Enya yet {{with the kind}} of dynamism of Florence + the Machine, Goulding's poetically opaque lyrics gain real dramatic weight. On a big, bold album, Goulding gives the expression 'singing like a bird' a whole new dimension." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented that the album has [...] "harp solos, digitally tweaked cyborg harmonies, and at least one tribute to bodily fluids ('My Blood'). But they're anchored by giant, disco-ball hooks and the type of dance beats <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>find</b> on a NOW That's What I Call Music! comp." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times remarked that on Halcyon, Goulding [...] "marries thoughtful ruminations on young love to whooshing synth riffs and hard-edged machine beats; the album claims electronic dance music as the natural province of sensitive singer-songwriters."

For the most part, health care systems in the indus-trialized world were built to care for people with acute ill-ness. This fact has resulted in the development of health care silos that are inherently disconnected from one another and thus necessitate frequent transitions from one part of the system to another. 1 These transitions may result in the neglect of certain needs, failed communication, and overall dissatisfaction with the quality of care. 2 Given the aging o...|$|R
