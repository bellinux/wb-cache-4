500|$|Following the show's cancellation, Cuoco {{said that}} she {{preferred}} working sitcoms rather than dramas. She felt the [...] "18-hour days where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> yourself" [...] did not leave her with enough time {{to have a life}} outside of work and the demanding shooting schedule did not allow her enough time to work with Combs, Milano, and McGowan. Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape. A writer from WE tv listed Billie's superhero look as one of the show's [...] "sexiest and most bizarre outfits". Cuoco {{said that she}} also disliked the black vinyl outfit and wig that she wore during her first two episodes.|$|E

One of the gunmen ran towards the policeman and shouted, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> us?" [...] The policeman answered, [...] "No, it's fine, boss", and raised his hand toward the gunman, who then gave the policeman a fatal shot to the head at close range.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Grace, I shall {{always say}} if I {{had died and}} I may die yet--that I {{did not wish to}} go out with Mr. Libby, and that I went purely to please you. You forced me to go.

2500|$|A {{day before}} the attack, {{multiple}} witnesses saw Zehaf-Bibeau engaged in a [...] "heated discussion" [...] with another man while waiting to register his purchase of the vehicle used in the shootings. According to a witness, Zehaf-Bibeau said [...] "If soldiers bombed your family, wouldnâ€™t <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> them?". Staff in the registry office asked him to lower his voice or leave. The purchase was disallowed by the office because of his out-of-province identification. The purchase was never registered and Zehaf-Bibeau pasted a piece of junk mail on the car to mimic a temporary license permit.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Game Informer {{featured}} him {{on their}} list of gaming's [...] "crappiest" [...] fathers, commenting he [...] "is more like an abusive, drunken stepfather than a crappy biological father [...] also a terrible husband." [...] The character's incarnation in the 2011 Mortal Kombat {{has been criticized for}} {{how hard it is to}} defeat him to the point of frustrating gamers; that same year, CraveOnline included him on the list of top five [...] "bosses <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> but can't". The fight against Shao Kahn in Mortal Kombat 3 was also noted for its difficulty; in 2013, Complex ranked it as the 23rd hardest boss battle in video games.|$|E
2500|$|One Friday {{evening in}} March, 1980, Bonin offered a 17-year-old named William Ray Pugh {{a ride home}} as the pair left the house of Everett Fraser. Within minutes of {{accepting}} the ride, Bonin asked Pugh whether {{he would like to}} engage in sex with him. Pugh later stated he panicked and stuttered upon hearing this question and, after sitting in silence for several minutes, attempted to leave the vehicle once Bonin had slowed the van at a stoplight. In response, Bonin wordlessly leaned across and grabbed Pugh by the collar, dragging him back into the passenger seat. According to Pugh, Bonin then confided in him that he enjoyed abducting young male hitchhikers on Friday and Saturday nights, whom he then restrained and abused before strangling them to death with their own T-shirts. In a matter-of-fact tone, Bonin then informed Pugh: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> somebody, you should make a plan and find a place to dump the body before you even pick a victim." [...] Bonin then informed Pugh he had not chosen to refrain from assaulting and killing him out of sentiment; he'd been spared because the pair had been seen leaving Fraser's party together.|$|E

2500|$|Stalin's {{forgiveness}} for Kavtaradze has drawn interest from historians, {{as did the}} fact Stalin's attitudes toward his friend remained ambiguous after {{he was released from}} prison. In his Let History Judge, Roy Medvedev cites an episode occurring circa 1939, reported to him by Kavtaradze himself: during dinner at the Kremlin, Kavtaradze was addressed by Stalin the words [...] "And yet <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me". Medvedev notes: [...] "Some historians may see this comment as proof of Stalin's paranoia. But Stalin knew well that Kavtaradze never tried <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> him. However, he could not admit this openly, for then {{he would have had to}} reconsider the execution of Budu Mdivani and many other Communists involved in the case. It was much simpler to 'forgive' Kavtaradze alone." [...] In his view, the case was similar to that of Alyosha Svanidze (the brother of Stalin's first wife Ekaterina Svanidze), who was shot after refusing to confess similar crimes. He concluded: [...] "All these actions reveal a misanthropic tyrant, not a mentally ill person who did not know what he was doing." [...] Reportedly, Sergey Kavtaradze himself believed that the conversation showed Stalin to be [...] "sick". Simon Sebag Montefiore, who places this event right after the Kavtaradzes' liberation, cites the line as: [...] "Nevertheless, <b>you</b> all <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me?", and gives Kavtaradze's reply to it as [...] "Do you really think so?" [...] He also records an exchange between Stalin and Sofia Kavtaradze: Stalin, looking at her hair (which had turned white in prison), commented [...] "We have tortured you too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> big game," [...] I {{heard some}} one say, {{who it was}} I really forget, [...] "there's the man {{to show you how}} to do it--Hunter Quatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too." ...|$|E

5000|$|Once {{the sage}} Agastya was invited. Agastya came to Ilvala and the sage was {{received}} with reverence and great honour. Sage Agastya with his divne power knew {{the intention of}} the hosts and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put an end to this. Agastya ate the food served to him. As soon as the sage finished eating, Ilvala called,"Vatape atragacha"(Vatapi come here). Immediately, Agastya who knows what Ilvala was up to passed his right hand over his stomach and said,"Vatapi Jeernobhava"(Vatape get digested). Vatapi could not come out of Agastya's stomach {{and that was the end}} of the demon. Ilvala, was scared. He went on shouting [...] "Vatapi atragacha" [...] Agastya then he said,"oh,you wicked Ilvala, <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> me,but your brother Vatapi cannot come out and he is already digested". Ilvala decided to take revenge on Agastya for killing his brother and attacked Agastya. With the power of his tapas (penance), Agastya reduced Ilvala to ashes. In this way Agastya rid the world of the two terrible demons who were troubling the people and helped people live in peace.|$|R

5000|$|The health {{ministry}} {{said that}} killing the pigs would serve no purpose in preventing an outbreak {{in the country}} that has no reported cases of swine flu. Ehassan Jafar, a spokesperson for the country's health ministry, said that [...] "it does not matter" [...] since the virus is able to transmit itself between humans now.
