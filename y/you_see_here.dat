25|$|The mid-1970s {{were the}} heydey of the World Touring Car Championships. Competitors of Jaguar like Ford and BMW had seen success {{here and it}} was a logical {{progression}} for Jaguar to try their hand at it too. For the 1976 season, British Leyland contracted James Broad and his tuning and engineering outfit, Broadspeed Engineering, a firm which had seen previous success racing Minis and Ford Capris around Europe. Broad saw potential in Jaguar’s then flagship coupe, the XJ12C. This {{led to the development of}} the car <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> – the , which has popped up at Duncan Hamilton for sale.|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} on the episode, investigative journalist Mark Ebner {{served as a}} consultant to Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Ebner had previously authored The New York Times best seller Hollywood, Interrupted, which includes an analysis of the Church of Scientology and its effects on the culture in Hollywood, and has a chapter on Tom Cruise and John Travolta's relationship to Scientology. On the official Comedy Central website for the South Park episode, it is asserted that the section of [...] "Trapped in the Closet" [...] that explains Scientology's portrayal and beliefs was not exaggerated: [...] "Nothing about what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> is exaggerated in the slightest. Seriously." [...] The title is a reference to the R. Kelly song of the same name, and a depiction of R. Kelly appears in the episode to sing a parody of it.|$|E
500|$|This {{wall map}} has no title {{but it is}} {{normally}} referred to as Orbis Imago (from the first sentence of the central legend, below). Size: [...] Dedicated to Johannes Drosius. Two copies extant: [...] one at the American Geographical Society Library (link above), and another at the New York Public Library. The first map identifying North American and South America. [...] The map was a slightly modified copy of a [...] (and its text) by Oronce Fine. The double cordiform projection, {{may well have been}} chosen because of its relationship to aspects of Lutheran beliefs. A notice to the reader (...) {{at the top of the}} map says: [...] "Let America, Sarmatia and India bear witness, Dear Reader, that the image of the world <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> is newer and more correct than those that have been circulated hitherto. We propose with regard to the different parts of the world to treat, successively, particular regions more broadly, as we are already doing with Europe, and you may soon expect a universal map, which will not be inferior to that of Ptolemy. Farewell. 1538".|$|E

The blues and purples and yellows tone, and yet, if I've got the hot {{glare of the}} sun right, {{you feel that the}} figure's exotic and doesn't belong to the scene. The latter really needs an olive-skinned daughter of the passionate South; but the girl I've painted ought to walk in the moonlight through cool forest glades." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{doors open}} 30 minutes prior to show start due to guests {{coming in and}} taking their seats. Approximately 5 minutes before the show is set to begin, Dave (the cameraman) and Marty (a new crew member) comes out and tells the {{audience}} that they're on location in Italy shooting a scene for a new action movie, directed by Morgan Ross. They ask for individual volunteers from the audience to act out various scenes such as being in an armed hold-up, pointing at the getaway vehicle and ooohing and aaahing at near-misses. The final piece of filming with the audience is a mexican wave featuring all 2000 audience members. Dave then sends Marty off to get the buggy and to reset red rally car. A safety spiel then follows stating [...] "In the interest of safety, ... please do not try anything of what <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> today, on your way home".|$|E
2500|$|Cycle World and Motor Cycle News both {{commented on}} how Kawasaki had claimed {{the high end}} of the market with the H2, moving past a {{stagnant}} market (at least from the Japanese Big Four manufacturers) full of cookie-cutter sportbikes and low-priced entry level bikes, and had set up the H2 as a halo model for the entire brand. Cycle World's Kevin Cameron said [...] "When we look at the current crop of 1000s, all date from before our present [...] "recession," [...] and what little has come by way of new product has sought to please the mostly imaginary [...] "new buyer" [...] with low-tech delights." [...] Highlighting Kawasaki's ability to create a product leveraging aerodynamic, turbine and engine technology design expertise from across the large Kawasaki Heavy Industries conglomerate (called a [...] "vast industrial complex" [...] by Sport Rider), an unsigned Motor Cycle News piece said [...] "The H2R <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> is the very pinnacle of what Kawasaki can do... This is the firm's halo product, and every element is Kawasaki at its very best, from the engine and aerodynamic development, through to the mirror-finish black chrome paint specially developed for this model." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>here</b> in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
