There are ponderous archways down there, also, over which the destroying [...] "plough" [...] of prophecy passed harmless. It is pleasant to know we are disappointed, in that we never dreamed we might see portions of the actual Temple of Solomon, and <b>yet</b> <b>experience</b> no shadow of suspicion that they were a monkish humbug and a fraud.|$|E
60|$|Of {{a nature}} {{profound}} and inquisitive, though {{with a great}} fund of reverence which had been developed by an ecclesiastical education, Lothair now {{felt that he had}} started in life with an extravagant appreciation of the influence of the religious principle on the conduct of human affairs. With him, when heaven was so nigh, earth could not be remembered; and <b>yet</b> <b>experience</b> showed that, so long as one was on the earth, the incidents of this planet considerably controlled one's existence, both in behavior and in thought. All the world could not retire to Mount Athos. It was clear, therefore, that there was a juster conception of the relations between religion and life than that which he had at first adopted.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Hutton {{was touched}} with shame and remorse. To be thanked like this, worshipped for having seduced the girl--it was too much. It {{had just been}} a piece of {{imbecile}} wantonness. Imbecile, idiotic: {{there was no other}} way to describe it. For, when all was said, he had derived very little pleasure from it. Taking all things together, he had probably been more bored than amused. Once upon a time he had believed himself to be a hedonist. But to be a hedonist implies a certain process of reasoning, a deliberate choice of known pleasures, a rejection of known pains. This had been done without reason, against it. For he knew beforehand--so well, so well--that there was no interest or pleasure to be derived from these wretched affairs. And yet each time the vague itch came upon him he succumbed, involving himself once more in the old stupidity. There had been Maggie, his wife's maid, and Edith, the girl on the farm, and Mrs. Pringle, and the waitress in London, and others--there seemed to be dozens of them. It had all been so stale and boring. He knew it would be; he always knew. And yet, and <b>yet....</b> <b>Experience</b> doesn't teach.|$|E

6000|$|... "In {{that which}} I now propose, we will discard the {{interior}} points of this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts. Not the least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events. It is the mal-practice {{of the courts}} to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy. <b>Yet</b> <b>experience</b> has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly irrelevant. It is through the spirit of this principle, if not precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen. But perhaps you do not comprehend me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out {{of the range of}} ordinary expectation. It is no longer philosophical to base, upon what has been, a vision of what is to be. Accident is admitted as a portion of the substructure. We make chance a matter of absolute calculation. We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the mathematical formulae of the schools.|$|E
60|$|Technical {{instruction}} tempts {{to violence}} (as a short cut) more than liberal education. The sailor in Mr Rudyard Kipling's Captains Courageous, teaching the boy {{the names of}} the ship's tackle with a rope's end, does not disgust us as our schoolmasters do, especially as the boy was a spoiled boy. But an unspoiled boy would not have needed that drastic medicine. Technical training may be as tedious as learning to skate or to play the piano or violin; but it is the price one must pay to achieve certain desirable results or necessary ends. It is a monstrous thing to force a child to learn Latin or Greek or mathematics on the ground that they are an indispensable gymnastic for the mental powers. It would be monstrous even if it were true; for there is no labor that might not be imposed on a child or an adult on the same pretext; but as a glance at the average products of our public school and university education shews that it is not true, it need not trouble us. But {{it is a fact that}} ignorance of Latin and Greek and mathematics closes certain careers to men (I do not mean artificial, unnecessary, noxious careers like those of the commercial schoolmaster). Languages, even dead ones, have their uses; and, as it seems to many of us, mathematics have their uses. They will always be learned by people who want to learn them; and people will always want to learn them as long as they are of any importance in life: indeed the want will survive their importance: superstition is nowhere stronger than in the field of obsolete acquirements. And they will never be learnt fruitfully by people who do not want to learn them either for their own sake or for use in necessary work. There is no harder schoolmaster than experience; and <b>yet</b> <b>experience</b> fails to teach where there is no desire to learn.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{we are not}} at all {{concerned}} to dispute such positions as that Feeling is the right starting-point of moral education; that in forming character appeal should be to the heart rather than to the understanding; that the only basis on which our faculties can be harmoniously ordered is the preponderance of affection over reason. These propositions open much grave and complex discussion, and they are not to our present purpose. We only desire to state the evil of the notion that a man is warranted in comforting himself with dogmas and formularies, which he has first to empty of all definite, precise, and clearly determinable significance, before he can {{get them out of the}} way of his religious sensibilities. Whether Reason or Affection is to have the empire in the society of the future, when Reason may possibly have no more to discover for us in the region of morals and religion, and so will have become emeritus and taken a lower place, as of a tutor whose services the human family, being now grown up, no longer requires,--however this may be, it is at least certain that in the meantime the spiritual life of man needs direction quite as much as it needs impulse, and light quite as much as force. This direction and light can only be safely procured by the free and vigorous use of the intelligence. But the intelligence is not free in the presence of a mortal fear lest its conclusions should trouble soft tranquillity of spirit. There is always hope of a man so long as he dwells in the region of the direct categorical proposition and the unambiguous term; so long as he does not deny the rightly drawn conclusion after accepting the major and minor premisses. This may seem a scanty virtue and very easy grace. <b>Yet</b> <b>experience</b> shows it to be too hard of attainment for those who tamper with disinterestedness of conviction, for the sake of luxuriating in the softness of spiritual transport without interruption from a syllogism. It is true that there are now and then in life as in history noble and fair natures, that by the silent teaching and unconscious example of their inborn purity, star-like constancy, and great devotion, do carry the world about them to further heights of living than can be attained by ratiocination. But these, the blameless and loved saints of the earth, rise too rarely on our dull horizons to make a rule for the world. The law of things is that they who tamper with veracity, from whatever motive, are tampering with the vital force of human progress. Our comfort and the delight of the religious imagination are no better than forms of self-indulgence, when they are secured at the cost of that love of truth on which, more than on anything else, the increase of light and happiness among men must depend. We have to fight and do lifelong battle against the forces of darkness, and anything that turns the edge of reason blunts the surest and most potent of our weapons.|$|E

50|$|Vulnerabilities {{and risks}} {{go hand in}} hand: an {{organization}} may {{have a lot of}} vulnerabilities (e.g., in its production processes) <b>yet</b> <b>experience</b> little risks from the environment in which it operates (e.g., little competition), or else it may have few vulnerabilities but face a very challenging environment full of, for example, politico-legal upheavals. Organizations are only vulnerable if they face risks, and risks become significant only if the organization feels vulnerable towards them. Generally speaking, organizations trade off between operating in risky environments and the level of vulnerabilities they accept to bear. In project management, points of vulnerabilities (POVs) impede most particularly on the calendar of tasks and activities, the costs and the norms of quality (the triple constraints). Risks (unlike POVs) refer to the eight areas of activity: (Plan) financial and organizational;(Processes) environmental and technological; (People) marketing and sociocultural; and (Power) legal and political.|$|E

50|$|There is some {{uncertainty}} about {{to what degree}} visual snow constitutes a true HPPD symptom. There are many individuals who have never used a drug which could have caused the onset, but <b>yet</b> <b>experience</b> the same grainy vision reported by HPPD sufferers. There are a few potential reasons for this, the most obvious of which being {{the theory that the}} drug usage may exaggerate the intensity of visual snow. Another theory is that instead, there may be no change in the severity or magnitude of the visual snow, but perhaps the drug usage opens sensory pathways that result in the individual becoming more aware of any visual disturbances that may have simply not been noticed before the incidence of drug use. As for root cause of visual snow, some theories suggest that it is the result of thermal noise in the visual cortex or in the 'Optic Pathway' (encompassing photoreceptor cells on the retina, the optic nerve, and the optic chiasm), as eye tests for individuals who experience visual snow often reveal that physically, the eye is perfectly normal, and in many cases the individual still maintains 20/20 vision.|$|E
