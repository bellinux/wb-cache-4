500|$|In October 1990, {{after he}} had ceased running the [...] "Wake up!" [...] TV spots, Peterson debuted an alarm clock {{in the shape of}} a {{television}} set with his face in the center and voice as the alarm, saying: [...] "Wake up! Wake up to a happy day!" [...] Peterson said of the promotion at the time: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> face in 5,000 homes in Portland, it certainly can't hurt." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Verdi's {{dissatisfaction with}} some of the librettist's work led him to find a local {{collaborator}} to help revise some of the sections. [...] Accordingly, he called upon an Italian exile in Paris, the politician, former professor of law, poet and writer Giuseppe Montanelli, to do this. Piave learned nothing of the revisions until he received a note from Verdi: [...] "Here is the libretto, shortened and altered more or less as it must be. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> name to or it, just as you please". [...] However, he also learned nothing of the anonymous collaborator either. [...] After the premiere of Le trouvère on 12 January 1857, Verdi and Strepponi left Paris to return to Italy, then both went to Venice for the March premiere.|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>can</b> {{say that}} <b>you</b> know her old aunt wouldn't,--wouldn't refuse {{to have her}} back again. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> it <b>your</b> own way, you know. You needn't make me find words for you." ...|$|R
50|$|Whereas if {{you send}} out SWAP troopers first, 3 seconds later <b>you</b> <b>can</b> then <b>put</b> <b>your</b> buggy on the field. Meaning you get both your units out onto the field faster.|$|R
6000|$|Hallam made {{a gesture}} of impatience. [...] "Then you can let him wait," [...] he said. [...] "This deal will pay you better. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> own price on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} {{luck in the}} enterprise,' said Doctor Bindon. 'You'll soon be out of that chair, and then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> impulse to the test. But--after twenty years of silence--I should say, don't!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next Saturday? Next Saturday? My dear boy, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> foot to {{the ground}} by next Saturday, you may take it as {{evidence}} that the age of miracles is not past. Next Saturday, indeed! Ha, ha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think you're to be pitied in the least; {{a husband}} with asthma {{is like a}} captive golf-ball, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hand on him when you want him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With Sid Dallam's love," [...] he said, as she pinned {{them on her}} gown. [...] "I {{tried to}} get Lily--Mrs. Sid--for lunch, but <b>you</b> never <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> finger on her. She'll amuse you, Honora." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> down <b>your</b> {{guns for}} the present. Mrs. Renshaw has {{just told me}} that breakfast is ready." [...] Mrs. Renshaw and Marion had indeed gone quietly about the work of {{preparing}} breakfast for their defenders.|$|R
60|$|GEORGE. In {{that case}} I've got {{nothing more to}} say. You can't expect me {{not to be a}} little disappointed, but after all the chief thing is your happiness, and {{whatever}} I can do I will. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> shirt on that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't do that!" [...] cried Davis, {{recoiling}} {{from the}} touch. [...] "Can't you see I'm all broken {{up the way}} it is? Come along, then; come along, old man; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> trust in me right through; come along and get dry clothes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you can feel, you know. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> {{hand on the}} top of my head. I mustn't speak, you know; but I'm sure I shall laugh; {{and then}} you must guess that it's Marian." [...] That was her idea of playing blindman's buff {{according}} to the strict rigour of the game.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're too particular, Barb'ry Aleshine," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "about your comforts. If {{you find}} the ground too hard to sleep on, when you get there, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> on <b>your</b> life-preserver, {{and go to bed}} in the water." ...|$|R
5000|$|The artwork {{features}} a photo {{taken from a}} car. Ameriie stated on an interview that the EP is titled Drive because it's [...] "music that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> in <b>your</b> car and drive to". It shows a road with fog and nature around it. It also shows Amerie's name on the bottom right (stylized as AMERIIE).|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} how {{to make it easier to}} abstain. Stop {{studying}} and write a novel into which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> all <b>your</b> wise things, and so clear your brains for a new start by and by. Do I should so like to read it," [...] cried Rose, delighted with the project, for she was sure Mac could do anything he liked in that line.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am {{sure that}} you are not fit to walk, even that distance. Now, I will lift you on my saddle, and you can sit sideways. There, I will walk by your side, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> hand to my {{shoulder}} to steady yourself. Surajah can lead your horse and his own, and Ibrahim can take mine." ...|$|E
60|$|However, if {{you will}} examine every thought that occurs to you {{for the next two}} days, you will find that in at least nine cases out of ten <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> finger on the outside suggestion--And that ought to {{convince}} you that No. 10 had that source too, although you cannot at present hunt it down and find it.|$|E
60|$|But come; {{for the sun}} burns bright, {{and fishing}} is impossible: lie down upon the bank, above this stop. There is a campshutting (a {{boarding}} in English) on which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> elbows. Lie down on your face, and look down through two or three feet of water clear as air into the water forest where the great trout feed.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Samuel, I don't {{think she}} {{means to be}} doing you any harm. You know she always did say-- Don't, Bessy; how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> fingers into the basin in that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop, my dear fellow," [...] {{interrupted}} Tom, [...] "don't become energetic! I {{accept your}} answer to the general question; but how many people, think <b>you,</b> <b>can</b> afford to <b>put</b> <b>your</b> theory in practice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will, if I know my opponents," [...] said Haldane significantly. [...] "Take off {{two more}} dollars, and, {{if there are}} any buyers, don't let them think you're not in earnest. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> another of <b>your</b> friends on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should say}} that you had better take {{possession}} of this, Bey. There {{seems to be a}} large courtyard, where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> camels. It is not likely that the Dervishes will return, but it is as well to be prepared. The house is strong, and we could hold out here against a host, unless they were provided with cannon.|$|E
6000|$|Gordon laughed. [...] "Oh, yes," [...] he said, [...] "I like that, naturally. I {{guess you}} would have taken their view of him once. Well, since <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> pride in your pocket, you're evidently growing. There's just one way of putting {{anything}} through here, and that's to take hold and hang right on, {{no matter what it}} costs. I guess there's one of the boys wanting you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{know you}} better," [...] I replied [...] "than {{to think that}} you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is {{probably}} arrived when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> theories into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie number one," [...] {{said the}} old man; [...] "I never saw either of them until two months ago, and I {{have never been in}} Africa in my life, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> that in <b>your</b> pipe and smoke it, Mr. Busybody Holmes!" ...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of charms available, such little figurine characters, rhinestone crystal charms, and small teddy bears. Some charms flash or light up when the phone rings. Many charms also have a small bell {{attached}} and there are charms available in Gashapon machines, many of which are based on characters from various popular franchises, such as video games. There are also some charms which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> on <b>your</b> finger to clean your cellphone display.|$|R
5000|$|Biohacker Hannes Sjöblad {{has been}} experimenting with NFC (Near Field Communication) chip {{implants}} since 2015. During his talk at Echappée Voléé 2016 in Paris, Sjöblad disclosed that he has also implanted himself between his forefinger and thumb and uses it to unlock doors, make payments, and unlock his phone (essentially replacing anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> in <b>your</b> pockets). Additionally, Sjöblad has hosted several [...] "implant parties," [...] where interested individuals can also be implanted with the chip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, peg {{number one}} goes in here, where I have picked a hole between the stones. Then I've made this other log into a mallet, and with two cracks {{there it is}} firm fixed, so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> weight on it. Now these two go {{in the same way}} into the holes above here. So! Now, you see, you can stand up there and look out of that window without asking too much of your toe joint. Try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] I said, [...] "I {{thank you}} heartily for your offer. You come of {{as good a}} house as mine, and yours is the brag of the Border, as mine is {{of the kingdom of}} Fife. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> pride in your pouch, faith, so can I; the rather that there is nothing else therein, and so room enough and to spare. But, as {{touching}} what this gentle demoiselle has said, I may march also, may I not, when the Maid rides to Orleans?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} so," [...] said he, [...] "and here's {{the amount}} for four months. I brought a receipt. You can sign {{it with a}} lead-pencil. That will do. Now put all this money in your inside pockets. Some in your vest, and some in your under-coat. Don't bundle it up too much, and be sure and pin it in. Pin it from the inside, right through the money, if <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Put</b> <b>your</b> clothes under your pillow at night. Good-bye! I expect they'll be sounding the gong directly, {{for us to get}} ashore." ...|$|E
5000|$|On 26 May, Member of Parliament Shashi Tharoor filed a civil {{defamation}} {{case in the}} Delhi High Court against Goswami and Republic TV {{in connection}} with the channel's broadcast of news items from 8 to 13 May claiming his link in his wife Sunanda Pushkar's death in 2014. Seeking the channel's response, Justice Manmohan of the High Court said, [...] "Bring down the rhetoric. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> out <b>your</b> story, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> out the facts.

6000|$|Miss Garth {{shook her}} head. [...] "My memory for dates is bad {{at the best}} of times," [...] she said. [...] "I am too {{confused}} to exert it at a moment's notice. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>your</b> question in no other form?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, too few! Too few! How very unfortunate, Watson! However, such as {{they are}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them in <b>your</b> watchpocket. And {{all the rest of}} your money in your left trouser pocket. Thank you. It will balance you so much better like that." ...|$|R
