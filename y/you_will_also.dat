The {{movie is a}} viscerally exciting, adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows {{a hole in the}} condescending assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise."Scott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film's limits, [...] "Ms. Bigelow, practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism, distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant, agonizing set pieces." [...] He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film, saying that it [...] "focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the performances of Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably, and said their characters reveal their [...] "unlooked-for aspects", such as Renner's character being playful with an Iraqi boy. Turan applauded Boal's [...] "lean and compelling" [...] script and said of Bigelow's direction, [...] "Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien, culturally unfathomable atmosphere." ...|$|E
5000|$|The final track, [...] "Helvegen" [...] ("the Road to Hel") is {{essentially}} a funeral song. The song (and album) closes with the famous stanza from Hávamál: [...] "Cattle die, kinsmen die, <b>You</b> yourself <b>will</b> <b>also</b> die, but the word about <b>you</b> <b>will</b> never die, if you win a good reputation. Cattle die, kinsmen die, <b>You</b> yourself <b>will</b> <b>also</b> die, I know one that never dies: the judgement of those who died".

[...] To grow algae you need lots of CO2, but if you get it from air <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> get all kinds of other organisms, some of which eat algae.

[...] Governments trying to address the external costs of coal power plants may have a carbon tax or carbon credit that provides additional motivation to use CO2 from smokestacks.

2500|$|.....a pianist {{who appears}} to be {{something}} really quite extraordinary. [...] I had to overcome great resistance in order to go at all, for the description I'd heard from Dr. Hoffmann and from Maurice Zam had made me very skeptical. [...] But I must say that I have never heard such a pianist before...First, [...] he does not play at all in the style you and I strive for. [...] And just as I did not judge him on that basis, I imagine that when you hear him, you too will be compelled to ignore all matters of principle, and probably will end up doing just as I did. [...] For your principles would not be the proper standard to apply. [...] What he plays is expression in the older sense of the word, nothing else; but such power of expression I have never heard before. [...] You will disagree with his tempis as much as I did. [...] <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>also</b> note that he often seems to give primacy to sharp contrasts at the expense of form, the latter appearing to get lost. [...] I say appearing to; for then, in its own way, his music surprisingly regains its form, makes sense, establishes its own boundaries. [...] The sound he brings out of the piano is unheard of, or at least I have never heard anything like it. [...] He himself seems not to know how he produces these novel and quite incredible sounds - although he appears to be a man of intelligence and not just some flaccid dreamer. [...] And such fullness of tone, achieved without ever becoming rough, I have never before encountered. [...] For me, and probably for you too, it's really too much fullness, but as a whole it displays incredible novelty and persuasiveness. [...] And above all he's only [...] old, so he's still got several stages of development before him, from which one may expect great things, given his point of departure... it is amazing what he plays and how he plays it. [...] One never senses that it is difficult, that it is technique - no, it is simply a power of the will, capable of soaring over all imaginable difficulties in the realization of an idea. - You see, I'm waxing almost poetic.|$|E
