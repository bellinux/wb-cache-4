2500|$|Harrison {{was noted}} as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{refreshing}} young faces to light up TV screens this new season." [...] Fox publicists issued press releases glossing over Harrison's deficient education and claiming for her a passion for Shakespeare, Voltaire, and Aristotle which she never possessed. Midway through its second season, Bracken's World was cancelled. Harrison said later that the studio wanted recognizable stars every week, instead of allowing the regular cast to grow as an ensemble, {{as was the case}} with shows such as [...] [...] "Had they done it like a continuing drama and focused on the regular characters, it would have lasted longer," [...] she said. [...] "NBC, however, wanted a one-hour contained show, so they would stock each episode with a big guest star. After a while, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> story.".|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes you will, dear," [...] Dorothy declared. [...] "The piglet is gone, and <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the room}} when Jellia opened the door. So, if you are innocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came {{to be in her}} room, and what has become of the piglet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Isaac Marvelling. [...] "I heard <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the yard}} behind the store right after I had called in Jackson {{to tell him}} about the robbery. We both saw you jump the fence and skip off in this direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} an ax and a rifle, but if <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> grub, Graham, the section-hand on the {{railroad}} will put me wise," [...] said Peter.

6000|$|... [Here the lightning-rod man sent {{up another}} call for me. I {{went down in}} a state of mind {{bordering}} on impatience. He said he would rather have died than interrupt me, but when he was employed to do a job, and that job was expected to be done in a clean, workmanlike manner, and when it was finished and fatigue urged him to seek the rest and recreation he stood so much in need of, and he was about to do it, but looked up and saw at a glance that all the calculations had been a little out, and if a thunder-storm were to come up, and that house, which he felt a personal interest in, stood there with nothing on earth to protect it but sixteen lightning-rods--"Let us have peace!" [...] I shrieked. [...] "Put up a hundred and fifty! Put some on the kitchen! Put a dozen on the barn! Put a couple on the cow! Put one on the cook!--scatter them all over the persecuted place till it looks like a zinc-plated, spiral-twisted, silver-mounted canebrake! Move! Use up all the material you can get your hands on, and when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> lightning-rods put up ramrods, cam-rods, stair-rods, piston-rods--anything that will pander to your dismal appetite for artificial scenery, and bring respite to my raging brain and healing to my lacerated soul!" [...] Wholly unmoved--further than to smile sweetly--this iron being simply turned back his wrist-bands daintily, and said he would now proceed to hump himself. Well, all that was nearly three hours ago. It is questionable whether I am calm enough yet to write on the noble theme of political economy, but I cannot resist the desire to try, for it is the one subject that is nearest to my heart and dearest to my brain of all this world's philosophy.] ...|$|E
50|$|Being deathblown was not {{the only}} way to die in Roma Victor. Other forms of dying {{included}} drowning in a river if <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> vigour whilst still swimming, bleeding to death after receiving a fatal wound without proper medical treatment, and suicide. If a player wished to commit suicide in the game, they could do so at any time. One attribute (muscle, vision, agility, dexterity, intuition, or stamina) would be completely zeroed.|$|R

A man in a Corvette pulled over to help. You've not been seen of since. It's been 17 years, but it's always just yesterday. Still looking for you (signed) THE ECHO PARK DUCKS." [...] It turned out that Al Medrano, a friend still living in the neighborhood, simply wanted to express that Graham had not been forgotten.|$|R

Low levels of engine oil may cause a connecting rod to break, allowing oil to escape and {{come into contact}} with engine parts. The oil would catch fire when it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components.... David Hudgens, a GM spokesman in Detroit... said, 'If <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> oil, and then that coupled with some aggressive driving, perhaps, and maybe not changing the oil very often, {{you end up with a}} broken rod, and that's where the connecting rod came in; it is still the owner's responsibility to check the oil.'

40|$|Food {{security}} {{refers to}} the ability to acquire appropriate and nutritious food on a regular and reliable basis. The NSW Population Health Survey uses a single item indicator of individual and household level food insecurity which measures financial access to food by asking the question “In the last 12 months, were there any times that <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> food and couldn’t afford to buy more?” The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relationship between food insecurity and dietary habits in the NSW population, using data from the 2007 and 2008 NSW Population Health Surveys. Dietary habits of interest comprised the frequency of consumption of energy dense nutrient poor (EDNP) foods and drinks, as well as intake of fruit and vegetables. This study explores self reported data from the 2007 and 2008 New South Wales Population Health Surveys. Six dietary intake variables were included for this analysis based on their relevance to chronic disease and weight gain: vegetable intake, fruit intake, soft drink, hot chip, salty snacks and takeaway food consumption. Responses on these variables were dichotomised into ‘healthier’/’unhealthier’ categories...|$|R
5000|$|Devolver Digital {{planned to}} reboot {{the game with}} Flying Wild Hog as the {{developer}} in mind from the start, first approaching Scott Miller of 3D Realms about new developments. As with the developer's last game Hard Reset, according to studio writer Jan Bartkowicz the game was designed to reflect the [...] "old school design" [...] with emphasis on fast-paced shooting against masses of enemies and no use of cover mechanics. Bartkowicz however also stated that they wanted the gameplay to also be new in other aspects, particularly the katana, not wanting it to be [...] "only used when <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammo" [...] but rather make it {{an integral part of}} the gameplay. In regards to the new writing style and character redesign, Bartkowicz explained it as [...] "a much more clever sense of humor and wit, rather than relying on the old Duke Nukem or Shadow Warrior tropes, falling back on jokes about women and racial stereotyping," [...] instead being drawn to what they considered to be the [...] "rich setting" [...] of the original game.|$|R

5000|$|In 2013, Turner {{questioned}} {{the assumption that}} the album featured social commentary: [...] "If that's what it was, then what was I actually saying? It was just pointing at things. I was looking at something going on, I'd be {{in the corner of the}} pub, but eventually <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> things to point at. Eventually you turn inward." ...|$|E

When not in service, the church doubles as a basketball court.|$|R

However, he had a problem with the scene in which one of the Syndicate members changes into an alien rebel, reasoning that this was because the effect had been created on such short notice. He explained, [...] "It was one of those cases where <b>you</b> just <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time, sorry to say". He later expressed a desire to one day go back and amend the effect.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game has}} failure {{animations}} when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time during a race {{and come to}} a complete stop.

If you miss (pop on the background), wait too long between popping or pop a different colour the chain will break. Also while you are chaining your score and time from each bubble is stored in a tally below the cursor. This means that until you break your chain neither your main score nor the main timer will increase {{so if you are}} not careful <b>you</b> can <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> time!" ...|$|R
