5000|$|In 1962, {{during a}} sabbatical year in Switzerland, Linvill visited an IBM {{laboratory}} in Germany, where he observed a high speed printer that used {{a set of}} small pins—like hammers—to print letters onto strips of paper.

[...] So on our return to Zurich, I told my wife and son and daughter, Candy, who was blind: [...] "Guys, I've got the most magnificent idea.

3000|$|Consider the {{following}} activity involving two hypothetical task scenarios. In both Condition 1 and Condition 2, (1) you {{are presented with}} a tablet interactive application; (2) on the screen you see a black circular line; and (3) you are asked to draw a red line {{on top of the}} black line. In Condition 1, a “finger painting” task, you use your index finger to trace directly along the existing circle perimeter. As you do so, virtual red paint oozes from under <b>your</b> <b>fingertip</b> to cover the black line. In Condition 2, you cannot trace directly on the black circle. Instead, you are asked to imagine this circle as plotted in a Cartesian space. Now you must move your left hand index up/down along the y-axis {{to the left of the}} circle simultaneous with moving your right hand index right/left along an x-axis below the circle. The application plots red points at spatial locations corresponding to the ordered-pair [x, y] Cartesian intersection of your fingers’ respective measured distances from the origin point. You are thus asked to graph a circle manually. 2 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Touching a real {{object with}} <b>your</b> <b>fingertip</b> {{provides}} simultaneous tactile and force feedback, yet most haptic interfaces for virtual environments can convey {{only one of}} these two essential modalities. To address this opportunity, we designed, prototyped, and evaluated the Touch Thimble, a new fingertip device that provides the user with the cutaneous sensation of making and breaking contact with virtual surfaces. Designed to attach to the endpoint of an impedance-type haptic interface like a SensAble Phantom, the Touch Thimble includes a slightly oversize cup that is suspended around the fingertip by passive springs. When the haptic interface applies contact forces from the virtual environment, the springs deflect to allow contact between the user 2 ̆ 7 s fingertip and the inner surface of the cup. We evaluated a prototype Touch Thimble against a standard thimble in a formal user study and found that it did not improve nor degrade subjects 2 ̆ 7 ability to recognize smoothly curving surfaces. Although four of the eight subjects preferred it to the standard interface, overall the Touch Thimble made subjects slightly slower at recognizing the presented shapes. Detailed subject comments point out strengths and weaknesses of the current design and suggest avenues for future development of the device...|$|R
