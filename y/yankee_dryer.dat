50|$|A <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer</b> is a {{pressure}} vessel {{used in the}} production of tissue paper. On the <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer,</b> the paper goes from approximately 42-45% dryness to just over 89% dryness. In industry, MG cylinders or Yankee dryers are primarily used to remove excess moisture from pulp that is about to be converted into paper. The Yankee cylinder can be equipped with a doctor blade and sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping is done by the Yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface thereby crêping the paper. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{machines}} typically {{form the}} paper web between a wire {{and a special}} fabric (felt) as they wrap around a forming roll. The web is pressed from the felt directly onto a large diameter dryer called a yankee. The paper sticks to the <b>yankee</b> <b>dryer</b> and is peeled off with a scraping blade called a doctor. Tissue machines operate at speeds of up to 2000 m/min.|$|E

40|$|Drying Doctor, a {{multiple}} technique simulator {{of the paper}} drying process, has been developed at the Pulp and Paper Research Centre, McGill University. This thesis examines the different approaches to the modeling of this process, provides a rigorous validation of the simulation program and demonstrates its utility with four containerboard machines of Norampac Inc. Several features differentiate this simulator from others. When heavy grades of paper are produced or when high intensity drying processes are used even with thin sheets, substantial thickness direction gradients of moisture content and temperature develop across the sheet, demonstrating {{the necessity of a}} fully microscale model such as employed by Drying Doctor. Using industrial and laboratory data for a variety of paper grades and drying processes, 31 uncalibrated simulations for machine speed showed a standard deviation of only 3. 4 % from known speeds. Through simulation of modified operating conditions such as steam pressure, spoiler bars, pocket air conditions and addition of the high intensity drying process, <b>Yankee</b> air impingement <b>dryers,</b> substantial production rate increases for the industrial partner's papermachines through use of the Drying Doctor simulator were shown possible...|$|R
50|$|Tissue {{paper is}} {{produced}} {{on a paper}} machine that has a single large steam heated drying cylinder (<b>yankee</b> <b>dryer)</b> fitted with a hot air hood. The raw material is paper pulp. The yankee cylinder is sprayed with adhesives to make the paper stick. Creping {{is done by the}} yankee's doctor blade that is scraping the dry paper off the cylinder surface. The crinkle (crêping) is controlled by the strength of the adhesive, geometry of the doctor blade, speed difference between the yankee and final section of the paper machine and paper pulp characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Yankee {{safety is}} an {{important}} issue and TAPPI has a committee (<b>Yankee</b> <b>Dryer</b> Safety Committee) dedicated to it. The sharper problems are present with cast iron yankee, being this material much more brittle than steel, making the yankee very sensitive to temperature differences. For example a yankee which is receiving steam while it is not rotating may be damaged by the temperature difference of the bulk {{to the bottom of the}} cylinder where the condensate is present. Particular attention shall be taken in case of fire, as direct jets of cold water on the surface of the hot yankee may damage it. Some cases of exploded yankees due to these and other reasons are unfortunately present in the history of tissue production.|$|E
40|$|In {{production}} of tissue paper, the adhesion of a liquid adhesive creping aid, compound polymer, as creping aids on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer</b> surface was investigated. A compound polymer was prepared based on mixing ratio of poly (amideamine) -epichlorohydrin resin (PAE) as an adhesive agent, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a modifier agent, and cationic fatty acid (CFA) and ethylene glycol (EG) as release agents. In order {{to simulate the}} <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer</b> cylinder, the adherence of paper to the substrate that was coated by the compound polymer solution was measured using a peel strength test. Results indicated that increasing the percent of total solid content of compound polymer would increase peel strength of paper. Peel strength of paper increases if EG as a release agent is used. The amount of PVA/PAE resin {{in the formulation of}} creping aid was critical for building a flexible and tough coating layer on to the substrate and to provide adequate adhesion of paper in peel strength test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{data mining}} {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most commonly used computer data analysis method. This paper establishes finite difference model of the data mining process using forward first difference, backward first difference and central difference and verifies the feasibility of the algorithm through Matlab software. In order to verify the suitability of the algorithm, the paper takes modeling and meshing of Proe mechanical engineering software for example and establishes the model for the <b>yankee</b> <b>dryer.</b> It achieves the meshing of complex dryer model and gets the better unstructured tetrahedral mesh. It also introduces grid to the computer mechanics simulation software and concludes simulation stress distribution of dryer through the calculation.

40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder are the key factors in the production process. They need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. A natural coating always develops {{on the surface of the}} Yankee cylinder due to evaporation from dissolved and dispersed substances and to fiber fragments that remain on the surface after creping. Nevertheless, coating chemicals are sprayed onto the Yankee surface in order to modify the adhesion between the paper and the dryer cylinder. To be able to control the process, on-line measurements of coating thickness as well as of the crepe structure of the tissue paper produced would be very valuable. In the work described in this thesis, the coating layer was analyzed chemically and morphologically to provide information about the coating layer before starting any on-line measurements. The chemicals added and the constituents of the pulps are known to the paper producers, but what is left on the cylinder and whether there are different layers of coating still remain to be investigated. The chemical analysis indicated that the adhesive content was higher in an inner layer of the coating than in the outer layer. The relative amount of polyamide-amine resin calculated on the basis of the nominal nitrogen content in the resin was low indicating that the coating consisted of a significant amount of carbohydrates or other substances. The coating layer could not be considered transparent. It was observed that the coating was thick and appeared patch-wise and that it contained fiber fragments. Measurements on a laboratory scale, to further be applied on-line on the tissue machine, have been investigated and evaluated in this study. The thickness of the coating layer on a laboratory dryer has been measured. The method was based on fluorescence with an optical brightener added to the coating chemicals sprayed on the <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer.</b> With a UV-LED (Ultra Violet - Light Emitting Diode) the coating layer was exposed to UV-light and the intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener in the layer was measured. The intensity in the trials with different thickness of the coating and no coating was scattered and no trend could be seen between the different trial points. Attempts were made to measure the wavelength of the tissue paper produced with an optical fiber perpendicular to and at an angle to the paper surface. The paper was travelling in a slow speed while the measurements were made. The collected signal to noise ratio was low and it was not possible to detect any representative characteristic wavelength of the tissue...|$|E
40|$|The creping {{process and}} the {{conditions}} on the Yankee cylinder dryer are key factors in a tissue paper mill, and they therefore need to be kept under good control {{in order to maintain}} a high and uniform quality. To this end it would be valuable {{to be able to make}} on-line measurements of Yankee coating thickness as well as the crepe structure of the tissue paper. The adhesion of paper to the cylinder affects the creping process and more information about the parameters that affect the adhesion is therefore of interest. To perform trials on a full scale or in a pilot plant is very costly and laboratory creping equipment is therefore sought after in order to be able to measure the adhesion force. The coating layer for use on the cylinder was analysed. It contained a large amount of carbohydrates and could not be considered transparent. The thickness of the coating layer was measured on a laboratory cylinder with a method based on fluorescence. An optical brightener was added to the coating chemicals and the coating layer was subjected to UV-radiation. The intensity of the light emitted by the optical brightener was measured and gave an indication of the thickness of the coating layer. The equipment has to be further investigated before it is possible to implement the new sensor on-line. New creping equipment and an adhesion method were developed for use on a laboratory scale. The equipment can operate with different creping angles and the force needed to crepe the paper can be measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers of high grammage, low dryness at adhesion, high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. A more direct method is to analyse the structure of the produced paper. Measurements were made on a tissue paper with an optical fibre sensor while the paper was travelling at low speed. The collected signal was mathematically analysed and the characteristic wavelength was calculated for different paper samples. These values were close to the wavelengths measured with an off line method by a commercial crepe analyser. Baksidestext The creping process is the heart of tissue paper manufacture. To control the process better, on-line measurements of paper structure and coating thickness are sought after. The creping is highly dependent on the adhesion of the paper to the <b>Yankee</b> <b>dryer.</b> To be able to measure the adhesion, laboratory creping equipment was also required. Different pulp parameters affect the adhesion and some of them have been investigated in this work. The coating on the Yankee cylinder consisted mainly of fiber fragments and could not be considered as transparent, which had to be considered when choosing a method to measure coating thickness. A method based on the light emitted from an optical brightener in the coating when subjected to UV-irradiation was used, but has to be further improved before it can be used on-line. A new laboratory creping method was developed to determine the adhesion between paper and metal, and the force needed to scrape off the paper with a doctor blade was measured. The highest creping force was obtained for papers made of pulp with a high drainability, high fines content and high hemicellulose content. An optical method using reflected light to measure crepe wavelength on-line was developed. The paper travelled under a sensor and the light collected was mathematically analyzed to determine the most common wavelength...|$|E
