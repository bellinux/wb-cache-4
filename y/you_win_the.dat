2500|$|Mack saw {{baseball}} as a business, {{and recognized}} that economic necessity drove the game. He explained to his cousin, Art Dempsey, that [...] "The {{best thing for}} a team financially {{is to be in}} the running and finish second. If <b>you</b> <b>win,</b> <b>the</b> players all expect raises." [...] This was one reason he was constantly collecting players, signing almost anyone to a ten-day contract to assess his talent; he was looking ahead to future seasons when his veterans would either retire or hold out for bigger salaries than Mack could give them.|$|E

Coffin took up the task and took a temporary leave from Yale, working to develop a rigorous training program modeled on Outward Bound and supervising {{the building of a}} training camp in Puerto Rico. He used his pulpit as a platform for like-minded crusaders, hosting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela, among others. Fellow Yale graduate Garry Trudeau has immortalized Coffin (combined with Coffin's protege Rev. Scotty McLennan) as [...] "the Rev. Scot Sloan" [...] in the Doonesbury comic strip. During the Vietnam War years, Coffin and his friend Howard Zinn often spoke from the same anti-war platform. An inspiring speaker, Coffin was known for optimism and humor: [...] "Remember, young people, even if <b>you</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> rat race, you're still a rat." ...|$|E

"A woman, my dear Lydia, {{with your}} appearance, your manners, your abilities, and your education, can make almost any {{excursions}} into society that she pleases if she only has money {{in her pocket}} and a respectable reference to appeal to in cases of emergency.

60|$|I didn't {{tell him}} that I came there every night, and that I came because I was paid for it. If you're a {{professional}} dancer at Geisenheimer's, you aren't supposed to advertise the fact.

Say, that Love-r-ly Cup's a joke. I win it on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and Mabel Francis wins it on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. It's all perfectly fair and square, of course. It's purely a matter of merit who wins the Love-r-ly Cup. Anybody could win it. Only somehow they don't. And the coincidence of the fact that Mabel and I always do has kind of got on the management's nerves, and they don't like us to tell people we're employed there. They prefer us to blush unseen.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{that ought}} to be {{considered}} robbery," [...] replied the captain, with a frown. [...] "Betting is a mean, shabby, contemptible way of obtaining money for nothing on false pretences. The man who bets says in his heart, `I want my friend's money without the trouble of working for it, therefore I'll offer to bet with him. In so doing I'll risk an equal sum of my own money. That's fair and honourable!' Is that logic?" [...] demanded the captain, vehemently, [...] "It is not! In the first place it is mean to want, not to speak of accepting, another man's money without working for it, and it is a false pretence to say that you risk your own money because it is not your own, it is your wife's and your children's money, who are brought to poverty, mayhap, because of your betting tendencies, and it is your baker's and butcher's money, whose bread and meat you devour (as long as they'll let you) without paying for it, because of your betting tendencies, and a proportion of it belongs to your church, which you rob, and to the poor, whom you defraud, because of your betting tendencies; and if you say that when <b>you</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> case is altered, I reply, yes, it is altered for the worse, because, instead of bringing all this evil down on your own head you hurl it, not angrily, not desperately, but, worse, with fiendish indifference on the head of your friend and his innocent family. Yes, madam, although many men do not think it so, betting is a dishonourable thing, and I'm ashamed of having done it. I repent, Mrs Tipps, the money burns my fingers, and I must return it." ...|$|E
