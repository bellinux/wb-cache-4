500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer {{us away from}} the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> all the people, to authority...

Commenting on the album and its use of samples, Pitchfork s Jeff Weiss claims that both Nas and his producers found inspiration for the album's production through the music of their childhood: [...] "The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on [...] "Life's a Bitch". Jazz rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't {{need to make the}} connection explicit—he allowed you to understand what jazz was like the first time <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> grandparents heard it."

By the 1940s, the performers had to beware of holes in the stage, unsafe wiring, faulty heating, and cockroaches. Unsafe conditions eventually led to a planned demolition.

[...] A specific concern for many parents is accommodating an adoptee in the classroom. Familiar lessons like [...] "draw your family tree" [...] or [...] "trace your eye color back through <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> grandparents to see where your genes come from" [...] could be hurtful to children who were adopted and do not know this biological information.
