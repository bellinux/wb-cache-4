The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying [...] "anything can do mystique {{if you believe in}} it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the lwa eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> on an altar." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2010, a fan-made mash-up of {{the video}} and a Sesame Street segment {{appeared}} online. The original Sesame Street clip featured a puppet portrayed as a young black girl proud of her hair. She flails her braids, cornrows, afro, and other ethnic hairstyles. According to the show's writer, Joey Mazzarino, the song was a tribute to his Ethiopian daughter's hair, writing it, stating {{that he wanted to}} say, [...] "Your hair is great. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in ponytails. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in cornrows. I wish I had hair like you." [...] The mash-up uses different shots in the show's segment paired with [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] to act as a music video. During the week of release of the [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] video, the Sesame Street clip also went viral. Veronica Miller of NPR commented that with both clips, [...] "little black girls are having the best week ever", noting the rarity that [...] "little African-American girls are publicly celebrated for their uniqueness and beauty", due to non-positive comments about their physical appearance, making them question individual and collective beauty. On the single's video, Miller said, [...] "Little Willow is operating with a sort of empowerment that grown women can sense, admire, and in some cases, envy", stating, [...] "not many girls are taught that it's OK to openly love and affirm yourself." [...] Noting that the norm is not to be [...] "sassy" [...] or [...] "cute", she said that [...] "Whip My Hair" [...] is [...] "a celebration of little girls celebrating themselves".|$|E
2500|$|Before {{opening day}} for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1961, talks had already started between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies for a {{potential}} trade involving Demeter and Phillies reliever Turk Farrell. A deal was reached on May 4, sending Don and Charley Smith to Philadelphia for Farrell and Joe Koppe. Phillies manager Gene Mauch was glad about the deal, announcing immediately after the trade that Demeter would be a starter immediately. Mauch remarked, [...] "There aren't many better center fielders around than he is, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> in the book right now that he'll hit more than 20 home runs any year he plays a full season in our park." [...] Don would prove the prophetic manager to be correct, hitting 21, 29, and 22 home runs in 3 seasons with Philadelphia.|$|E

40|$|A {{balanced}} scorecard is a management decision tool. It {{is intended to}} be a framework for linking strategy with operational performance measures. In practice, it is an integrated report, usually showing diverse areas of performance an organization most values. This is a departure from traditional performance measurement tools such as financial reports, sales reports, production reports and customer survey reports. Each of those reports focuses on performance along a single dimension. This is akin to the blind man understanding the attributes of an elephant in terms of the trunk or tail he is holding. The term "balance " suggests that objectives and measures along different dimensions, assembled together on one sheet or screen, offer a multi-dimensional and qualitatively better view of organizational success. As popularized by Kaplan and Norton, the right measures address performance regarding the management of finances, processes, customers and employee development. A well-designed scorecard should not exceed twenty measures, all connected to strategic objectives. It helps management (if not line employees) make good, fast decisions on what to improve or celebrate. The purpose is to understand what the whole elephant looks like so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> food where <b>it...</b>|$|R
5000|$|It's {{kind of a}} {{funny little}} title. And again, you {{have to kind of}} know the history of Fullerton music and the Adolescents in particular. There's an {{intentional}} inside joke there. The Naughty Women were a transvestite punk rock band from Fullerton who we all loved dearly, just a great rock band. Very, very punk rock, very, very fun. And they're a very funny bunch of guys. And the Black Sweaters were a group of girls that used to always hang around the scene, they were kind of the resident groupies of the early Fullerton scene. So we have Naughty Women in Black Sweaters. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> kind of <b>put</b> <b>it</b> all together and it has a whole new meaning.

You at least will listen to me, Lady Anne. Do I look like an assassin by choice? Do I seem like the sort of person to indulge in these dangerous exercises for mere amusement? You are both young, you have both your lives before you. Why do you, Sir Julien, voluntarily put the yoke about your neck? Why do you, my gracious young lady, suffer the man with whom your life is to be linked to deliver himself over voluntarily into a state of bondage? Politics lose all glamor to those who have dwelt within the walls. Sir Julien has dwelt there and so have I. He knows in his heart whether it is worth while. One lives always amidst a clamor of evil tongues, a pestilent trail of poisonous suspicions. One gives up one's life to be flouted and misunderstood, to be accused of evil motives and every imaginable crime. When it is all over, when one has time to think of all that one has missed, one feels that all one has done could have been done just as well by the next man in the street. That is the end of it. And against all that, you two have the world before <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> be rich--very rich indeed. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> make an idyll of this love of yours. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> travel around the world in your own yacht, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> visit all strange countries, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> wander where <b>you</b> will, and all the time affairs in the world will go on very much the same as if you had stayed and given the best hours of your life to the dusty treadmill. I am an old man, Lady Anne, and I have an evil name in your country. They call me greedy, subtle, and ambitious. I may be all these things, but let me assure you that if I had my time over again my master could find another servant and my country another toiler.
