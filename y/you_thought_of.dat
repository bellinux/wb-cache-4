Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves with German ghost stories, which prompted Byron to propose that they [...] "each write a ghost story". Unable {{to think of a}} story, young Mary Godwin became anxious: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a story? I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative." [...] During one mid-June evening, the discussions turned {{to the nature of the}} principle of life.

2500|$|Some {{criticism}} of the Quran has revolved around two verses known as the [...] "Satanic Verses".
