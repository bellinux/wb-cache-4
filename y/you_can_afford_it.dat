6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "and if I were you, Almira, I {{would take it}} without hesitating a moment. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> {{just as well as}} not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Devine, [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> {{but if you}} {{indulge in}} many changes of that kind you're {{not going to have}} very much of a dowry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet <b>you</b> <b>can</b> better <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> than others, perhaps. But let me {{observe that}} most women, {{if not always}} ready to play with fire, are {{generally}} eager {{to play with a}} loose spark or so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'As {{far as it}} goes, truly,' {{returned}} Carker, {{with an air of}} disparagement' 'It {{wants that}} qualification. Well! we have said enough about it; and though <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to praise <b>it,</b> I thank you nonetheless. Will you walk in?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, constable," [...] she replied. [...] "The {{circumstances}} were suspicious, and you only did your duty. However, {{you might have}} made it very unpleasant for me if you had chosen {{to take me to}} the lockup instead of bringing me here, and I am very willing to give you what I promised <b>you.</b> I <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> very well," [...] she said cheerfully, as he still hesitated, [...] "and I dare say it will be useful to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, at that, George, don't know's <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> I've {{heard your}} {{business}} has been kind of under {{the eye of the}} gov'ment since you stole the tail of Eathorne Park and sold it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Afford it!" [...] exclaimed Ned, in rising wrath, [...] "how can 'ee say <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> w'en I 'aven't {{had enough}} grog to half screw me, an' not a brown left. Did the doctor ask a fee?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right," [...] {{agreed the}} superintendent. [...] "A camp isn't quite {{the place for}} a married man--but--well, there's plenty of room at the house, and if you suit us as well as I think you will <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> You write to her to come on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a bit, man," [...] said Joe, as he {{bound up}} the injured member {{by the simple}} process of tying a kerchief right round his friend's face and head; [...] "it'll be handsomer than ever. There was always too much of <b>it.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to have <b>it</b> reduced." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Lord, Lord, only {{to think}} of it; why, we shall be downright rich!” said his wife. “Plenty of sugar and tea, a bit of meat when we fancy it, and a drop of rum to warm our old bones on Saturday night. It is wonderful, John. The Lord be praised for His mercies! But <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> Will? We wouldn’t take it from you if you can’t, not for ever so.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Priscilla is a tyrant, mother; {{and a very}} stern one. Just make up {{your mind}} to stay here till Christmas. If I tell <b>you</b> that I <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> surely that ought to be enough." [...] Then Dorothy entered the room, and Hugh appealed to her. Dorothy had come to Nuncombe only on the day before, and had not been {{consulted}} on the subject. She had been told that the Clock House was to be abandoned, and had been taken down to inspect the cottage in which old Soames had lived;--but her opinion had not been asked. Priscilla had quite made up her mind, and why should she ask an opinion of any one? But now Dorothy's opinion was demanded. [...] "It's what I call the rhodomontade of independence," [...] said Hugh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I mean if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> I {{like a man}} to like pleasure. But I despise a man {{who makes}} a {{business}} of his pleasures. When I hear that this man is the best whist-player in London, and that man the best billiard-player, I always {{know that they can}} do nothing else, and then I despise them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{rests with}} {{them by the}} nature of things. Why should you who are queens come down from your thrones? If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it,</b> WE can't. We can't afford to turn our women, our Madonnas, our Saint Catherines, our Mona Lisas, our goddesses and angels and fairy princesses, into a sort of man. Womanhood is sacred to me. My {{politics}} in that matter wouldn't be to give women votes. I'm a Socialist, Miss Stanley." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mary Louise was {{modest and}} sweet in demeanor; her pleas were as {{pleasant}} {{as they were}} persuasive; there was nothing virulent or dominant in her attitude. But when she said: [...] "Really, Mr. So-and-so, you ought to take more bonds than that; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it</b> and our country needs the money," [...] the argument was generally effective, and when she had smilingly pinned the bond button on a man's coat and passed on to interview others, she left him wondering why he had bought more bonds than he ever had intended to, or even provoked with himself that he had subscribed at all. These were {{the people who had}} generally resisted all former pleadings of the regular committee and had resolved to ignore the bond sale altogether. But perhaps their chagrin was equalled by their satisfaction in having been won over by a pretty girl, whose manner and appearance were alike irresistible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lydie," [...] he said impetuously, [...] "in {{the name}} of God throw aside your armour for one moment! Is life so long that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> to waste <b>it?</b> Have you learned the secret of {{perpetual}} youth that you deliberately fritter away its golden moments in order to rush after the Dead Sea fruit of domination and power? Lydie!" [...] he whispered with passionate tenderness; [...] "my little Lydie of the crisp chestnut hair, of the fragrant woods around Cluny, leave those giddy heights of ambition; come down to earth, where my arms await you! I will tell you of things, my little Lydie, which are far more beautiful, far more desirable, than the sceptre and kingdom of France; and when I press you close to my heart you will taste a joy far sweeter than that which a crown of glory <b>can</b> give. Will <b>you</b> not listen to me, Lydie? Will you not share with me that joy which renders men the equal of God?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now we {{must begin}} to see about furniture," [...] Bob Grimstone said. [...] "The best plan, I think, will be for you two to go round of an evening to all the shops in the neighborhood, and mark off just what you think will suit you. You put down the prices stuck on them, and just what they are, and then the missis can go {{in the morning and}} bargain for them. She will get them five shillings in the pound cheaper than you would. It's {{wonderful}} how women do beat men down, to be sure. When a man hears what's the price of a thing he leaves it or takes it just as he likes, but a woman begins by offering half the sum. Then the chap says no, and she makes as if she was going away; he lets her go a little way and then he hollers after her, and comes down a goodish bit in the price. Then she says she don't particularly want it and shouldn't think of giving any such price as that. Then he tries again, and so they gets on till they hit on a figure as suits them both. You see that little tea-caddy in the corner? My wife was just three weeks buying that caddy. The chap wanted seven and six for it, and she offered him half a crown. He came down half a crown {{at the end of the}} first week, and at last she got it for three and nine. Now, the first thing you have got to do is to make out a list. First of all you have got to put down the things as you must have, and then the things you can do without, though you will get them if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it.</b> Mother will help you at that." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1986, the {{government}} reversed its population policy — except its stance on low-income, lowly-educated women — and initiated the Have Three or More (if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it)</b> campaign, offering cash and public administration incentives to have children. In 2001, the Singapore government started its Baby Bonus scheme.|$|E
50|$|Singapore {{had also}} been {{undergoing}} the demographic transition and birth rates had fallen precipitously. The government eventually became pro-natalist, and officially announced its replacement Have Three or More (if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it)</b> in 1987, {{in which the government}} continued its efforts to better {{the quality and quantity of}} the population while discouraging low-income families from having children. The Social Development Unit (SDU) was also established in 1984 to promote marriage and romance between educated individuals.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986 the {{government}} had recognised that falling birth rates were a serious problem and began to reverse its past policy of Stop at Two, encouraging higher birth rates instead. By 30 June of that year, {{the government}} had abolished the Family Planning and Population Board, and by 1987, the total fertility rate had dropped to 1.44. That year, Goh Chok Tong announced a new slogan: Have Three or More (if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>it),</b> announcing that the government now promoted a larger family size of three or more children for married couples who could afford them, and promoted [...] "the joys of marriage and parenthood". The new policy took into account Singapore's falling fertility rate and its increased proportion of the elderly, but was still concerned with the [...] "disproportionate procreation" [...] of the educated versus the uneducated, and discouraged having more than two children if the couple did not have sufficient income, to minimise the amount of welfare aid spent on such families. The government also relaxed its immigration policies.|$|E

This Act, all but ignored by the newspapers and TV outlets owned by megamedia, amounted to a massive giveaway of the public's airwaves.
