2500|$|Wingate trained, {{commanded}} {{and accompanied}} {{them on their}} patrols. The units frequently ambushed Arab saboteurs who attacked oil pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company, raiding border villages the attackers had used as bases. In these raids Wingate's men sometimes imposed severe collective punishments on the villagers, which was criticised by Zionist leaders as well as Wingate's British superiors. Wingate disliked Arabs, once shouting at Haganah fighters after a June 1938 attack on a village {{on the border between}} Mandatory Palestine and Lebanon, [...] "I think you are all totally ignorant in your Ramat Yochanan [...] since you do not even know the elementary use of bayonets when attacking dirty Arabs: how can you put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> in front?" [...] But the brutal tactics proved effective in quelling the uprising, and Wingate was awarded the DSO in 1938.|$|E

When I give the order 'Forward,' you balance on your right foot, and when the word comes 'March!' you step out with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> And when you step out, do it like this," [...] and he gave an {{illustration}} by marching up and {{down in front of the}} squad.|$|E
50|$|Keeping {{the point}} of the cane to the front, turn you upper body to the left {{slightly}} as you draw back your right hand (palm facing up i.e. towards you) and arm across your chest. Transfer your weight slightly to <b>your</b> back (<b>left)</b> <b>foot</b> and raise <b>your</b> front heel slightly as you do so. Your hand should pass the line of your spine (if viewed from the side). Now turn your hand over (anti-clockwise), in order to flip {{the point of}} your cane out behind you, with your hand and forearm over <b>your</b> <b>left</b> shoulder, and extend the cane out to the rear as far as possible. Next, bring your arm and the cane around from the rear to the front, along a horizontal line. If the target is the head, remain upright as you deliver your hit. Your arm should remain straight throughout the execution of the strike as the point travels through an 180 degrees arc from the rear to the front.|$|R

[...] in the Royal Navy): Bring <b>your</b> <b>left</b> leg up at 90 {{degrees and}} stamp down so {{both of your}} feet are in a V shape. In the Royal Navy, however, the squad bring the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> over to the right without stamping, so that the feet are at a 45 degree angle. This is {{traditionally}} done {{in the interest of}} not putting ones foot through the deck of a ship.|$|R

Bind one end of this silk thread to the left fore-leg of the calf, and the other end to the little toe of <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot,</b> so that the calf {{will never be able to}} leave your side, whether you walk, stand, or lie.' After this the prince went to bed and slept soundly.|$|E

You did not pivot properly. You allowed <b>your</b> <b>left</b> heel to point down the course when {{you were at the}} top of your swing. This makes for instability and loss of distance. The fundamental law of the dynamics of golf is that the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> shall be solidly on the ground at the moment of impact. If you allow your heel to point down the course, it is almost impossible to bring it back in time to make the foot a solid fulcrum." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1608, {{from the}} press of Giovanni Fontani of Pisa, came forth a second book of fencing by Niccoletto Giganti in which he deals {{with the use of}} the single sword, sword and dagger and also the sword and rotella, the sword and targa, the sword and buckler, the sword and cape, the dagger alone, the dagger against the spear and the dagger alone against the sword. Subsequently he {{discusses}} grabs to the weapon and pommel strikes to the face, and of other grapples advising to put <b>your</b> <b>left</b> hand over the hilt of your opponent's sword. He proposes executing the passata sotto in the tempo in which your opponent performs a cavazione on the line of terza. Finally he discusses a new guard with the sword and dagger with the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> forward, suggesting that he proposes to publish another book where he will teach all of the actions possible with the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> forward. This treatise is illustrated with 53 figures, very badly drawn and likewise engraved; nevertheless his treatise is filled with very useful teachings.|$|R
40|$|The {{controllability}} {{of motor}} imagery (CMI) {{is defined as}} the ability to control or manipulate motor imagery mentally. In the present study, we investigated the correlations between CMI and the accuracy or repeatability of an action with the right and <b>left</b> <b>foot.</b> In the CMI test, {{the participants were asked to}} imagine their posture according to the instructions of six sequential movements (e. g., step 50 cm forward on your right leg, bring <b>your</b> <b>left</b> arm 90 °to the left side). They were then asked to replicate the final posture that they created in their mind. To evaluate the accuracy and repeatability of the movement, the participants were asked to visualize the target line that was located 50 cm in front of the participants and then to step and fit the heel of their right or <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> to the target line without looking at it. We found that the scores on the CMI test were significantly correlated with the repeatability of the step but not with the accuracy. This suggested that the ability to control or manipulate the imagery of body parts toward intended directions was associated with moving the body repeatedly...|$|R

5000|$|A light jig is the second-fastest {{of all the}} jigs. The performer's feet rarely {{leave the}} ground for long, as the step is fast, {{typically}} performed at a speed around 116 at feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but one step is almost standard in all light jigs. This step {{is known as the}} rising step, or the rise and grind. This is the right side version of it: Put your weight on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> and lift your right foot off the ground. Hop on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> once. Hop on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> again, bringing your right foot back behind <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> and then shift your weight onto your right foot, leaving <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> in the air. Dancers use the phrase [...] "hop, hop back" [...] for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on your right foot. Then you shift your weight on your feet, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: [...] "hop, hop back, hop back 2-3-4." [...] To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.|$|E

50|$|Also {{notice that}} the more widely adopted <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> braking {{technique}} in modern race cars requires a sensitive <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> to operate and a left-hand-driver with a more dominated <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> may brake better than those who brakes with right <b>foot</b> or whose <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> isn't dominated, this drastically shorten the time from maximum acceleration to maximum deceleration and left footer possesses a much greater advantages in racing.|$|R

5000|$|Rohene Ward (aka Roh-roh) is {{the first}} and only skater (that I'm aware of) to {{successfully}} land all his triple jumps in both directions. Meaning: much like when a toddler is learning to write, they choose the left or right hand depending which one look and feels more natural. In figure skating it's the same type of deal, you learn the entry into your spins and jumps on <b>your</b> <b>left</b> or right <b>foot.</b> Often at times kids will play around in practise and attempt to do single jumps and spins on the opposite foot/entry because it's difficult, it looks silly and it's something to do with other skaters. Not only is this physically demanding to do and extremely hard to successfully achieve but it also take great mental strength to comprehend changing your technique in the opposite direction. Skaters work extremely hard on mastering a technique that works best for them. I am incredibly amazed that Rohene Ward has mastered the technique for both direction all the way through to his triple jumps. I've been actively in the skating world for the past 26 years and have only met & seen one person ever to do this and that person was Rohene Ward. He is a beautiful skater, a beautiful person and in my eyes the worlds best skater.|$|R

50|$|The step is done two {{different}} ways. One is more elaborate than the other. Initially, while standing with feet side by side, {{step to the}} side with your right foot followed by stepping further with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> so that you are standing with your legs crossed. Then step right again with your right foot so that you are standing normally with your legs slightly apart.|$|E
50|$|Bring <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> to {{you right}} foot so they are {{together}} and touching. Here is where the step can vary. The easier step is done with a little jump to the left with both feet together so that you are facing slightly {{to the left and}} bend at your knees slightly. Jump back to the position before the jump and you repeat the jump. The dance then starts over.|$|E

50|$|To perform {{counterclockwise}} backward crossovers, the skater {{begins by}} gliding backwards on two feet. The upper body is {{turned to face}} into the circle, and the head is turned {{to look over the}} right shoulder in the direction of travel.

At this point, the skater shifts weight to the <b>left</b> <b>foot,</b> on a back inside edge, and executes a wide step inside the circle with the right foot; then the sequence is repeated by again drawing the <b>left</b> <b>foot</b> across.
