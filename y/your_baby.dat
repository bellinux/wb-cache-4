5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open up a bit more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, <b>your</b> <b>baby,</b> your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E
25|$|Later in 1991, Houston put {{together}} her Welcome Home Heroes concert with HBO {{for the soldiers}} fighting in the Persian Gulf War and their families. The free concert took place at Naval Station Norfolk in Norfolk, Virginia in front of 3,500 servicemen and women. HBO descrambled the concert {{so that it was}} free for everyone to watch. Houston's concert gave HBO its highest ratings ever. She then embarked on the I'm <b>Your</b> <b>Baby</b> Tonight World Tour.|$|E
25|$|My Love Is Your Love is {{the fourth}} studio album by American {{recording}} artist Whitney Houston, released worldwide on November 17, 1998. It was Houston's first studio album in eight years, following I'm <b>Your</b> <b>Baby</b> Tonight, although she had released several movie soundtracks in that time. My Love Is Your Love is composed of mid-tempo R, hip hop, ballads, urban-dance, reggae, and torch songs, produced by musicians such as Rodney Jerkins, Soulshock & Karlin, Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, David Foster, and Babyface. It is notable for introducing elements of hip hop into Houston's work, only sparingly used in her previous material.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{less common}} types of McGillivray syndromes are: Metopic {{synostosis}} (trigonocephaly). The metopic suture runs from <b>your</b> <b>baby's</b> {{nose to the}} sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the scalp a triangular appearance. Another one is Lambdoid synostosis (posterior plagiocephaly). This rare form of craniosynostosis involves the lambdoid suture, which runs across the skull near {{the back of the}} head. It may cause flattening of <b>your</b> <b>baby's</b> head on the affected side. A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of <b>your</b> <b>baby's</b> head appears flattened, it could be the result of birth trauma or <b>your</b> <b>baby's</b> spending too much time on his or her back. This condition is sometimes treated with a custom-fit helmet that helps mold <b>your</b> <b>baby's</b> head back into a normal position.|$|R

Some lyrics include: [...] "Sky fits heaven so fly it, that's what the prophet said to me/Child fits mother so hold <b>your</b> <b>baby</b> tight, that's what my future can see". Elements of the lyric are taken from the poem What Fits? by poet Max Blagg, the poem used for a 1993 advertisement for Gap Inc. [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi" [...] is a Hindu Sanskrit prayer and up-tempo techno song sung by Madonna with an Indian accent over a driving dance rhythm. The techno dance track features Madonna singing the adapted version of Shankaracharya entirely in Sanskrit with lines such as [...] "Vunde gurunam caranaravinde/Sandarsita svatma sukhavabodhe".|$|E

The poem was also used in the advertisements for Gap on NBC. Upon viewing them, Madonna contacted Blagg for obtaining permission to use the poem in her new musical material. While composing her 1998 album Ray of Light, Madonna and Blagg reached a deal which would allow the singer to include excerpts of What Fits? within her song [...] "Sky Fits Heaven"; in exchange, Blagg would receive no credit.

500|$|... "Forgive Me" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The BBC {{review of the}} single called [...] "Forgive Me" [...] a [...] "danceable funky pop song". Gavin Martin of The Mirror said, [...] " [...] showcases her voice of fire and honey. No apologies necessary". Nick Levine, Digital Spy music critic, gave the song three out of five stars, comparing it with Whitney Houston's song [...] "I'm <b>Your</b> <b>Baby</b> Tonight" [...] saying that after her previous three ballad singles, [...] "it's a nice change". However, he also said, [...] "the adultery-themed lyrics are a poor match for the sweet, unassuming Hackney girl". Chad Grischow noted that with the song Lewis [...] "will not go down as a glorified one-hit wonder". Stephen Thomas Erlewine described [...] "Forgive Me", and another song ("Misses Glass") from the album as [...] "just slightly glitzier {{than the rest of}} Spirit." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the single 'bouncy and youthful'. The New York Times criticised Lewis for being [...] "a second-tier Mariah" [...] on the song.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's <b>your</b> <b>baby,</b> you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe if we take a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, {{we might be able to}} find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E
500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm <b>your</b> <b>baby,</b> ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what you tell him, I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E

500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, <b>your</b> <b>baby,</b> your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be <b>Your</b> <b>Baby</b> Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
500|$|Houston {{performed}} the song {{throughout the entire}} run of her Greatest Love Tour (1986), Moment of Truth World Tour (1987–1988), Feels So Right Japan Tour (1990), I'm <b>Your</b> <b>Baby</b> Tonight World Tour (1991), The Bodyguard World Tour (1993–1994), and My Love Is Your Love World Tour (1999). She also recently {{performed the}} song on her Nothing but Love World Tour (2009–2010). Apart from the concert tour performances, Houston has performed the song on various other occasions like the Third MTV Video Music Awards (1986), where she sang [...] "How Will I Know" [...] and [...] "Greatest Love of All", Thirteenth Annual American Music Awards (1986), and 1987 BRIT Awards. The latter performance {{is included in the}} 2014 CD/DVD release, [...] [...] On May 15, 1987, during her European promotion for then-new album, Whitney, Houston sang the song at the Montreux Golden Rose Rock Festival: IM Gala with two other 1986 released songs, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" [...] and [...] "Where Do Broken Hearts Go". She appeared on The Mike Douglas Show, taped in Philadelphia, and performed [...] "How Will I Know". On her Moment of Truth World Tour, she participated in the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute Concert and performed the song with other seven songs. She also performed the song on [...] "Welcome Home Heroes", a concert dedicated to the US troops, their families, and military and government dignitaries in honor of those returning from the Gulf War, which aired on HBO on March 31, 1991. The concert was taped and later released as a VHS on May 14, 1991. She also performed the song on , three concerts to honor President Nelson Mandela, in 1994. Houston later performed the song on the closing ceremonies of the 1994 World Cup along with five of her other songs. In 2000, she performed the song on Arista's 25th Anniversary, along with [...] "I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)".|$|E

500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, <b>your</b> <b>baby,</b> your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't ever say bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't ever say bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
