5|$|Freya {{served in}} the German fleet for the initial <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a {{modernization}} in 19051907, Freya {{was used as a}} school ship for cadets. At the outbreak of World War I, Freya was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly.

5|$|Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. During the war, she was involved in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where she provided gunfire support to Italian infantry. The ship was obsolescent by World War I and was slated to be broken up in 1914–15, but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and, after April 1916, was used primarily as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Yeats was 51 {{years old}} and {{determined}} to marry and produce an heir. His rival John MacBride had been executed {{for his role in}} the 1916 Easter Rising, so Yeats hoped that his widow might remarry. His final proposal to Maud Gonne took place in mid-1916. Gonne's history of revolutionary political activism, as well as a series of personal catastrophes in the previous few <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life—including chloroform addiction and her troubled marriage to MacBride—made her a potentially unsuitable wife and biographer R.F. Foster has observed that Yeats's last offer was motivated more by a sense of duty than by a genuine desire to marry her.|$|E

5|$|Campania {{was built}} by the Castellammare shipyard, where her keel was laid on 9 August 1913, {{the same day as}} Basilicata. The ships were small enough that they could be built on the same slipway. They were {{launched}} {{less than a year later}} on 23 July 1914. After Fitting-out work was completed, Campannia was commissioned on 18 May 1917, four months before her sister ship. Designed as a colonial cruiser in the mold of the cruiser , Campania spent the first several <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career in Italy's African colonies, including Italian Libya. On 1 July 1921, the ship was reclassified as a gunboat and two of her 152mm guns were removed during reconstruction work that lasted until 1922. Starting in 1932 she served as a school ship for naval cadets. She was capable of carrying 100cadets, along with their officers, petty officers, and support staff. She remained in this role until she was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and sold for scrapping.|$|E
5|$|Comfort, however, {{asserts that}} McClintock was well {{regarded}} by her professional peers, {{even in the}} early <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> career. Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of gender discrimination, she has been widely written about {{in the context of}} women's studies. Most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize Geneticist, Deborah Heiligman's Barbara McClintock: Alone in Her Field and Mary Kittredge's Barbara McClintock. A recent biography for young adults by Naomi Pasachoff, Barbara McClintock, Genius of Genetics, provides a new perspective, based on the current literature.|$|E

Danzig was also involved in Operation Albion, the seizure of the islands at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga, in September 1917. She was thereafter withdrawn from service, and surrendered to Britain {{after the end of the}} war as a war prize. Danzig was dismantled for scrap starting in 1921.|$|E
