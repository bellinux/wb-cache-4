At {{the end of the}} commercial, Dylan says: [...] "So let Germany brew your beer, let Switzerland make <b>your</b> <b>watch,</b> let Asia assemble your phone. We will build your car." [...] Dylan's Super Bowl commercial generated controversy and op-ed pieces discussing the protectionist implications of his words, and whether the singer had [...] "sold out" [...] to corporate interests.|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{creates an}} {{argument}} between lyrical personas by alternating her vocal range and point of view. Stefani's vocal range spans two octaves in the song, from G3 to G5. In a melody {{similar to that}} of Weezer's [...] "Hash Pipe", one side of Stefani's personality sings in a higher range in the first person, and the other, more confident personality sings lower in the second person. During the verses, the more nervous personality discusses her concerns about leaving No Doubt for a solo career as well as the ephemeral success of female singers in the music industry. The chorus is a boost of confidence for her and continues the song's time motif with the lines [...] "Look at <b>your</b> <b>watch</b> now/You're still a super hot female". Backed by perfect octave dyads, Stefani sings a verse about her excitement for her future, and the two personalities merge into one during the coda.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1920s, the Marx Brothers {{had become}} one of America's {{favorite}} theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, [...] "First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, [...] "The 9:20's right on time. You can set <b>your</b> <b>watch</b> by the Lehigh Valley." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dido and Belinda enter, {{shocked at}} Aeneas’ disappearance. Dido is distraught and Belinda comforts her. Suddenly Aeneas returns, but Dido {{is full of}} fear before Aeneas speaks, and his words only serve to confirm her suspicions. She derides his reasons for leaving, and even when Aeneas says he will defy the gods and not leave Carthage, Dido rejects him for having once thought of leaving her. After Dido forces Aeneas to leave, she states that [...] "Death must come when he is gone." [...] The opera and Dido's life both slowly come to a conclusion, as the Queen of Carthage sings her last aria, [...] "When I am laid in Earth", also known as [...] "Dido's Lament." [...] The chorus and {{orchestra}} then conclude the opera once Dido is dead by ordering the [...] "cupids to scatter roses on her tomb, soft and gentle as her heart. Keep here <b>your</b> <b>watch,</b> and never never never part." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} {{eighteenth-century}} London, the night watchman was indeed an old controversial figure (established {{for the first}} time in the 1285 Statute of Winchester), deeply-rooted in the belief that the individual citizen had to perform his social and moral duty for the well-being of the society. Hence, every London parish requested its householders to perform by rotation the watch-duty on an unpaid and amateur basis, from dusk until dawn, and with only a stick or an halberd as a weapon. Each watchman was assigned with a short length of street to patrol every hour, and he had to examine all suspicious characters from his assigned watch box (a sentry box with half-door). The performance of such duty took away a great amount of money and energy, so by the late seventeenth-century it grew up the practice to pay a substitute (often another parishioner) to take up <b>your</b> <b>watch</b> duty. The fact that this service had to be arranged locally by parish officers rose a great number of issues. Firstly, the only men willing to take on this job for a very small wage were those who had little prospect of some other employment, usually old men hired as an alternative to the poor law grant. Secondly, Moreton suggests that [...] "parochial misapplication" [...] were commonplace around constables and beadles, appointed to collect the individual fee for the night-watch. They were often accused to spend as little as possible on hiring watchmen and pocket the difference as a recompense for the unpaid service they had performed.|$|E
