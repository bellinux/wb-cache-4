5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, {{several of the}} routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways which did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> route number, such as the Preston–Norwich state highway, were assigned one. The road was designated as NY319 and maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation west of the Norwich city limits and {{by the city of}} Norwich within the city. The alignment of NY319 remained unchanged for the next half-century.|$|E

On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter Michiko Yamamotoknown for films such as Magnifico (2004) and Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros (2006)came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.|$|E

At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> route number were assigned one. This included both SH1282 and the section of SH286 south of Morton Road as both became part of NY18, a highway that was extended eastward from Buffalo to Rochester {{as part of the}} renumbering. At the time, NY18 entered the hamlet of Morton on Kenmore Road and followed Morton, Redman, and Church Roads and Lake Road West Fork into Hamlin, where it overlapped with NY63 (modern NY19) south along Lake Road to rejoin its modern alignment at Hamlin Center Road. By the following year, NY360 was assigned to what is now NY18 between NY272 and Lake Road (then-NY63) in Hamlin. The alignments of NY18 and NY360 between Morton and Hamlin were flipped , placing both highways on their modern routings.|$|E

As a result, when the series was featured at a panel during the January 2009 television critics press tour, NBC {{did not have a}} finished episode to screen, only a copy of the pilot script available for review. Some of the parts were still not cast and the series, which did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> name, was referred to as The Untitled Amy Poehler Project or TUAPP. The name Public Service was considered, but ultimately rejected because network officials {{did not want to be}} accused of mocking the idea. In a commercial that aired during NBC's Super Bowl coverage in February, it was announced that the series would be called Parks and Recreation.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the New York State Legislature {{passed a}} law authorizing the {{construction}} of a highway connecting Route24 (an unsigned legislative route that is now part of NY30) to the new Veterans' Mountain Camp, an American Legion camp on Tupper Lake. The work was funded through appropriations defined in the law. The beginning of a state road to the camp came in 1924 when earth movers were brought in by the Harnathy Contracting Company, with construction beginning in early June. The project would include construction of a concrete bridge over the Bog River. However, Hanrathy was unable to finish the job as it went bankrupt, and a second firm, the Spadaccini Realty Construction Corporation of The Bronx was brought into finish the job, which began in June1925.The bridge over the Bog River was completed on August 29, 1925 and they announced would be opened for traffic within ten days.The route did finally open in 1925, with the Veterans Camp opening on May 15, 1926. This road was extended from modern NY30 north to a dead end at Warren Point. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways that did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> designation were assigned one. The Veterans' Mountain Camp highway was designated as NY421 by the following year.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford was Premier, {{but had not}} yet {{faced the}} people in an {{election}} and did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> legislature to which he could propose legislation. Elections for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta were accordingly fixed for November 9. The Conservatives, the young province's only other political party, had already selected R. B. Bennett as their leader. Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources {{in the hands of}} the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of separate schools. He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the British North America Act. The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year. They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular Canadian Pacific Railway, which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.|$|E

25|$|While {{up until}} the end of the Parthian period in the 3rd century CE, the idea of “Irān“ had an ethnic, linguistic, and {{religious}} value, it did not <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> political import. The idea of an “Iranian“ empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely Sasanian one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the Zoroastrian clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr “Kingdom of the Iranians,” which was “ēr“ (Middle Persian equivalent of Old Persian “ariya“ and Avestan “airya“).|$|E

25|$|Concrete {{roads are}} more fuel {{efficient}} to drive on, more reflective and last significantly longer than other paving surfaces, <b>yet</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> much smaller market share than other paving solutions. Modern-paving methods and design practices {{have changed the}} economics of concrete paving, so that a well-designed and placed concrete pavement will be less expensive on initial costs and significantly less expensive over the life cycle. Another major benefit is that pervious concrete can be used, which eliminates the need to place storm drains near the road, and reducing the need for slightly sloped roadway to help rainwater to run off. No longer requiring discarding rainwater through use of drains also means that less electricity is needed (more pumping is otherwise needed in the water-distribution system), and no rainwater gets polluted as it no longer mixes with polluted water. Rather, it is immediately absorbed by the ground.|$|E
