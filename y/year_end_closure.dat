5000|$|The {{somewhat}} humble {{economic status}} of the South High geographic area and the cosmopolitan nature of the school in an otherwise ethnically monolithic culture {{may have been the}} factor that led to the closure of South High due to declining enrollment in all Salt Lake City high schools. At the time of closure, two high schools, West and East, had buildings much older than South High. On February 3, 1987, the school board announced the proposed closure of South High School. Following a period of further evaluation, the board of education allowed the school to remain open one additional year. South High closed June 8, 1988, when the 1987-1988 school <b>year</b> <b>ended.</b> After <b>closure</b> the student body of South was divided between East, West, and Highland high schools.|$|R

This paper presents a parametric analysis of threaded <b>end</b> <b>closures</b> using elastic and elasto-plastic finite element solutions. The results are used to discuss the influence of these residuals on the estimated fatigue life when the vessel is subjected to repeated internal pressure. A simple empirical method to allow for the Bauschinger effect of the material is also proposed...|$|R

40|$|A {{hydraulically}} powered gas compressor receives {{low pressure gas}} and outputs a high pressure gas. The housing of the compressor defines a cylinder with a center chamber having a cross-sectional area less than the cross-sectional area of a left end chamber and a right end chamber, and a spool-type piston assembly is movable within the cylinder and includes a left <b>end</b> <b>closure,</b> a right <b>end</b> <b>closure,</b> and a center body that are in sealing engagement with the respective cylinder walls as the piston reciprocates. First and second annual compression chambers are provided between the piston enclosures and center housing portion of the compressor, thereby minimizing the spacing between the core gas and a cooled surface of the compressor. Restricted flow passageways are provided in the piston closure members and a path is provided in the central body of the piston assembly, such that hydraulic fluid flows through the piston assembly to cool the piston assembly during its operation. The compressor of the present invention may be easily adapted for a particular application, and is capable of generating high gas pressures while maintaining both the compressed gas and the compressor components within acceptable temperature limits...|$|R
