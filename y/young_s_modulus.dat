The O ring {{is a type of}} elastomer sealer that, among other applications, is used in pipe connections. Such seals must withstand high pressures and sudden pressure drops, as well as different contact media and a wide temperature range. The capability of the O ring has been investigated. Standard failure modes have been studied and the different features necessary to protect against leaks, such as oil and fuel resistance, resistance towards more aggressive fluids, operating temperature spectre and mechanical properties have been looked into. The mechanical properties of filler/elastomer composites have been tested at a range of temperatures from room temperature to - 25 °C, with respect to <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and hysteresis (energy loss) development. O rings for use in the arctic must have a sufficiently low glass transition temperature (Tg) for the environment in which the seals will be used.

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of the paper is to analyze four point bending tests performed on samples of an epoxy-type thermoset polymer oxidized under several conditions, and to predict the failure mechanisms. Different responses are observed depending on the oxidation time: for small durations there is a linear elastic phase followed by an abrupt failure of the specimen whereas for higher oxidation times, the elastic phase {{is followed by a}} nonlinear one corresponding to the development of numerous superficial micro-cracks prior to failure. In order to predict this behavior, a finite fracture mechanics approach based on the coupled criterion is used. This criterion requires an energy and a stress condition to be fulfilled. This approach is here extended {{to take into account the}} gradient of properties of the oxidized layer: <b>Young</b> " <b>s</b> <b>modulus,</b> tensile strength, toughness. One novelty of the approach is to implement the model in a periodic representative cell in order to process an increasing number of cracks. Despite the large scattering in the experimental detection of the initiation of the micro-cracks and their counting, the predictions agree rather well with the observations: the oxidation times leading either to a sudden failure of the sample or to micro-cracking are well reproduced, and the loads triggering the crack onset as well as the increase in number of cracks are somewhat well predicted...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Metallic materials have gained much attention recently from the areas of medical devices and orthopaedics. Artificial organs, dental implants, prostheses and implants that replace damaged or malfunctioning parts in the body are, or contain, metal components. Our ageing society poses an increased demand to provide devices and implants that can demonstrate better performance than those presented by traditional solutions. Matching the mechanical properties (i. e. stiffness and strength) of the device {{to those of the}} host tissue is a major challenge for the design and manufacture of engineered metal materials for biomedical applications. Failure in doing so provokes implant loosening, patient discomfort and repeated surgeries. Therefore, tailoring physical properties and biocompatibility of those materials is the main final aim of this research programme. This PhD study has focused on the tailoring of the mechanical properties of titanium-based materials and titanium-based alloys. Titanium inertness and the selection of biocompatible alloying elements were set as the baseline. Two approaches were employed to decrease stiffness (i. e. <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus)</b> : one, by introducing porosity in a titanium matrix and therefore, reduce its <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus,</b> and two, by designing and manufacturing beta-titanium-based alloys with a reduced <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus.</b> Titanium scaffolds were manufactured using powder metallurgy with space holder technique and a sintering process. Different space holder sizes were used in four different categories to study the effect of pore size and porosity on the mechanical properties of the porosity engineered Ti scaffolds. Ti-based alloys were manufactured using manufacturing techniques such as sintering and arc-melting. The effect of different fabrication processes and the addition of beta-stabilising elements were studied and investigated. The obtained results of mechanical properties for pore size and porosity were within the values that match bone properties. This means these materials are suitable for biomedical application and the beta-Ti alloys results show that the mechanical properties can be decreased via tailoring the crystal structures. The characterisation of the Ti-based alloys helps to develop this material for its use in biomedical application...|$|E

This paper employs the Mori-Tanaka micromechanics model, incorporating the effect of stretching-induced re{{orientation of}} graphene platelets (GPL), to predict Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of GPL/polymer nanocomposites. Subjected to uni-axial stretching, dispersion of GPLs is described by an orientation distribution function (ODF) in terms of a stretching strain and two Euler angles. The ODF shows that GPLs tend to realign along the stretching direction. Such realignment is enhanced at a higher Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio and under a larger stretching strain. It is found that the out-of-plane Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of GPL nanofillers has a limited effect on the overall Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of the composites. With an increase in stretching strain and GPL concentration, Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> increases in the stretching direction while it decreases in the transverse direction.

Two distinct tests are analyzed in this thesis, a cantilever bending test (CBT) and a three-point bending test (TPBT), both on Coscinodiscus sp. frustules.

It is found that {{the values of the}} Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios depend on the number of atomic layers in the thickness direction and approach the respective bulk values as the number of atomic layers increases. Based on the semi-continuum model, a nanoplate model is also developed for plate-like nanomaterials. Equations of motion are derived with Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s Principle. The dispersion relations of a three-layered nanomaterial are analyzed with both the nanoplate model and the lattice model to show the effectiveness of this nanoplate model. Cylindrical bending of a three-atom-layered nanoplate is analyzed with the nanoplate model, the lattice model, and the continuum Mindlin plate theory. It is found that the nanoplate model predicts the deflection in good agreement with the lattice model. The continuum Mindlin plate theory tends to underpredict the deflection. This result indicates that, if the continuum plate theory is used to extract the Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of a nanomaterial, the value could be significantly underestimated. An approach to realize simple tension stress state in molecular statics simulation is proposed and used to analyze the size-dependent mechanical behavior of FCC single crystal Ni nanoplates, Ni nanowires and Ni/Ag nanolaminates. For nanoplates, the simulations show that the Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and the Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratios are highly size-dependent at nanoscale. The Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of nanowires decreases as the characteristic sizes decrease. For Ag/Ni nanolaminates, it is found that elastic constants, c 11, c 33, and biaxial modulus Y, all show a decrease as the number of monolayers in each lamina decreases. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{deposition}} of boron carbonitride layers on silicon substrates by a microwave plasma enhanced {{chemical vapour deposition}} MW PECVD process using N trimethylborazine TMB and benzene as precursors is presented. As plasma gases argon and nitrogen were used. In this investigation {{we focus on the}} influence of the gas composition, substrate temperature and bias on the layer composition, layer structure as well as the thermal stability. The films were analyzed with respect to their composition and bonding structure using elastic recoil detection analysis ERDA and X ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS. Furthermore, nanoindentation measurements before and after annealing tests at 500 and 700 C were performed. The measurements show a strong dependence of the structure and mechanical properties on the substrate temperature. The hydrogen content strongly decreases to 8 at. with higher substrate temperatures. Simultaneously, the layer hardness and <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> increase up to 21 and 173 GPa, respectively. The hardness does not decrease after annealing for 1 hour at 700 C...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a lattice method for {{predicting}} the Youngs modulus of concrete with two types of elliptical aggregate. After distributing fine and coarse aggregates within a rectangular unit, the finite element method is adopted to estimate the Youngs modulus of concrete. Compared with previous studies, the method considers the aggregate shape effect and the difference in Youngs modulus between fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. After the validity of the method is verified with two sets of experimental results, the effects of various factors on the <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of concrete are quantified. It is found that the Young&# 039;s modulus of concrete increases with an increase in aggregate aspect ratio, minimum aggregate diameter, or both, but decreases by increasing the interfacial transition zone thickness. It is also found that the maximum aggregate diameter and aggregate gradation have little effect on the Young&# 039;s modulus of concrete...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{characterization}} of brain tissue {{has been investigated}} extensively by various research groups over the past 50 Â years. These properties are particularly important for modeling Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). In this research, we present the design and calibration of a High Rate Tension Device (HRTD) capable of performing tests up to a maximum strain rate of 90 /s. We use experimental and numerical methods to investigate the effects of inhomogeneous deformation of porcine brain tissue during tension at different specimen thicknesses (4. 0 14. 0 Â mm), by performing tension tests at a strain rate of 30 /s. One-term Ogden material parameters (&# 956;Â =Â  4395. 0 Â Pa, &# 945;Â =Â &# 8722; 2. 8) were derived by performing an inverse finite element analysis to model all experimental data. A similar procedure was adopted to determine <b>Young</b> <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> (EÂ =Â  11200 Â Pa) of the linear elastic regime. Based on this analysis, brain specimens of aspect ratio (diameter/thickness) S / 1. 0 are required to minimise the effects of inhomogeneous deformation during tension tests. IRCSE...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{structure}} and Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of switchable films formed by peptide self-assembly at the air–water interface. Peptide surfactant AM 1 forms an interfacial film that can be switched, reversibly, from a high- to low-elasticity state, with rapid loss of emulsion and foam stability. Using neutron reflectometry, {{we find that the}} AM 1 film comprises a thin (approx. 15  Å) layer of ordered peptide in both states, confirming {{that it is possible to}} drastically alter the mechanical properties of an interfacial ensemble without significantly altering its concentration or macromolecular organization.

Young 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of each model is practically independent of the solid Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. At a sufficiently high porosity, Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio of the porous models converges to a fixed value independent of the solid Poisson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> ratio. <b>Young</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> of the models is in good agreement with experimental data.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} effects of the melt {{compounding}} variables, matrix molecular weight and organoclay content on the X-ray diffraction (XRD) ansd mechanical properties of polystyrene (PS) /organoclay nanocomposites (PNC) prepared in a twin-screw extruder. An increase of residence time reduced the height of the first XRD peak and increased that of the second peak. Barrel temperature and screw configuration had a little influence on the tensile properties and impact strength. Young 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> increased with organoclay content and it was almost independent of matrix PS molecular weight. The stressat- break and impact strength decreased with organoclay content and increased with PS molecular weight. Young 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> and impact strength decreased with residence time. Since the slopes of these dependencies for PNC were {{similar to that of the}} neat PS, the matrix degradation seems to play the major role. The relationship between impact strength and elongation at break of PNC showed high dependency on matrix grade. However, better empirical correlation was observed between the impact and tensile strengths. According to theoretical model of Ji et al. [32], the Young 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>modulus</b> vs. clay concentration dependence indicated the presence of low interphase thickness. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
