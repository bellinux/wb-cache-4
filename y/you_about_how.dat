[...] "We mustn't miss a moment of these days.... I am frank with <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> glad I am to have you here. You must be good to me; you will prize my love a little, won't you?"

6000|$|... "Dear Blyth,--I {{have given}} in--at {{least for the}} present. I told my father about my wanting to be an artist, and about your saying that I had a good notion of drawing, and an eye for a likeness; but I {{might just as well}} have talked to one of your easels. He means to make a man of {{business}} of me. And here I have been, for the last three weeks, at a Tea Broker's office in the city, in consequence. They all say it's a good opening for me, and talk about the respectability of commercial pursuits. I don't want to be respectable, and I hate commercial pursuits. What is the good of forcing me into a merchant's office, when I can't say my Multiplication table? Ask my mother about that: she'll tell you! Only fancy me going round tea warehouses in filthy Jewish places like St. Mary-Axe, to take samples, with a blue bag to carry them about in; and a dirty junior clerk, who cleans his pen in his hair, to teach me how to fold up parcels! Isn't it enough to make my blood boil to think of it? I can't go on, and I won't go on in this way! Mind you're at home to-morrow; I'm coming to speak to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> I'm to begin learning to be an artist. The junior clerk is going to do all my sampling work for me in the morning; and we are to meet in the afternoon, after I have come away from you, at a chop-house; and then go back to the office as if we had been together all day, just as usual. Ever yours, Z. THORPE, JUN.--P. S. My mind's made up: if the worst comes to the worst, I shall leave home." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics have {{commented that}} Fox's {{adaptation}} of Kitchen Nightmares strayed from {{the strengths of}} the original Channel 4 series. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune said, [...] "Leave it to Fox to take something the Brits did pretty well and muck it up". She added, [...] "Never mind the cooking; this edition of the show appears to be more interested in playing up the family dramas at the restaurants Ramsay visits".Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "Whereas the British Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares is fundamentally a food show — it has interesting things to show <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> a restaurant runs and a kitchen works, the wonders of local markets and what you can make from them if you're Gordon Ramsay or willing to follow his instructions — the Fox edition emphasizes mishap, argument and emotional breakdown almost to the exclusion of cuisine".|$|E

5000|$|The Big Dream {{consists}} of 10 original [...] "modern blues" [...] songs composed by David Lynch and producer Dean Hurley, {{as well as}} Bob Dylan covers [...] In an interview with Billboard Lynch discussed the songwriting process of The Big Dream, {{as well as the}} composition of the album. Describing the songwriting process, Lynch said that [...] "sometimes the lyrics come first but mostly the music is talking to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> it wants to be, and then the lyrics are born out of that." [...] He added that most of the songs were [...] "based on the blues and start with a jam" [...] between himself and Hurley. Lynch further explained that the songs are [...] "tighter" [...] than those on his debut studio album, Crazy Clown Time (2011), due to increased confidence in his musical abilities. Regarding the Bob Dylan cover [...] "The Ballad of Hollis Brown", Lynch said it is [...] "not really a cover of Bob Dylan {{as much as it is}} a cover of a Nina Simone cover of Bob Dylan" [...] and noted that the song was [...] "important for the sequence" [...] of the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Forever Evil #4 {{received}} mixed reviews. Schedeen {{gave the}} issue an 8.0 out of 10, saying, [...] "Forever Evil #4 makes some mistakes {{in terms of}} separating Batman and Luthor's factions and trying to hard to humanize Luthor. But it also manages to build Luthor's team into a compelling force and inject the plot with a spark of life {{it was starting to}} lose." [...] Grey also gave the issue an 8 out of 10, adding, [...] "Geoff Johns doesn’t deliver any Christmas miracles for the beleaguered team in this final Forever Evil for 2013, but he does pack every square inch of it with enough geekgasm inducing moments that it’s just like opening your presents all over again. More importantly, the story finally feels as though it is moving forward again after several months of tie-in selling stagnation." [...] Conversely, Matt Little of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "Forever Evil #4 is the halfway point of DC's big 2013 event, and it makes the story feel like it should be a five issue tale. We're in character shuffling mode, rearranging players on the board so they're in place for different stories that don't even look like they'll be told in this series. This issue is the comic book equivalent to listening to a friend standing outside a party telling <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> cool it is inside when all {{you want to do is}} just go in and see for yourself." ...|$|E
