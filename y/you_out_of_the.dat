25|$|The {{form of the}} {{covenant}} resembles the suzerainty treaty in the ancient Near East. Like the treaties, the Ten Commandments begins with Yahweh's identification {{and what he had}} done for Israel ("who brought <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land of Egypt"; Ex 20:2) as well as the stipulations commanding absolute loyalty ("You shall not have other gods apart from me"). Unlike the suzerainty treaty, the Decalogue does not have any witness nor explicit blessings and curses. The fullest account of the Mosaic covenant is given in the book of Deuteronomy.|$|E
500|$|The cut {{scenes of}} Snake Eater {{have been called}} [...] "visually {{exciting}} and evocative, beautifully shot" [...] by Edge. However, they commented that the script [...] "ranges from awkward to awful" [...] and criticized David Hayter's performance as Snake, concluding that [...] "Snake Eaters speech {{is not up to}} the standard of other games, let alone cinema." [...] GameSpot said that some of the humor [...] "falls flat, as if lost in translation from Japanese" [...] and [...] "should appeal to... hardcore fans but... takes <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment." ...|$|E

500|$|On September 22, 2011, McCotter {{notified}} The Detroit News {{he would}} {{withdraw from the}} presidential race.

[...] He then released a statement in which he endorsed Mitt Romney for president, and called on the Republican Party to unite behind Romney as the most electable candidate. [...] In the press release, McCotter also announced that he would run for re-election in his congressional district.|$|E
500|$|The God of War comic series {{received}} mixed reviews. Mike Murphy of Platform Nation {{stated that}} although the comic series serves as a good prequel to the video game series, [...] "the story is bogged down by horrible art... muddy, confusing, and consistently pulls <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story {{as you try to}} figure out just what is going on from panel to panel." [...] Rating it 5 out of 10, Murphy said that he [...] "can’t give this one a pass, even to the hardcore God of War fans" [...] who should [...] "skip it." ...|$|E
500|$|The aliens seen at {{the start}} of the episode were portrayed by children. Carter wrote {{specifically}} the part of Duane Barry with Steve Railsback in mind, saying [...] "I've resisted casting the marquee names only because it takes <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show; makes the show less believable. But there are certain actors who just call out for the part." [...] Originally, Railsback character was named Duane Garry, but it was changed to Duane Barry after learning that a person within the Federal Bureau of Investigation had the same name. Carter has mentioned that he disliked the new name at first, but got used to it over time.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly {{one of the things}} I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 8.5 out of 10, stating [...] "L.A. Noire may {{not reach the}} {{emotional}} heights of a game like Heavy Rain, but it's something everyone must try out. It reaches high and almost succeeds as a brilliant new type of video game narrative." [...] GameTrailers gave the game a 9.1 out of 10, concluding that [...] "L.A. Noire floors <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, loses some steam due to repetition, but eventually wins the day thanks to its subtlety, attention to detail, and stunning character interaction." [...] GameSpot's Carolyn Petit awarded the game a 9 out of 10, concluding that [...] "L.A. Noires absorbing investigations and intoxicating sense of style make it an unforgettable journey through the seamy side of the City of Angels." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8.5/10, stating [...] "The story is intriguing, albeit a little slow at first. L.A. Noire takes an old school approach toward its storytelling. It’s a much slower approach, similar to older movies, with a heavy emphasis on detail. It is that attention to detail that sets L.A. Noire apart from other games and makes it enjoyable to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Current socio-political {{issues in}} the United States are {{addressed}} on the album, with Vedder claiming the record [...] "deals with real content and the moral issues of our time", and crediting as inspiration both the frustration with George W. Bush being reelected, {{and the birth of}} Vedder's daughter - [...] "Now that I see it as my daughter's planet, I'm even more (angry)." [...] McCready said, [...] "We all feel that we're living in tumultuous, frightening times, and that ranges from the Iraq war to Hurricane Katrina to wiretapping to anything that smacks of totalitarianism. And just bad political decisions being made. We feel that as Americans, and we're frustrated. So a lot of those feelings have come out in these songs." [...] Vedder also added that among all the dark themes [...] "the hope {{was going to be in}} the guitar solos. It was the guitars and drums going at it that was going to lift <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark abyss that I had painted." [...] The Iraq War is addressed in the songs [...] "World Wide Suicide", [...] "Marker in the Sand", and [...] "Army Reserve". The lyrics of [...] "World Wide Suicide" [...] depict anger against the war. Other themes addressed on the album include alcohol use ("Severed Hand"), religion ("Marker in the Sand"), poverty ("Unemployable"), leaving everything behind to seek a fresh start ("Gone"), and loneliness ("Come Back").|$|E

2500|$|In {{the long}} second reading ( [...] , aliyah), God gave Moses two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God.

They exclaimed, [...] "This is your god, O Israel, who brought <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land of Egypt!"

Moses descends from the mountain forty days later with the Sefer Torah he wrote, and with two rectangular lapis lazuli tablets, into which Yahweh had carved the Ten Commandments in Paleo–Hebrew. In his absence, Aaron has constructed an image of Yahweh, depicting him as a young Golden Calf, and has presented it to the Israelites, declaring [...] "Behold O Israel, this is your god who brought <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land of Egypt".

On the second Top 7 show, Allen brought back the guitar {{for the fourth time}} and performed an original, acoustic version of [...] "She Works Hard for the Money", complete with bongo drums and the band on stage. This earned praise from all four judges, with Abdul remarking [...] "There aren't many men who are willing to shop in the women's department. You shopped and found a perfect fit."
