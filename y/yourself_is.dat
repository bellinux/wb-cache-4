Though the accident left the band shaken, none of the members sustained serious injury – Tony and Cedric were taken to the hospital for minor injuries and released. In January 2001, At the Drive-In traveled to Australia for the Big Day Out music festival. While performing in Sydney, they left partway through their set after telling the attendance to calm down and observe the safety rules against moshing. After the refusal of the crowd, frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala told them [...] "You're a robot, you're a sheep!"

2500|$|One character, a slave {{companion}} for the Sith Warrior named Vette, drew controversy. Writing for Kotaku, Mike Fahey, {{after playing}} the game, recalled players boasting of their torturing of Vette and her low affection rating for them. The Daily Mail ran {{an article about}} Fahey's story on their Mail Online website, remarking on how the option to treat Vette decently did not seem popular, and while noting Star Wars was [...] "no stranger to slavery" [...] said [...] "the idea of playing 'master' <b>yourself</b> <b>is</b> unsavoury". The Mail was criticised for its lack of evidence for its statements and its selective information. Forbes's Erik Kain criticised gaming as overly focused on [...] "teenage boys", calling {{the inclusion of a}} shock-collar-wearing slave [...] "not so much surprising as it is disappointing" [...] and [...] "really creepy". Kain commented how it enforced how gaming could be a [...] "hostile environment" [...] for girls and felt that the inclusion of choice failed to make the situation better. The Mary Sue contributor Becky Chambers felt Vette's inclusion was less [...] "sexist" [...] than [...] "shortsighted". Religion Dispatches researched the matter, surveying 369 players to ask them how they acted. The survey's findings suggested that most players chose the good options and felt uncomfortable doing any evil ones. They suggested that the presence of characters like Vette influenced the player's actions, making them want to take choices that would gain Affection.|$|E
