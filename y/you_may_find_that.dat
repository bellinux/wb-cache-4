6000|$|... 'You think a look {{will bring}} him back, but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> a true man is no slave. Prove his affection misplaced, {{and he will}} tear it away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Mary. Ah, colonel! I {{appreciate}} her disappointment. Let us hope, however, {{that some}} day <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> happy woman who {{will be able to}} keep you through the whole dinner and the whole season, until December and the ices! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pontoons and {{excavations}} {{have their}} charm for men with constructive tastes," [...] Lance went on; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> later <b>that</b> they don't satisfy all your needs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may spare your protestations, captain. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> yet <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have every}} reason to be deeply pained. For the last time, do you refuse to carry my message to the king?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Despite {{a rather}} skeevy ouverture, the sound quality of this release quickly settles into a nice, warm groove. Listen closely, however, for <b>you</b> <b>may</b> just <b>find</b> <b>that</b> your mind will be blown {{by the music}} {{contained}} herein." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{desire to}} have no words with you," [...] Philip said. [...] "Eat your dinner in peace, and let me eat mine; for {{if it comes to}} cutting off ears, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> you had better have left the matter alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{trouble is}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> hollow {{filled with water}} now, Fred," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "Remember the heavy rains {{of the last few}} weeks have caused something of a freshet. Even down at our boathouse the water is unusually high." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Wrayson," [...] the Colonel assented, {{a little more}} cheerfully. [...] "Well, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> all will come right very soon now. By the by, I've {{been talking to the}} Baroness. I want you to let me be at your rooms to-morrow night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] he said, smiling a little grimly, [...] "that the Vincents {{had better be}} kept away from your house until you have gone. If you do {{anything}} more to it <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> out <b>that</b> {{it would have been}} more profitable to have shut it up while you are away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The supernatural {{influences}} have spared me, this time,' Henry answered. 'Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>may</b> yet <b>find</b> <b>that</b> {{they have}} affected some {{other member of}} the family.' He spoke gravely, resenting the familiar tone in which the manager had referred to his previous visit to the hotel. 'Have you just returned?' he asked, by way of changing the topic.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Urania," [...] he said, [...] "man's love {{could not}} have done for you what only another Love can do. <b>May</b> <b>you</b> yet <b>find</b> <b>that</b> and true Life." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{there was}} the {{struggle}} upon McMurdo's face, and again it set like granite. [...] "No harm shall come to you, Ettie--nor to your father either. As to wicked men, I expect <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> I am {{as bad as the}} worst of them before we're through." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If that is {{the case}} we shall not have heard the last of it, Messer Francisco. Only someone of a {{powerful}} family would venture upon so bold a deed, as to try to carry off ladies of birth on the Grand Canal, and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> this adventure has created for you enemies not to be despised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Holmes answered, in his gentlest voice, [...] "I {{will not}} cause you any {{unnecessary}} trouble, Lady Brackenstall, and my whole desire {{is to make}} things easy for you, for I am convinced {{that you are a}} much-tried woman. If you will treat me as a friend and trust me, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> I will justify your trust." ...|$|E
60|$|Pressed {{as we are}} by lapse of time I am glad to {{hear you}} say this; and yet I do hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> a way <b>that</b> the effort shall not be desperate in the sense of great loss of life.|$|R
6000|$|... "You were," [...] {{said the}} little man dryly. [...] "But we've changed that in your absence. You're broke for abandoning your post without due cause, and thereby imperiling the {{settlement}} over which you had charge. It's a serious matter, Colonel Bishop, as <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find.</b> Considering <b>that</b> <b>you</b> held your office from the Government of King James, it is even possible that a charge of treason might lie against you. It rests with your successor entirely whether ye're hanged or not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll hiss no more," [...] said Irene, as the {{soldiers}} formed up round her, [...] "yet, perchance, Constantine, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> live to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the snake still has strength to strike and poison in its fangs, you and others. Do {{you come with}} me, Martina?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] she said, [...] "that I {{rather like}} what you have said. Don't be afraid to go on {{thinking}} it. Even though I am going to sing at the 'Unusual' <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the 'Alcide,' whom you knew in Paris does not exist any more. At the same time," [...] she added, in a suddenly altered tone, [...] "it isn't anything whatever to do with you, is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And thus," [...] {{broke in}} Rosamund, [...] "add murder to sacrilege! Oh! sirs, bethink what you do--ay, and {{remember}} this, {{that you do}} it all in vain. Saladin has promised you nothing, except that if you deliver me to him, he will talk with you, and then <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> you have sinned for nothing. Have pity on me and go your ways, leaving {{the issue in the}} hand of God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Noble in this as {{in other}} things," [...] commented Sir Andrew when they had done; [...] "but I fear that one of <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> vow hard to keep. By all the saints, nephews, you were right when {{you said that you}} asked a great boon. Do you know, {{although}} I have told you nothing of it, that, not to speak of the knave Lozelle, already two of the greatest men in this land have sought my daughter Rosamund in marriage?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Send a page-boy {{round the}} hotel," [...] I told the hall-porter, [...] "to inquire if Mr. Delora {{is in any}} of the rooms. If I might make the suggestion," [...] I continued, turning towards her, [...] "I would go upstairs at once. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>find,</b> after all, <b>that</b> Mr. Dean has made a mistake, and that your uncle is there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Independent film scholar Bharadwaj Rangan {{praised the}} acting and casting stating [...] "Watching Rajat Kapoors marvellous Ankhon Dekhi, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> {{yourself}} wishing <b>that</b> {{we had one}} of those [...] "Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture" [...] awards. The casting is perfect, the performances exquisite. Its a cliché to say that an actor has [...] "lived" [...] his role - but that sense of not-acting-but-being is all-pervasive here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} {{no more than}} my young sister Spring where <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> the Spirits <b>that</b> <b>you</b> seek; but I too, like her, will give a gift to aid you. Take this sunbeam from my crown; it will cheer and {{brighten}} the most gloomy path through which you pass. Farewell! I shall carry tidings of you to the watcher by the sea, if in my journey round the world I find her there." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, Beatrice, {{have your}} will, sow your seed of tears, {{and take your}} chance. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> you were right and the worldlings wrong, and you may reap a harvest beyond the grasp of their poor imaginations. And {{if you find that}} they are right and you are wrong, what will it matter to you who sleep? For of this at least you are sure. If there is no future for such earthly love as yours, then indeed there is none for the {{children}} of this world and all their troubling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: look in that {{shelf in}} the corner; there are all our old childish books. Bring that one," [...] she added, as Henrietta took one out, and opening it, she showed in the {{fly-leaf}} the well-written [...] "F.H. Langford," [...] with the giver's name; and below in round hand, scrawled all over the page, [...] "Mary Vivian, the gift of her cousin Fred." [...] "I believe that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> in almost all of them," [...] said she. [...] "I am glad they have been spared from the children at Sutton Leigh. Will you bring me a few more to look over, before you go down again to grandmamma?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{one point}} of view," [...] he said, [...] "that would be a bad thing for you: but I don't {{look at it in}} that way; in fact, I hope you may become my biographer. I will furnish you with {{material}} enough, and you can arrange it and put it in shape; that is, if, {{in the course of a}} few years, you consider that, in doing what I ask of you, you will be writing the true life of a man, and not a collection of fanciful stories. So I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> you have not lost your time when thinking so much of a man of the past." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not good}} at riddles, sir," [...] Philip said haughtily, [...] "and can only suppose that your object is to pick a quarrel with me; though I am not {{conscious}} of having given you offence. However, that matters little. I suppose {{you are one of}} those gallants who air their bravery when they think they can do so, with impunity. On the present occasion <b>you</b> <b>may,</b> perchance, <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are mistaken. I am a stranger here, and know of no place where this matter can be settled, nor am I provided with a second; but I am quite content to place myself in the hands of one of these gentlemen, if they will act for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is," [...] said Grant calmly, [...] "the {{great new}} trade of the Organizer of Repartee. This fat old gentleman {{lying on the}} ground strikes you, as I have no doubt, as very stupid and very rich. Let me clear his character. He is, like ourselves, very clever and very poor. He is also not really at all fat; all that is stuffing. He is not {{particularly}} old, and his name is not Cholmondeliegh. He is a swindler, and a swindler of a perfectly delightful and novel kind. He hires himself out at dinner-parties to lead up to other people's repartees. According to a preconcerted scheme (which <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> on <b>that</b> piece of paper), he says the stupid things he has arranged for himself, and his client says the clever things arranged for him. In short, he allows himself to be scored off for a guinea a night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suit yourself, young man, suit yourself," [...] she said, with equally direct {{resentment and}} antagonism; [...] "only mebbee you'll {{let me tell}} you that Jim McClosky ain't no fool, and mebbee knows what lawyers think of an {{arrangement}} with a sister-in-law that leaves a real sister out! Mebbee that's a 'Sister's title' you ain't thought of, Mr. Brant! And mebbee you'll <b>find</b> out <b>that</b> your chance o' gettin' Mrs. Peyton's consent ain't as safe to gamble on as you reckon it is. And mebbee, what's more to the purpose, if you DID get it, it might not be just the trump card to fetch Susy with! And to wind up, Mr. Brant, when you DO have to come down to the bed-rock and me and Jim McClosky, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> out <b>that</b> him and me have discovered a better match for Susy than the son of old Ham Brant, who is trying to play the Spanish grandee off his father's money on a couple of women. And we mayn't have to go far to do it--or to get THE REAL THING, Mr. Brant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... [51] [...] "I {{come now}} from Mr. Dryden's funeral, {{where we had}} an Ode in Horace sung, instead of David's Psalms; whence <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find,</b> <b>that</b> we don't think a poet worth Christian burial. The pomp of the {{ceremony}} {{was a kind of}} rhapsody, and fitter, I think, for Hudibras, than him; because the cavalcade was mostly burlesque: but he was an extraordinary man, and buried after an extraordinary fashion; for I do believe there was never such another burial seen. The oration, indeed, was great and ingenious, worthy the subject, and like the author; whose prescriptions can restore the living, and his pen embalm the dead. And so much for Mr. Dryden; whose burial was the same as his life,--variety, and not of a piece:-- the quality and mob, farce and heroics; the sublime and ridicule mixed in a piece;--great Cleopatra in a hackney coach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sixty-seven in all," [...] {{she muttered}} {{to herself as}} she regained the street. [...] "Well, it was no use holding out for any more, for he hasn't got the cash. The man's as poor as Lazarus, but he wants to live like Dives, and, what is more, he gambles, as I learned at The Hague. Also, there's {{something}} queer about his past; I have heard as much as that. It must be looked into, and perhaps the bundle of papers which I helped myself to out of his desk while I was waiting"--and she touched the bosom of her dress {{to make sure that they}} were safe--"may tell me a thing or two, though likely enough they are only unpaid bills. Ah! most noble cheat and captain, before you have done with her <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Black Meg knows how to pay back hot water for cold!" ...|$|E
60|$|To read such essays is to {{understand}} the spell they have cast on successive generations of readers. They are, first of all, very personal; they begin, as a rule, with some pleasant trifle that interests the author; then, almost before we are aware, they broaden into an essay of life itself, an essay illuminated by the steady light of Lamb's sympathy or by the flashes of his whimsical humor. Next, we note in the Essays their air of literary culture, {{which is due to}} Lamb's wide reading, and to the excellent taste with which he selected his old authors,--Sidney, Brown, Burton, Fuller, Walton and Jeremy Taylor. Often it was the quaintness of these authors, their conceits or oddities, that charmed him. These oddities reappear in his own style {{to such an extent that}} even when he speaks a large truth, as he often does, he is apt to give the impression of being a little harebrained. Yet if you examine his queer idea or his merry jest, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it contains more cardinal virtue than many a sober moral treatise.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to his [...] "kids" [...] shortly before his surgery, which was {{distributed}} after his death, Dave wrote: [...] "Some of <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> it ironic <b>that</b> a 37-year-old man who neither drinks nor smokes nor drugs, and who frequently preaches that life is great if you smile a lot and make others happy, suddenly discovers that he harbors something in his brain that doesn't belong there. So do I." [...] Then he shared a little bit of his philosophy of life: [...] "I think it all has to do with working hard and smiling a lot and listening more than you talk and concentrating your effort in one area...

40|$|As you design Web pages, {{there may}} be {{occasions}} {{when you want to}} insert characters that arenot available on your keyboard. Or <b>you</b> <b>may</b> wish to use characters that could be confused as HTML markup or JavaScript code (the> and < symbols, for example). <b>You</b> also <b>may</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a need to use certain international characters. In all of these situations, you can solve your problem by making use of entities. The numeric and character entities listed in the tables that follow are taken from the International Standards Organization’s list of Latin characters (ISO 8859 - 1). As you browse the list, you will notice that some of the characters include both numeric and character entities, while others have only the numeric entity. A number of other entity lists are available, including lists of mathematical operators, symbols, Greek letters, and additional internationalization characters. These {{can be found at the}} World Wide Consortium’s Web site, at www. w 3. org/TR/html 4 /charset. html#didx. character_entity_references.

40|$|The main {{text for}} {{this part of}} the course (up to the October break) is DeGroot and Schervish (2002) (D&S). D&S cover most topics we will discuss, but the book is at a {{somewhat}} more elementary level than this course. D&S usually give separate treatment to discreteprobability and continuous-probability versions of the same concepts. They also usually do univariate versions first, then multivariate versions. We have to move faster than that, and will discuss the theory for the general case of distributions in R n from the start. So when a topic has gone by too quickly, or without enough examples, in lecture, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> well <b>find</b> <b>that</b> reading the corresponding parts of D&S makes it clearer. Students who already have strong math background might find Schervish (1995) a better investment than D&S. It covers much more than we will cover in this course, but will be a useful reference if you go further in econometrics or finance. Gelman, Carlin, Stern, and Rubin (1995) is also a useful reference for modern Bayesian methods, a few of which we will discuss, and should be available at the PU store...|$|R
