500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common.

We were heavily into stuff like Amon Tobin, Warp Records, et cetera, and that certainly influenced {{the sound of that}} one." [...] Continuing, “film soundtracks was more painstaking work than we thought. It's exciting work, but it's also more commercially orientated. You can apply your own tastes and your own vision, of course, but only to a certain extent. It always comes down to what the director and producers have in mind. And I respect that, as they are the ones with lots of money at stake. As a musician, it's an advantage if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> early in the process, before the editing is done because then you can cross edit sounds and images for better momentum or what have you.

5000|$|Samar {{received}} positive reviews. Sify's critic wrote, [...] "a suspense thriller that is intelligently structured, Vishal’s Thiru directed Samar is an all {{new experience}} for Tamil commercial cinema viewers", with the reviewer {{going on to}} add {{that it was not}} [...] "what one would rate as great cinema but we assure it has enough zing, visual and thrills to keep you in your seats for its runtime of a little over two hours". Vivek Ramz from in.com rated it 3 out of 5 and stated, 'Samar' has an interesting storyline, but is somewhat let down in its treatment. Still, it’s watchable, especially for those who love suspense and thrills. M. Suganth from The Times of India gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and claimed, Samar is an engaging film that is quite a different attempt for Tamil cinema (Hollywood routinely comes up with such thrillers) and Thiru deserves a pat for confidently exploring this slightly tricky genre and managing to succeed in it. Rediff's Pavithra Srinivasan gave it 3 out of 5 and cited that it [...] "manages to wring out a tale that's entertaining and snappy, despite its flaws", further adding that [...] "it is slick, makes <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> with the characters, and doesn't let you pause until almost the end", and calling it an [...] "ideal festival fare". Deccan Chronicle stated that Samar was a [...] "neat thriller with an interesting plot and a good script". Oneindia.in gave 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, [...] "the strength of the film is the screenplay, which thrills you with every twist. The first half of Samar is brilliant and the second half is cleverly narrated", describing it as a [...] "must-watch movie for action lovers". Behindwoods gave the film 2.5 out of 5 and cited that director Thiru [...] "has given a movie which has the right intentions, begins well and incites your interest at the halfway point. But, once the knots are untied, the end feeling is {{that it could have been}} a greater product", concluding that it was a [...] "watchable suspense flick which could have been better".|$|E

40|$|When Julius {{graduated}} from St. Patrick’s Cathedral High School {{in the early}} 1950 ’s, {{he went to work}} for Fur Foods and then the railroad company. After being let go from the railroad company, Julius started volunteer coaching touch football. The following year, Julius began coaching tackle football and basketball at St. Patrick’s. During this time, Julius began attending The University of Texas at El Paso and did so while coaching at St. Patrick’s. Julius left St. Patrick’s to coach at Putnam Elementary when he was offered a high school coaching job at a school in Canutillo, a community in the El Paso Metropolitan Statistical Area. Julius took the job at Canutillo High School and had the chance to build the athletics program from the very bottom. Julius became known as “Coach,” taught athletics for 12 years at Canutillo High School, won 21 district championships, 2 state championships while coaching basketball, football, track and cross-country. During the first years coaching at Canutillo, the students lacked a field to practice and would practice at a nearby farm. Julius fostered self-respect by having his athletes wear clean pants, shirt and a tie to their games and his firm rules provided much guidance for his young students. When the school finally got a field, Julius planted the seed during the summer and the kids would spend the nights on the field and took care of manually moving the sprinklers around for the field to receive adequate water. The athletics program at Canutillo High School grew out of community involvement. The janitors built the bleachers and the press box, Irene would sell burritos, and a janitor would bring the game ball out to the field at the beginning of every game. After being at Canutillo High School for 12 years, Julius felt that he was done with coaching and went to work for Bob Hayes selling cleaning. He stayed with that job shortly before learning of a coaching job at St. Patrick’s. Julius again went to coach for St. Patrick’s for a few short years before leaving to coach in Monterrey México, with the University in Provolone. Julius taught there for a short while before the peso devalued. Julius and his family moved back to the El Paso and he was offered a job with Gadsden coaching and he took it. Julius stayed with Gadsden {{for a short period of}} time before leaving coaching all together. Julius left Gadsden and went to work for the builder Floyd Burrs as his superintendent. Julius worked as a superintendent for a time until he quit and formed a partnership with Luis Rico and they formed what became Julius Lowenberg and Associates Construction. Julius also formed the El Paso chapter of the National Association of Remodeling Industry. Julius Lowenberg and Associates Construction focuses on commercial and high end residential remodeling and construction. The advice Julius would offer entrepreneurs is that nothing is helpful unless <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> in it. Nothing is worthwhile unless <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> in it.

40|$|For most of {{our early}} years in percussion, our goals have been to master snare drum, marimba, or drumset. The other {{instruments}} {{that we had to}} play in band often got no attention in our practice routine. At times this was because we could not practice them at home. In other cases it might have been because we thought it was unnecessary to work on instruments like Bass Drum, Cymbals, Tambourine and Triangle. As we grow as performers and become increasingly sensitive musicians, the artistry needed on these instruments becomes more apparent. Let’s begin our study of Accessory Instruments with Concert Bass Drum. “But I don’t like Bass Drum. ” “Mr. /Ms Doe only put me on bass drum because he/she doesn’t like me. ” “All I’ve got to do is hit it, right? ” How many of you have had these thoughts? All of us have had them at one point or another, but Bass Drum is a fantastic instrument once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> with it. It is probably the most important instrument in the band because of the power it possesses to direct the entire ensemble. Everyone listens to the bass drum—and follows it. This means you have incredible power over the music—and you have an incredible responsibility. Bass Drum players must have impeccable time, must always watch the conductor, and must always listen to the ensemble. In addition, the percussionist on bass drum needs a large palette of sound colors to use in various situations. How is this done? Through changes in technique, stroke, and where we strike the head...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{incitement}} to commitment and voluntary work. The overall problem is the question why <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> in voluntary work for an organisation like Lutherhjälpen, the organisation for international development co-operation of the Church of Sweden, {{one of the largest}} NGOs of the country. The theoretical perspectives are seen from the position of the increasing pace of change, the loss of tradition and the individualization in modern society. These views deepen in considering the following aspects: The importance of globalization and the risk society to an involvement in voluntary work, the extent to which voluntary efforts can be regarded as work, the significance of existential issues and religious faith to that commitment, the extent to which that commitment is an expression of altruism and/or selfishness. The empirical part consists of three sections: A content analysis of the annual reports of Lutherhjälpen from the years 1963 - 1996 and of the educational material of the organisation; further, qualitatively focused interviews with thirty-one people actively involved in the organisation and, finally, 820 inquiries representing the quantitative aspect. The results show that {{there are a variety of}} motives. In the organisation’s own material the incitements referred to are predominantly biblical. The interviews and inquiries provide a wider scope of motives. In this material it is possible to distinguish between more and less important motives. Issues of global justice are strong incitements to many of those involved but to some people subordinate to other motives. Whenever the organisation suggests concrete actions in order to solve problems or meet threats in the global risk society, we find a connection between existential issues and voluntary engagement. Being involved provides the satisfaction of being part of a meaningful context. The church and Christian belief are of great importance to people’s engagement in Lutherhjälpen. Involvement in voluntary work can be understood as part and parcel of one's involvement in the church, being a way of participating in the church one belongs to. Altruistic values are very important to many of those involved in the activities of Lutherhjälpen. Altruism and self-interest is, in fact, what it is all about. Whatever you do is done both for others and because you get something in return. People's early socialization seems to be the key to understanding why anybody gets involved in voluntary work for Lutherhjälpen...|$|E

[...] The University of Georgia Law School Alumni Association has {{presented}} its highest honor, the Distinguished Service Scroll Award, to Bruce W. Kirbo, {{an attorney in}} Bainbridge, Ga., and John S. Noell, Jr., an attorney in Athens, Ga. The award is given each year to two individuals whose services to the legal profession and to the UGA School of Law are worthy of special recognition. The awards were presented during the Law School Association 2 ̆ 7 s annual breakfast held {{in conjunction with the}} Georgia State Bar meeting at Kiawah Island, S. C. on Friday, June 15, 2001. Kirbo is the senior practitioner in the South Georgia circuit. He entered the University of Georgia at the age of 16 and earned a law degree in 1951 at the age of 21. While at UGA, Kirbo made a mark as a student leader: {{he was a member of}} Blue Key and Gridiron, president of Demosthenian, and served two terms of service on the law school 2 ̆ 7 s honor court. He was admitted to the Georgia Bar just a few days after his 21 st birthday and, after two years of service in the military, began his successful private practice in Bainbridge. During his distinguished career, Kirbo has served as a member of the board of governors and other committees of the State Bar, as a special master for the Supreme Court of Georgia, as well as a member of the School of Law 2 ̆ 7 s Board of Visitors. He was inducted into the American College of Trial Lawyers in 1979 and is now a Fellow of the organization. Kirbo has also led a lifetime of leadership, service and philanthropy to his local community. He has represented the Decatur County School Board since 1979, served as a member of the executive board of the Bainbridge College Foundation, as president of the Kiwanis Club, as chairman of the First Christian Church, and as a Sunday School teacher. In addition, he and his brother, the late Charles H. Kirbo (a Distinguished Service Scroll recipient in 1978), were named chairmen of the Thomas M. and Irene B. Kirbo Charitable Trust in the 1980 s. That fund, named for his late uncle and aunt, has benefited numerous educational institutions, including the University of Georgia School of Law, where a total of more than 2 million presently endows the Charles H. Kirbo Professorship of International Law. The city of Bainbridge also has the Kirbo Trust to thank for its YMCA building. 2 ̆ 2 Today we honor Bruce, but in honoring Bruce, we must honor the entire Kirbo family, 2 ̆ 2 said Beaird. 2 ̆ 2 I cannot think of another group who, as a family, has served the university and its law school as this family has. 2 ̆ 2 Kirbo and his wife, Cass, have been married for 45 years. They have five children, all of whom graduated from UGA. Bruce Wheat Kirbo, Jr., a UGA law graduate like his father, now practices with his father at the firm of Kirbo 2 ̆ 6 Kendrick in Bainbridge. MORE SCROLL AWARDS, page 2 2 ̆ 2 I have been practicing law for 50 years, 2 ̆ 2 said Kirbo upon receiving his award. 2 ̆ 2 I have had some good times and some hard times, but I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I appreciate the university. I appreciate the law school, and I appreciate every one of you. 2 ̆ 2 John S. Noell, Jr., a native of Thomaston, Ga., also earned both his undergraduate (1963) and law degrees (1965) from the University of Georgia. He was a distinguished military graduate of the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) and secretary/treasurer of his first-year law class. Noell served as a captain in the U. S. Army with the 9 th Infantry Division in Vietnam from 1967 - 2 ̆ 768 and received numerous commendations for service: Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, and Republic of Vietnam Medal with Gold Star. He returned to Athens in 1968 and continues to practice there today with the law firm of Cook, Noell, Tolley, Bates 2 ̆ 6 Michael. Noell 2 ̆ 7 s excellence as a litigator has led to his election to membership in the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association and Association of Trial Lawyers of America. He served as president of the Athens Bar Association in 1976 - 2 ̆ 777 and taught trial practice as an instructor at the UGA law school from 1973 - 2 ̆ 774. Noell 2 ̆ 7 s service to the law school also includes leadership as president of the Law School Association (1992 - 2 ̆ 793), chairman of the Board of Visitors (1999 - 2000), ex-officio member of the Dean Search Committee (1992 - 2 ̆ 793), member of the Law School Bicentennial Celebration Committee, fund-raising class agent for four years, and chair of his Class of 1965 reunion on five occasions. He is also a member of the UGA Partners, the Presidents Club, Heritage Society and Joseph Henry Lumpkin Society - all among the most prestigious designations for financial support of the University of Georgia and its School of Law. Noell gives of his time and energy to the local community as well. He has served as past president of the local Chamber of Commerce, Lions Club, and American Cancer Society chapter. 2 ̆ 2 For the past 36 years, John Noell has been what a good alumnus should be - a lawyer generous with his time, generous with his leadership skills and yes, his financial support, 2 ̆ 2 said Callaway Professor Emeritus Verner Chaffin, Noell 2 ̆ 7 s former law school professor, who presented him with the award. 2 ̆ 2 [The law school] has not hesitated to place responsibility on John Noell and to let him know that we trusted him. He has always been faithful to that trust. John has done honor to the law school and all his fellow alumni by rendering service back to our community of scholars and the legal profession. 2 ̆ 2 Noell and his wife, Claudia Stowers Noell, have been married for 37 years. She is retired from the UGA Cooperative Extension Service and had served for 10 years as extension agent for Athens-Clarke County. In 1999, she received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from UGA 2 ̆ 7 s College of Family and Consumer Sciences. 2 ̆ 2 You don 2 ̆ 7 t know what you 2 ̆ 7 re missing as alumni until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>involved</b> with the institution, 2 ̆ 2 Noell said in his acceptance remarks. 2 ̆ 2 I encourage all of you to take away from this meeting of the State Bar a renewed dedication to your law school. And it is your law school, and you have an investment in it. You need to make sure that you don 2 ̆ 7 t lose the opportunity to participate. 2 ̆ 2 ## PHOTO CAPTION: UGA Distinguished Service Scroll Presenters and Recipients (l. to r.)

40|$|An email {{comes through}} from my Head of Department: "Simon, are <b>you</b> <b>getting</b> <b>involved</b> in the Exploring Our Ocean MOOC this year? You don't {{want to miss}} out!" I {{try to figure out}} whether this is a typo and also what it is that I don't want to miss out on. Has her cap-lock key got stuck? What letters are close to M, O, and C that she {{actually}} meant to type? Another email grabs my attention, and I decide I have too much to do to worry about decoding an email, which is either mistyped or in a hitherto unseen language. A week later as I walk down the corridor, there it is again. A bright and engaging poster with images of the deep ocean proclaims: "The University of Southampton MOOC on Exploring Our Ocean goes live in October 2014, register today—don't miss out!" As I study the poster, a passing student asks if I am starring in the MOOC this time around—he was surprised I wasn't involved in last year's. Last year's? I suddenly feel like someone who fell asleep in the 1980 s comfortable with the fax, VHS tapes, and a mobile phone that occasionally made phone calls, and woke up 20 years later to discover emails, online movies, and the iPhone...|$|R
