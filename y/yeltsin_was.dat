He recovered, and started intensively criticizing Gorbachev, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the Soviet Union as his major argument.|$|E

25|$|Between 21 and 24 September <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> {{confronted by}} popular unrest. The demonstrators were protesting {{the new and}} terrible living {{conditions}} under Yeltsin. Since 1989 GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> increasingly getting the blame. By early October, Yeltsin had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, Russia's parliament building.|$|E
25|$|Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> born in {{the village}} of Butka, Talitsky District, Sverdlovsk, USSR, on 1 February 1931. In 1932 after the state took away the entire harvest from the {{recently}} collectivised Butka peasants, the Yeltsin family moved as far away as they could, to Kazan, more than 1,100 kilometres from Butka, where Boris' father, Nikolai, found work on a construction site. Growing up in rural Sverdlovsk, he studied at the Ural State Technical University (now Urals Polytechnic Institute), and began his career in the construction industry. In 1934 Nikolai <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> convicted of anti-Soviet agitation and sentenced to hard labour in a gulag for three years.|$|E

50|$|On April 28, Rostropovich's body lay {{in an open}} coffin at the Moscow Conservatory, {{where he}} once studied as a teenager, and was then moved to the Church of Christ the Saviour. Thousands of mourners, {{including}} Putin, bade farewell. Spain's Queen Sofia, French first lady Bernadette Chirac and President Ilham Aliev of Azerbaijan, where Rostropovich was born, as well as Naina Yeltsina, the widow of Boris <b>Yeltsin,</b> <b>were</b> among those in attendance at the funeral on April 29. Rostropovich was then buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery, the same cemetery where his friend Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> had <b>been</b> buried four days earlier.|$|R
25|$|According to {{author and}} {{historian}} Taylor Branch's interviews with Bill Clinton, on a 1995 visit to Washington D.C., <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> found on Pennsylvania Avenue, drunk, {{in his underwear}} and trying to hail a taxi cab {{in order to find}} pizza.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} Russian {{head of state}} in 113 years {{to be buried in}} a church ceremony, after Emperor Alexander III. He was survived by his wife, Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina, whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters Yelena and Tatyana, born in 1957 and 1959, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In February 1996, Yeltsin {{announced}} that he would seek a second term in the summer 1996 Russian presidential election. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> {{at the end of his}} political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened in early 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero. Meanwhile, the opposition Communist Party had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1993 Russian {{constitutional}} crisis, Vice President Alexander Rutskoy {{was named}} by Parliament as the Acting President when the legislature announced Yeltsin's removal from office. On 21 September 1993 at 12:22 a.m., Rutskoy assumed {{the powers of}} acting president of Russia. He took the presidential oath, stating, [...] "I am taking the authority of President.

The summit was convened with the expressed aim of putting the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track {{after a period of}} increased tension and hostility.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{profusion of}} small parties and their aversion to {{coherent}} alliances left the legislature chaotic. During 1993, Yeltsin's rift with the parliamentary leadership led to the September–October 1993 constitutional crisis. The crisis climaxed on 3 October, when Yeltsin chose a radical solution to settle his dispute with parliament: he called up tanks to shell the Russian White House, blasting out his opponents. As <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> taking the unconstitutional step of dissolving the legislature, Russia came close to a serious civil conflict. <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> then free to impose the current Russian constitution with strong presidential powers, which was approved by referendum in December 1993. The cohesion of the Russian Federation was also threatened when the republic of Chechnya attempted to break away, leading to the First and Second Chechen Wars.|$|E
25|$|In April 2008, a new {{memorial}} to <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> dedicated in Moscow's Novodevichy cemetery, to mixed reactions.

25|$|Yeltsin also sparked popular unrest {{with his}} {{dissolution}} of a parliament increasingly opposed to his neoliberal economic reforms. Tens {{of thousands of}} Russians marched {{in the streets of}} Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions.

25|$|According to {{numerous}} reports, <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> alcohol dependent. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's {{visit to the}} U.S. in 1989 {{for a series of}} lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica. The article, reprinted by Pravda, reported that Yeltsin often appeared drunk in public. His alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and an incident during a flight stop-over at Shannon Airport, Ireland, in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) Albert Reynolds was told that <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. Reynolds tried to make excuses for him in an effort to offset his own humiliation in vainly waiting outside the plane to meet him. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Yumasheva claimed that her father had suffered a heart attack on the flight from the United States to Moscow and was therefore {{not in a position to}} leave the plane.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, the Russian SFSR, {{which was}} then the largest {{constituent}} republic (with {{about half of the}} population) convened a newly elected Congress of People's Deputies. Boris <b>Yeltsin</b> <b>was</b> elected its chairman. On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the USSR's laws. After a landslide victory of Sąjūdis in Lithuania, that country declared its independence restored on 11 March 1990.|$|E

The new party attempted to mimic OVR's formula of success, placing an emphasis on competence and pragmatism.
