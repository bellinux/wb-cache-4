500|$|Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly {{praised the}} song's [...] "confident drums that resound with special exuberant zing." [...] A {{reviewer}} for People felt that [...] "the more exotic musical elements are subsumed by Simon's pretty pop structures [...] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> {{the impression that}} Paul has truly gone native or even considered it. He's more like a kid camping under the stars in his own backyard." ...|$|E
500|$|Portrayed {{for most}} of his tenure as a deceiving villain, Paul can often be viewed {{participating}} in unpredictable stories. This arbitrary nature lead Dennis to proclaim [...] "he's a character <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> bored with. Even during times when storylines aren't centred on my character, the writers still come up with little twists for him all the time." [...] Network Ten branded Paul a high flying business man who enjoyed womanising until he met Gail Lewis (Fiona Corke). Other labels the character has are [...] "lothario" [...] and [...] "serial cheat" [...] because of his ill-treatment of the opposite sex. Upon his 2004 return he was portrayed stuck in his old ways. The writer added Paul was committing dodgy deals and deceiving his neighbours in a bid for revenge. The character despises pity, has a damaged personality and can never be faithful to a romantic partner. Dennis branded Paul as [...] "Mr. Evil" [...] because of Paul's harsh treatment of women, observing that his character treated them like toys, throwing them away when he was bored.|$|E
500|$|Martin Campbell {{spent three}} days of {{preparation}} on the [...] "Box" [...] set, analyzing it from every angle to learn {{the feel of the}} room. Fontana comes from a playwriting background, and [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] involves long lengths of dialogue in a single setting, much like a play. The actors shot about 14 pages of dialogue each day, and had a very small amount of rehearsal time before shooting. According to Fontana, Campbell never shot a scene from the same angle twice, [...] "So the entire hour keeps changing {{the point of view of}} the camera, so that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> tired of being in that room." [...] While filming the episode, Campbell would shoot single scenes with multiple pages of long dialogue, then film the scene again from another angle. Braugher said the experience felt more like staging a play than shooting a television episode, and allowed for a feeling of spontaneous human emotion in the performances. Although the dialogue in the final episode did not stray from the original script, Fontana said Campbell and the actors came up with the rhythm and pacing of the performances largely on their own, particularly during the fast-paced questions when Pembleton and Bayliss team up on Tucker.|$|E

2500|$|The efficient-market {{hypothesis}} {{emerged as}} a prominent theory in the mid-1960s. Paul Samuelson had begun to circulate Bachelier's work among economists. In 1964 Bachelier's dissertation along with the empirical studies mentioned above were published in an anthology edited by Paul Cootner. In 1965, Eugene Fama published his dissertation arguing for the random walk hypothesis. Also, Samuelson published a proof showing that if the market is efficient prices will show random-walk behavior. This is often cited {{in support of the}} efficient-market theory, by the method of affirming the consequent, however in that same paper, Samuelson warns against such backward reasoning, saying [...] "From a nonempirical base of axioms <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> empirical results." [...] In 1970, Fama published a review of both the theory and the evidence for the hypothesis. The paper extended and refined the theory, included the definitions for three forms of financial market efficiency: weak, semi-strong and strong (see below).|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. Ellie Miller was a lesbian in the first draft of the script, and there was no Joe Miller. But this didn't work well narratively, so Chibnall changed the character to a married heterosexual. But he had not yet settled on a killer. [...] "Often as a writer, you get your first draft out, and then you look and think, 'Now, what have I got here'," [...] Chibnall {{said in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly. [...] "You're really just throwing mud at the wall and then going, 'Oh, there's a pattern there.' [...] " [...] Chibnall knew, however, that the killer had to be someone close to Ellie. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke one morning and realised the murderer should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. [...] "t was the lightbulb moment above my head—which <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>get</b> as a writer, frankly. I've never had it before, probably won't ever have it again. I was, like, 'Ohmygod, it's Joe. It can't be anyone else.' [...] " [...] By making Joe the killer, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie Miller, and improved the narrative structure so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. The killer's identity was [...] "embedded" [...] (as Chibnall described it) into the script before he brought the project to ITV. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E
