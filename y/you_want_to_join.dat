In addition, in the next newsletter, we will have a special column — “Ask Judy ” where the 2011 ACM-W’s Athena Lecturer, Judy Olson, will answer questions from our community. Dr. Olson has over 40 years of experience in research and industry, thus she can answer any of those sticky questions we are not sure who to ask, but really need an answer for.

He was in a band called Talas out of Buffalo and they would come to Toronto and he’d freak us out, he’s just an insane bass player. He loved our music and was a fan of Max Webster, we sort of became friends and when he’d come to town we’d hang out. I said 'Bill, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>join</b> the band?' because Mike was leaving the group, and he agreed. So for about three weeks in was in the band and I’ll tell you 'High Class in Borrowed Shoes” and 'Battle Scar' never sounded better but 'Diamonds, Diamonds', you couldn’t have made it sound any worse. He just didn't know how to lay back and be a real soft, sensitive bass player. It was all about this thing that he had which was absolutely incredible, so it didn’t work out. There were no hard feelings {{and he went on}} and did really well. I got a call from him one day and he goes 'Hey man I'm in the studio with David Lee Roth, Ted Templeman and Steve Vai and we're covering your tune 'Kids in Action' and we need the words to the second verse'. I was shaking on the phone; this was right after Roth left Van Halen. Then at the last minute it got bumped off the record for “Tobacco Road”, they thought they needed a cover. See there's those darn covers again." [...] There is no known studio version of Roth's cover available to the public.|$|E
