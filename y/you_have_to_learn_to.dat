5|$|It {{was first}} time I ever swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different.... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all {{out on the field}} every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E
2500|$|She {{studied with}} Ragnar Blennow in Åstorp {{for six months}} to prepare for an {{audition}} at the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm where she came in first out {{of a group of}} 47 singers and was awarded the Christina Nilsson scholarship named for the famous soprano. Märta Birgit Svensson combined her middle name with Nilsson to form her new stage name. Her teachers at the Academy were Joseph Hislop and Arne Sunnegårdh. However, she considered herself self-taught: [...] "The best teacher is the stage", she told an interviewer in 1981. [...] "You walk out onto it, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> project." [...] She deplored her early instruction and attributed her success to native talent. [...] "My first voice teacher [...] almost killed me ... he second was almost as bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Off-screen, actress Lucy Speed {{had decided}} to leave the serial after playing Natalie for a year, as she was {{reportedly}} “freaked out” by the media attention she was receiving from being in such a high-profile show. In an interview with the ‘’Walford Gazette’’, Speed commented: “I was very frightened by it quite frankly and certainly unprepared for it. I didn't like at all the attention that came with being on such a high-profile show. It simply wasn't what I signed up for in the first place-all that craziness. I was naive, I admit. Of course it does come with the job of being on the show and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> deal with it and cope with it. The advantages always outweigh the drawbacks, anyway, but it didn't seem like that to me at the time. I was very young and extremely shy, so it all became a huge difficulty for me…But I also have {{to make it clear that}} from the beginning when I joined, I always intended to stay in it for just a year anyway. I honoured my initial one-year contract and then moved on…they did express their interest in signing me for another year, but I politely but firmly declined. They were a bit shocked. I tried to explain in the best way I could my reasons for leaving at the end of my contract and they ultimately understood, and so I left on good terms with them…I had some growing up to do and instinctively knew that growing up more or less in front of the British public for one year was enough!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There is no evil {{between men}} and women that is not a common evil,' said Karenin. 'It is you poets, Kahn, with your love songs which turn the sweet {{fellowship}} of comrades into this woman-centred excitement. But there is something in women, in many women, which responds to these provocations; they succumb to a peculiarly self-cultivating egotism. They become the subjects of their own artistry. They develop and elaborate themselves as scarcely any man would ever do. They LOOK for golden canopies. And even when they seem to react against that, they may do it still. I have been reading in the old papers of the movements to emancipate women that were going on before the discovery of atomic force. These things which began with a desire to escape from the limitations and servitude of sex, ended in an inflamed assertion of sex, and women more heroines than ever. Helen of Holloway was at last as big a nuisance in her way as Helen of Troy, and so long as you think of yourselves as women'--he held out a finger at Rachel and smiled gently--'instead of thinking of yourselves as intelligent beings, you will be in danger of--Helenism. To think of yourselves as women is to think of yourselves in relation to men. You can't escape that consequence. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> think of yourselves--for our sakes and your own sakes--in relation to the sun and stars. You have to cease to be our adventure, Rachel, and come with us upon our adventures. ...' He waved his hand towards the dark sky above the mountain crests.|$|E
5000|$|Seresin {{described}} {{his approach to}} his work as [...] "detached". “As a DP, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> both trust your eye and to be brave enough {{to say to the}} director ‘This is the wrong decision’".|$|E
2500|$|On one tape, titled [...] "Jihad", he said: [...] "Our {{methodology}} is the bullet, not the ballot." [...] In a tape called [...] "Rules of Jihad", thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} before the 9/11 attacks, he said: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> shoot. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> fly planes, drive tanks, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> load your guns and to use missiles. You are only allowed to use nuclear weapons in that country which is 100% unbelievers." [...] He encouraged the use of [...] "anything, even chemical weapons," [...] to [...] "exterminate non-believers."

The first thing, {{therefore}}, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in landscape, is to outline; {{and therefore}} we must now know precisely what an outline is, how {{it ought to be}} represented; and this it will be right to define in quite general terms applicable to all subjects.|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> [...] "talk musically" [...] {{by giving}} {{just the right}} stress to the various {{elements}} {{that make up the}} music. A forte is not just a violent, [...] "wooden" [...] sound, while a pianissimo should not be considered merely as a quieter sound.|$|E
50|$|Third is {{that the}} {{information}} market does not exhibit high degrees of transparency. That is, to evaluate the information, the information must be known, {{so you have to}} invest in learning it to evaluate it. To evaluate a bit of software <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> use it; to evaluate a movie you have to watch it.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, LeBrock's phrases from Weird Science [...] "So {{what would}} you little maniacs like to do first" [...] and [...] "If you want be a party animal, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> live in the jungle. Now stop {{worrying}} and go and get dressed" [...] {{were used in the}} Bastille song Good Grief which was released in 2016.|$|E
6000|$|But her perplexities did not impair the {{appetite}} which she {{brought to the}} sylvan feast.

5000|$|In the Evelyn Waugh novel Brideshead Revisited, Lord Sebastian Flyte takes Charles Ryder [...] "to see the ivy" [...] {{soon after}} they first meet.

I don't know where I should be without the Botanical gardens" [...] (Chapter One).|$|R
40|$|I {{address this}} topic because I {{want you to}} be aware that the stock market could be a good {{investment}} vehicle—investing in it also exposes us <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> disparate businesses. One big advantage of owning stock is liquidity. Unlike investing in fixed assets, you won't be stuck with any stock that falls out of favor. Of course, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the trade, as well as the tricks of the trade, to do well...|$|R
5000|$|The Oregonian quoted Hazelbaker's {{reflecting}} on the Senate campaign, [...] "People {{are not afraid to}} personally attack you if they think it is in the interests of their candidate," [...] she says.

5000|$|Regarding his then-new {{role as a}} starter, Bullitt stated: [...] "You {{always want}} to be a starter. That’s why you come to the NFL. You don’t want to come in and be a backup. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait your time. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be patient, because anytime, an {{opportunity}} may come.

2500|$|Hitchens {{has said}} of his reputation: [...] "I {{know a lot of}} people {{consider}} me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> not <b>to</b> care, or at least not to mind. I don't like being called 'bonkers' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that. But I take comfort from the fact that most totalitarian regimes tend to classify their opponents as mentally disordered." ...|$|R
50|$|De Négrier had a hasty temper, {{but it was}} {{redeemed}} by a ready {{sense of}} humour, and his troops relished his occasional volcanic eruptions. Second Lieutenant René Normand of the 111th Line Battalion (killed in action a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo) recalled a typical incident during the Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885:General de Négrier began to concentrate his brigade. The column was moving forward slowly, in single file, and as he watched it he remarked to us, 'The thing about warfare is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> be patient.' No sooner were the words {{out of his mouth}} than a cannon bogged down. He spurred towards the wretched gun section. 'Oh, for God's sake! Keep the damned thing moving!' Then he burst out laughing, and that set us all off.|$|E
5000|$|Weissenbruch's {{early work}} showed the strong {{influence}} of the romantic painter Andreas Schelfhout. Schelfhout's influence {{can be seen in}} Weissenbruch's early landscapes, painted in precise detail. His magnificent, cloudy skies show his admiration for the seventeenth-century artist Jacob van Ruisdael, whose work he saw at an early age in the Mauritshuis in The Hague. When he was invited to take lessons from this very celebrated artist, his older friend, Bosboom, advised him not to accept. 'I can't simply say [...] "no, thank you" [...] to Schelfhout!" [...] sputtered Weissenbruch. Whereupon Bosboom said: [...] "you should do that, Weiss! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> stand on your own and see through your own eyes." [...] In 1847, Weissenbruch first exhibited at the exhibition of Living Masters, and {{he became one of the}} founders of the Pulchri Studio.|$|E
5000|$|Kesha was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Learn to Let Go" [...] by {{one of her friends}} who went through [...] "the worst childhood imaginable." [...] The track is also based on Kesha's struggles while making Rainbow.About the song, Kesha told Huffington Post: [...] …The only way to truly evolve is to let the past be the past and move forward with an open heart. If you let your demons haunt you, they will haunt you forever. Learn from your mistakes but don’t dwell on them, and if you feel like someone has wronged you, let that be their problem - not yours. As much as our past creates who we are, we can't let it define us or hold us back. And especially if you've been through something hard, and we all have, you can't hold on to resentment because it's like a poison. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> let go of those bad feelings and move forward. Kesha [...] She has also described the song's title as [...] "one of my mantras over the last few years." ...|$|E
60|$|This is {{all that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in the room below; but as we stand there, we hear a {{trampling}} of feet in the apartment above,--the quick yet careful opening and shutting of doors,--and voices come and go about the house, and whisper consultations on the stairs. Now comes the roll of wheels, and the Doctor's gig drives up to the door; and, as he goes creaking up with his heavy boots, we will follow and gain admission to the dimly-lighted chamber.|$|R

5000|$|Knopfler later {{admitted}} {{it was difficult}} to produce Dylan. [...] "You see people working in different ways, and it's good for you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> adapt to the way different people work. Yes, it was strange at times with Bob. One of the great parts about production is that it demonstrates to you {{that you have to be}} flexible. Each song has its own secret that's different from another song, and each has its own life. Sometimes it has to be teased out, whereas other times it might come fast. There are no laws about songwriting or producing. It depends on what you're doing, not just who you're doing. You have to be sensitive and flexible, and it's fun. I'd say I was more disciplined. But I think Bob is much more disciplined as a writer of lyrics, as a poet. He's an absolute genius. As a singer—absolute genius. But musically, I think it’s a lot more basic. The music just tends to be a vehicle for that poetry." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Fenn's career took a downturn. In 1993, she had stated: I don't get {{considered}} {{for a lot of}} those big fat movies. The studios have their list of five actresses and whether they’re right or wrong for a role doesn’t matter. It’s how much money their last movie made," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I necessarily want to do them anyway. Because there’s very few that are big budget that have any substance or any depth or any integrity." [...] In 1997, she stated: [...] "It was crazy, I was very picky. In other words, I didn't take advantage of what was happening necessarily then." [...] Also, she has attributed her failure to adapt to the Hollywood system to her frankness and her dislike for the [...] "Hollywood game." [...] I was told once that I didn't play the Hollywood game, and that's why I wasn't a big star. What they meant when they said that was that I don't go to parties, and when I go to an audition and I don't like the script, they know it. I don't flirt and I don't play the people that I'm meeting with. In the next breath, this person said to me, ‘When you're passionate about a role, there's nobody that can touch you, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> do this also...’ But I don't know how to sit there and pretend I love something when I don't! ...|$|E
5000|$|When the Galaxy Being emerges, the {{authorities}} attempt to kill it; but it protects itself by destroying the bullets in flight, again with radiation. As a warning demonstration (and perhaps to prevent other aliens from coming), the Galaxy Being destroys the transmitter tower. The mob is told, [...] "There are powers in this universe beyond anything you know. … There is much <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b> … Go <b>to</b> your homes. Go and give {{thought to the}} mysteries of the universe. I will leave you now, in peace." [...] At this, the crowd disperses.|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked at}} him curiously, as if to enquire, 'then if <b>you</b> won't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> poetry and <b>you</b> won't get sent to bed, what on earth is there for you to worry about?' ...|$|R
