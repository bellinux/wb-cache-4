40|$|Five hundred seven bull calves were {{assembled}} at {{a commercial}} feedlot in North-central Utah and sorted by frame size into 8 pens. Bullocks were fed a high energy diet ad libitum. Approximately {{one-half of the}} bullocks received 27. 5 mg/kg of sodium lasalocid daily while the others were fed 27. 5 mg/kg of sodium lasalocid or sodium monensin on alternating days. The experiment was conducted with a randomized block design where ionophore treatment was the main effect and pens were blocks. The objectives {{of the study were}} to determine whether alternating two popularly used ionophores in feedlot diets affects average daily gain, efficiency of growth, total volatile fatty acid production, acetate to propionate ratio and/or carcass traits of <b>young</b> bulls. <b>Bullocks</b> were harvested by pen when the average fat thickness for a pen was estimated to be 0. 6 cm. Days on feed averaged 126 days for all bullocks and were the same for each treatment group. No differences were detected (P< 0. 05) in average daily gain, dry matter feed to gain ratio, cost of gain, total volatile fatty acid production or acetate to propionate ratio. No treatment effects were found for carcass maturity scores, ribeye area, percentage of kidney, pelvic and heart fat or carcass weight. Fat thickness, marbling score and quality grade were slightly higher and USDA sex class was lower (P< 0. 05) for bullocks continuously fed lasalocid than for those fed lasalocid and monensin on alternating days. While small differences were observed for certain carcass traits, it was concluded that alternating ionophores in feedlot diets fed to <b>young</b> <b>bullocks</b> makes little difference in beef production traits of economic importance and is probably not cost effective...|$|R
5000|$|Bullockies often chose Devon cattle {{because they}} were plentiful, hardy, {{tractable}} and readily matched up the team, which was often {{a source of pride}} to the owners. Teams had to be educated to perform their respective tasks, too. The first part of a bullock’s education began when the bullocky tied two <b>young</b> <b>bullocks</b> together with two heavy leather collars and a connecting chain. Thus connected they were turned out to graze and rest until they accepted the close presence of their partner. Untrained bullocks were then put in the centre of the team, where they were more easily controlled with the assistance and guidance of the [...] "leaders” who were well trained to verbal commands. Pairs of bullocks were matched for size and yoked together using a wooden yoke secured to each bullock by a metal bow which was fixed in place by key on top of the yoke. Each pair was connected by a special chain, which ran from a central ring on each yoke to the next pair, thus coupling the team in tandem fashion. The “wheelers” or “polers” were the older, heavier, trained bullocks which were closest to the dray or jinker and helped to slow the load when necessary. Thus then was the team attached to the dray or jinker.|$|R

The High-Priest in his linen garments, took a censer full of burning coals of fire from the Altar, his hand being full of sweet incense beaten small; {{and went into the}} most holy place within the veil, and put the incense upon the fire, and sprinkled the blood of the bullock with his finger upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat seven times; and then he killed the goat which fell to God's lot, for a sin-offering for the people, and brought his blood within the veil, and sprinkled it also seven times upon the mercy-seat and before the mercy-seat. Then he went out to the Altar, and sprinkled it also seven times with the blood of the bullock, and as often with the blood of the goat. After this he laid both his hands upon the head of the live goat; and confessed over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat; and sent him away into the wilderness by the hands of a fit man: and the goat bore upon him all their iniquities into a land not inhabited, Levit. chap. iv. & chap. xvi. While the High-Priest was doing these things in the most holy place and at the Altar, the people continued at their devotion quietly and in silence. Then the High-Priest went into the holy place, put off his linen garments, and put on other garments; then came out, and sent the bullock and the goat of the sin-offering to be burnt without the camp, with fire taken in a censer from the Altar: and as the people returned home from the Temple, they said to one another, God seal you to a good new year.|$|E

Tall, square-shouldered, straight-limbed, as active as kittens and as powerful as <b>young</b> <b>bullocks,</b> {{it was clear that}} they would take a lot of beating. They were the pick of the University and London clubs, with a few players from the northern counties; not a man among them whose name was not known wherever football was played. That tall, long-legged youth is Evans, the great half-back, who is said to be able to send a drop-kick further than any of his predecessors in the annals of the game. There is Buller, the famous Cambridge quarter, only ten stone in weight, but as lithe and slippery as an eel; and Jackson, the other quarter, is just such another--hard to tackle himself, but as tenacious as a bulldog in holding an adversary. That one with the straw-coloured hair is Coles, the great forward; and there are nine lads of metal who will stand by him to-day through thick and thin. They were a formidable-looking lot, and betting, which had been five on four to them in the morning, showed symptoms of coming to five to three. In the meantime, by no means abashed at finding themselves the cynosure of so many eyes, the Englishmen proceeded to keep up their circulation by leap-frog and horse-play, for their jerseys were thin and the wind bleak.|$|R

What should I {{remember}} {{in all my life}} if not that night--the <b>young</b> <b>bullocks</b> snuffling in the gateways--the campion flowers all lighted up along the hedges--the moon with a halo-bats, too, in and out among the stems, and the shadows of the cottages as black and soft as that sea down there. For a long time we stood on the river-bank beneath a lime-tree. The scent of the lime flowers! A man can only endure about half his joy; about half his sorrow. Lucy and her husband," [...] he went on, presently, [...] "his name was Frank Tor--a man like an old Viking, who ate nothing but milk, bread, and fruit--were very good to us! It was like Paradise in that inn--though the commissariat, I am bound to say, was limited. The sweethriar grew round our bedroom windows; when the breeze blew the leaves across the opening--it was like a bath of perfume. Eilie grew as brown as a gipsy while we were there. I don't think any man could have loved her more than I did. But there were times when my heart stood still; it didn't seem as if she understood how much I loved her. One day, I remember, she coaxed me to take her camping. We drifted down-stream all the afternoon, and in the evening pulled into the reeds under the willow-boughs and lit a fire for her to cook by--though, as a matter of fact, our provisions were cooked already--but you know how it is; all the romance was in having a real fire. 'We won't pretend,' she kept saying. While we were eating our supper a hare came to our clearing--a big fellow--how surprised he looked! 'The tall hare,' Eilie called him. After that we sat by the ashes and watched the shadows, till at last she roamed away from me. The time went very slowly; I got up to look for her. It was past sundown. I called and called. It was a long time before I found her--and she was like a wild thing, hot and flushed, her pretty frock torn, her hands and face scratched, her hair down, like some beautiful creature of the woods. If one loves, a little thing will scare one. I didn't think she had noticed my fright; but {{when we got back to}} the boat she threw her arms round my neck, and said, 'I won't ever leave you again!' ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{castrated}} male {{is called}} a steer in the United States; older steers are often called bullocks {{in other parts of}} the world, but in North America this term refers to a <b>young</b> bull. Piker <b>bullocks</b> are micky bulls (uncastrated young male bulls) that were caught, castrated and then later lost. [...] In Australia, the term [...] "Japanese ox" [...] is used for grain-fed steers in the weight range of 500 to 650 kg that are destined for the Japanese meat trade. In North America, draft cattle under four years old are called working steers. Improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer known as a stag in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. In some countries, an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig.|$|R

His blood boiled with honest British exultation, as he saw the name of Osborne ennobled in the person of his son, and thought that he might be the {{progenitor}} of a glorious line of baronets. He worked in the City and on 'Change, until he knew everything relating to the fortune of the heiress, how her money was placed, and where her estates lay. <b>Young</b> Fred <b>Bullock,</b> one of his chief informants, would have liked to make a bid for her himself (it was so the young banker expressed it), only he was booked to Maria Osborne. But not being able to secure her as a wife, the disinterested Fred quite approved of her as a sister-in-law. [...] "Let George cut in directly and win her," [...] was his advice. [...] "Strike while the iron's hot, you know--while she's fresh to the town: in a few weeks some d---- fellow from the West End will come in with a title and a rotten rent-roll and cut all us City men out, as Lord Fitzrufus did last year with Miss Grogram, who was actually engaged to Podder, of Podder & Brown's. The sooner it is done the better, Mr. Osborne; them's my sentiments," [...] the wag said; though, when Osborne had left the bank parlour, Mr. Bullock remembered Amelia, and what a pretty girl she was, and how attached to George Osborne; and he gave up at least ten seconds of his valuable time to regretting the misfortune which had befallen that unlucky young woman.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in three {{highland}} woredas (districts) of Chilga, Dembia and Gondar Zuria in north Gondar Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia. These woredas were purposively selected because of their long experience in transhumance cattle production system. The objectives of the study were to characterize the transhumance cattle production system, identify the major constraints and forward appropriate developmental interventions for the future. Informal and formal surveys were employed to collect qualitative and quantitative data. From these woredas, a total of 180 representative households from 9 rural kebeles were selected using systematic random sampling methods. Semi-structured questionnaires and topical guidelines (checklists) were used to collect data. The results revealed that livestock production system in the highlands is characterized by mixed crop–livestock production and rainy season transhumance production system. Transhumance production system was practised mainly into the lowland areas. The major reasons why cattle were trekked to the lowlands were availability of feed (99. 2 %), free land for stocking (92. 4 %), low disease risk (25. 0 %) and availability of non-waterlogged areas (0. 8 %). Preferred locations were Metema (84. 0 %), Armachiho (9. 6 %), and Quara (4. 0 %) woredas, while very low percentages considered Alefa and Chilga woredas (0. 8 % each). The months when cattle movement started were May (69. 5 %), June (29. 6 %) and April (0. 8 %), and the months of returned home were October (45. 8 %) and September (35. 9 %). Three major cattle trekking routes were identified, and the selection of routes depended on distance, availability of forage and non-crop covered areas. The first destination is Agamwuha kebele (Lemlem Terara) in Metema district, irrespective of the routes followed. About 60. 3 % of the cattle population of the three woredas was trekked to the lowlands during the rainy season. The number of cattle owners and the size of cattle population involved in one group were 4. 3 ± 0. 18 farmers and 58. 8 ± 3. 89 heads, respectively. The average daily milk off-take, lactation yield and lactation length of indigenous cows in the three studied areas was about 2. 0 ± 0. 07 litres, 540 ± 21. 05 litres, and 8. 9 ± 0. 16 months, respectively. The mean age at first calving (AFC) and calving interval (CI) was 5. 2 ± 0. 30 years and 19. 0 ± 0. 38 months, respectively, while mean calf crop was 7. 4 ± 0. 47 heads. The average weaning age of calves was almost one year, being 11. 6 ± 0. 26 months. In the lowlands, milking, butter making and selling of dairy products were performed only by male herders. In the highland areas, butter (95. 6 %) {{was one of the most}} important saleable dairy products followed by raw milk (18. 4 %), fermented milk (ergo) and buttermilk (6. 1 %). However, during the transhumance period, butter (95. 3 %) was the major marketable commodity followed by raw milk (61. 3 %), buttermilk (18. 9 %) and fermented milk (14. 2 %). Highlanders also market dry cows, oxen, heifers and <b>young</b> <b>bullocks</b> during their stay inthe lowlands. The major constraints identified by the highlanders were conflict with the lowlanders, cattle theft, human and livestock diseases, and lack of markets. Most of the respondents (86. 3 %) estimated that the trend of transhumance has been increasing due to feed shortage (50. 4 %), expansion of crop cultivation (27. 4 %) and increasing cattle population (21. 2 %) in the highlands. Human population has also been increasing both in the highlands and lowlands, and the current infrastructure development in the lowlands (tarmac road, electricity, phone etc.) will further encourage more migration to the lowlands. The conflict over resources will intensify, probably leading to the demise of this production system unless alterative development strategies, such as intensification of the production system in the highlands and development of feed conservation and marketing in the lowlands are devised.
