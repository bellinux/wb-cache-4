There was wild {{excitement}} {{because they had to}} cross a little bridge to get into the front garden. But they loved the house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow on one side, and immense expanse of land patched in white barley, <b>yellow</b> <b>oats,</b> red wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching level to the sky.|$|E
60|$|Harvest had {{commenced}} at the Range, and the clashing binders {{were moving}} through the grain when Hawtrey sat one afternoon in Wyllard's room. It was about five o'clock, and every man belonging to the homestead was toiling, bare-armed and grimed with dust, among the <b>yellow</b> <b>oats,</b> but Hawtrey {{sat at a table}} gazing with a troubled face at the litter of papers in front of him. He wore a white shirt and store clothes, which was distinctly unusual in case of a Western farmer at harvest time, and Edmonds, the mortgage-jobber, leaned back in a big chair quietly watching him.|$|E

60|$|That was all Deringham saw {{at first}} sight, but he {{realized}} that it was very beautiful, and then commenced to note details with observant eyes. There was a sawmill beside the river, for he could faintly hear a strident scream and see the blue smoke drifting in gauzy wisps across the hill. The square log-house which stood some little distance from the lake looked well built and substantial, and the road that wound through the green oblong had been skilfully laid with rounded strips sawn off the great fir-trunks. Sleek cattle stood apparently ready for dispatch in a corral, the <b>yellowing</b> <b>oats</b> beyond them were railed off by a six-foot fence, and behind the rows of sawn-off stumps which ringed about the clearing great trunks and branches lay piled in the confusion of the slashing. Deringham was not a farmer, but {{he was a man of}} affairs, and all he saw spoke to him of prosperity that sprang from strenuous energy and administrative ability.|$|R
60|$|It {{was summer}} {{in the land of}} Denmark, and though for most of the year the country looks flat and ugly, it was {{beautiful}} now. The wheat was <b>yellow,</b> the <b>oats</b> were green, the hay was dry and delicious to roll in, and from the old ruined house which nobody lived in, down {{to the edge of the}} canal, was a forest of great burdocks, so tall that a whole family of children might have dwelt in them and never have been found out.|$|R
6000|$|Their {{carriage}} {{had climbed}} from Carlsbad in long irregular curves to the breezy upland where the great highroad to Prague ran through fields of harvest. They had come by heights and slopes of forest, where the serried stems {{of the tall}} firs showed brown and whitish-blue and grew straight as stalks of grain; and now on either side the farms opened under a sky of unwonted cloudlessness. Narrow strips of wheat and rye, which the men were cutting with sickles, and the women in red bodices were binding, alternated with ribands of <b>yellowing</b> <b>oats</b> and grass, and breadths of beets and turnips, with now and then lengths of ploughed land. In the meadows the peasants were piling their carts with heavy rowen, the girls lifting the hay on the forks, and the men giving themselves the lighter labor of ordering the load. From the upturned earth, where there {{ought to have been}} troops of strutting crows, a few sombre ravens rose. But they could not rob the scene of its gayety; it smiled in the sunshine with colors which vividly followed the slope of the land till they were dimmed in the forests on the far-off mountains. Nearer and farther, the cottages and villages shone in the valleys, or glimmered through the veils of the distant haze. Over all breathed the keen pure air of the hills, with a sentiment of changeless eld, which charmed March, back to his boyhood, where he lost the sense of his wife's presence, and answered her vaguely. She talked contentedly on in the monologue to which the wives of absent-minded men learn to resign themselves. They were both roused from their vagary by the voice of General Triscoe. He was handing back the folded newspaper to Stoller, and saying, with a queer look at him over his glasses, [...] "I should like to see what your contemporaries have to say to all that." ...|$|R
60|$|The little {{hamlet of}} Pine {{lay on the}} last level of sparsely timbered forest. A road, running {{parallel}} with a dark-watered, swift-flowing stream, divided the cluster of log cabins from which columns of blue smoke drifted lazily aloft. Fields of corn and fields of <b>oats,</b> <b>yellow</b> in the sunlight, surrounded the village; and green pastures, dotted with horses and cattle, reached away to the denser woodland. This site {{appeared to be a}} natural clearing, for {{there was no evidence of}} cut timber. The scene was rather too wild to be pastoral, but it was serene, tranquil, giving the impression of a remote community, prosperous and happy, drifting along the peaceful tenor of sequestered lives.|$|R

"Far back, in {{the very}} old times, Caballeros," [...] said Maruja, {{standing}} by the table in mock solemnity, and rapping upon it with her fan, [...] "this place was {{the home of the}} coyote. Big and little, father and mother, Senor and Senora Coyotes, and the little muchacho coyotes had their home in the dark canada, and came out over these fields, <b>yellow</b> with wild <b>oats</b> and red with poppies, to seek their prey. They were happy. For why? They were the first; they had no history, you comprehend, no tradition. They married as they liked" [...] (with a glance at Carroll), [...] "nobody objected; they increased and multiplied. But the plains were fertile; the game was plentiful; it was not fit that it should be for the beasts alone. And so, in the course of time, an Indian chief, a heathen, Koorotora, built his wigwam here." ...|$|R
40|$|A granola-type, omega- 3 -rich {{breakfast cereal}} {{prototype}} was developed using ground flaxseed {{as the principal}} source of linolenic acid (1. 8 % w/w). Other ingredients included rolled <b>oats,</b> <b>yellow</b> sugar, honey, sliced almonds, and canola oil. The focus of the research investigation was to apply and study the addition of an antioxidant (AO) {{and the use of}} Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) on shelf-life extension of the enriched cereal. Granola samples, both with and without AO (300 ppm of 70 % mixed tocopherols), were packaged in air, and under the two atmospheres achieved by nitrogen flushing (MA 1) and an oxygen scavenger (MA 2). Samples were stored at either 21 or 35 °C. Shelf-life was terminated when products reached a thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value of 4. 0 mg malonaldehyde/kg corresponding to a sensory score of 5 (on a hedonic scale of 10).

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia de Sistemas Bioenergéticos - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe use {{of fossil}} fuels has come along {{in recent years to}} foster a growing concern, not only related to {{environmental}} issues but also due to problems that the energy dependence from outside sources can cause to national economies. As an alternative to fossil fuels, many alternative energy sources have been studied, being the renewables those that have aroused most interest, especially due to its ecological character. In the field of renewable energy there are several forms to produce energy, being this variance the result of using different sources - wind, solar radiation, ocean waves, underground heat, dams or biomass. This diversification allows us to find solutions to the most varied needs, portending a future in which energy is produced from this mix of renewable energy solutions. The aim of this work was to study five different raw materials with potential use for the production of biogas through the process of anaerobic digestion. We used three agricultural substrates (<b>oats,</b> <b>yellow</b> lupine and oilseed radish) and two WWTP sludge (from fish and vegetables processing industry). The <b>oats</b> and <b>yellow</b> lupine produced about 400 m 3 of CH 4 /ton SV, values very close to or even higher than those reported in the literature. The sludge from fish processing industry reached values close to 700 m 3 of CH 4 /ton SV...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{literature}} thesis includes articles and publications dedicated {{to the topic of}} the digestive tract, the issue of measuring the digestibility of horse nutriens, characteristics and nutritional values of the yellow oat (Avena sativa), black oat (Avena strigosa) and hay. The practical part is devoted to comparing the nutritional values and digestibility of <b>yellow</b> and black <b>oats</b> in the ration using yellow or black with oat hay The experiment was conducted on six horses borrowed from the Academic riding club in Prague - Suchdol in February 2016. The preparatory period was 5 days, and sampling of faeces took place fifth morning after the morning feeding. Three pairs were created out of the six horses. The first pair formed gelding breed, Czech warmblood, who were housed in the inner box stable. The second pair formed a Haflinger gelding breed housed in an outdoor box. The third pair formed a Hucul gelding breed and welsh cob, housed in an outdoor box. One of the horses from an experimental pair was fed oat hulls and other horse was fed black varieties oats Raven. Rations was the same for both of the horses and both experimental animals also received the same amount of roughage. Digestibility coefficient was found {{at the base of the}} marker method using indicator lignin. The chemical analysis of determination of dry matter and ash, crude fiber (CF), neutral - detergent fiber (NDF), acid - detergent fiber ADF and acid - detergent lignin (ADL), crude fat and calculated using nitrogen-free substances process colors (BNLV) and organic matter (OH) were performed. Among the experimental pairs there was no statistically significant difference. Therefore, the hypothesis about differences in nutritional and dietetic value of oat and black oat was rejected...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a typical}} Irish stone tower mill, with a {{moveable}} cap turned {{by means of an}} automatic fantail, ensuring that the sails always faced into the wind. When the wind blows directly onto the sails the blades or vanes of the fantail are not moved. However, if the wind veers, it catches the blades and the whole cap turns on an iron ring or ‘curb’, bringing the sails back into the wind. As well as the ground floor the mill has three storeys - a ‘drive’ floor, ‘stone’ floor and ‘hopper’ floor, from the first to third level respectively. The rotating cap sits above the hopper floor. Three pairs of millstones sit at the ‘stone’ floor - one set for making wheatmeal, one for shelling the grains of corn (a process which separated the useless ‘hulls’ from the valuable ‘seeds’ or grain) and a set for grinding grains into oatmeal. The power of the wind is transmitted back from the sails or ‘sweeps’ by means of the central ‘windshaft’ passing back into the cap. On the inner end of the rotating windshaft is the ‘brake wheel’ which drives a bevel gearwheel or ‘wallower’ perched on top of the main (vertical) driveshaft. This power turns the three sets of grinding stones below. The sails would have been covered with canvas sailcloth. The amount of sailcloth used determined the amount of power and this would have been adjusted from within the cap, even while the sails were turning, to suit the particular grinding requirements at any given time. Ballycopeland produced oatmeal and wheatmeal for human consumption, as well as animal feed such as shelled and bruised <b>oats,</b> <b>yellow</b> meal (from maize), kibbled (crushed) grain for poultry and ground peas and beans.|$|R
