500|$|In August 2007, Microsoft {{issued its}} Game Content Usage Rules, a license {{intended}} {{to address the}} legal status of machinima based on its games, including the Halo series. Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who will tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E
500|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} are two important themes in Little Busters!. The opening {{video of the}} visual novel starts with two lines written in English: [...] "What 'Adolescence' do you have?" [...] and [...] "Do you remember 'Childhood'?". Riki Naoe, the male protagonist, has four childhood friends with whom he grew up together through adolescence and still hangs out with when the story begins. Thus, friendship is another theme presented {{in the form of}} Riki's relationships with his friends in high school, and is thought to be irreplaceable. The opening video of the original visual novel contains a third line written in English, [...] "The irreplaceable one existed there," [...] though another line was added into the opening video of Little Busters! Ecstasy: [...] "This will remind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to recollect 'Adolescence'." ...|$|E

500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas [...] "we told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here." [...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

So choose what you want.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Runner {{up of the}} {{eleventh}} series, Vana Koutsomitis criticized the living conditions that candidates live in; granted they are accommodated in a lavish house, Vana claimed that the bosses impose living conditions similar to Big Brother - with strict rules and zero contact with outsiders. She said [...] "They just throw you into a house and tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no phone, no internet and you’ll have no {{contact with the outside}} world, You can only talk to your family once a week for 10 minutes and that’s monitored. And we weren’t allowed to go to Boots to grab something. We had to be monitored and guided there." [...] She continued; [...] "I think that element of cabin fever and psychological torture is not necessary for a business competition. I don’t believe that you need to isolate people. I think you can gauge people’s business skills without putting them in that environment.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{found in}} [...] {{support for the}} proverb that if a person tells <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a donkey's ears, do not believe it, but if two tell it to you, order a halter. For Abraham called Hagar Sarai's servant {{the first time in}} [...] saying, [...] "Behold, your maid is in your hand." [...] And then the angel called Hagar Sarai's servant the second time in [...] saying, [...] "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid." [...] Thus, {{thereafter}} in [...] Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai." [...] Similarly, Rava asked Rabbah bar Mari where Scripture supports the saying of the Rabbis that if your neighbor (justifiably) calls you a donkey, you should put a saddle on your back (and not quarrel to convince the neighbor otherwise). Rabbah bar Mari replied that the saying found support in [...] where first the angel calls Hagar [...] "Sarai's handmaid," [...] and then Hagar acknowledged that she was Sarai's servant, saying, [...] "I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.".

2500|$|In May 1978, the Bloomingdale, Illinois Police Department {{received}} an anonymous letter. The letter stated, [...] "This letter is to inform <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{a couple in}} your town who strictly make their living on selling drugs. They are Sue and Lance Gates, who live on Greenway, off Bloomingdale Rd. in the condominiums. Most of their buys are done in Florida. Sue, his wife, drives their car to Florida, where she leaves it to be loaded up with drugs, then Lance flies down and drives it back. Sue flies back after she drops the car off in Florida. May 3 she is driving down there again and the car back he has the trunk loaded with over $100,000.00 in drugs. Presently they have over $100,000.00 worth of drugs in their basement. They brag about the fact they never have to work, and make their entire living on pushers. I guarantee, if you watch them carefully you will make a big catch. They are friends with some big drug dealers who visit their house often." ...|$|E

It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know...you decide." ...|$|E
