5|$|Anne was {{recalled}} {{to marry}} her Irish cousin, James Butler, {{a young man who}} was several <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> and who was living at the English court, in an attempt to settle a dispute over the title and estates of the Earldom of Ormond. The 7th Earl of Ormond died in 1515, leaving his daughters, Margaret Boleyn and Anne St Leger, as co-heiresses. In Ireland, the great-great-grandson of the 3rd earl, Sir Piers Butler, contested the will and claimed the Earldom himself. He was already in possession of Kilkenny Castle – the ancestral seat of the earls. Sir Thomas Boleyn, being the son of the eldest daughter, felt the title belonged to him and protested to his brother-in-law, the Duke of Norfolk, who spoke to King Henry about the matter. Henry, fearful the dispute could be the spark to ignite civil war in Ireland, sought to resolve the matter by arranging an alliance between Piers's son, James, and Anne Boleyn. She would bring her Ormond inheritance as dowry and thus end the dispute. The plan ended in failure, perhaps because Sir Thomas hoped for a grander marriage for his daughter or because he himself coveted the titles. Whatever the reason, the marriage negotiations came to a complete halt. James Butler later married Lady Joan Fitzgerald, daughter and heiress of James FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Desmond and Amy O'Brien.|$|E

25|$|A {{native of}} Chicago, Illinois, the {{diminutive}} Ziegler {{was the daughter}} of Frank Siegler and Mae (née Connal) Ziegler. At a very early age, she played baseball in Chicago. In 1933 her family had to relocate to the Los Angeles, California, due to the economic depression. Her father had been a linotype operator in Chicago, but went into different work after moving to California, while her mother was a housewife and an avid bridge player. Ziegler had a brother, Frank, who was three <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> <b>she.</b> At that time in California girls were not allowed to participate in interscholastic sports, except tennis. As expected, Ziegler expressed disappointment over very little organized women's school sport in her new home, but she recalled that various girls athletic associations in the Los Angeles area provided compensation, as her hectic later teenage years involved memberships on several softball, basketball and speedball teams. In the late 1930s, she joined the Goodrich Silvertown, a prestigious softball club sponsored by B. F. Goodrich Company, one of the largest tire and rubber manufacturers in the world. In 1939 she helped her team win another Southern California Championship.|$|E

He was the managing editor when he left the paper in 1952. The couple met while Bazy was running the Times-Herald, but Robert McCormick, Bazy's uncle and owner of the newspaper, considered Garvin Tankersley to be of unsuitable social status for Bazy because [...] "Tank" [...] was from a poor Lynchburg, Virginia, family. [...] McCormick also disapproved of her divorce. [...] Bazy saw the latter stance as hypocritical, given McCormick's own complicated personal life. McCormick's attempts to end the relationship ultimately prompted the couple to elope, and the Tankersleys were married for 45 years until Garvin's death in 1997.|$|E

Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at Child's Bank. [...] It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: [...] "How can you and I live upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [...] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever?" ...|$|E

[...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let Me Stop You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E

Gerald, Lord Berners used her as the basis of a character in his novel Far From the Madding War (1941), while photographer Cecil Beaton, 16 years her senior, treated her as a special confidante and introduced her to the reclusive Swedish actress Greta Garbo. The journalist and author Sofka Zinovieff has claimed that, after her grandmother, Jennifer Fry (of the Fry's chocolate family), separated in 1944 from her grandfather, Robert Heber-Percy, who was Lord Berners' closest friend, Clarissa and Cecil Beaton amused themselves by riffling through underclothes and love letters that Jennifer had left in a drawer at Berners' country home, Faringdon House, in Oxfordshire. A few years' later, while working at Contact, Clarissa became friends with the writer and journalist Alan Ross, who subsequently married Jennifer Fry.|$|E
