500|$|Beginning in 2005, Thompson {{supported}} {{a campaign to}} discourage Take-Two’s subsidiary, Rockstar Games, from releasing a game called Bully, in which, according to Thompson, [...] "what you are in effect doing is rehearsing <b>your</b> <b>physical</b> revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by. And then you, like Klebold and Harris in Columbine, become the ultimate bully." [...] According to Thompson, the game [...] "shows you how to—by bullying—take over your school. You punch people; you hit them with sling shots; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets. There's white-on-black crime in the game. You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats. It's absolutely nuts." [...] Thompson sued Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Target, Circuit City, GameStop, and Toys 'R' Us, seeking an order to bar the game’s release. He also participated in a protest at Rockstar's office that also included students from Peaceaholics, a Washington, D.C. mentoring organization. Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game. In March 2006, a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game, but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors.|$|E

The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to <b>your</b> <b>physical</b> health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. However, the footage was too costly to procure from Paramount Pictures, and producer Niki Marvin approached The Shawshank Redemptions domestic distribution rights-holder Columbia Pictures, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was Gilda.|$|E
