40|$|PURPOSE: We {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} heated wire humidifiers (HWHs), which should avoid water condensation in the circuit. METHODS: We evaluated the efficiency of 3 HWHs, MR 850 (Fisher & Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), CONCHATHERM IV (Hudson RCI, Temecula, Calif), and DAR HC 2000 (Mallinckrodt DAR, Mirandola, Italy), in comparison {{with that of the}} MR 730 heated humidifier (HH), which has a standard circuit. We measured gas temperature and absolute humidity (AH) at the <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> of the ventilatory circuit using a test lung ventilated at 2 minute ventilation volumes (5 and 15 L/min). Temperature levels at the <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> of the ventilatory circuit of the HHs were set at 35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 39 degrees C with different gradients (- 2 degrees C, 0 degrees C, and + 2 degrees C) between the outlet chamber and the <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> of the ventilatory circuit. RESULTS: At the set temperature levels of 35 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 39 degrees C with a gradient of 0 degrees C, the MR 850 and CONCHATHERM IV had lower gas temperature and AH levels as compared with the DAR HC 2000 and MR 730 HH. With increasing temperature gradient, gas temperature increased only with the CONCHATHERM IV but AH increased with all the HWHs. The MR 850 showed lower gas temperature and AH levels as compared with CONCHATHERM IV. The condensate was abolished inside the inspiratory circuit with the HWHs. CONCLUSIONS: Heated wire humidifiers eliminate water condensation but present significant differences in gas temperature and AH levels that are lower than the expected setting...|$|E

In the epidemiologic investigation of the outbreak caused by A. baumannii, environmental sampling and screening of all health care workers revealed the same species from the <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> of a mechanical ventilator and the hands of two health care personnel.

40|$|Background: Tube {{resistance}} and apparatus dead space are essential parameters of an endotracheal tube (ETT). They are inversely correlated and {{may result in}} impaired gas exchange in the ventilation of premature infants. In 2003, Kolobow and his research team developed an ultrathin-wall, two-stage, twin endotracheal tube (UTTS-T-ETT). This tube’s increased internal diameter and integrated <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> separating the inspiratory and expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit reduce both tube {{resistance and}} dead space. However, by inserting the <b>Y</b> <b>piece</b> use of a conventional in-line flow sensor for volume monitoring is no longer possible. The aim of this doctoral thesis was - based on an in-vitro and an in-vivo study - to investigate {{the superiority of the}} UTTS-T-ETT compared with standard ETT with connected flow sensor in terms of tube resistance and dead space. Methods: Tube resistances of the UTTS-T-ETT and of the standard ETT (Portex, Vygon and Mallinckrodt) were investigated by ventilating a lung model (50 ml bellows; compliance 0. 6 ml/kPa) at a respirator flow of 6 l/min and 8 l/min. The tubes including ETT connector had a standardized length of 12. 6 cm. The impact of the UTTS-T-ETT’s dead space reduction on gas exchange, compared with a conventional ventilation system, was analyzed in a crossover trial in 14 tracheotomized surfactant depleted piglets (aged < 12 hours; body weight 705 g to 1200 g). The animals were ventilated alternately for 15 minutes by either a standard ventilation system or the UTTS-T-ETT. In both systems the internal diameter of the ETT was 3. 6 mm. Compared with the dead space of the UTTS-T-ETT (1. 34 ml), the dead space of the standard ventilation system (3. 0 ml) was more than twice the size. Results: Within the in-vitro study the UTTS-T-ETT showed the lowest tube resistance at 98. 25 ± 0. 43 cmH 2 O/l/s and 102. 63 ± 0. 86 cmH 2 O/l/s at a respirator flow of 6 l/min and 8 l/min, respectively. Contrary to previous publications the tube resistances of the standard ETT were hardly higher than those of the UTTS-T-ETT. The deviations were < 7 % at 6 l/min and < 6 % at 8 l/min. Within the in-vivo study a statistically significant improvement in gas exchange was only evident in the smaller animals (body weight < 900 g) when using the UTTS-T-ETT. In this weight group paCO 2 was decreased by 11 % (p< 0. 01) whereas the decline in paCO 2 showed a positive correlation with the paCO 2 baseline (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, paO 2 increased by 8. 7 % (p< 0. 05) and SaO 2 by 2. 2 % (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: The investigations showed that compared with the standard ETT with connected flow sensor the UTTS-T-ETT allows reducing both tube resistance and apparatus dead space. However, in the animal model studied the impact on gas exchange was low and therefore the current concomitant loss of volume monitoring seems not to be justified...|$|E

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{describes the}} experience of our team in developing a flow-triggered nasal respiratory support for the neonate and its related clinical applications. Although mechanical ventilation (MV) via an endotracheal tube has undoubtedly led to improvement in neonatal survival in the last 40 years, the prolonged use of this technique may predispose the infant {{to the development of}} many possible complications, first of all, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Avoiding mechanical ventilation is thought to be a critical goal, and different modes of non invasive respiratory support may reduce the intubation rate: nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP), nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and its more advantageous form, synchronized nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (SNIPPV). SNIPPV was initially performed by a capsule placed on the baby’s abdomen. To overcome the disadvantages of the abdominal capsule, our team decided to create a flow-sensor that could be interposed between the nasal prongs and the <b>Y</b> <b>piece.</b> Firstly we developed a hot-wire flow-sensor to trigger the ventilator and we showed that flow-SNIPPV can support the inspiratory effort in the post-extubation period more effectively than NCPAP. But, although accurate, the proper functioning of the hot-wire flow-sensor was easily compromised by secretions or moisture, and therefore we started to use as flow-sensor a simpler differential pressure transducer. In a following trial using the new device, we were able to demonstrate that flow-SNIPPV was more effective than conventional NCPAP in decreasing extubation failure in preterm infants who had been ventilated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). More recently we used flow-SNIPPV as the primary mode of ventilation, after surfactant replacement, reducing MV need and favorably affecting short-term morbidities of treated premature infants. We also successfully applied SNIPPV to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP). Finally, we developed a new shaped flow-sensor, which is smaller and lighter of the previous one and its reliability was tested using a simulated neonatal model.   Proceedings of the 9 th International Workshop on Neonatology · Cagliari (Italy) · October 23 rd - 26 th, 2013 · Learned lessons, changing practice and cutting-edge research </p...|$|E

Med sedacijo bolnika z uporabo tekočega hlapnega anestetika lahko v brizgalki nastane plinski mehurček in zaradi njega pojav autopumpinga. Namen raziskave je bil preučiti, kako izpostavljenost tekočega anestetika viru toplote, način shranjevanja hlapnega anestetika, prisotnost plinskega mehurčka v ACD-brizgalki in gravitacija vplivajo na pojav autopumpinga. Dodatno smo želeli ugotoviti, kako dihalni minutni volumni (MV), predvsem enkratni dihalni volumen (Vt), in hitrost pretoka tekočega anestetika vplivajo na izgube hlapnega anestetika iz dihalnega sistema pri uporabi ACD. Metode: Pojav autopumpinga z uporabo ACD-sistema smo testirali {{in vitro}} na štirih različnih skupinah brizgalk z dvema hlapnima anestetikoma (izofluran in sevofluran) : hlapni anestetik, shranjen na sobni temperaturi ali temperaturi hladilnika, z ali brez prisotnosti plinskega mehurčka v brizgalki. Tekoči hlapni anestetik smo v ACD-sistem dovajali s pomočjo infuzijske črpalke s konstantno hitrostjo pretoka in ga ogrevali postopoma, dokler na površini brizgalke nismo dosegli {{temperature}} 50 °C. Vpliv gravitacije smo testirali ločeno, pri višinah infuzijske črpalke ± 30 cm in ± 60 cm glede na višino ACD-sistema. Med eksperimentom smo opazovali spremembe v koncentracijah hlapnega anestetika v izdihanem zraku (Fet, v vol %). Za ugotavljanje izgub hlapnega anestetika skozi filter ACD-sistema smo dodatni analizator dihalne zmesi umestili na ekspiratorno cev dihalnega sistema takoj za Y-konektom. Rezultati: Do autopumpinga je prišlo le v skupinah z začetnim plinskim mehurčkom, pri obeh hlapnih anestetikih. V teh primerih so se vrednosti Fet povečevale z naraščanjem velikosti plinskega mehurčka (ΔFet pri izofluranu = + 2, 5 – 4, 2 vol %pri sevofluranu = + 0, 9 – 2, 3 vol %). V skupinah brez začetnega plinskega mehurčka so pri obeh hlapnih anestetikih vrednosti Fet ostale stabilne med celotnim eksperimentom (ΔFet = + 0, 1 – 0, 3 vol %). S spremembo višine infuzijske črpalke so se vrednosti Fet le prehodno spreminjale za ± 0, 1 vol %. Izgube hlapnega anestetika iz dihalnega sistema so bile pri vrednostih Fet 0, 9 vol % minimalne (0, 9 vol %, pa so izgube naraščale v odvisnosti od hitrosti pretoka tekočega anestetika in Vt. Zaključki: Na pojav autopumpinga vplivata predvsem izpostavljenost tekočega anestetika viru toplote in prisotnost plinskega mehurčka v ACD-brizgalki. Zatorej je potrebno pred pričetkom sedacije z ACD-sistemom iz brizgalke odstraniti vse vidne plinske mehurčke in odstraniti vire toplote. Na izgube hlapnega anestetika iz dihalnega sistema vplivajo zlasti vrednosti Fet in MV oz. Vt. Introduction: During inhalational sedation with the AnaConDaTM (ACD, Sedana Medical, Uppsala, Sweden) system, certain technological factors can affect its performance. When liquid volatile anaesthetic {{is used to}} sedate patients, a gas bubble may arise in the syringe, which in turn {{may lead to the}} occurrence of auto-pumping. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine how exposure of the liquid anaesthetic to the heat source, its storage mode, the presence of a gas bubble in the ACD syringe and gravity affect the occurrence of auto-pumping. In addition, we wanted to determine how breathing minute volumes (MV), especially the tidal volume (Vt), and the infusion rate of the liquid anaesthetic agent, affect the loss of volatile anaesthetics from the breathing circuit when using ACD. Methods: The occurrence of auto-pumping when using ACD was tested in four different syringe groups in vitro, with two volatile anaesthetics (isoflurane and sevoflurane) : with the liquid agent either at room temperature or precooled, and with or without the presence of gas bubbles in the syringe. The liquid agent was infused into the ACD via a syringe pump at a fixed rate and heated gradually until the temperature of the syringe surface reached 50 °C. The influence of gravity was tested separately, with the syringe pump placed at ± 30 cm and ± 60 cm according to the level of the ACD system. During the experiment, we observed changes of the expired fraction of volatile anaesthetic (Fet, in vol%). In order to determine the losses of volatile anaesthetic through the ACD filter, an additional gas analyser was inserted in the expiratory hose of the breathing circuit, right after the <b>Y</b> <b>piece.</b> Results: Auto-pumping occurred only in syringe groups in which a gas bubble was initially present, for both volatile anaesthetics. In these groups, the Fet values increased with expansion of the gas bubble in the syringe (ΔFet for isoflurane was + 2. 5 – 4. 2 vol%for sevoflurane + 0. 9 – 2. 3 vol%). In the groups without the presence of an initial gas bubble in the syringe, Fet values remained relatively stable in both volatile anaesthetics during the entire experiment (ΔFet = + 0. 1 – 0. 3 vol%). Only a small transitory change in Fet values of ± 0. 1 vol% was noted with positioning the syringe pump above or below the level of the ACD. Losses of volatile anaesthetic from the breathing circuit were minimal with Fet values 0. 9 vol% losses increased in dependence with the infusion rate of liquid anaesthetic and Vt. Conclusions: The occurrence of auto-pumping is mainly affected by exposure of the liquid anaesthetic to the heat source, and the presence of a gas bubble in the ACD syringe. Before staring sedation with the ACD system, therefore, care must be taken to expel all visible gas bubbles from the syringe and to remove any heat sources from the vicinity of the syringe pump. The loss of volatile anaesthetic from the breathing circuit is mainly affected by the Fet value and MV, especially Vt...|$|E

The aim of this study was the determination of bacterial pollution of corrugated anesthesia sets in surgical rooms. Methods: This study was an analytic-description one performed in training hospitals of Yazd city. Research sample was 440 cases provided from different parts of corrugate after completing the anesthesia period by wet sterile swabs and transferred to culture media. On Thursday, each week, a sample from different parts of tube after sterilizing with cetrimide solution was obtained. Finally, after 24 hours, culture medias were studied for colony growth. Results: Obtained results indicated that of 440 cases taken samples, 343 cases were without bacterial pollution, 71 cases (19. 29 %) had bacterial pollution of samples before sterilizing and 26 cases (36. 1 %) were polluted after tube sterilizing. Conclusion: Sampling and culturing from used equipment and tools in hospital is one of the important actions for identifying and controlling hospital infections. Obtained results from this study indicated that of 440 cases, there were 97 cases of pollution. Therefore, it is suggested that anti bacterial filters should be installed before <b>Y</b> form <b>piece</b> of tubes in anesthesia machines and disposable corrugated tubes should replace traditional tubes.

40|$|Lunar meteorites (LMs) are rocks {{found on}} Earth that were {{ejected from the}} Moon by impact of an asteroidal meteoroid. Three factors make the LMs {{important}} to remote-sensing studies: (1) Most are breccias composed of regolith or fragmental material; (2) all are rocks that resided (or breccias composed of material that resided) in the upper few meters of the Moon prior to launch and (3) most apparently come from areas distant from the Apollo sites. How Many Lunar Locations? At this writing (June 1999), there are 18 known lunar meteorite specimens. When unambiguous cases of terrestrial pairing are considered, the number of actual LMs reduces to 13. (Terrestrial pairing is when {{a single piece of}} lunar rock entered Earth's atmosphere, but multiple fragments were produced because the meteoroid broke apart on entry, upon hitting the ground or ice, or while being transported through the ice.) We {{have no reason to believe}} that LMs preferentially derive from any specific region(s) of the Moon; i. e., we believe that they are samples from random locations. However, we do not know how many different locations are represented by the LMs; mathematically, it could be as few as 1 or as many as 13. The actual maximum is < 13 because in some cases a single impact appears to have yielded more than one LM. Yamato 793169 and Asuka 881757 are considered "source-crater paired" or "launch paired" because they are compositionally and petrographically similar to each other and distinct from the others, and both have similar cosmic-ray exposure (CRE) histories. The same can be said of QUE 94281 and Y 793274. Thus the 13 meteorites probably represent a maximum of 11 locations on the Moon. The minimum number of likely source craters is debated and in flux as new data for different isotopic systems are obtained. Conservatively, considering CRE data only, a minimum of about 5 impacts is required. Compositional and petrographic data offer only probabilistic constraints. An extreme, but not unreasonable viewpoint, is that such data offer no constraint. For example, if one were to cut up the Apollo 17 landing site (which was selected for its diversity) into softball-sized pieces, some of those pieces (e. g., sample 70135) would be crystalline mare basalts like Y 793169 whereas others (e. g., sample 73131 would be feldspathic regolith breccias like MAC 88104 / 88105. However, nature is not so devious. Warren argues that LMs come from craters of only a few kilometers in diameter. If so, even though CRE data allow, for example, that ALHA 81005 and Y 791197) were launched simultaneously from the same crater, the probability is nevertheless low because the two meteorites are compositionally and mineralogically distinct. Thus, within the allowed range (5 - 11) for the number of locations represented by the LMs, values at the high end of the range are probably more likely. Mare Meteorites: Three LMs consist almost entirely of mare basalt. Two, Y 793169 and Asuka 881757, are unbrecciated, low-Ti, crystalline rocks that are compositionally and mineralogically similar (but not identical) to each other; they probably derive from a single lunar-mare location. The third, EET 87521 / 96008, is a fragmental breccia consisting predominantly of VLT mare basalt. Thus, these LMs probably represent only two lunar mare locations. The basaltic LMs have mineral and bulk compositions distinct from Apollo mare basalts. The petrography of Calcalong Creek has not been described in detail, but compositionally it is unique in that it corresponds to a mixture (breccia) of about one-half feldspathic material (i. e., the mean composition of the feldspathic lunar meteorites, below), one-fourth KREEP norite, one-fourth VLT mare basalt (like EET 87521), and 1 % CI chondrite. With 4 micro g/g Th and correspondingly high concentrations of other incompatible elements, it is the only lunar meteorite that is likely to have come from within the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT). Yamato 793274 and QUE 94281 are together distinct in being fragmental breccias containing subequal parts of feldspathic highland material and VLT mare basalt. Jolliff et al. estimate a mare to highland ratio of 54 : 46 for QUE 94281 and 62 : 38 for Y 793274; this difference is well within the range observed for soils collected only centimeters apart (in cores) at interface site like Apollo 15 and 17 [11]. Although the two meteorites were found on opposite sides of Antarctica, they are probably launch-paired. The strongest evidence is that the pyroclastic glass spherules that occur in both are of two compositional groups and the two groups are essentially the same in both meteorites. Yamato 791197 is nominally a feldspathic lunar meteorite (below), but among FLMs, it probably contains the highest abundance of clasts and glasses of mare derivation. As a consequence, its composition is at the high-Fe, low-Mg end of the range for FLMs and is not included in the FLM average of Table 1. Its composition is consistent with about 10 % mare-derived material. Similarly, the two small (<b>Y</b> 82) <b>pieces</b> of <b>Y</b> 82192 / 82193186032 are more mafic than the large (<b>Y</b> 86) <b>piece,</b> probably as a result of about 7 % mare-derived material. All Apollo missions went to areas in or near the PKT, and, consequently, all Apollo regolith samples are contaminated with Th-rich material from the PKT. At the nominally "typical" highland site, Apollo 16, about 30 % of the regolith (< 1 -mm fines) is Th-rich ejecta from the Imbrium impact and about 6 % is mare material probably derived from mare basins. Thus Apollo 16 regolith is not typical of the highlands. Among Apollo rocks, the compositions of the FLMs correspond most closely to the feldspathic granulitic breccias of Apollo 16 and 17.

Participants searched for coins set amongst a 5 m x 15 m (defined as x and <b>y</b> axes respectively) <b>piece</b> of grassland. The grassland contained natural distractors of leaves and flowers and was not manicured. Coins were visually detectable from standing height. There was no time limit to the task and participants were instructed to search until they were confident they had completed their search.

Participants' movement over space and time was recorded {{as a series of}} time-stamped x, y coordinates using a Total Station theodolite. To quantify their search behaviour, the x- and y-coordinates of participants' physical locations as they searched the grassland were converted into the frequency domain using a Fourier transform. Decreases in dominant frequencies, a measure of the time before turning during search, resulted in increased response accuracy as well as increased search times. Furthermore, decreases in the number of iterations, defined by the total search time divided by the dominant frequency, also resulted in increased accuracy and search times. Comparing distance between the two most dominant frequency peaks provided a measure of consistency of movement over time. This measure showed that more variable search was associated with slower search times but no improvement in accuracy. Throughout our analyses, these results were true for the y-axis but not the x-axis. At least with respect to the present task, accurate search for hard-to-find targets is dependent on conducting search at a slow consistent speed where changes in direction are minimised.

Rather than tracing a linear history, this project explores Catalan-Cuban connections in their multifaceted, fragmented, and shifting aspects from the 19 th through the 21 st centuries, across a broad range of expressions of culture. In my first chapter, "Modernisme Caribeny in Cuba as an Expression of Catalanitat," I show how Modernisme marked Catalan national space in Cuba and how 1898 begins a new Cuban-Catalan epoch, characterized by the development of political ideology and greater mutual influence. The second chapter, "Listening for the Revolution After the Revolution: Silence and Noise in Manuel Vázquez Montalbán's Y Dios entró en La Habana (1998)," examines Vázquez Montalbán's late <b>piece,</b> <b>Y</b> Dios entró en La Habana, in which he describes the visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba and presents unique commentary on revolution and contemporary Cuba. My third chapter, "(Re) Imagining a National Project: The Rise of Cuban Nationalism in Carme Riera's Cap al cel obert (2000)," scrutinizes mid-nineteenthcentury relations between Cuba and Catalonia and how Carme Riera (Palma, 1948) reworks this historical relationship {{in the context of the}} late twentieth century in her novel Cap al cel obert (2000). Her nuanced manipulation of the historical CatalanCuban connection reveals certain attitudes about contemporary Catalan national identity. The final chapter, "Locating the Catalan Nation in the Twenty-First Century: Immigration and Exile in Contemporary Barcelona," examines the photography of Enlloc (2005) by Juan Pablo Ballester. Ballester portrays identity in exile; however, his use of the Catalan term and his treatment of Catalan symbols depict the challenges of immigration to Catalonia in the twenty-first century. Ballester's establishment of a Catalan "Nowhere" re-enacts cultural and political conflict, even as it seeks to go beyond it. Overall, my research demonstrates how Cuba has affected Catalan identity and politics in the contemporary period in a greater capacity previously indicated by the scholarship, and moreover, that the importance to Catalonia that Cuba held in its colonial struggle against Spain has been re-imagined in literature and arts through the present day...|$|R
