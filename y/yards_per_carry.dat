For his efforts Robinson earned Big Ten Conference Offensive Player of the Week, AT ESPN All-America Player of the Week, and Walter Camp Football Foundation National Offensive Player of the Week recognition.|$|E
5|$|A {{strike by}} NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing {{time in the}} 1982 NFL season. He {{underwent}} surgery to repair a detached retina, and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record. Delaney averaged 4.6 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.|$|E

He also set a record by rushing for 8.4 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> Vick and {{teammate}} running back Warrick Dunn {{became the first}} quarterback-running back duo to each surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a single season. Despite Vick's record-setting season, the Falcons finished with a 7–9 record and again missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 against St. Thomas Aquinas High School, Robinson was {{responsible}} for six touchdowns in a single game, passing for 342 yards and five touchdowns and rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown.

5|$|In {{recognition}} of his performance despite a losing effort, Clemson running back C. J. Spiller was named the game's most valuable player. Spiller set several ACC Championship game records: most yards, most <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> most touchdowns, and longest run from scrimmage. Spiller finished the game with 233 rushing yards, more than Georgia Tech's two leading rushers combined.

5|$|McElhenny was {{a first-round}} {{pick of the}} San Francisco 49ers in the 1952 NFL Draft, ninth overall, and made an {{immediate}} impression as a rookie. His first play as a professional was a 40-yard touchdown run which had been drawn in the dirt because {{he had not yet}} learned the team's playbook. He recorded the season's longest run from scrimmage (89 yards), the longest punt return (94 yards), and the top rushing average (7.0 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry).</b> He was unanimously recognized as the season's top rookie.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's record {{dropped to}} 5–3 with a 41–31 loss to Penn State. Despite the loss, Robinson's {{offensive}} output rebounded against the Nittany Lions. He rushed for 191 yards on 27 carries (an average of 7.1 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry)</b> and passed for another 190 yards, including a 60-yard {{touchdown pass to}} Kevin Koger. With 191 rushing yards against Penn State, Robinson's season rushing total reached 1,287 yards, breaking Antwaan Randle El's Big Ten record of 1,270 rushing yards by a quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Motley {{took the}} 1954 season off and {{attempted}} a comeback in 1955 after the Browns, who still had rights to Motley under his contract, traded {{him to the}} Pittsburgh Steelers for Ed Modzelewski. In Pittsburgh he played seven games as a linebacker, but the Steelers released him {{before the end of}} the season. In his eight years in the AAFC and NFL, Motley had rushed for 4,712 yards and averaged 5.7 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> His career rushing average is still an all-time record for running backs.|$|E
5000|$|Running back John Hoffman led {{the team}} in both rushing and {{receiving}} in 1945. He totaled 587 rushing yards on 139 <b>carries</b> (4.2 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> and caught 11 passes for 198 yards. Quarterback Bud Canada completed 24 of 69 passes for 272 yards.|$|R
50|$|In the 2008 season, Jones-Drew gained 824 {{yards on}} 197 attempts, posting a 4.2 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> average. He also gained 12 touchdowns on the ground.

50|$|Barber had {{a disappointing}} 2010 {{season as the}} entire Cowboys team {{struggled}} from game one. In 13 games Barber rushed for 374 yards on 113 carries for a 3.3 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> average, the lowest of his career. His 4 rushing touchdowns were also the lowest of his career.|$|R
5|$|Motley's knees {{continued}} to bother him in 1952. While he showed occasional signs {{of his old}} form that season, {{it became clear to}} the Browns' coaching staff that he was no longer in his prime. Motley finished the year with 444 yards of rushing and 4.3 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> a career low. The Browns finished with an 8–4 record but still captured the conference title and secured another spot in the NFL championship game. Motley performed well in that matchup against the Detroit Lions, rushing for 95 yards. The Browns, however, lost 17–7.|$|E
5|$|From 1970 through 1998, the Orange Bowl Committee, {{organizers}} of the Orange Bowl, recognized two most valuable players. Following the 63rd Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech running back Ken Oxendine and Nebraska running back Damon Benning were awarded the honor. Oxendine carried the ball 20 times during the game {{for a total of}} 150 rushing yards—an average of 7.5 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> He also caught three passes for 60 yards, making him the game's leading receiver as well as its leading rusher. Benning, meanwhile, carried the ball 15 times for 96 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught one pass for two yards and returned one kickoff 23 yards.|$|E
5|$|In week thirteen, the Bears {{visited the}} Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome {{to play the}} Vikings, whom the Bears trailed 50–53–2 in the all-time series. Josh McCown was given the start for the third {{straight}} week, with an expectation that Jay Cutler would return the following week. McCown entered the game having a 65.5 completion percentage for 1,106 yards, seven touchdowns, an interception, and a 100.8 passer rating. As a result, McCown had an advantage over the Vikings' pass defense, which ranked 29th in the league with 282 passing yards allowed, while also allowing quarterbacks to record a 65 completion percentage, 40 attempts per game, and a 97.7 passer rating. Also, the Vikings allowed 31.5 points per game, the worst in the NFL, while recording only 14 turnovers. However, the Bears' defense was a weakness, ranking last in rushing yards allowed per game (145.2), total yards (1,597) and first-downs allowed (89); the defense was 31st in the NFL in <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> (4.9), first-down percentage (27.1) and 20-plus yard runs (12). Additionally, the defense allowed running backs in the previous five games to rush for 999 yards, average 5.8 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> and 197 yards per game. Adrian Peterson ran for an average of 108 yards per game in his career against the Bears, including 120.6 in the last three meetings between the two. Minnesota's rushing game also ran for a year-best 232 yards in the previous week. Cutler, Lance Briggs, Major Wright, Anthony Walters, James Brown, Jonathan Scott, and Cornelius Washington were inactive for the Bears.|$|E
50|$|By 1973, Morris {{had taken}} over the {{starting}} halfback spot and rushed for 954 yards on 149 carries, despite playing with a neck injury late in the season. His 6.4 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> average led the NFL that season, and he finished third in the NFL in rushing touchdowns.|$|R

5|$|The {{two teams}} had split their {{meetings}} 2–2 since 2004, Dallas winning in 2004 and 2007, and Chicago winning in 2010 and 2012. Among the players the Bears had to contain is Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray, who averaged 5 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> The Bears had the worst-ranked rushing {{defense in the}} league with 153.6 yards allowed per game, but the Cowboys ranked last in rushing attempts with 249. ESPN Chicago's Michael C. Wright writes that the Bears could use its sixth-ranked passing offense to attack the Cowboys' 31st-ranked passing defense, which has allowed 294.9 yards per game. The Cowboys' defense also allowed a league-worst 422 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|While {{attending}} Jackson State, Payton played alongside many future {{professional football}} players, including Jerome Barkum, Robert Brazile, and Jackie Slater. As {{a member of}} the Jackson State Tigers, Payton rushed for more than 3,500 yards, averaging 6.1 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry,</b> and set the school record for career rushing touchdowns with 65. In 1973, Payton had a school record 24 rushing touchdowns, and was named Black College Player of the Year. He won this award again in 1974, in addition to being selected for the All-American Team. Payton graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor's degree in Communications.|$|E
5|$|In the 1969 season, after a {{slow start}} and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers {{led the league in}} rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He {{averaged}} 4.4 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and its leading receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.|$|E
25|$|Sophomore RB Melvin Gordon led {{the nation}} with a 10.0 average <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> last year. He gained 144 yards on 13 carries in the game (11.1 ypc.), {{including}} a 70-yard TD run in the second quarter. That was his longest career run, surpassing a 60-yard run he had against Nebraska in last year’s Big Ten Championship game.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, after {{both he and}} Bettis were injured, Willie Parker, an undrafted free agent, had {{a stellar}} season, and Staley, in another injury plagued season, was dropped to third-string, {{managing}} only 148 yards in five games, with a 3.9 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> average. The Steelers {{went on to win}} Super Bowl XL, giving Staley his first ever championship.|$|R

5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry.</b> The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his small}} frame, Brown {{recognized}} Horvath's {{potential as a}} senior in 1942 and made him a regular starter at halfback beside Paul Sarringhaus and fullback Gene Fekete. While Sarringhaus and Fekete were Ohio State's main offensive weapons, Horvath averaged eight <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> in a victory over Pittsburgh and scored two touchdowns and passed for 109 yards in a win over Illinois in Cleveland. Ohio State was ranked first {{in the country in}} the AP Poll early in the season, but fell in the rankings after a loss to Wisconsin in October. The team won the rest of its games, however, including a 21–7 victory over arch-rival Michigan {{at the end of the}} season. Horvath passed to Sarringhaus for a 35-yard touchdown and caught another 32-yard touchdown pass from Sarringhaus in the Michigan game. Ohio State's 9–1 record put it on top of the Big Ten standings and in the final AP Poll, giving the school its first-ever national championship.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Kindt joined a backfield which {{contained}} quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 <b>yards</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E
50|$|Hunter {{received}} {{his first start}} of his NFL career in week 4 of the 2011 season against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Late in the 2012 season Hunter was put on injured reserve with a torn Achilles.|$|R
50|$|On November 25, he {{suffered}} a broken fibula {{in the fourth quarter}} on a Sunday Night Football game against the Green Bay Packers at MetLife Stadium, effectively ending his season. He ended the season, where he participated in 10 games, with 73 carries for 385 yards, with a 5.3 <b>yard</b> <b>per</b> <b>carry</b> average, after only 2 carries in the previous 3 seasons. He was eventually placed on injured reserve.|$|R
