We, first of all, provide a very brief overview of each <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> including its geographical cover and agro-ecosystem. The <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is then evaluated against its associated Resource Requirements, Tradeoffs, Effectiveness, Risks, Framework conditions, Attractiveness and its Cross Cutting relevance as far as biodiversity, climate change adaptation, mitigation, gender, and participation is concerned. This includes a ranking of each <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> on a scale of - 2 to + 2; minus indicating a negative and plus a positive impact. We also highlight cases when farmers redesigned the <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> as well as proven cases of success and additional literature sources. Resource requirements are further sub-divided into: Organic inputs; Inorganic inputs; Land, land tenure; Labour; Money, cash, loan; Time; Machinery, animal draught, other tools; Market demand; and Others. Each of these requirements is evaluated on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of the probability that absence or excess of the required item/input jeopardizes the overall success of the <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> Here, 1 means very little impact and 10 very high impact.

But they don’t come cheap. <b>Your</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is to follow Neal’s lead by building your own 4 ″ × 4 ″ system. It is funny how simple beginnings can lead you down convoluted paths of learning and discovery. About {{a year and a}} half ago, I was playing around with my automatic garage door remote control unit. I was experimenting with signal encoding at the time, and I wanted to look at the scheme used in my remote. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was trying to determine the RF frequency at which the transmitter was operating. I then built RF filters to look at signal levels and RF generators to aid in prototyping and testing. Next came RF mixing, frequency doubling, and so on. You can see where I’m going here. I became hooked on RF and all of the art that goes along with getting RF circuits working properly. Currently, all of my design-related pursuits are focused on circuits and test equipment at radio frequencies. When it comes to RF test equipment, the spectrum analyzer is the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, both new and used RF spectrum analyzers are extremely expensive. There are a variety of home-brew spectrum analyzers available on the ’Net. Some are more sophisticated than others because all of the circuit elements are built from scratch. They feature complex filter constructions, have precise PCB layouts that turn PCB traces into inductors, and include a lot of discrete components. Other somewhat simpler designs feature integrated modules borrowed from the TV/VCR tuner world. These are easier to build, but they lack sophistication and functionality. As I was browsing the ’Net for an alternative to a home-brew spectrum analyzer, I stumbled across the Maxim MAX 3550, which seemed almost too good to be true. Not onl...|$|E

RESIDENCY STATUS Your tuition rate for fall and spring semesters depends upon whether you are classified as a resident or non-resident of New Mexico. The rate for summer session is the same for residents or non-residents. You will not be considered a resident if you are financially dependent on your parents or legal guardians who are non-residents of New Mexico. If you are financially independent, you may be considered a resident after twelve consecutive months of residence in this state. You must also complete certain overt acts as explained in the admission policy. The only exceptions are for those on active military duty in the state or for those who have a Navajo census number and are living on the reservation. For details of the residency policy see “New Mexico Residency for Tuition Purposes ” in the UNM-Gallup Catalog. FINANCIAL AID Don‟t let lack of money stand between you and an education.

40|$|Thesis (M. Comm.) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Many fund {{managers}} {{who are supposed}} to have your best interest at heart have become just as greedy, have vested interests and their performance has been mediocre. Until they clean up their act, <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is to opt for an index fund, or the type that uses our money to track a stock market index, provided the initial and ongoing costs are low if you invest in shares. A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously. However, it’s often not clear to individuals which ones these are. In the absence of clarity, those index funds that are very low-cost are investorfriendly by definition and are the best selection for most of those who wish to own equities. Warren Buffet Throughout the past twenty years, investment funds have been transforming financial markets. There has been a tremendous growth in this industry {{and at the end of}} 2003 more than USD 13 trillion were invested in investment funds around the globe. In the United States, 12 percent of all money invested in mutual funds resides in index mutual funds and investors can choose from 149 index funds. Academics have researched mutual funds in depth and most are in favour of index-related funds. The reason for this is that the average US mutual fund that is actively managed does not manage to outperform its benchmark index. In South Africa, the scenario is very different. There are currently only nine index unit trusts with a net asset value of ZAR 1. 4 billion. This represents only 60 basis points of all money invested in South African unit trusts. In this study, a few factors are discussed as possible contributors to this situation, with exchange-traded funds and enhanced index fund strategies identified as the most significant factors. This study investigates whether active unit trusts succeed in outperforming their benchmark index. It provides empirical research showing that All-Share Index have been a better risk-adjusted investment over the twenty years studied. This may be seen as a reason why investors prefer enhanced strategies since they provide a premium on the index’s return, and the risk and costs are lower than for active unit trusts. Exchange-traded funds have accumulated investments of close to ZAR 6 billion since the launch of the first Satrix fund, Satrix 40, in 2001. These funds aim at the same return as index unit trusts and have significant cost advantages over index unit trusts. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Many {{fund managers}} {{who are supposed to}} have your best interest at heart have become just as greedy, have vested interests and their performance has been mediocre. Until they clean up their act, <b>your</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> is to opt for an index fund, or the type that uses our money to track a stock market index, provided the initial and ongoing costs are low if you invest in shares. A great many funds have been run well and conscientiously. However, it’s often not clear to individuals which ones these are. In the absence of clarity, those index funds that are very low-cost are investorfriendly by definition and are the best selection for most of those who wish to own equities. Warren Buffet Beleggingsfondse het tot gevolg gehad dat daar ‘n drastiese verandering in finansiële markte oor die afgelope twintig jaar plaasgevind het. Daar was ‘n aansienlike groei in hierdie industrie en aan die einde van 2003 was daar wêreldwyd meer as USD 13 triljoen in beleggingsfondse belê. In die Verenigde State behoort 12 persent van alle geld wat in effektetrusts belê is aan indeksfondse en beleggers het 149 indeksfondse waaruit gekies kan word. Effektetrusts is al in diepte deur akademici bestudeer en die meeste is ten gunste van indeks-verwante fondse. Die rede hiervoor is dat die gemiddelde effektetrust in die Verenigde State nie dit reg kry om beter as sy indeks maatstaf te presteer nie. In Suid Afrika is die omstandighede heeltemal anders. Daar is huidiglik slegs nege indeksfondse met ‘n netto bate waarde van ZAR 1. 4 biljoen. Dit verteenwoordig slegs 60 basis punte van al die geld wat in Suid Afrikaanse effektetrusts belê is. In hierdie studie word daar ‘n paar faktore bespreek wat moontlik bygedra het tot hierdie situasie. Beursverhandelde fondse en ”verbeterde” indeksfondse word geïdentifiseer as die twee vernaamste faktore. Hierdie studie kyk of aktiewe effektetrusts suksesvol was om beter te presteer as hulle maatstaf indeks. Empiriese navorsing word gegee wat wys dat die Algemene Indeks ‘n beter risiko-aangepaste belegging was oor die twintig jaar van die studie. Dit kan gesien word as ‘n rede hoekom beleggers “verbeterings” strategieë verkies wat ‘n premie bied op die indeks se prestasie en beide die risiko en koste is laer as met aktiewe fondse. Beursverhandelde fondse het beleggings ten bedrae van ZAR 6 biljoen opgebou sedert die begin van die eerste Satrix fonds, Satrix 40 in 2001. Hierdie fondse mik vir dieselfde opbrengs as indeks effektetrusts en het groot koste voordele bo indeksfondse...|$|E
