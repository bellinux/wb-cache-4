I can tell you, {{as soon as you get}} on Social Security, your disability is AIDS, and everybody knows it.” Petrelis accused federal health officials of genocide in mishandling the AIDS epidemic and said, “You locked up the Japanese during World War II, and you’ll do it again if you want to. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> talking about new treatments.” Lavender Hill Mob members also passed out leaflets that said “Test drugs, not people,” and referred to the CDC as “Center for Detention Camps.” ...|$|E

2500|$|With Henry Marshall Tory as {{its first}} president, the University of Alberta started {{operation}} in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, {{on the top floor}} of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction. In a letter to Alexander Cameron Rutherford in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up McGill University College in Vancouver, Tory wrote, [...] "If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> on a teaching basis." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then if I were <b>you</b> I <b>should</b> <b>start</b> at once. I {{will give}} you a sort of formal letter of leave in case you are {{questioned}} as you go down. You can get to Santarem to-night and to Lisbon to-morrow afternoon." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can see {{no reason}} why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>start</b> within a month after the receipt of this letter, and I shall look most anxiously for a letter from you saying that you will come, and that you will start by a sailing ship in a month at latest from the date of your writing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think, sir, that {{it would}} be best that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> at once, in the carriage, for Pointdexter. Monsieur Philip's intendant and his men will ride as your escort, but I do not think that there is the {{slightest}} probability of your being interfered with; for now that the vicomte is dead, these men--who were not, I think, his retainers, but a band of robbers whom he had hired for the occasion--will have no further motive for attacking you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{that your}} force {{has been so}} much depleted, I do not know what number of men you can put into the field. If not more than five {{thousand}} men, however, all cavalry, I think it will be sufficient. It is not desirable that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> this expedition until the one leaving Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even a week. I do not know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon as I learn. If you should hear through other sources before hearing from me, you can act on the information received.|$|E
6000|$|... "The other plan is that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> {{forward at}} once, {{so as to}} enter Saint Amboise early. Stable your horse at an inn; and order rooms, saying that you are expecting your master and a party, who {{are on their way}} to join the army. You might also order a meal to be cooked. Then you could enter into {{conversation}} with stablemen and others, and find out whether there are any castles in the neighbourhood held for us by Huguenot lords, or by their wives in their absence. If not, if there are any Huguenot villages. In fact, try and discover some place where we may leave the young lady in safety. You can have three hours to make your inquiry.|$|E

'You {{thought it}} strange that, feeling much {{interested}} in <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>start</b> at what sounded like a proposal to bring you {{into contact with the}} murdered man who lies in his grave.

6000|$|... "I didn't mean that," [...] was her retort. [...] "I {{meant that}} you were {{exhausting}} the possibilities of the language.

What I desire is that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> tonight, ride round the lines upon the flank, {{make your way}} across the enemy's rear, and return upon the other flank, {{bringing}} me news of his disposition. You will wear a uniform, and will, therefore, if captured, be safe from {{the death of a}} spy. It is probable that you will get through the lines unchallenged, for the posts are very scattered. Once through, in daylight you can outride anything which you meet, and if you keep off the roads you may escape entirely unnoticed. If you have not reported yourself by to-morrow night, I will understand that you are taken, and I will offer them Colonel Petrie in exchange." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend, if {{you will}} allow me to call you so, it is quite true that I have done this because I wished to do it. But it is equally true that to me {{it is a small}} thing--to be frank, {{scarcely}} a month's income; what I have saved travelling on that ship to Natal would pay for it all. Also I have weighed my own interest in the matter, for I am anxious that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>start</b> upon this hazardous journey of ours up country with a mind absolutely free from self-reproach or any money care, for thus {{you will be able to}} do me better service. Therefore I beg that you will say no more of the episode. I have only one thing to add, namely that I have myself bought up at par value a few of the debentures. The price of them will pay the lawyers and the liquidation fees; moreover they give me a status as a shareholder which will enable me to sue Mr. Jacob for his fraud, to which business I have already issued instructions. For please understand that I have not paid off any shares still standing in his name or in those of his friends." ...|$|E
