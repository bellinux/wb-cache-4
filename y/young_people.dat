40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the question of}} <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations in agriculture {{in light of the}} renewed interest in the agricultural sector as a viable basis for development in sub?Saharan Africa (SSA), and the perception that <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> involvement is important for the success of this project. Life choices and outcomes are affected in part by aspirations. The nature and formation of <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations therefore have direct implications for emerging visions and future models of agriculture to the extent that <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations inform the decisions they make in relation to agriculture. The article takes issue with essentialising policy narratives about rural youth in agricultural areas that obscure the diversity that exists within that group. We need to investigate such diversity and its significance for <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> aspirations. Using the case of the cocoa sub?sector in Ghana, we analyse how the differences in <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> backgrounds and experiences with cocoa influences their expectations of the role of cocoa farming in their future...|$|R
5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among children and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and {{only one of the}} trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in that trial were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper explores <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> {{access to}} and use of {{computers}} {{in the home and}} at school. Drawing on a questionnaire survey, conducted in 2001 and 2003 with over 1800 children in the South-West of England, on group interviews in school with over 190 children and with visits to 11 families, the paper discusses: (1) children’s current use of computers in the home and in school; 2) changing patterns of computer use in home and school between 2001 and 2003; (3) the impact of age, gender and socio-economic area on <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> computer use in home and school. The paper then goes on to discuss <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> per-ceptions of the differences between home and school use of computers and to address the question of whether <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> home and school use of information and communica-tions technologies (ICTs) are really ‘different worlds’. Through analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data, the paper proposes that the boundaries between home and school are less distinct in terms of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> ICT use than has previously been proposed, in particular through <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> production of virtual social networks through the use of instant messenger that seem to mirror <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> social school contexts. The paper concludes by suggesting that effective home–school link strategies might be adopted through the exploration of the permeability of home/school boundaries...|$|R

This {{is due to}} lacking knowledge of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> reasoning behind voluntary work. The ‘Red Cross visitor’ initiative in Røde Kors Roskilde is used as an exemplifying case-study consisting of a group interview with five young volunteers. The volunteers’ motivation for and understanding of their involvement in volunteerism is analyzed through concepts from Yeung’s Octagon Model of Volunteer Motivation and Becks individualization-theory. A discussion of how <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> motivation {{can be interpreted as}} sub-politics follows {{as a result of the}} analysis. The project argues that the <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> voluntary work is another form of politics displacing formal, political tasks to individualized, fragmented problem-solving...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityMuch {{is known}} in {{political}} science {{about the influence of}} sociodemographic characteristics such as gender and race on political preferences, but much of this research has ignored age {{in spite of the fact}} that age was one of the strongest predictors of vote choice in the most recent presidential elections. In 2008 and 2012, <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> overwhelmingly voted for Democrat Barack Obama, while older people instead voted for Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney by wide margins. Why might age have such an important influence on vote choice? Three theories are commonly offered. First, the age similarity hypothesis predicts that individuals will prefer candidates closer to them in age, and thus <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> should prefer <b>younger</b> candidates while older people should prefer older candidates. Second, generational replacement explanations assume that <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> who enter the electorate are more liberal than their older counterparts, and thus <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> should prefer more liberal candidates relative to older people. Third, the mainstream-insurgent hypothesis assumes that <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> prefer political candidates that are viewed as ideologically extreme and challengers to the traditional party establishment, whereas older people prefer more moderate and traditional mainstream candidates. Therefore, <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> should prefer insurgent candidates while older people should prefer mainstream candidates. I explore these hypotheses using nationally representative data sets for the period 1976 through 2008 (U. S. primary exit poll data, American National Election Study data, and General Social Survey data) and original survey data collected the week prior to the 2012 presidential election. I find the most support for the ideology and mainstream-insurgent hypotheses; <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> are usually more liberal than older <b>people</b> and <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> usually prefer insurgent candidates over mainstream candidates compared to older people. I find the least support for the age similarity hypothesis; although there were many cases in which <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> preferred <b>younger</b> candidates, there were additional cases in which <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> actually preferred the older candidate, contrary to expectations. In total, these results indicate that age is an important predictor variable above and beyond ideology and partisanship, though its effects are conditional upon electoral context.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the {{purchase}} of children's and <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature in public libraries in Austria, namely which sources librarians use for the selection of children's and <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature and which factors they take into consideration when selecting a book. The research methods have taken a combined approach that has included both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative data are collected by sending out an email-based questionnaire. First, the questionnaires are analysed, which then {{formed the basis for}} the guided interview. Afterwards, a guided interview with the librarians of the libraries in question was carried out to collect information about the purchase of children's and <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature. In conclusion, {{it was found that the}} purchase of children's and <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> literature is based mainly on assumed interests of the readers and not on pedagogical, literary, nor educational aspects. The analysis of the questionnaire showed that there is a link between the proportion of children’s and <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> literature and the size of the library. It was found that mass media, for example radio and TV are seldomly used for selecting children’s and <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> literature, while lists of recommendations, professional journals and recommendations on advanced training are often used as selection sources...|$|R
