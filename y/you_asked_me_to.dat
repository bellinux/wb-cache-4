In the course of these studies, the name [...] "Oyama" [...] was mentioned to him by several people, including Yamaguchi, and this aroused his curiosity. In January 1961, through Donn Draeger, Arneil began to study Kyokushin karate under Masutatsu Oyama. He recalled that, unlike the other karate schools he had visited in Japan (who had welcomed him with minimal reservation), Oyama's Kyokushin school was selective; on their first meeting, Oyama told Arneil, [...] "Remember, <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> train, I didn't ask you. You don't follow the rules, you out. Understand?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'As <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay, I {{was very}} pleased to do so, and always should be; but I think that now I will wish you good-bye.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> a great deal," [...] he said. [...] "The Daily Oracle {{represents}} {{a million of}} capital, it represents the life work of myself and many dear comrades. <b>You</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stake our prestige, our whole future, upon your story. <b>You</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> publicly flout the government which we have supported through thick and thin. You give <b>me</b> no time <b>to</b> consult my colleagues--I must decide at once, yes or no! This is no small matter. Monsieur Bardow!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Miss Monson, <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> use a most killing frankness! Had we {{not better}} remain under the {{influence}} of the poetical star?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nuflo?" [...] She {{spoke as}} if putting a {{question}} to herself. [...] "Is that {{an old man with}} two dogs that lives somewhere in the wood?" [...] And then, with sudden petulance: [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk to you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] cried H., [...] "I will not. Here <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop, {{right on}} the edge of this precipice, to see you roll down a stone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The general went on. [...] "You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give <b>you</b> my {{daughter}} when you haven't money {{enough to keep}} her in gowns; <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give her to a stranger--" ...|$|R

[...] "Perhaps you will believe that I mean well, when I ask if there is anything I can do for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why do <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do this?" [...] demanded Patsy. [...] "Thomas and I {{are good}} friends, and I'd {{feel like a}} traitor {{to try to get}} him to confess a murder." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then said Nqong, 'Perhaps I'm mistaken, but didn't <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make <b>you</b> {{different}} from all other animals, {{as well as to}} make you very truly sought after? And now it is five o'clock.' ...|$|R
