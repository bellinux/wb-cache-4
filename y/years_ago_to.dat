5|$|Magmatism in the Anahim Volcanic Belt can {{be traced}} {{as far back as}} 10–14million years ago with the {{emplacement}} of dike swarms and plutons as well as the eruption of rhyolite flows and breccias on the British Columbia Coast. The slow continuous westward motion of the North American Plate during the late Neogene positioned the Anahim hotspot further east at the Chilcotin Plateau where volcanic activity built the Rainbow Range shield volcano 8.7to 6.7million years ago. Volcanism then shifted eastwards, in displacement contrary with the North American Plate's movement, 6.1million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> construct the Ilgachuz Range shield volcano, which became extinct 2.1million years later. Renewed volcanic activity southeast of the Ilgachuz Range starting 3.5million years ago {{led to the creation of}} the Itcha Range, the youngest of the three Anahim shield volcanoes. The Itcha Range continued to be an area of Anahim hotspot volcanism well into the Quaternary period (2.58million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> present).|$|E

5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E

5|$|The {{fundamental}} DNA-based research {{carried out}} by Singh and his colleagues on primitive tribes including the tribal population of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, provided critical insights into the evolution and migration of humans, suggesting the out of Africa route of modern humans about 60,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> the Andaman Islands.

5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> <b>to</b> Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis to an average of about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

Tools made from Columbian mammoth remains have been discovered in several North American sites. At Tocuila, Mexico, mammoth bones were quarried 13,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> produce lithic flakes and cores. At the Lange-Ferguson Site in South Dakota, the remains of two mammoths were found with two 12,800-year-old cleaver choppers made from a mammoth shoulder blade; the choppers {{had been used to}} butcher the mammoths. At the same site, a flake knife made from a long mammoth bone was also found wedged against mammoth vertebrae. At Murray Springs, archaeologists discovered a 13,100-year-old object made from a mammoth femur; the object is thought to be a shaft wrench, a tool for straightening wood and bone to make spear-shafts (the Inuit use similar tools).|$|E

5|$|Quern stones: Quern {{stones were}} used in China at least 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> grind wheat into flour. The {{production}} of flour by rubbing wheat by hand took several hours. Due to their form, dimensions, {{and the nature of}} the treatment of the surfaces, they reproduce precisely the most ancient implements used for grinding cereal grain into flour. Saddle querns were known in China during the Neolithic Age but rotary stone mills did not appear until the Warring States Period. A prehistoric quern dating back to 23,000 BCE was found at the Longwangchan archaeological site, in Hukou, Shaanxi in 2007. The site is located in the heartland of the northern Chinese loess plateau near the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The line following the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> the present.|$|E
5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years old, with {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E

5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} there is a clear {{continuity}} from the earlier apes of five million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor to a change in their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E

He also states that Barzahl has died. Zakary and the population of Drypeak behave suspiciously. Shanti is shadowed by an armed guard against her will. She instructs the apprentice, who is not guarded, to explore Drypeak and beyond in order to discover the truth behind the colony and Barzahl's disappearance.|$|E
5|$|As early Homo sapiens {{began to}} diversify the {{ecological}} zones that they inhabited during the MSA, {{the archaeological record}} associated with these zones begins to show evidence for regional continuities. These continuities are significant {{for a number of}} reasons. The expansion of Homo sapiens into various ecological zones demonstrates an ability to adapt to a variety of environmental contexts including marine environments, savanna grasslands, relatively arid deserts, and forests. This adaptability is reflected in MSA artifacts found in these zones. These artifacts display stylistic variability depending on zone. During the Acheulian, which spanned from 1.5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> 300 thousand years ago, lithic technology displayed incredible homogeneity throughout all ecological niches. MSA technologies, with their evidence for regional variability and continuity, represent a remarkable advance. These data have been used to support theories of social and stylistic development throughout the MSA.|$|E

Excavations in Gorham's Cave have found evidence of Neanderthal occupation dated as recently as 28,000–24,000 years ago, well after they were believed to have died out elsewhere in Europe. The caves of Gibraltar continued to be used by Homo sapiens after the final extinction of the Neanderthals. Stone tools, ancient hearths and animal bones dating from around 40,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> about 5,000 years ago {{have been found}} in deposits left in Gorham's Cave. Numerous potsherds dating from the Neolithic period have been found in Gibraltar's caves, mostly of types typical of the Almerian culture found elsewhere in Andalusia, especially around the town of Almería, from which it takes its name. There is little evidence of habitation in the Bronze Age, when people had largely abandoned the tradition of living in caves.|$|E
5|$|E.V.O.: Search for Eden is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} action {{game where}} players must navigate {{a creature of}} their own design across a number of environments resembling Earth's past. The game is divided into five distinct geological periods: the Cambrian Period and the Ordovician Period of the Paleozoic Era ("The World Before Land") from 500 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>to</b> 450 million years ago, then the Carboniferous period ("Early Creatures of Land"), the Mesozoic Era ("Age of Dinosaurs"), the late Neogene period ("Ice Age"), and finally the early Quaternary period ("Early Man"). Each period has its own map screen, which is divided into various levels. While each era takes historical liberties with both its inhabitants and time frames, the player's choices for evolution are dependent on the current era of play, ranging from aquatic bodies during the Age of Fish to mammalian physiology during the Age of Man. During the first two eras you are forced to gain a new body to progress, but once you reach the Age of Dinosaurs, a side quest {{will give you the}} option to remain as a reptile, or become a bird, gaining the ability of flight. As you enter the Ice Age as a bird or reptile, you are immediately given the option to become a mammal. You can finish the game as a reptile, bird, or mammal and the outcome is still the same, only the interaction dialogue is affected by your choices.|$|E
