25|$|Sir Pelham Warner records 'according to Sir Edward, Harvey was 'showing {{off before}} the ladies on Ladies Day by endeavouring to bowl faster than ever. Poor Chandos Leigh {{had a bad}} time at long-stop and when he {{returned}} home after match, battered and bruised, his man said to him ' I beg <b>your</b> <b>pardon,</b> sir, but have you noticed your finger? Finger? Which finger? This one, sir, it's broken' Good heavens, man! Quick! Get me an arnica bath. And that was why in after-years Sir Edward often shook with half a hand'.|$|E
25|$|It {{would give}} me great {{pleasure}} to comply with his request and see you personally, but, as the military laws of my country prohibit me from going on board a foreign vessel, I regret to have to decline this honor and to ask that you will kindly come on shore, where I await you to accede to your wishes as far as possible, and to agree as to our mutual situations. Asking <b>your</b> <b>pardon</b> for the trouble I cause you, I guarantee your safe return to your ship.|$|E

2500|$|A {{separate}} sound gag {{involved a}} song Benny had written, [...] "When You Say I Beg <b>Your</b> <b>Pardon,</b> Then I'll Come Back to You". Its inane lyrics and insipid melody guaranteed {{that it would}} never be published or recorded, but Benny continued to try to con, extort, or otherwise inveigle some of his musical guests (including The Smothers Brothers and Peter, Paul and Mary) to perform it. None ever made it all the way through.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} those among them who, giving up the attempt to {{convince}} you with arguments, seek <b>your</b> <b>pardon</b> by pleading their liturgies: [...] Nothing makes me angrier, on this account, than the idea that expenses they sought for their own glory, should become a claim to public favor. [...] No-one earns a right to your gratitude, simply for having fed the horses, or paid for lavish choregies, or other largesse of this kind; on such occasions, one obtains the crown of victory for himself alone, without the least benefit to others. [...] But [...] {{to perform the duties}} of a trierarchy with flair, [...] or build walls to protect the city, or spend one's fortune for the city's well-being: those are actions for the public good, and in the interest of all. [...] These are the gifts that reveal the dedication of a citizen; the others only prove the wealth of those who made them. However, I do not think anyone ever has performed services to the State great enough, to demand in return that traitors be permitted to avoid punishment.|$|E
