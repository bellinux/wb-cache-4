50|$|The yellow-olive flatbill or <b>yellow-olive</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Tolmomyias sulphurescens) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Tyrannidae. It is found in {{tropical}} and subtopical forest and woodland in Central and South America, but over its range there are significant variations in plumage, iris-colour and voice, leading to speculations {{that more than one}} species is involved. Its plumage is overall greenish-yellow, the lores are whitish, the crown is often greyish and some subspecies have a dusky patch on the auriculars. The flat bill is black above and pale pinkish or greyish below; similar to the yellow-margined flatbill, but unlike the grey-crowned flatbill.|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of digenean found in the {{intestines}} of the steely-vented hummingbird Amazilia saucerrottei and the <b>yellow-olive</b> <b>flycatcher</b> Tolmomyias sulphurescens from the Área de Conservación Guanacaste, Guanacaste, Costa Rica, resembles members of the Prosthogonimidae in having a highly lobate ovary; an elongate cirrus sac containing the cirrus, pars prostatica, and internal seminal vesicle; no external seminal vesicle; two fields of extracecal vitelline follicles restricted to the area between the intestinal bifurcation and testes; and uterine loops occupying all available space in the hind body. The new species differs from all {{other members of the}} family in having genital pores opening laterally to the cecum, immediately anterior to the acetabular level, and markedly oblique rather than symmetrical testes. Consequently, we propose the new genus Whallwachsia for the species. Preliminary phylogenetic assessment suggests that the species is the sister group of all other prosthogonimids...|$|E
50|$|The nest {{is roughly}} spherical {{with a side}} {{entrance}} and made of mosses and lined with plant fibre; it may be built amongst mosses or dangling epiphyte roots, inside a large dead leaf, or inside or below a <b>yellow-olive</b> <b>flycatcher's</b> pendant nest. It is constructed 2-15 m above the ground. The typical clutch is two rufous-marked dull white eggs. Incubation by the female is 14-15 days to hatching, with another 17 days to fledging.|$|R
