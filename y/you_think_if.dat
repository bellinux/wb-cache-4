Elder of the Chicago Tribune said [...] "Spears {{delivers}} a performance {{with the same}} sincerity she invests into a Pepsi commercial, only this film contains twice the sugary calories", while New York Daily News writer Elizabeth Weitzma noted, [...] "Here's what Crossroads does not have: Cohesive direction from Tamra Davis, intelligent dialogue, a comprehensible plot". Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide commented that [...] "the film's mealy-mouthed messages about feminine empowerment will almost certainly fall on deaf ears, since even 11-year-olds know Spears's power resides largely in her taut torso". Claudia Puig of USA Today considered it [...] "less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip", while The Washington Post reporter Ann Hornaday said, [...] "not a music video, not yet a movie, but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney". Jane Dark of Village Voice compared Crossroads to Mariah Carey's Glitter, saying, [...] "you {{spend a lot of}} time wondering, 'Better or worse than Glitter?' <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> the projectionist cranked the volume a little you could actually sort of get into this".|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{responded to}} the media's {{questions}} about the incident at a press conference. He {{was asked about the}} pepper-spraying by a Vancouver-based comedic reporter known as [...] "Nardwuar the Human Serviette", a frequent contributor to Canada's MuchMusic network, known for his high-pitched voice and odd attire, who told Chrétien that there was a song released by a punk rock band called [...] "The Nomads" [...] (a fictitious band Nardwuar had made up) called [...] "The Suharto Stomp". Nardwuar then asked Chrétien [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> you were say 40 years younger, that you too would be writing punk songs about Suharto and protesting against APEC?" [...] Chrétien replied that he himself had protested as a student, and that in a democracy, protests were to be expected. Nardwuar followed up by telling the Prime Minister that [...] "Some of the protesters were maced." [...] Chrétien asked, [...] "What do you mean by that?" [...] Nardwuar then clarified, [...] "Mace? Pepper spray?" [...] Chrétien then stated abruptly, [...] "I don't know, these techniques did not exist in those days", which received big laughs from everyone in the room. Nardwuar simply smiled at Chrétien's joke, and the Prime Minister concluded his answer by adding [...] "For me, pepper, I put it on my plate", with a smile while pantomiming shaking pepper onto a plate. This line also received laughter. However, allegations soon arose that someone in the Prime Minister's Office or Chrétien himself gave the go-ahead for the pepper-spraying of protesters. Chrétien denied any involvement, and it has never been proven.|$|E
