[...] Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed the album in Rolling Stone, hailing it {{as a work of}} [...] "musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of 'Into the Mystic' and the fine, epic brilliance of 'Caravan' will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years." [...] Fellow Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau found the singer's vocals overwhelming: [...] "Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it." [...] Ralph J. Gleason from the San Francisco Chronicle also wrote of Morrison's singing as a focal point of praise: [...] "He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old folks in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries <b>you</b> <b>along</b> with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines." ...|$|E
