I offer <b>You</b> <b>the</b> <b>Most</b> Precious Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity of Jesus Christ, {{present in}} all the tabernacles of the world, in {{reparation}} for the outrages, sacrileges and indifferences by which He is offended.

500|$|The film {{relied on}} subtext, {{requiring}} the actors to [...] "read between the lines" [...] {{for a number}} of their scenes. Most of the sentiments are understated, and Burshtein avoided having any of the characters break down or openly become angry when pressured. Yaron described a scene between Yochay and Rivka as her favorite, saying, [...] "I think it's {{because there is so much}} pain there; it touches <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> when people feel something and try to hide it and you see it." ...|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower sent Attorney General Herbert Brownell to {{meet with}} Bricker to try to delay {{consideration}} of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. [...] However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution. [...] Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it [...] "a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non-interventionists" [...] and stating [...] "if {{it is true that}} when you die the name of the things that bothered <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her early {{songs were}} written for {{her by the}} Hori Productions songwriting team of {{composer}} Shunichi Tokura and lyricist Kazuya Senge. One of her biggest hits was her 5th single [...] "Hito natsu no Keiken" [...] ("an experience one summer"), which includes lyrics like [...] "I'll give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> precious thing a girl has". and [...] "Everyone experiences it at least once, the sweet trap of seduction". The suggestive lyrics attracted widespread press interest. The young singer was frequently asked salacious questions such as [...] "What {{do you think a}} girl's most precious thing is?", to which she replied magokoro ("her devotion").|$|E
2500|$|Hermann Burchardt, a 19th-century German {{explorer}} and photographer, {{surmised that}} the Pirate Coast deserved its designation, {{and goes on}} to claim that piracy was the main occupation of the inhabitants who were infamous for their fanatacism and bloodthirstiness. A British customs official named John Malcolm who served in the Persian Gulf area from the 18th century to the 19th century wrote that when he questioned an Arab servant named Khud치d치d about the Jawasmi (the main pirate tribe in the Persian Gulf), Khud치d치d professed that [...] "their occupation is piracy, and their delight murder; and to make it worse, they give <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pious reasons for every villainy they commit".|$|E
2500|$|Curtis replaces him, {{strongly}} {{determined to}} make his black singers household names. Curtis attempts to transform Jimmy Early into a Perry Como-esque pop singer ("I Want You Baby"), and concentrates on establishing the Dreamettes as their own act, renaming them The Dreams, changing their act {{to give them a}} more sophisticated and pop-friendly look and sound. The most crucial of these changes is the establishment of Deena as lead singer, instead of Effie. Effie is resentful of her change in status within the group. C.C. convinces her to go along with Curtis's plan ("Family"). After a fight between Marty and Curtis, Marty quits as Jimmy's manager and Curtis takes over. The Dreams make their club debut in the Crystal Room in Cleveland, Ohio, singing their first single ("Dreamgirls"). After a triumphant show, the press is eager to meet the newly minted stars ("Press Conference"). Curtis declares to Deena, [...] "I'm going to make <b>you</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> famous woman who's ever lived," [...] as the slighted Effie asks [...] "What about me?" [...] ("Only the Beginning"). Over the next few years, the Dreams become a mainstream success with hit singles ("Heavy"). As Deena is increasingly feted as a star, Effie becomes temperamental and unpredictable. She suspects Curtis and Deena of having an affair. Lorrell attempts to keep peace between her bandmates, but the task seems difficult.|$|E
