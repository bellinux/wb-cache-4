40|$|SUMMARYObjectivesLower {{back pain}} {{is one of}} the most common {{complaints}} among the general population and among health professionals. Multiple workplace-related risk factors may contribute to back pain among physicians. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain among medical residents of different medical specialties and to evaluate the relevant risk factors. MethodsA Dutch Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (DMQ) was completed by 125 medical residents. Part I concerned general demographic information, part II evaluated workplace-specific factors, and part III assessed the individual characteristics of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. ResultsThe overall prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain among residents was 56. 8 %, with 45. 1 % of men and 76. 5 % of women reporting <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. A total of 94. 4 % of affected individuals believed that their <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain was related to their current job, and 72. 6 % claimed that the onset of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain occurred after beginning medical work. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and certain risk factors, such as working in the same position for long periods, repetitive movement (bending, twisting) of the lumbar region, working in uncomfortable postures, stress, walking, and standing for long periods. However, no significant relationship was found between <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and heavy lifting, smoking, or prolonged sitting. The role of exercise as a protective factor in reducing the incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain was supported by the statistical analysis. ConclusionsThe prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain among residents is high and is associated with a number of workplace-related risk factors...|$|R

Objective: Estimate prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and describe the levels of disability amongst construction workers. Methods: 84 construction workers participated in this study. Each of them was given three questionnaires. The first questionnaire was aimed at identifying sociodemographic variables such as work and lifestyle habits. The second questionnaire was created by Monnerat and Pereira to measure the intensity of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. The last questionnaire was created by Roland-Morris to measure functional incapacity. The SPSS 18. 0 program was used for data analysis. <b>Lower</b> <b>back</b> pain was described with the Mann Whitney U test using the variables of both labor and time. Furthermore, a correlation between <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain intensity and functional incapacity was found by Spearman. Results: A higher prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain was found (71. 4 %) amongst the construction workers especially during laborious activity.

(Chiropractic) The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{prevalence}} of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain in registered pharmacists in Johannesburg, in terms of workplace and individual factors, in order to establish under which circumstances workplace and individual factors could influence the prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain in pharmacists. The sample population of registered pharmacists in Johannesburg (N= 300) was selected from the register of pharmacists of Gauteng and a questionnaire was sent to the relevant pharmacists. A total of 92 questionnaires were returned and represented a 30, 7 % response rate. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding : The prevalences of previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the intensities and frequencies of previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the location of previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the radiation of pain occurring in the lower extremities during previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the weakness or numbness perceived in the lower extremities during previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the professionals consulted for previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain; the medication administered for previous and current <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. The questions asked regarding individual factors included : age; gender; anthropometry; exercise and smoking; the workplace factors included : number of years in practice; number of hours and days worked per week; bending, twisting and lifting; static work postures and repetitive work. The results were statistically analysed using frequency distributions, cross-tabulations and the Kruskal-Wallis. Chi-squared approximation test. The results were represented by pie charts, frequency tables and cross-tabulations, and descriptively analysed. The overall prevalence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain in registered pharmacists in Johannesburg was 41, 3 %. Among other findings, the weight and build were found to be significantly associated with the respondents increased <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. Other significant findings were that respondents who worked more days per week as well as those who had an increased frequency of reaching above shoulder height at work, had an increased incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. It must be emphasised that great caution should be exercised in attempting to generalise the findings of this survey, 'since workplace and individual factors associated with the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain were based on the respondent's subjective evaluations.

40|$|Background: Little {{epidemiological}} information exists on overuse injuries in elite road cyclists. Anecdotal reports indicate anterior knee pain and <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain may be common problems. Purpose: This {{study was conducted}} to register overuse injuries among professional road cyclists with special focus on anterior knee and <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. Study Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Methods: We attended training camps of 7 professional teams and interviewed 109 of 116 cyclists (94 %) on overuse injuries they had experienced in the previous 12 months. Injuries that required attention from medical personnel or involved time loss from cycling were registered. Additional information on anterior knee pain and <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain was collected using specific questionnaires. Results: A total of 94 injuries were registered; 45 % were in the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> and 23 % in the knee. Twenty-three time-loss injuries were registered— 57 % in the knee, 22 % in the <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> and 13 % in the lower leg. Fifty-eight percent of all cyclists had experienced <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain in the previous 12 months, and 41 % of all cyclists had sought medical attention for it. Thirty-six percent had experienced anterior knee pain and 19 % had sought medical attention for it. Few cyclists had missed competitions because of pain in the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> (6 %) or anterior knee (9 %). Conclusion: <b>Lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and anterior knee pain were the most prevalent overuse injuries, with knee injuries most likely to cause time loss and <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain causing the highest rates of functional impairment and medical attention.

40|$|The lifting task is {{the major}} {{activity}} contributing {{to the risk of}} <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> injury. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the mechanical stresses on the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> during manual lifting and to analyze how people adapt to the stresses. This purpose was accomplished by approaching the mechanical stresses on the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> from three different perspectives. The effects of manual lifting tasks were measured as: the fatigued condition, the knowledge of load and the previous lifts, and effort in lifting over a constraining barrier. A biomechanical model (linked segment and rigid body) was applied to estimate the peak compressive forces at the L 5 /S 1 (<b>lower</b> <b>back)</b> joint during the manual lifting tasks. Three-dimensional locations of joint markers were digitized using a Peak Video and Analog Motion Measurement System. A strain-gage force platform was used to determine the location, direction and magnitude of external ground reaction forces acting on the feet. The peak compressive forces at the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> were insignificantly different when individuals were fatigued. Some individuals increased and others decreased when they were fatigued. Individuals tended to lift faster and bring the load closer to the body when fatigued. Individuals applied different techniques of lifting when they were fatigued. Individuals lifted and adapted differently during the subsequent lifts when lifting known or unknown loads of different masses. Lifting under an unknown condition generated greater stresses on the <b>lower</b> <b>back,</b> especially when the load was light. When lifting a light load, individuals adapted to the lifts by bringing the load closer to the body, which reduced the stresses on the <b>lower</b> <b>back.</b> However, when the load was heavy, individuals adapted the lifts by changing the lifting technique, which did not reduce the stresses on the <b>lower</b> <b>back.</b> Lifting over a constraint barrier developed greater forces on the <b>lower</b> <b>back.</b> Individuals required more flexing of the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> and less bending of the knees when lifting over the barrier.

Methods: The sample included 66 pregnant women who {{were randomly selected from}} a total of 84 patients in the waiting rooms of the Family Health Units in Cuitegí, Paraíba, from September to November 2009. An epidemiological questionnaire adapted from the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale was used for data collection. The questions about back pain, physical activity, and psychosocial factors were emphasized. SPSS 16. 0 was used for the data analysis.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible influences of saddle type on {{the incidence of}} "lower back pain" in {{a cross section of}} equestrian riders. METHODS: 108 equestrian riders completed a questionnaire concerning their riding habits and whether they suffered from <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. In particular they were asked whether they used a traditional style/general purpose saddle (GP) or a deep seated/Western style saddle (W). RESULTS: 48 % of the riders reported suffering from <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain, the incidence being higher in the GP saddle users (66 %) than in W saddle users (23 %) (P < 0. 001). Female riders had a higher incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain than males, 58 % v 27 % (P < 0. 005). When the genders were analysed separately for the effect of saddle type, males using the GP and W saddles had a 33 % and 6 % incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain respectively, while females using the GP and W saddles had a 72 % and 33 % incidence. The highest incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain occurred in the GP saddle users who had been riding for more than 15 years (P < 0. 07). The data also indicated a possible tendency for there to be more low back pain among riders using a short stirrup length. No other factors were found to affect the incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain. CONCLUSIONS: The difference in the incidence of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain between the users of the two saddle types {{may be due to the}} additional comfort, cushioning, postural positioning, and stability offered by the design of the deep seated saddle. The results suggest that, while a deep seated saddle is not suited to all equestrian activities, where possible its use should be considered because of its effect in reducing the risk of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{describes}} the playing characteristics of golfers {{who had an}} injury to their <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> {{in the course of}} play or practice in the previous year (12 months). METHODS: A retrospective survey was mailed to members of randomly selected golf clubs across Australia. Statistical methods used included 2 -sample t test to compare means of 2 independent populations and the chi(2) test to examine the association between categorical variables/factors in the study. RESULTS: Of 1634 Australian amateur golfers surveyed, 17. 6 % of golfers sustained at least 1 injury in the previous year. The <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> accounted for 25 % of all golf-related injuries in the previous year, making the <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> the most common site of injury. The golfer with a golf-related <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> injury was likely to have a previous history of <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> injury, while the injury had a progressive onset compared with an acute single onset.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} effect of yoga and {{acupressure}} in <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and functional capability in pregnant women during the third semester of pregnancy. Methods: A quasy experimental design with pretest posttest with non-equivalent control group. The research was conducted at the Community Health Center of Kalikajar I, Selomerto I and Garung I in Wonosobo regency in January 2017. The samples of this research were 42 pregnant women in trimester III selected using purposive sampling, which 14 samples assigned in the yoga group, acupressure group, and control group. A Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain level, and Oswestry Disability Index to measure functional capability of <b>lower</b> <b>back.</b> Data were analyzed using paired t-test and one-way ANOVA. Results: Findings showed that there was a statistically significant effect of yoga, acupressure, and pregnancy exercise (control group) in reducing <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain and <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> functional capability with p < 0. 05. Pregnancy exercise (mean= - 1. 43) was more effective in reducing <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> pain compared with yoga (mean=- 2. 29) and acupressure (mean=- 2. 71); and acupressure (mean=- 14. 29) was more effective in improving <b>lower</b> <b>back</b> functional capability than yoga (mean=- 6. 57) and pregnancy exercise (mean= - 13. 29).
