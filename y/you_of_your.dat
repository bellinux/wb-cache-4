500|$|The book's third {{paragraph}} {{contains a}} long {{description of the}} process and purpose behind the ritual in gambling houses whereby [...] "the law despoils <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> hat at the outset." [...] The atmosphere of the establishment is described in precise detail, from the faces of the players to the [...] "greasy" [...] wallpaper and the tablecloth [...] "worn by the friction of gold". The emphasis on money evoked in the first pages– and its contrast with the decrepit surroundings– mirrors the novel's themes of social organization and economic materialism.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. [...] "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [...] Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to [...] "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own traditions." [...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now take care of my baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the English {{translation}} of Domosławski's book for The Financial Times in 2012, the then permanent {{secretary of the}} Nobel-awarding Swedish Academy, Peter Englund, said: [...] "In any case, the “literary” in “literary reportage” doesn’t absolve <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> duty to the facts. Neither is it possible, in my mind, {{to see it as}} a sliding scale, in which you are able slowly to introduce droplets of fiction into a factual text until, at a certain point, the mixture transforms into pure fiction. No, once an element of fiction is introduced into a text everything immediately turns into fiction – maybe fiction with a strong resemblance to the real world, but still fiction." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Billy Wilder's 1954 {{romantic comedy}} film Sabrina, the Larrabee family are millionaires {{who live on}} Long Island, New York. During a party, Oliver Larrabee (played by Walter Hampden) takes his younger son, David (played by William Holden), to task for romancing the family chauffeur's soignée daughter, Sabrina (played by Audrey Hepburn), and {{neglecting}} his fiancée. Also present is Oliver's older son, Linus (played by Humphrey Bogart). Oliver to David: [...] "I'll overlook for the moment the fact that you're an engaged man and merely remind <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> marital record to date. First, that Hungarian countess, who only married you to bring her family over: her mother, her father and five brothers—all of them {{badly in need of}} costly dental repairs.... Then that Twyman girl—her family 50 years on the social register, and she has the audacity to wear on her wedding dress not a corsage but the Stevenson button!"

2500|$|In March 2014, Snowden {{spoke at}} the South by Southwest (SXSW) Interactive {{technology}} conference in Austin, Texas, in front of 3,500 attendees. He participated by teleconference carried over multiple routers running the Google Hangouts platform. On-stage moderators were Christopher Soghoian and Snowden's legal counsel Wizner, both from the ACLU. Snowden said that the NSA was [...] "setting fire {{to the future of}} the internet," [...] and that the SXSW audience was [...] "the firefighters." [...] Attendees could use Twitter to send questions to Snowden, who answered one by saying that information gathered by corporations was much less dangerous than that gathered by a government agency, because [...] "governments have the power to deprive <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> rights." [...] Representative Mike Pompeo (R-KS) of the House Intelligence Committee, and later Donald Trump's nominee for Director of the CIA, had tried unsuccessfully to get the SXSW management to cancel Snowden's appearance; instead, SXSW director Hugh Forrest said that the NSA was welcome to respond to Snowden at the 2015 conference.|$|E
