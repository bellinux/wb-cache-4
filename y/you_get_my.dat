2500|$|In May 2003, Hines {{endured the}} illness {{and death of}} her mother Esme; she {{returned}} to the public eye with her role as a judge on the television show Australian Idol from 27 July 2003. She has been described as [...] "the nice judge" [...] and has been accused of being a [...] "fence-sitter" [...] – unable to provide criticism of any kind. Hines counters such criticism with: [...] "Well, you know, I’m living it, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>my</b> drift, so the advice I give the kids is the advice I’m living." [...] The success of the program has led to further interest in her as a recording artist and in 2004 she released an album of cover versions, titled Hinesight – Songs from the Journey which featured a duet, with former Home and Away star Belinda Emmett, [...] "Shower the People". In 2005 Hines released a remixed version of her earlier hit [...] "You", followed in 2006 by Discotheque an album containing her versions of disco classics, which peaked at number 6. Hines made a cameo appearance on Neighbours in early 2007; on 18 July she was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame. In November 2007, Hines released a new album, Life and during December she toured in support of Lionel Richie. From 31 August 2008 the sixth season of Australian Idol was broadcast with Hines continuing as a judge and is the only judge to appear in every season of Australian Idol.|$|E
