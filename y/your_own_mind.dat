500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it once, then somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Elgar was knighted at Buckingham Palace on 5 July 1904. The {{following}} month, he and {{his family}} moved to Plâs Gwyn, a large house on the outskirts of Hereford, overlooking the River Wye, where they lived until 1911. Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music. He was not at ease in the role, and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the critics and on English music in general: [...] "Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined. Vulgarity often goes with inventiveness ... but the commonplace mind can never be anything but commonplace. An Englishman will take you into a large room, beautifully proportioned, and will point out to you that it is white – all over white – and somebody will say, 'What exquisite taste'. You know in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind,</b> in your own soul, that it is not taste at all, that it is the want of taste, that is mere evasion. English music is white, and evades everything." [...] He regretted the controversy and was glad to hand on the post to his friend Granville Bantock in 1908. His new life as a celebrity was a mixed blessing to the highly strung Elgar, as it interrupted his privacy, and he often was in ill-health. He complained to Jaeger in 1903, [...] "My life is one continual giving up of little things which I love." [...] Both W. S. Gilbert and Thomas Hardy sought to collaborate with Elgar in this decade. Elgar refused, but would have collaborated with George Bernard Shaw had Shaw been willing.|$|E

2500|$|In his Harmony of the Gospels, Augustine of Hippo {{produced}} a 5th-century {{attempt to explain}} away all of the apparent contradictions he was aware of. He wrote that because {{there are those who}} would [...] "rob [...] of their credit as veracious historians", [...] "we must prove that the writers in question do not stand in any antagonism to each other." [...] Whereas more modern apologists, such as Gleason Archer, in producing a book that provides explanations for many Bible difficulties, writes: [...] "Be fully persuaded in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>mind</b> that an adequate explanation exists, even though you have not yet found it." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was a silence, {{which was}} broken by the unfortunate {{representative}} of an unhappy dynasty, with some appearance of irritation. 'This is strange, gentlemen,' he said; 'you have sent for me from the bosom of my family, to head an adventure of doubt and danger; and when I come, <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> seem to be still irresolute. I had not expected this {{on the part of}} two such men.' ...|$|R

6000|$|But {{what can}} you say for yourselves, if having once had these thoughts, having once settled in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> that the Gospel of God is right and you are wrong, if you persist in disobeying that gospel--if you agree one minute with the inner voice, which says, [...] "Do this and live, do this and be at peace with God and man, and <b>your</b> <b>own</b> conscience"--and then fall back the next moment into the same worldly, selfish, peevish, sense-bound, miserable life-in-death as ever? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The very thing. You see, my {{argument}} is so clear and simple that in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>minds</b> you carry {{it on for}} me. And now for the next step.

'If {{you will}} do me the favour,' he said, holding up the green shade, and {{revealing}} an eye most horribly discoloured, 'to look at this, you will naturally inquire, in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>minds,</b> how did I get it.

"Umph," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "I don't quite {{like the idea}} of a {{projected}} marriage with my daughter, Miss de la Molle of Honham Castle, being hushed up as though there were something discreditable about it, but still there may be peculiar circumstances in the case which would justify me in consenting to that course. You are both old enough to know <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>minds,</b> and the match would be as advantageous for you as it could be to us, for even now-a-days, family, and I may even say personal appearance, still go for something where matrimony is concerned.
