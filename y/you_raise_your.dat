500|$|Scott & Bailey is {{produced}} by Manchester-based Red Production Company, which itself is majority owned by StudioCanal following an acquisition estimated at £30 million in December 2013. Nicola Shindler, who founded the company in 1998, is the programme's executive producer alongside writer Sally Wainwright and Tom Sherry. When speaking of Shindler, Wainwright said: [...] "Nicola is just a genius. She makes <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> game. So if you're good, she'll make you better".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2009, Rogue Traders {{revealed}} that Henwood had returned on guitar and Spencer had left. On 14 November, Ash revealed via Twitter {{the names of}} their new singer, Melinda [...] "Mindi" [...] Jackson, and new drummer, Peter Marin. On 25 December 2009 (Christmas Day), [...] "Love Is a War" [...] was issued as a digital download single and then, on 8 January 2010, as a physical single. It peaked at numberninety. On 12 March [...] "Would <b>You</b> <b>Raise</b> <b>Your</b> Hands?" [...] was released as the follow-up single, which reached numberninety-five. [...] "Hearts Beat as One" [...] was issued as the third single on 11 June 2011 – it had been written for the Socceroos as the official anthem for their 2010 FIFA World Cup campaign. However, despite this, the song failed to chart, the Rogue Traders' first single to do so since 2002's [...] "Need You to Show Me".|$|E
6000|$|... "Bah! Do <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> {{voice to}} me? Do you think I am of your kind, animal, to be affrighted by sounds--however hideous?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>You</b> can <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> stick {{above the}} {{shoulder}} {{to call for}} a pass.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} aspect {{to the game}} is to <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> family; choose who your daughter is going to marry and who will succeed your ruler when he dies. As {{is the case with}} any scenario, without any successors, the game is over. A strong family-oriented empire is less susceptible to revolutions. The US version of the game removed the harem subgame entirely, in which <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> <b>your</b> affinity with one of your wives, much like a dating simulation game.|$|R
5000|$|Guru Nank Dev Ji said [...] "Sikhi {{does not}} teach <b>you</b> to <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> {{hand on a}} women it teaches you to respect them" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hist! you wild buffalo," [...] he said, [...] "you'll frighten off all {{the bars}} within ten miles of us, if <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> horrable trumpet!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Adolphe," [...] he said, [...] "why do <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> sword {{against your}} friend? Don't {{you see that}} I have come as your friend: don't you see that I have no sword?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{monsieur}} is afflicted," [...] she said. [...] "Perhaps monsieur cannot speak. If that be {{the cause}} of your silence, will <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> hand, and I shall understand." [...] He sat rigid and silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "But all that's stopped now," [...] he lamented. [...] "A sailor's {{a gentleman}} these days. <b>You</b> can't <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice or your hand to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{there is}} a medium, if one could find it," [...] said Albert, {{defending}} his opinion in the same tone in which the King attacked him; [...] "so this morning, {{when you were in}} the woman's dress, <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> <b>your</b> petticoats rather unbecomingly high, as you waded through the first little stream; and when I told you of it, to mend the matter, you draggled through the next without raising them at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, then!' he said, {{speaking}} {{from the rock}} under which the brushwood grew, 'I cannot reach <b>you</b> unless <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> up <b>your</b> hand to me--your left hand--straight up. Let go. Now!' ...|$|R
60|$|Shooting Horse.--Spur {{him as much}} as you will, {{but never}} use a whip; else, {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> gun to fire, he will feel a dread that it may be the whip, and will be unsteady.|$|E
6000|$|... "You Americans are so awfully odd," [...] she said. [...] "You say <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> {{corn and}} your plants instead of growing them. It nearly makes me die {{laughing}} when I hear {{one of you}} Americans say raise when you mean grow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Fore God, this is {{a strange}} way of preaching peace," [...] cried Black Simon. [...] "You may find the scath yourself, my lusty friend, if <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> great cudgel to me. I had as lief have the castle {{drawbridge}} drop upon my pate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't stoop," [...] she said, {{taking him}} literally. [...] "I could hear {{what was said}} without that--especially what you said, Terence. <b>You</b> will <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice so on the {{slightest}} provocation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me--but {{perhaps you}} are not aware that <b>you</b> are <b>raising</b> <b>your</b> voice in a lady's drawing-room, and that {{although}} you are speaking a language no one here understands, you are disturbing the hotel." ...|$|R
50|$|Goat, the oddly named {{underwater}} sanctuary, allows <b>you</b> to <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> monster underwater. The {{waters of}} Goat are extremely high in oxygen, explaining {{why and how}} you and your monsters have no trouble living under the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "You dog!" [...] I snarled at {{him from}} between clenched teeth. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> hand to me? Am I your lord, or am I dirt of your own kind? Go learn submission." [...] And I flung him almost headlong down the flight of steps.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not minded {{you shall}} {{send me to}} a British prison, Seth Jepson, and I swear solemnly that if <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice above a whisper, or fail to run at your best pace, I'll thrust this knife into your heart with the {{certainty}} of killing you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sing you of her, O {{first few}} stars, [...] Whom Brahma, {{touching}} with his finger, praises, for you hold [...] The van of wandering quiet; ere you be too calm and old, [...] Sing, turning in your cars, [...] Sing, till <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> hands and sigh, and from your car heads peer, [...] With all your whirling hair, and drop many an azure tear.|$|E
50|$|Community and {{residential}} gardening, {{as well as}} small-scale farming, save household food dollars. They promote nutrition and free cash for non-garden foods and other items. As an example <b>you</b> can <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> own chickens on an urban farm and have fresh eggs for only $0.44 per dozen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, but----' However, as his logic was {{absolutely}} unanswerable, she merely registered a protest. 'I cannot endure those cold-blooded ways of clubs and professional players, like Staunton and Morphy. Just {{as if it}} really mattered whether <b>you</b> have <b>raised</b> <b>your</b> fingers from a man or no!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is an advantage," [...] Captain Nelson laughed. [...] "When I {{think that}} <b>you</b> have <b>raised</b> <b>your</b> hand against that venerable but {{somewhat}} truculent prelate, I shudder at your boldness. I only {{caught a glimpse}} of him as he passed, but I could see that he looks rather scared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, you may speak, captain, but don't <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice above a whisper. There is no {{saying what}} redskin ears may be near us. I guess these forests are pretty well alive with them. You may bet there isn't a redskin, {{or one of}} the {{irregular}} Canadian bands, but is out arter us tonight. The war whoop and the rifles will have put them all on the lookout.|$|E
6000|$|Yank-Yank {{turned around}} {{so that he}} was once more head down, and his eyes twinkled as he looked down at Peter. [...] "You're mistaken Peter," [...] said he. [...] "This isn't home. I've simply come down here for the winter. You know home is where <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> children, and my home is in the Great Woods farther north. There is too much ice and snow up there, so I have come down here to spend the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Creep in there, lad, {{and hold}} your peace! If <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice above a whisper, I swear that {{it shall be}} the last moment of your life! You can well fancy we would not flinch at killing such as you when it might be to save ourselves. To hold you secretly, and yet securely, is our hope, {{therefore}} bear well in mind to what lengths we are bound to go rather than allow you {{to give us the}} slip!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "----Under {{the finding}} of the Court," [...] she went on, [...] "your fate is left in my hands. I may kill you or torment your body. Or I may spare <b>you</b> and <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> head higher {{than any other in}} the Empire, aye, and adorn it with a crown." ...|$|R
60|$|Nour. Your sullen silence cheats not me, false man; I {{know you}} think the bloodiest things you can. Could you accuse me, <b>you</b> would <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> voice, Watch for my crimes, and in my guilt rejoice: But my known virtue is from scandal free, And leaves no shadow for your calumny.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You did,' said Wardle. 'I saw you do it--I {{observed}} {{you pick}} him out--I noticed <b>you,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>raised</b> <b>your</b> piece to take aim; and I will say this, {{that the best}} shot in existence {{could not have done}} it more beautifully. You are an older hand at this than I thought you, Tupman; you have been out before.' It was in vain for Mr. Tupman to protest, with a smile of self-denial, that he never had. The very smile was taken as evidence to the contrary; and from that time forth his reputation was established. It is not the only reputation that has been acquired as easily, nor are such fortunate circumstances confined to partridge-shooting.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is nothing}} very formidable," [...] he said, {{taking a long}} cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. [...] "It is an {{ordinary}} plumber's smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> cry of fire, it will be taken up by {{quite a number of}} people. You may then walk {{to the end of the}} street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you only}} would; but you don't seem to! In short I don't {{understand}} you--I give you up. But it doesn't matter," [...] {{said the old}} woman wearily, [...] "for the theatre's dead and even you, ma toute-belle, won't bring it to life. Everything's going from bad to worse, and I don't care what becomes of you. You wouldn't understand us here and they won't understand you there, and everything's impossible, and no one's a whit the wiser, and it's not of the least consequence. Only when <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> arms lift them just a little higher," [...] Madame Carré added.|$|E
6000|$|... [232] It is {{a useful}} piece of study to {{dissolve}} some Prussian blue in water, {{so as to make}} the liquid definitely blue: fill a large white basin with the solution, and put anything you like to float on it, or lie in it; walnut shells, bits of wood, leaves of flowers, &c. Then study the effects of the reflections, and of the stems of the flowers or submerged portions of the floating objects, as they appear through the blue liquid; noting especially how, as you lower your head and look along the surface, you see the reflections clearly; and how, as <b>you</b> <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> head, you lose the reflections, and see the submerged stems clearly.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it seems!" [...] Cliffe rejoined bluntly. [...] "The {{price you}} asked was high enough, and now, {{when we have}} half fixed things, <b>you</b> want to <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> terms." ...|$|R
50|$|Making up for {{the loss}} of the {{combination}} system is the ability of monsters to adapt to their surroundings. Though only one is available {{at the start of the}} game, the five different homes that <b>you</b> can <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> monster in represent five climates, each with its own training regimes, features, and food.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] she cut in, [...] "they {{accounted}} {{that you}} had been sufficiently provoked. Because you had not sworn to them as you swore to me that no provocation should ever drive <b>you</b> to <b>raise</b> <b>your</b> hand against my brother. Because they did not realize how false and how forsworn you were." ...|$|R
