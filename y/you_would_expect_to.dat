Allan Raible of ABC News wrote that the [...] "stringed fanfare" [...] is {{something}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> hear {{on the red carpet}} of an awards ceremony. Jim Farber of the Daily News called the opening [...] "classic enough" [...] for Michael Jackson. After the [...] "sweeping" [...] orchestral intro, the song transcends into a [...] "funky main section", which, according to Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph, is a [...] "sweet slice of funk-soul seduction". According to Thomas, [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] starts off like a [...] "classic Sinatra song": with a [...] "rise of strings" [...] that [...] "hit a pitch before dropping into a neo-soul sound".|$|E
500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha was {{positive}} in his review. In his opinion, the episode {{never failed to}} deliver and [...] "acts {{as a tribute to}} everything Russell T Davies put in place when he resurrected the series in 2005." [...] He described the storyline as [...] "fast-moving, bursting [...] excitement" [...] and said that it contained [...] "everything <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see from an adventure [...] all companions and a new Dalek empire" [...] and [...] "acts as the ultimate climax to four years of storytelling and will leave you with goose bumps for the full 42 minutes." [...] Blair was impressed about how Torchwood and Doctor Who crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it [...] "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband Rhys, Ianto watching The Paul O'Grady Show, and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission. Although his review {{was positive}}, he did criticise two parts of the episode: the concept of [...] "time-lock" [...] the Time War was questioned because the Time Lords were annihilated in the conflict; and he complained that the Doctor's phone number was out of service.|$|E

500|$|Friday Night Lights {{final season}} was lauded by critics. Based on 10 reviews, the season {{obtained}} {{a score of}} 82 out of 100 on Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim" [...] and it was included on numerous best lists. Poniewozik ranked it No. 7 on his list of 2011's Top 10 TV Series, saying, [...] "The final season of this drama came down, as <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect,</b> <b>to</b> a final dramatic game. But the real action was always just {{as much in the}} stands". He also ranked the final episode [...] "Always" [...] No. 1 on 2011's Top 10 TV Episodes list. Paste also named it one of the 20 best TV shows of 2011 and Slant Magazine ranked Friday Night Lights No. 10 on its list of 2011's 25 Best TV Shows, concluding [...] "The show's true concerns—obsession, class, family—were articulated beautifully as ever in the quiet, familiar relationships between a town and its team, and a coach and his wife". The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked Friday Night Lights No. 1 explaining [...] "For five seasons, Friday Night Lights was both the simplest and most complex show on TV. It felt like real life, and real life is complicated." [...] TV Guide named the show among its Best TV Shows of 2011 praising the fact that [...] "Friday Night Lights left its fans with the best portrait of a marriage ever on TV".

2500|$|Jim Shelley of The Guardian has {{described}} the character as [...] "irresistibly charming, a classic anti-hero; a modern-day Rockford." [...] Entertainment Weekly said that the character was exemplary of the funky feel of the show citing his naturalistic dialogue, soulful voice and easy rapport with his African-American work partners. The character {{has been described as}} defying genre conventions – although his actions drive several plot points he is not quite the central character implied by the show's opening or promotional material. Flak Magazine also picked McNulty as a central character and commented on the uncommon experience of having the main character fit to a standard police character archetype ("He has poor impulse control. He's personally fearless and outspoken, and he bangs babes like a hunchback rings bells...") but also exposing the archetype as self-destructive and emotionally immature. Salon.com described McNulty as [...] "The heart, soul and oft-impaired nervous system of [...] "The Wire"", again selecting him as a central character. Salon also chose McNulty's pride as his main character trait, saying that this aspect of his personality made him a successful investigator and a failure in most other aspects of his life. Entertainment Weekly picked McNulty as offering one of the show's most wicked ironies: {{he is one of the}} characters <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be on the side of law and order as a police detective but they describe him as a [...] "boozing cop who pisses on authority and order." ...|$|E

60|$|They met Nevada Warren at the station.

The [...] "Entrance Hall" [...] is a singularly chaste apartment. There is no necessity for a door-mat: people with muddy boots, it is to be presumed, were sent round to the back. A riding-cloak, the relic apparently of a highwayman, hangs behind the door. It is the sort of cloak <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find there--a decorative cloak.

The Big River had frozen over {{everywhere}} except in this one place where the water was too swift to freeze, and there Quacker had remained. You see, he was a good diver and {{on the bottom of the}} river he found plenty to eat. No one could get at him out there, unless it were Roughleg the Hawk, and if Roughleg did happen along, all he had to do was to dive and come up far away to laugh and make fun of Roughleg.

60|$|Some {{three miles}} north of where I write {{there is a certain}} small patch of tall open woods that a few hunters have known and tended for years, while others passed by carelessly, for it is the least likely looking spot for game in the whole region. Yet if there is but a single {{woodcock}} in all Fairfield County, in these days of many hunters and few birds, the chances are that he will be there; and if you do not find one there on the first morning after a promising spell of weather, you may be almost certain that the flight is not yet on, or has passed you by. Several times after flushing a solitary woodcock in this spot I have gone over the whole place to find some reason for Whitooweek's strange fancy; but all in vain. The ground is open and stony, with hardly a fern or root or grass tuft to shelter even a woodcock; and look as closely as you will you can find no boring or sign of Whitooweek's feeding. From all external appearances it is the last spot where <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find such a bird, and there are excellent covers close at hand; yet here is where Whitooweek loves to lie during the day, and to this spot he will return {{as long as there are}} any woodcock left. Hunters may harry the spot to-day and kill the few rare birds that still visit it; but to-morrow, if there be any birds in the whole neighborhood, there will be practically the same number just where the first were killed.|$|E
