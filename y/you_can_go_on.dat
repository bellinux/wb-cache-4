However, Schwartz notes that [...] "Gossip Girl became the first show that indicated that the way people watch television is changing. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> iTunes, every episode is No. 1, ahead of all these bigger shows. The streams are high, the DVR time-shifting number was something like 40%. There’s a much bigger audience for the show than the (Nielsen) numbers might indicate." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Scully, who was showrunner {{during seasons}} nine through twelve, {{has been the}} subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of Slate wrote that [...] "under Scully's tenure, The Simpsons became, well, a cartoon... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a {{tranquilizer}} dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked: [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> forever." ...|$|E

The Portland Mercury {{said the}} restaurant was a [...] "kinda retro-y bar... popular with a young college-y, drinkin', party crowd". One Portland resident described the club as [...] "the {{kind of place where}} you can go with your sophisticated friends and look at the Daddy-O decor. Or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a date and snuggle in a corner where the lighting is low. And if you want to meet new people you can stroll through there and see people whose faces you've never seen before, which is a rare thing in Portland." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite this, much of Scully's work on {{the show}} also {{received}} critical praise. Scully won five Primetime Emmy Awards {{for his work on}} The Simpsons, while Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation" [...] as the show's 22nd best episode. Robert Canning of IGN also gave the episode a positive review, something he also did for [...] "Behind the Laughter" [...] and [...] "Trilogy of Error", which aired during season 12. He called the latter: [...] "one extremely enjoyable misadventure. The Simpsons may have peaked in the '90s, but that doesn't mean the eight years since haven't delivered their share of quality episodes. This was one of them." [...] Martin said that he does not understand the criticism against Scully, and that he thinks the criticism [...] "bothered , and still bothers him, but he managed to not get worked up over it." [...] Ortved noted in his book that blaming a single show runner for what some perceive as the lowering quality of the show [...] "is unfair." [...] When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked, [...] "Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Modal jazz of {{this type}} was not unique to this album. Davis himself had {{previously}} used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the 58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition {{as a means of}} getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled [...] "thick." [...] Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, [...] "a return to melody." [...] In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop, stating [...] "No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [...] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them." ...|$|E

In August 2013, Brandon T. Jackson give his reason about the pass: I think we were very edgy for CBS. I think we were the edgiest as you could've went for CBS.
