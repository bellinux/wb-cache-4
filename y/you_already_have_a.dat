His parents were so thrown by this bizarre request that they acquiesced. Over the next six years, Fullmer proceeded to build approximately 30 guitars, craftsmanship that was both self-taught and mentored by an old country western fiddle maker named Tom. (Fullmer continued to build guitars throughout his life, but this task was relegated to hobby status while his animation career took precedence.) ...|$|E

When a kitten is introduced to a mature cat, that cat may show feline asocial aggression where they feel threatened and act aggressive to drive off the intruders. If this happens, separate the kitten and the cat and slowly introduce them by rubbing towels on the animals and presenting the towel to the other.|$|R

They go on 3 dates and then goes steady (If <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> girlfriend, this will not happen). The player's sibling tells the character to go to Chinatown to celebrate where he sees the actor once more being robbed by some thug. The character helps the actor only {{to realize that the}} player intruded the set of the actor's new movie. At the apartment, the character is given a surprise birthday party where the player befriends the friends of his/her lover. After spending the night together, the player's sweetheart prepares breakfast only to hear the actor calling the character while using seductive words. This in turn infuriates the lover and leaves the player. After meeting with the actor, the player is introduced to a famous NYC agent who gives him an offer in exchange of the player being used as publicity for the actor.|$|E
50|$|As {{the council}} {{never had much}} money to expend on works not listed on its schedule, many early deputations had to return home empty-handed. In 1902 some coastal ratepayers were so sore when their request for road works was {{declined}} that they failed to smile when Captain Tucker rebuked them with the facetious remark: “What more should you require? <b>You</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> road (he was alluding to the beach) which is washed twice a day by the Creator!” When Rua, the Maori” prophet,” applied in 1908 for better access to his settlement at Maungapohatu, {{he was told that}} he would have to provide £150 towards the cost. Wi Pere, who accompanied him, suggested that the council should deduct 2/- per day from the wages of each of the natives whom it employed on the work until Rua's share had accumulated. It was pointed out to him that the council would have to spend £1,000 before Rua's share could be raised in such a manner. As Wi Pere went off he roundly denounced all and sundry connected with the administration of the county.|$|E

Pogue praised Siri's language understanding, stating that [...] "It’s mind-blowing how inexact your utterances can be. Siri understands everything from, “What’s the weather {{going to be like}} in Tucson this weekend?” to “Will I need an umbrella tonight?”". Pogue also equally praised Siri's ability to understand context, using the example of [...] "Once, I tried saying, “Make an appointment with Patrick for Thursday at 3.” Siri responded, “Note that <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> all-day appointment about ‘Boston Trip’ for this Thursday.

5000|$|Fans and EA {{developers}} both view Madden NFL 06 as [...] "the undisputed lemon of the franchise", {{because of}} the concurrent shift from the Xbox and PlayStation 2 to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The passing cone was so unpopular that it disappeared in Madden NFL 09. Reviewers criticized the game's lack of new features and lackluster soundtrack (a recurring complaint), claiming the game plays very similarly to Madden NFL 2005 if the QB Vision cone is turned off. GameSpot gave the mobile version a score of 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "a decent game of football with a solid statistical foundation. It breaks new ground for the franchise and promises future installments for football fans. However, this edition definitely shows EA's wireless inexperience and wasn't the stunner it should have been. In particular, the game's visuals are a disappointment. If <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> V Cast phone, Madden 06 isn't {{a bad way to}} go. It's just not the killer app that forces an upgrade." [...] Similarly, IGN gave the same version seven out of ten, saying that the game [...] "was developed not internally, but by a development house called Finite Monkeys. And it ultimately feels like they were rushed to get this game on the decks by [...] "Madden Tuesday." [...] This is unfortunate, because I {{think a lot of people}} will download the game hoping to have a [...] "Madden experience" [...] on their handset, and just end up with an average football game, albeit one with above-average visuals and spoken commentary." ...|$|E

5000|$|Eurogamer's Dan Whithead {{was even}} more critical, scoring the game 4 out of 10, and writing [...] "combat {{takes the form of}} long, {{drawn-out}} dogfights between enormous spacecraft that are woefully ill-equipped for such maneuvers." [...] He was also heavily critical of the controls, the AI and the graphics, and concluded that [...] "Unless <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> emotional attachment to the Star Trek universe, and feel a cheeky little frisson down there at the prospect of pretending to be Kirk, there's no reason at all to put up with the unresponsive controls, shallow gameplay and absolutely infuriating inability to save during an hour-long mission. With the game's appeal thus reduced to those faithful fans still willing to suffer in the name of brand loyalty, it remains an impossible game to recommend without serious caveats." ...|$|R
5000|$|In his {{new book}} on the {{seemingly}} permanent financial crisis, Boomerang: Travels in the New Third World, Lewis shows again why he is the leading journalist of his generation. He writes about important matters — the most important matters — and he writes about them so amusingly that he can permanently change your point of view, even of things <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> settled opinion about. Who sees baseball the same way after his Moneyball? Football announcers seldom talked about the immense importance of the left tackle before The Blind Side.And, thanks to “Boomerang,” a collection of financial-disaster reports from Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Germany and California, few {{will be able to}} think of Germans without recalling what Lewis memorably describes as a national obsession with excrement. In typical Lewis fashion, a bodily aperture becomes a lens for seeing Germany’s role in the global debt calamity.|$|R
