5000|$|Bug Jack Barron (1969), a pre-cyberpunk {{tale of a}} cynical, exploitative {{talk-show host}} who {{gradually}} uncovers a conspiracy concerning an immortality treatment and the methods used in that treatment, was serialised in the British magazine New Worlds during Michael Moorcock's editorship. With its explicit language and cynical attitude to politicians, it roused one British Member of Parliament's ire at the magazine's partial funding by the British Arts Council. A memorable quote from this novel is, [...] "The saddest day of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> isn't <b>when</b> you decide to sell out. The saddest day of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> is <b>when</b> you decide to sell out and nobody wants to buy." ...|$|R

He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in Love Happy, the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.|$|E

However, he was also sent off against Chelsea, was the subject of death threats, and failed to turn up for training for a whole week in January as he instead spent his time with Miss Great Britain 1971, Carolyn Moore. On 17 November, he was the subject of Eamonn Andrews's This Is <b>Your</b> <b>Life</b> <b>when</b> he was surprised at a central London restaurant.

500|$|Television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman {{originally}} pitched Friends as a {{show about}} [...] "that special time in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>when</b> your friends are your family" [...] to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield shortly after their short-lived sitcom Family Album was canceled by CBS. Inspired by their own experiences as young adults living in New York City, the writers loosely based the six main characters on {{some of their own}} friends and family; Monica is based on Kauffman herself. Observing that each main character was originally written as a [...] "one-note stereotype", Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Monica as the group's [...] "uptight fun-killer". When Friends first aired, the majority of its earliest episodes revolved around Monica, via whom each character appears to be interconnected; Friends stars the character's brother, her best friend, her former roommate and her two neighbors socializing in Monica's apartment.|$|E
500|$|After their {{short-lived}} {{television series}} Family Album was canceled, television writers David Crane and Marta Kauffman pitched Friends to then-NBC president Warren Littlefield as a sitcom about [...] "that special time in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>when</b> {{your friends are}} your family," [...] basing the show on their own experiences as young people living in New York; the main characters themselves were inspired by their own friends. Conceived {{as a young woman}} who is unprepared for adulthood, the character Rachel Green was originally named Rachel Robbins. Although critics and audiences initially perceived Monica as the show's main character when Friends premiered, the writers had actually given Rachel the pilot's most prominent storyline. Before deciding that Rachel and Ross would be an item for the entire series, the writers had originally intended for the show's defining couple to be Joey and Monica. However, after the success of the pilot, in which Rachel and Ross' developing romance is first hinted at, and witnessing Aniston and co-star David Schwimmer's on-screen chemistry for the first time, Crane and Kauffman determined that the entire series relied on [...] "finding all the wonderful roadblocks for them to be with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Comedy Central {{originally}} ordered {{only six}} episodes of South Park {{for the first}} season's initial run. However, when the show {{proved to be a}} success, they requested an additional seven, the first ones of which creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone had to produce quickly. [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was the first of those new seven episodes to be produced. It was also the first South Park Halloween episode. The script was written by Parker, Stone and writer Philip Stark, and was directed by Parker and Stone, who made the pinkeye a major element of the plot because they associate the illness with the elementary school experience. Parker said, [...] "Pinkeye is just such a huge part of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>when</b> you're in third grade. Pinkeye is the thing every third grader gets and it's just such a bizarre thing." [...] In writing the episode, Parker said he wanted to convey his belief that Halloween is a positive holiday, especially for children: [...] "Halloween's a great thing. That was part of what we wanted (to say). I think kids having this kind of mythology is great." ...|$|E

500|$|Bosworth {{was cast}} as {{reporter}} Lois Lane in Bryan Singer's superhero film Superman Returns (2006). She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>when</b> you feel you've come into your own? When you grow up a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete." [...] The movie grossed $52million during its opening weekend in North America and went on to earn $391million worldwide.|$|E
