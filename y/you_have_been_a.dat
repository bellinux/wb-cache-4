You are a Priest; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Friar; you are, it is undeniable, the scandal of Catholicism, and the palmary {{argument}} of Protestants, by your extraordinary depravity. You have been, it is true, a profligate, an unbeliever, and a hypocrite. Not many years passed of your conventional life, {{and you were}} never in the choir, always in private houses, so that the laity observed you. You were deprived of your professorship, we own it; you were prohibited from preaching and hearing confessions; you were obliged to give hush-money to the father of one of your victims, as we learned from an official document of the Neapolitan Police to be 'known for habitual incontinency;' your name came before the civil tribunal at Corfu for your crime of adultery. You have put the crown on your offences, by {{as long as you}} could, denying them all; you have professed to seek after truth, when you were ravening after sin.|$|E
500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> father, a benefactor and a friend for me. It was a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one}} of Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E

His wife Pattie was traveling from Rock Island, Illinois, but would not arrive in time. Near the end, he became delirious and began admonishing the servant, but then, {{in a moment of}} clarity, called for the man and apologized: [...] "Edward, I hear that I have been scolding you.

2500|$|The {{previous}} Prime Minister, Julia Gillard re-affirmed her party's platform about {{a possible}} future republic.

A statement unaligned to this position was recorded on 21 October 2011 at a reception {{in the presence of the}} Queen at Parliament House in Canberra when Gillard stated that the monarch is [...] "a vital constitutional part of Australian democracy and would only ever be welcomed as a beloved and respected friend." [...] The then Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, a former head of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy stated on 21 October 2011, [...] "Your Majesty, while 11 prime ministers and no less than 17 opposition leaders have come and gone, for 60 years <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> presence in our national story and given the vagaries of public life, I'm confident that this will not be the final tally of the politicians that you have outlasted." ...|$|E
