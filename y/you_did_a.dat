500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that is part of his enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Niven had {{particular}} scorn {{for those}} newspaper columnists covering the war who typed out self-glorifying and excessively florid prose about their meagre wartime experiences. Niven stated, [...] "Anyone who says a bullet sings past, hums past, flies, pings, or whines past, has never heard one—they go crack!" [...] He gave a few {{details of his}} war experience in his autobiography, The Moon's a Balloon: his private conversations with Winston Churchill, the bombing of London, {{and what it was}} like entering Germany with the occupation forces. Niven first met Churchill at a dinner party in February 1940. Churchill singled him out from the crowd and stated, [...] "Young man, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> fine thing to give up your film career to fight for your country. Mark you, had you not done so − it would have been despicable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and you carry on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Charles Thomson wrote a {{piece for}} The Huffington Post, [...] "One of the Most Shameful Episodes in Journalistic History", in which he {{detailed}} the story, as he saw it, of why [...] "the trial that was relayed to us didn't even resemble the trial {{that was going on}} inside the courtroom." [...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria were some of the features. After all, that was the thing that interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage." [...] Court TV hired tabloid journalist Diane Dimond to cover the trial even though Dimond had previously been sued by Jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor Sneddon.|$|E
