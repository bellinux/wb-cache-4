5|$|Cuisine {{varies by}} region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common {{throughout}} the country. A typical dish {{is based on}} cocoyams, maize, cassava (manioc), millet, plantains, potatoes, rice, or <b>yams,</b> often pounded into dough-like fufu. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, groundnuts, palm oil, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and Maggi.|$|E

40|$|The Glycemic Indices (GI) {{of three}} <b>yam</b> cultivars {{commonly}} consumed in Nigeria were studied. The <b>yam</b> cultivars were white <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea rotundata Poir), water <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea alata) and three-leaved <b>yam</b> (Dioscorea domentroum). Five normal (healthy) volunteers {{participated in the}} study. GI was determined using a standard method with glucose as the reference food. Fifty (50) gram available carbohydrate portions of the <b>yam</b> cultivars were analyzed for proximate composition and dietary fiber by enzymatic-gravimetric method. The mean IAUCs (glycemic responses) for the test foods and glucose ranged from 863. 5 - 3642. 84 and were significantly different. Expectedly, glucose had the highest glycemic response of 3642. 84. The mean IAUC for white <b>yam,</b> water <b>yam</b> and three-leaved <b>yam</b> were 2386. 50, 863. 50 and 1929. 08 respectively. The GI of white <b>yam</b> (67) and three-leaved <b>yam</b> (56) {{were significantly higher than}} that of water <b>yam</b> (24).

It was believed that Nri's influence and bountiful amount of food was a reward for the ruler's blessings. Above all, Nri was a holy land for those Igbo who followed its edicts. It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just by entering it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses. Following {{the passage of}} Waka, communication with Niuas and Vava'u were lost. According to local reports, high winds sandblasted Neiafu and downed nearly every tree. Surveys by the Red Cross revealed that roughly 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, <b>yams</b> and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs.

30|$|<b>Yam</b> {{is mainly}} {{cultivated}} as a staple crop across the humid and semi-humid tropics, especially in West Africa {{which accounts for}} about 90 % of world <b>yam</b> production (Aboagyne-Nuamah et al. 2005). There are over 150 species of <b>yam</b> grown throughout the world (Purseglove 1985). White <b>yam</b> (D. rotundata) is the most predominant <b>yam</b> species and it constitutes about 80 % of total <b>yam</b> produced worldwide [(Titteh and Saakwa 1994; Ejechi and Souzey 1999). Although the main constituent of the <b>yam</b> tuber is carbohydrate, it also contains an appreciable amount of proteins, vitamins and minerals (Babaleye 2003). It serves as {{an important source of}} income to many people. The tuber is of economic value and is {{the most important part of}} the crop. It can be eaten in different forms such as roasted, boiled, fried or better still made as pounded <b>yam</b> or as flour which is a delicacy in Nigeria. <b>Yam</b> is a very important and revered crop, especially in southern Nigeria where it has cultural importance exemplified by the annual new <b>yam</b> festival (Arua 1981; Okorji 1992). Water <b>yam</b> (D. alata) becomes an alternative only when the white <b>yam</b> is out of season or very costly.|$|R

40|$|Millions {{of people}} around the world, {{particularly}} in West Africa, depend on <b>yam</b> for food and income, however global <b>yam</b> production has been fluctuating since 2007. Virus infections contribute to <b>yam</b> yield losses and the occurrence of mixed virus infections is potentially catastrophic. Planting of certified virus-free/resistant tubers is advocated therefore knowledge of the role of <b>yam</b> planting material in the virus dynamics in <b>yam</b> fields is crucial for effective <b>yam</b> virus control. In this study, <b>yam</b> tubers bought from markets in six West African countries were planted in an insect proof screen-house. Leaf samples from the tuber sprouts were tested by ELISA and/or IC-PCR/IC-RT-PCR to determine the incidence of <b>Yam</b> mosaic virus, <b>Yam</b> mild mosaic virus, cucumber mosaic virus, and Dioscorea Bacilliform viruses. <b>Yam</b> tubers from Nigeria and Ghana, as well as <b>yam</b> leaves collected from <b>yam</b> fields in Nigeria were also tested. All the viruses assayed for were detected. Most of the virus infections detected in the tuber (83 %) and tuber sprouts (95 %) were single infections of either Dioscorea bacilliform viruses (DBV) or <b>Yam</b> mosaic virus (YMV). The incidence of mixed infection in the field samples (49. 3 %) was about 3 times and 10 times more than those detected in the tubers (17 %) and the tuber sprouts (5 %). These results suggest that other factors other than the tubers used as planting materials contribute to the vast incidence of mixed virus infections in <b>yam</b> fields. These factors must be properly appraised and be factored into any <b>yam</b> virus control strategy equation in order to achieve a sustainable <b>yam</b> production in West Africa in particular and the world in general.

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} on <b>yam</b> {{production}} in federal Capital Territory (FCT). It aimed at establishing {{the relationship that}} exists between rainfall, temperature and <b>yam</b> yield. Two sets of {{data were collected from}} agricultural development project of federal capital territory on climatic elements (rainfall and temperature) and <b>yam</b> yield for ten (10) years. The Pearson product-moment correlation techniques were used to determine the relationship between rainfall and <b>yam</b> yield and between temperature and <b>yam</b> yield which were 0. 10 and 0. 07 respectively. The result showed a positive relationship for both. Using the simple step-wise regression analysis for rainfall and <b>yam</b> yield, applying the same techniques on temperature and <b>yam</b> yield the following questions were derived: rainfall and <b>yam</b> yield _ _ y = 12. 46466 - 0. 002 x. Temperature and <b>yam</b> yield _ _ y = 6. 936 - 0. 24 x. With the use of multiple regressions we obtained 0. 14 between rainfall, temperature and <b>yam</b> yield is yield. We also discovered that 14 % of the proportion variation of <b>yam</b> yield is explained by rain and temperature. The positive relationship obtained between <b>yam</b> and temperature, between <b>yam</b> rainfalls is in agreement with work done previously by other authors. While that of temperature, rainfall and <b>yam</b> is also positive relationship which also agrees with literatures. We recommend that: a more reliable data should be collected and tried again especially on rainfall. <b>Yam</b> yield should be regressed on other environmental factors. Data on temperature, rainfall, compared to eradicate errors. A longer period of data could be collected for better analysis. However, with respect to our present study we concluded that rainfall and temperature has an influence on <b>yam</b> production...|$|R
