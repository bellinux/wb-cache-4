She started with regular training herself and stated that boxing had allowed her to forget the difficulties of her life for a short time: [...] "I could let everything out, my whole energy. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> problems like our family, you need something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try {{to tell you what}} you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
500|$|Crile's report, {{rather than}} {{exploring}} the thesis {{laid out by}} Reasoner, instead focused in large measure on sexual activity, including men cruising in Buena Vista Park and interviews with so-called sadomasochism consultants. He reported {{that one out of}} every ten deaths in San Francisco was attributable to gay men participating in BDSM and that one gay-oriented BDSM establishment's clientele engaged in sexual activity [...] "so dangerous that they have a gynecological table there with a doctor and nurse on hand to sew people up." [...] He compared San Francisco to the Weimar Republic, asking Cleve Jones, [...] "Isn't it a sign of decadence when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> gays emerging, breaking apart all the values of a society?" [...] Crile also included footage of Feinstein, {{in the midst of a}} run-off election to retain her mayorship, appearing before the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, an LGBT Democrat organization. The program as aired showed Feinstein apologizing for remarks she had made in an earlier Ladies' Home Journal interview, followed immediately by applause.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, sir, but <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> words," [...] said she; [...] "you {{must have}} words. Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> words with that Signora Neroni? Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> disgraced yourself, you a clergyman, too, by {{constantly}} consorting {{with such a}} woman as that--with a married woman--with one altogether unfit for a clergyman's society?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard of}} this little {{performance}} jest in time to get here before that long-winded speech was begun; but what pleases me the most is that I was ahead of the whole gang, an' started our little blow-out when it wasn't known <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> friends. I'll see you to-night, of course, an' I must go now, for the bouncer has been around tellin' that you've been sleepin' in my tent, an' I count on a good payin' crowd this afternoon." ...|$|R
500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{string of}} poorly {{received}} films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed {{the lives and}} careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain [...] and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best." [...] For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. [...] With a worldwide revenue of , Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha {{as one of the}} best films of the decade with women protagonists. It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. [...] She said in retrospect, [...] "I think actually Fashion kick started... the process of female dominated films. Today <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other films which have done well with female leads." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{will be even}} better, for <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{been able}} to give a good deal more time to it, since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> drills. Besides, {{progress}} is not so manifest at first, until one is able to converse a little; after that it goes on rapidly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{picked them}} all for <b>you.</b> I <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many,</b> and I heard you cried for some," [...] said Betty, very glad {{that she had}} not run away and spoiled the little lady's drive.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>had</b> <b>you</b> a {{great many}} smart beaux there? I suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{in this part of}} the world; for my part, I think they are a vast {{addition}} always." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh! Armand!" [...] {{she said}} quaintly, [...] "I {{sometimes}} wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not <b>so</b> <b>many</b> lofty virtues. [...] . I assure you little sins {{are far less}} dangerous and uncomfortable. But you WILL be prudent?" [...] she added earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? Well, girls don't {{have that}} air of melancholy absence for nothing. She is {{brooding}} upon something, {{you may be}} sure. But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> more opportunities than I! Do you mean that you haven't suspected a tragical past far her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{thought you}} would be quite changed, Jack, and quite different, now you are a captain, and famous, and all that, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen <b>so</b> <b>many</b> grand ladies in all the {{countries}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> traveled that--that--" [...] And she hesitated.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{things to}} think about,' {{returned}} Mr Meagles, clapping him on the shoulder, as if his weakness must not be left to itself on any account. 'Figures, and wheels, and cogs, and levers, and screws, and cylinders, and a thousand things.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "About a {{third of}} that would be nearer the mark, Glossy. Take my word for it, you don't know {{everything}} yet, though <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> advantages." [...] After that Mounser Green retreated to his own room with a look and tone as though he were angry.|$|E

6000|$|... "Dear sir, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> {{advantages}} over poor Mr. Oldbuck, that no wonder it should put {{him a little}} out of humour; but I know he has much respect for your person and your conversation;--nothing would give him more pain than to be wanting in any real attention." ...|$|E
