500|$|Pfeiffer lent {{her voice}} for the {{character}} of goddess of chaos Eris in [...] (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt {{as the voice of}} Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was [...] "too sexual," [...] then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him [...] "You know, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> fire me.", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely {{out of the public eye}} to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film [...] (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Sheen starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan in {{the romantic}} drama Far from the Madding Crowd as prosperous bachelor William Boldwood. His performance was well received. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker remarked: [...] "How you prevent such a fellow, crushed {{by his own}} decency, from sagging into a bearded Ashley Wilkes is no easy task, yet Sheen succeeds, and Boldwood's brave smile grows dreadful to behold." [...] Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club found the character [...] "pitiful, and sometimes downright painful to watch. He's not Hardy's Boldwood, but he's a Boldwood. The only sad, genuine moment of the film belongs to him." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian remarked that Sheen's face [...] "is etched with agony and an awful kind of abject adoration, forever {{trying to find ways}} to forgive the loved one in advance for rejection. When Sheen's Boldwood confides to Oak that he feels [...] "grief" [...] <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> feel his pain." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice also referred to the scene where Boldwood expressed his grief, commenting: [...] "Sheen's performance is fine-grained, and the pure Englishness of his understatement is heartrending." [...] Also in 2015, Sheen had well-received comedic television performances in Comedy Bang! Bang!, The Spoils Before Dying and 7 Days in Hell. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times said his television host in 7 Days in Hell was [...] "played with damp lechery and cigarette-ash mastery." [...] Liz Shannon Miller of Indiewire said he may have [...] "stolen the show" [...] while John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter described him as the [...] "scene-stealer of the bunch." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Kurt Cobain's biographer Christopher Sandford, Nirvana singer gave [...] "specific references" [...] when {{recording}} {{their first}} album Bleach: [...] "the guitar part in [...] "Love Buzz" [...] was lifted from Sparks’ Kimono My House". Björk talked about Kimono my House {{as one of}} the records that changed her life. [...] " [...] were exotic , [...] were the most refreshing thing in my life" [...] when she was eight. [...] "I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: [...] "I saw Sparks play on American Banstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, [...] "why I love the Sparks". He said about their music: [...] "It's only after a few listens <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> get into it [...] Then your really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them"." [...] Sparks were also namechecked by the likes of Def Leppard, Ween, Will Sheff of Okkervil River, Mark Burgess of the Chameleons, Cait Brennan, and Justice.|$|E

6000|$|It {{does not}} matter how small or {{apparently}} symmetrical the cluster may be, nor how large or vague. You can hardly have a more formal one than b in Fig. 9. p. 276., nor a less formal one than this shoot of Spanish chestnut, shedding its leaves, Fig. 24.; but in either of them, even the general reader, unpractised {{in any of the}} previously recommended exercises, must see that there are wandering lines mixed with the radiating ones, and radiating lines with the wild ones: and if he takes the pen and tries to copy either of these examples, he will find that neither play of hand to left nor to right, neither a free touch nor a firm touch, nor any learnable or describable touch whatsoever, will enable him to produce, currently, a resemblance of it; but that he must either draw it slowly, or give it up. And (which makes the matter worse still) though gathering the bough, and putting it close to you, or seeing a piece of near foliage against the sky, you may draw the entire outline of the leaves, yet if the spray has light upon it, and is ever so little a way off, you will miss, as we have seen, a point of a leaf here, and an edge there; some of the surfaces will be confused by glitter, and some spotted with shade; and if you look carefully through this confusion for the edges or dark stems which <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> see, and put only those down, the result will be neither like Fig. 9. nor Fig. 24., but such an interrupted and puzzling piece of work as Fig. 25.[228] ...|$|E

"To 'The Velvet Glove'--after I've {{sent it to}} you and you've judged if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can.</b> Of course I don't {{want you}} to perjure yourself; but"--and she fairly brushed him again, at their close quarters, with her fresh {{fragrant}} smile--"I do want you so to like me, and to say it all out beautifully and publicly." [...] "You want me to like you, Princess?" [...] "But, heaven help us, haven't you understood?" [...] Nothing stranger could conceivably have been, it struck him--if he was right now--than this exquisite intimacy of her manner of setting {{him down on the}} other side of an abyss. It was as if she had lifted him first in her beautiful arms, had raised him up high, high, high, to do it, pressing him to her immortal young breast while he let himself go, and then, by some extraordinary effect of her native force and her alien quality, setting him down exactly where she wanted him to be--which was a thousand miles away from her. Once more, so preposterously face to face with her for these base issues, he took it all in; after which he felt his eyes close, for amazement, despair and shame, and his head, which he had some time before, baring his brow to the mild night, eased of its crush-hat, sink to confounded rest on the upholstered back of the seat. The act, the ceasing to see, and if possible to hear, was for the moment a retreat, an escape from a state that he felt himself fairly flatter by thinking of it as [...] "awkward"; the state of really wishing that his humiliation might end, and of wondering in fact if the most decent course open to him mightn't be to ask her to stop the motor and let him down.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Iglesias {{performed}} at the Super Bowl XXXIV halftime show alongside Christina Aguilera, Phil Collins, and Toni Braxton. Shock jock Howard Stern repeatedly played a tape of a supposedly very off-key Iglesias on his radio show and accused the Iglesias {{of not being able}} to sing live. On 8 June 2000, Iglesias sang the song live on Stern's show with just a guitar accompanying him. After the performance, Stern remarked, [...] "I respect you for coming in here; <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> sing". Iglesias noted that the off-key recording was also him, but that it was probably a recording made during a television taping where he was required to lip sync. He would remark that the controversy was the best promotion he could have. The album's single [...] "Be With You" [...] became Iglesias's second number one single on Billboards Hot 100.|$|E
5000|$|ModNation Racers {{received}} mostly positive reviews.

[...] Gamers Globe, a Danish gaming website, also rated ModNation Racers 9 out of 10, saying [...] "the game isn't a creative breakthrough as LittleBigPlanet or a go-kart game so complete as Mario Kart - it's a solid combination of both, which borrows the best of two worlds." [...] Eurogamer scored the game 7 out of 10, criticising long loading times and saying that the dynamic game difficulty can make the player feel like they're [...] "operating at a distinct disadvantage," [...] but that, when playing online or split-screen against other human players, [...] "ModNation allows its own charm to shine through".|$|E

5000|$|Kitty Empire of The Observer was {{impressed}} by the album's production and songwriting, but felt that [...] "every track outstays its welcome by a couple of minutes", resulting in Reflektor not being an [...] "astonishing album", but [...] "merely very, very good one instead." [...] In a mixed review, PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III said [...] "Reflektor doesn't contain any actually bad songs (the closest we can peg on the collection would be a small amount of filler material), but the impact of a full listen is one of catchy excitement and impressive pop rock which slowly rolls downhill into the murky sonic depths of the more somber second half without any truly punctuating final moment of the record itself." [...] Simon Goddard of Q wrote that Reflektor fails to [...] "fully justify the size of it and it doesn't end so much as unravel" [...] and [...] "is proof <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> have {{too much of a good}} thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{movie was}} given three-and-a-half {{out of four}} stars in The New York Post by Kyle Smith who called it, [...] "A {{cinematic}} enchantment" [...] as well as, [...] "one of the year’s best movies." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and wrote, [...] "Thanks to director David Lowery's humanizing magic, this tale of an orphan boy and a dragon is that rare family film <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>can</b> take to heart." [...] Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] and {{said that while the}} remake, [...] "may owe more to E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, along with a dash of The Jungle Book than it does to the original Pete's Dragon," [...] she overall concluded that [...] "this story of two vulnerable souls who help each other find their way works, too." [...] Barry Hertz of The Globe and Mail praised the film for its sincerity as well as its [...] "honest effort to entertain and enthrall" [...] audiences rather than simply being a cash grab.|$|E
