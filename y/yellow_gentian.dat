30|$|The cyanoacrylate-developed print may {{be further}} {{enhanced}} by dusting with regular or magnetic fingerprint powder (Ramotowski 2012). The cyanoacrylate developed fingerprints can further {{be enhanced by}} using Rhodamine 6 G (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Morris (1992) suggested the use of basic yellow 40 in place of gentian violet for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on adhesive side of tape. Isaac (1993) used rhodamine 6 G for enhancing cyanoacrylate-fumed fingermarks on different kinds of self-adhesive tapes. Kobus et al. (1983) suggested the use of gentian violet and coumarin 540 to {{enhance the quality of}} cyanoacrylate developed prints on polyethylene and aluminium foil respectively. Chesher et al. (1992) used acid fuchsin, Nile blue A, safranin bluish and Rit® fabric dye in combination with OMNIPRINTTM 1000 alternate light source to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed prints on white polyethylene dinner plate. Post-treatment with vapors of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde was suggested {{to improve the quality of}} cyanoacrylate-fumed latent fingerprints on solvent-sensitive surfaces such as oil marker writings and materials with rough surfaces such as unglazed earthenware (Takatsu et al. 2012). The use of RAY (Rhodamine, Ardrox, Basic <b>Yellow)</b> dye stain, <b>gentian</b> violet and alternate powder was suggested for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed fingerprints on the adhesive side of various kinds of tapes. Processing of cyanoacrylate fumed prints with gentian violet, followed by alternate powder and finally with RAY dye stain was suggested as best processing sequence to enhance the quality of developed prints (Wilson 2010). Chadwick et al. (2014) observed that staining of Polycyano UV processed marks with rhodamine 6 G significantly improves its performance on aluminium, glass and polyethylene bags. The use of sublimating dyes such as 1 -amino- 2 -phenoxy- 4 -hydroxy-anthraquinone and 1, 4 -bis-(ethylamino)-anthraquinone was suggested to enhance the quality of cyanoacrylate developed (fresh and aged upto 2  months) prints on plastics, metals and glass surfaces. The particles of dyes adhere to polymerized cyanoacrylate and provide red purple or blue color to it (Morimoto et al. 1998). Lock et al. (1995) suggested the use of europium thenoyltrifluoroacetone ortho-phenanthroline (EuTTAPhen) complex for enhancing the quality of cyanoacrylate-developed prints. Olenik (2015) described a procedure to develop latent fingermarks on smooth and adhesive sides of duct tape and other plastic tapes, including black electrical tape using cyanoacrylate fuming followed by dyeing with basic yellow 40. The procedure involves the fuming of tape with cyanoacrylate vapors followed by application of basic yellow 40. After dyeing, tape is rinsed under running tap water, followed by drying and visualized with orange or yellow goggles under blue light as well as under forensic light source in the range of 415 to 485  nm. Menzel et al. (1983) observed that application of post-treatment procedures (dusting, staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride) to cyanoacrylate developed prints significantly improves the detectibility of latent prints. They suggested the use to ultraviolet and blue-green argon-ion laser together with fluorescent powder dusting, fluorescent dye staining and ninhydrin/zinc chloride post-processing of cyanoacrylate developed prints. Sonnex et al. (2016) used cyanoacrylate fuming followed by Infrared spectral mapping for visualization and enhancement of latent fingermarks on smooth, shiny fabrics such as silk, nylon and polyester, of different colors and patterns. However, due to the presence of carbonyl functional group in cotton and polycotton and their absorbency to latent fingermark residues, these fabrics gave poor results. Stoltzfus and Rebane (2016) used NIR two-photon induced fluorescence imaging technique to image cyanoacrylate processed fingermarks on highly-reflective substrates. Chadwick et al. (2011) suggested the use of styryl 11, a laser dye, over rhodamine 6 G for the enhancement of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks in near-infrared region. The luminescence emission intensity of STaR 11, combination of styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G, was better than styryl 11 and rhodamine 6 G individually and could be used for enhancing the visualization of cyanoacrylate-developed fingermarks on multicolored glossy cardboard in visible and near-infrared regions.|$|R

After a further six weeks, the finished product is ready for bottling and is shipped in tankers to Beaucaire, Gard, where it is bottled by Martini & Rossi.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{perception}} that the spirit is produced with gentian flowers (which are depicted in the labeling by many producers), Gentian is actually produced using gentian root, most commonly the <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian,</b> which is a larger variety. Less commonly, the roots from other flowers from the Gentian genus are used, such as the purple gentian, brown gentian, or spotted gentian. The harvesting of gentian from the wild is strictly controlled; as a result, fields are planted with the specific purpose of being harvested. In both the EU and Switzerland, the alcoholic strength of Gentian must be at least 37.5 percent alcohol by volume.|$|E

30|$|A dozen natural {{substances}} {{from the}} INCI list originate from {{plants that are}} on the red list of endangered species in Germany (class 2 or 3) [18], e.g. Drosera rotundifolia (sundew), Orchis morio (green-veined orchid), Gentiana lutea (great <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian),</b> Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (bearberry), or Arnica montana (mountain arnica). There were no notifiers of Drosera rotundifolia (sundew) and Orchis morio. Also, no notifier is entered for Arnica montana, although this plant is used frequently for pharmaceutical products. Some plants which are endangered in Germany and used for the production of natural substances may be cultivated (e.g. Gentiana lutea, Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi, and since recently also Arnica montana) or they may be collected in other countries (e.g. Arnica montana). Gentiana lutea, and Arctostaphyllos uva-ursi are notified by 747, respectively 25 notifiers. There are additional rare and protected plants, which are used for the production of personal care products, but which are itemized in the INCI list and not in the German red list. For example, alpine valerian (Valeriana celtica, German name: Speick) is used by the German Speick company for the production of soap. This company was granted an exception permit for the collection of Valeriana celtica in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
40|$|Gentiana lutea L. (<b>yellow</b> <b>gentian,</b> Gentianaceae) is an {{important}} medicinal plant under protection as endangered species in most European countries. The aim of this work was to evaluate variation in seed mass, seed water content, and seed germination among 56 wild accessions of G. lutea. The effect of gibberellic acid (GA 3), putrescine, moist chilling, and level of ripeness of seeds on subsequent germination was also investigated. Seeds of G. lutea showed physiological dormancy (final germination percentages ranged from 0 % to 11 %, depending on the accession) and GA 3 enhanced seed germination drastically in all the accessions. The highest germination (99 %) of GA 3 -treated seeds was reached at 15 °C. Final germination percentage and germination rate (as expressed by mean germination time), as well as seed mass and seed water content, varied significantly among accessions. In general, 1 year moist chilling did not significantly enhance G. lutea seed germination. For most accessions, {{no significant differences were}} found between fully ripe seeds and less ripe seeds for seed water content, seed mass, and seed germination. Applications of GA 3 were always most effective than those of putrescine for increasing seed germination...|$|E
40|$|Field {{trial with}} <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian</b> was {{established}} (11. 1 plants per m 2) at 1004 m. a. s. l., {{in order to}} assess the effect of black PE (bPE), silver PE (sPE), and black permeable biodegradable (bPB) mulching films on the root yield and development during six years. The highest crop density measured prior to the root harvest (sixth year), was obtained in the plot with bPB film (84 %), while in the plot with bPE and in control (without mulch) number of plants was reduced by 34. 2 % and 45 %, respectively. In addition, application of the bPB film proved to be the most effective treatment; in the fifth and sixth year root yields per m 2 increased by 92. 3 % and 106. 0 %, respectively, in comparison to bPE, and by 78. 9 % and 69. 2 %, respectively, in comparison to sPE, and by 184. 4 % and 169. 6 %, respectively, in comparison to control. Application of bPE had a lower positive effect on YG root yield than control (- 18. 6 %- 54. 95 %), whereas the effect of sPE was higher than the bPE and control; the achieved root yields were higher, 29. 7 % and 70. 6 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Improvement of {{the lung}} {{function}} of horses with heaves by treatment with a botanical preparation for 14 days R. Anour, S. Leinker, R. van den Hoven The {{effects of an}} oral preparation containing a mixture of extracts from <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian,</b> garden sorrel, cowslip, verbena and common elder on the lung function of nine horses suffering from heaves were determined in a longitudinal crossover study. The horses were divided at random into a group of five (group 1) {{and a group of}} four (group 2). The horses in group 1 were each given 15 tablets of the preparation twice daily, while the horses in group 2 were left untreated. Fourteen days later, the horses in group 2 were given the same course of treatment while the horses in group 1 were left untreated. On being subjected to a histamine inhalation provocation test, five of eight horses tested appeared to be hyperresponsive to histamine. The treatment decreased the histamine sensitivity of three of them; it also caused a significant decrease in maximal intrapleural pressure difference of all the horses. The treatment had no significant effects on the clinical signs, the mucociliary activity or the cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the horses...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{assessments}} {{could be}} more reliable than global ones, especially for species in peripheral parts of their range. In this sense, distribution criteria proposed by the IUCN, expressed by the Extent of Occurrence (EOO) and the Area of Occupancy (AOO), are of critical importance to evaluate the risk category at any scale. Our study {{was focused on the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>gentian</b> (Gentiana lutea L. subsp. lutea), a rhizomatous mountain plant of central and southern Europe, included in the Annex V of the Directive 92 / 43 /EEC. The exhaustive and updated regional distribution and the recently published extinct localities, allowed for review of option {{to increase the number of}} criteria used for its regional conservation status assessment. In particular, the current restricted EOO and AOO extents and reductions occurred during the last three generations led this plant being considered as Endangered (EN), according to the IUCN sub-criteria A 2, B 1 and B 2. Additionally, Species Distribution Models based on the extant localities and the respective current and future climate scenarios (2050 and 2070) predicted a decrease of its environmental niche reducing its altitudinal range towards higher elevations. This reduction was greater than 50 % and confirmed the regional conservation status of EN, also according to the sub-criterion A 3. This paper shows the reliability of regional risk assessment of peripheral and/or narrow populations, which is an effective tool for helping the development of the necessary conservation management, underling a diversified set of solutions for each specific past, present and future threat that could occur in each locality...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} weeds {{to form a}} seed bank is {{important}} for their population dynamics and management because it provides a refuge enabling reinvasion after established target plants have died. However, knowledge of the differential seed behaviour of individual species over multiple years and varying environmental conditions is surprisingly rare but necessary for effective control of diverse weed populations. We established a seed burial experiment in alpine habitats differing in management regime (i. e., forest, hay meadow and pasture) to determine whether seeds of the unpalatable perennial weeds, Veratrum album (white hellebore) and Gentiana lutea (<b>yellow</b> <b>gentian)</b> were able to delay germination and remain viable over 3 years. Our study shows that both species formed a short-term persistent seed bank; in the third-year, the soil seed banks of both species were nearly depleted, having declined to G. lutea seeds mainly germinated in their first-year, whilst the majority of V. album seeds germinated in their second-year. The fraction of dormant G. lutea seeds increased with seed age, indicating that seeds remained viable after forgoing germination in the previous year. Habitat-specific differences in seed germination increased with seed age, with germination fractions being lowest in moist hay meadows. This suggests that {{the negative effects of}} anoxic conditions became more pronounced as seeds aged in hay meadows. Conversely, seed dormancy was equal among habitats. The absence of a long-term persistent seed bank has important implications for the management of both nuisance and endangered-plant populations. In the case of V. album and G. lutea, re-colonization of habitats from the seed bank is unlikely after established plants have been removed...|$|E
