2500|$|The {{first day}} of {{negotiations}} was originally planned to last just two hours, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm VLAT, after which the two delegations would break for dinner and then retire for the night before resuming talks the next morning. The negotiations had been so productive, however, that the Soviets and the Americans agreed to forgo dinner and continue the talks, ultimately taking three short breaks that evening instead of one long one to eat. The Americans, afraid that the Sanatorium had been bugged, elected to take their breaks outside, despite the sub-zero temperatures. During one of the breaks, Brezhnev presented Ford with , and while Ford was quite impressed {{by the quality of}} the work he did not think it looked much like him. When he presented the portrait to a group of his American colleagues, photographer David Hume Kennerly joked: [...] "Hey now, would <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that?</b> They gave you a picture of Frank Sinatra." [...] Ford was not amused.|$|E

6000|$|... "That’ll do," [...] {{broke in}} the captain, hastily. [...] "Go {{in and get}} the tea ready. If I so much as see <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> glass again we part, my lad, mind that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} so!" [...] cried Peterkin {{with a loud}} laugh.--"Oh Ralph, you're incorrigible! See, there's a club for you. I was sure, when we left <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> bit of stuff, that we would find you poring over it when we came back, so I just cut a club for you {{as well as for}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come!" [...] {{said the}} stranger, [...] "I'll help you. You don't deserve help, but I'll help <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> paper you hold in your hand. What is it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not degrade {{yourself}} by unnecessary falsehood, my lord; {{and that to}} a single man, who, I promise you, will not invoke public justice to assist his own good sword should he see cause to use it. Can <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> ring, and deny that you are Lord Wilmot?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{remembered that}} there were emetics in the cruet-stand," [...] said Father Brown. [...] "Exactly. He threw the cruet in the dustbin--where I found it, along with other silver--for {{the sake of a}} {{burglary}} blind. But if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> pepper-pot I put on the table, you'll see a small hole. That's where Cray's bullet struck, shaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} silly of them, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it <b>that</b> way," [...] I admitted, [...] "but {{what we have}} got to {{consider}} is, the injury it is doing us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So says John Bellini, {{with art}} more cunning than words. And if this paper shall {{make one of}} <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> little picture with fresh interest, and raise one strong and solemn longing in you to die {{the death of the}} righteous, and let your last end be like his who is painted there--then I shall rejoice in the only payment I desire to get, for this my afternoon's writing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{philosophy}} of madness," [...] was the retort. [...] "So have I assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams. But beware. These bourgeois cities will kill <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> den of traitors where I met you. Dry rot is no name for it. One can't keep his sanity {{in such an}} atmosphere. It's degrading. There's {{not one of them}} who is not degrading, man and woman, all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic impulses of clams--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because it's too {{absurd to}} be endured! What does the mere sound of Fanny suggest? A flirting, dancing creature--plump and fair, and playful and pretty!" [...] She {{went to the}} looking-glass, and pointed disdainfully to the {{reflection}} of herself. [...] "Sickening to think of," [...] she said, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> Call me Frances--a man's name, with only {{the difference between an}} i and an e. No sentiment in it; hard, like me. Well, what was it you didn't like to say of yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll sure eat {{us if we}} don't. They look hungry {{enough for}} it. Hello, old skeeziks. What's wrong with <b>you?</b> Don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> dog that way. No cookin'-pot for him--savvy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it <b>that</b> way," [...] I replied. [...] "Why, we're {{already getting}} cramped, Maude, and now you're {{going to have}} a governess I don't know where you'd put her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There is some sneaking Temperance Society {{movement}} {{about this}} business," [...] he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, {{who had just}} come from forward. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> kannakin, sir; smell of it, if you please." [...] Then watching the mate's countenance, he added, [...] "The steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether {{this is the sort}} of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you said}} you'd accept," [...] pleaded Baxter. [...] "They are all alike, as I said before. I had the firm make them to order, {{so there is}} nothing else like them on the market. The three {{diamonds}} represent you three brothers, and the ruby--well, when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> you can think of me, if you want to. And another thing," [...] went on Baxter, his face flushing a trifle, [...] "the pins are settled for. They didn't come out of my stock. I mention this because--because--" [...] The young traveling salesman stopped in some confusion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Abe, {{you know}} I put no faith {{whatever}} in a dream, but if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> sharp {{curve in the}} opposite bank higher up, {{you will see that}} {{it is quite possible that}} in the days when this was a river instead of being a mere stream, it struck that curve and came over by where we are standing now. As the water decreased it would naturally find its way down the middle of the valley, as it does now; but I think it likely enough that in the old times it flowed under where we are standing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now listen, Woodden. Have <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> Odontoglossum Pavo, and if so, what do {{you think}} of it?" [...] and he nodded towards a plant which stood in the centre of the little group that was placed on the small table beneath the auctioneer's desk. It bore a spray of the most lovely white flowers. On the top petal (if it is a petal), and also on the lip of each of these rounded flowers was a blotch or spot of which the general effect was similar to the {{iridescent}} eye on the tail feathers of a peacock, whence, I suppose, the flower was named [...] "Pavo," [...] or Peacock.|$|R

6000|$|... "You needn't try to {{play off}} Dobell or Mitchell on ME--you hear! Much YOU know of either, don't <b>you?</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> copy. If Johnny couldn't do better than that, I'd lick him. Of course it's the pen--it ain't your stodgy fingers--oh, no! P'r'aps you'd like to hev a few more boxes o' quills and gold pens and Gillott's best thrown in, for two bits a lesson? I tell you what! I'll throw up the {{contract}} in another minit!

6000|$|... "You can try it on, if you like," [...] Mr. Earles remarked genially. [...] "My {{only answer}} would be to ask <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> mirror {{and then at the}} poster. The poster is of 'Alcide.' It's a {{duplicate}} of the French one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Eames," [...] she said, [...] "will <b>you</b> kindly <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> watch {{which is}} lying on the table." [...] She <b>looked</b> full <b>at</b> him with her great eyes wide open, and the tone of her voice was {{intended}} to show {{him that she was}} aggrieved.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{surrender}} to you, sir,' I cried; though I daresay my English {{was not very}} much better than his French. 'If <b>you</b> will <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> tree to the left you will see what these villains do to the honourable gentlemen who fall into their hands.' ...|$|R

50|$|The {{trick is}} always buy when you're strong so {{he needs to}} buy players.

He's got to buy players, as simple as that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he was mad}} enough," [...] replied Dave, with a grim smile. [...] "But say, {{when you}} get the chance, I want <b>you</b> to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> Hank Snogger. He looks like {{somebody}} I've met somewhere, but {{for the life of me}} I can't place him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then what--Why do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me in <b>that</b> fashion, sir?" [...] and {{springing}} up, Adrian rushed forward, {{and held}} the candle to Amyas's face.|$|R
