The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located {{very close to the}} south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Fresno State's {{offensive}} woes {{continued on}} their next drive. On second down, Carr was sacked for {{a loss of}} 18 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 6-yard line. On third down, Hunt recorded another sack {{which resulted in a}} safety to make the score 12-0 SMU. Zach Line rushed for an 8-yard touchdown to cap an 11-play, 67-yard drive after the safety. This made the score 19-0.|$|E

5|$|Allen was {{selected}} by the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the fourth round of the 1988 CFL Draft with the 29th overall pick. He played in 17 regular season games during his rookie season, in which he made no tackles but contributed heavily on special teams. Allen recovered three blocked punts for touchdowns throughout the season, including one that was returned 30 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> endzone against the Ottawa Rough Riders. The Blue Bombers went on to defeat the BC Lions 22–21 to win the 76th Grey Cup, making Allen a Grey Cup champion in his rookie season.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard line, where Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was within range of a 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E
5|$|From {{that point}} on, the Colts {{took over the}} game. Four plays after the ensuing kickoff, Colts {{defensive}} back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass and returned it 38 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bears 41-yard line. Chicago's defense eventually forced a punt, but Smith's 32-yard kick pinned the Bears back at their own 8-yard line. The Bears drove to their own 47, but on a fourth down conversion attempt, tight end Desmond Clark dropped a potential first down reception after being leveled by defensive back Matt Giordano. The Colts subsequently called eight consecutive Dominic Rhodes runs before turning the ball over on downs themselves, leaving only 1:42 remaining in regulation. Five plays later, the game was over.|$|E
50|$|Highland Pines {{boundaries}} are Uceta <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south, <b>the</b> Lake Avenue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, Grant Park <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northeast, Florence Villa <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southeast and Belmont Heights-Jackson Heights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west.|$|R
50|$|In {{the third}} quarter, kicker Rob Bironas would kick field goals of 41 and 49 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> Titans up by 31, {{and in the}} fourth quarter, he would nail field goals of 45 and 43 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> Titans up for good.|$|R
50|$|In Canadian football, {{the team}} on defense must line up no nearer than a <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> line of scrimmage. In American football, they must only be beyond the line.|$|R
5|$|Johann Ludwig Schneller also {{purchased}} land in {{the vicinity}} of the orphanage and constructed houses for workers. Two of these Batei Schneller (Schneller Houses) still stand across the street from the main entrance, as well as three of the original five homes built several <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west (near the present corner of Malkhei Yisrael and Sarei Yisrael Streets). A plaque on each home bears the name of the German city of its donors. The cities are: Halle, Stuttgart, Kletz, Munich, Hamburg, Petersberg, and Erpfingen, Schneller’s birthplace.|$|E
5|$|Linton ran {{for nine}} yards, {{then picked up}} a first down with a five-yard gain on second down. Keldorf {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Barnes for a first down, Linton ran seven <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Carolina 43-yard line, then gained another first down with a run to the 50-yard line. From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on first down, but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|E
5|$|NC State, {{needing to}} score, {{drove down the}} field and kicked a go-ahead 33-yard field goal with 7:12 {{remaining}} in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball away, allowing NC State to run down the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final {{chance to win the}} game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 win.|$|E
50|$|By 2010, {{a tunnel}} was {{partially}} constructed <b>to</b> link <b>the</b> {{north end of}} <b>the</b> Wilson <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainline just south of Sheppard West Station. Rails were not laid in this tunnel for several years. This new link will provide a entry/exit {{at the north end}} of <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> support traffic on the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension.|$|R
25|$|The entrance, off a small <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ‘right’ of the {{building}} is via “a Tudorish gateway” erected in 1862, made from {{a section of the}} old Cornmarket arcade that stood in Broad Street in front of Browne's Hospital.|$|R
25|$|Buntlines, spaced {{every few}} feet {{along the front}} of a sail, run from a point on the mast above <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foot (bottom edge) of the sail and serve <b>to</b> raise <b>the</b> foot up for {{shortening}} sail or for furling.|$|R
5|$|On the 16th RCT front, at {{the eastern}} end of Easy Red, was another area between strongpoints. This allowed G/16 and the support {{battalion}} to escape complete destruction in their advance up the beach. Nevertheless, most of G/16's 63 casualties for the day came before they had reached the shingle. The other 2nd Battalion company landed in the second wave; H/16 came in a few hundred <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left, opposite the E-3 draw, and suffered for it – they were put out of action for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Texas fair {{caught the}} punt at their 14-yard line. On {{the first play}} after the kick, a run up the middle was stopped {{for the loss of}} a yard. Williams then gained two yards, and Brown threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Texas went three-and-out {{for the first time in}} the second quarter and prepared to punt. Bryan Still fielded the kick at the Tech 40-yard line and returned it 60 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end zone for Virginia Tech's first points of the game. The subsequent extra point was good, and with 2:34 remaining in the first half, Tech cut Texas' lead to 107.|$|E
5|$|The Tech kickoff was {{returned}} 17 yards by Gilyard to the Cincinnati 40-yard line, giving the Bearcats good field position {{to start their}} drive. Two rushes by Goebel resulted in 11 yards and a first down at the Tech 49-yard line. This success on the ground was followed by more through the air, as Pike completed three consecutive passes: a 16-yarder to Gilyard, a 3-yarder to Goodman, and a 14-yarder to Gilyard. Goebel then ran five <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tech 11-yard line. Two Pike passes fell incomplete, setting up fourth down. Rather than attempt to kick a field goal, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly ordered the offense to attempt to convert the fourth down. This was done when Pike completed a seven-yard pass to Goodman for a first down at the Virginia Tech four-yard line. Two more Pike passes fell incomplete before Goebel rushed three <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech one-yard line. Cincinnati again faced a fourth down, and again, Kelly elected to attempt to score a touchdown rather than kick a field goal. Pike attempted to cross the goal line on a running play, but was stopped by the Virginia Tech defense. With 7:25 remaining in the game, Cincinnati turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense, which returned to the field.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} train {{stabling}} sidings {{are near the}} station, as is a little used goods <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south of the station.

The remaining rooms include a winter garden and Atatürk's former office.|$|R
25|$|The London Olympic Village, with {{accommodation}} for all {{athletes and}} accredited officials (some 17,320 beds in total). After the games, {{the village was}} planned to become a district of the Stratford City development, a multi-billion-pound development project on the former railway goods <b>yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east of the Olympic Park.|$|R
5|$|The Tigers {{began their}} second drive {{of the game}} from their 26-yard line and {{advanced}} the ball through short gains. The Tigers needed three plays to gain a first down, then running back Andre Ellington advanced 18 yards and into Georgia Tech territory. Clemson could not gain another first down, and kicker Richard Jackson missed a 52-yard field goal attempt. After the miss, Georgia Tech's offense resumed the field. From the Tech 35-yard line, the Yellow Jackets advanced to the Clemson 48-yard line before running back Jonathan Dwyer gained 20 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 28-yard line. Two plays later, as the Yellow Jackets advanced to the 18-yard line, the quarter ended with Clemson leading, 7–3.|$|E
5|$|The {{limited time}} {{left in the}} game meant there was little chance the Hokies could make good the 20-point deficit. Tech's hopes flared after Nebraska's kickoff was {{returned}} 67 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nebraska 25-yard line, providing a chance for a quick score. Druckenmiller completed a 14-yard pass after the long return, giving Tech a first down at the 11-yard line, but the Hokies were unable to advance the ball much further. Oxendine ran for five yards, but Druckenmiller threw three incomplete passes, turning the ball over on downs. With a firm lead, Nebraska proceeded to run four short rushes, running out the clock and bringing the game to an end. Nebraska won the 63rd Orange Bowl, 4121.|$|E
5|$|The victims' {{bodies were}} found {{floating}} in Tampa Bay on June 4, 1989. The first body was found when several people on board a sailboat, crossing under the Sunshine Skyway, saw an object in the water.

While the Coast Guard went to recover the second body, a call came in about a third, which was seen floating 200 <b>yards</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east. All three female {{bodies were found}} face down, bound with a rope around the neck, and naked below the waist.|$|E
50|$|A 16 mi riverwalk {{provides}} {{a path for}} people to walk, run or bike on {{along the banks of}} the Anacostia River. Sections of the trail currently exist <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eleventh street bridge and behind the Washington Navy Yard. Upon completion of Yards park in 2010 the Navy opened the riverwalk trail behind <b>the</b> Navy <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.|$|R
25|$|In 1945, the W Railroad {{acquired}} {{ownership of}} the section of line between Potomac Yard and Purcellville that the W Railway had earlier leased from the Southern Railway. The Southern Railway retained {{ownership of the}} easternmost section of the railroad's route, which still connected Potomac <b>Yard</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern's freight and passenger stations in old town Alexandria.|$|R
50|$|However, in 2003, Whitemoor Yard re-opened and on 18 April 2008 GB Railfreight (a freight {{operating}} company {{and part of}} FirstGroup) officially opened their new depot at March.
