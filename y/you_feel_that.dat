25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E

About Kukunoor, he said that, [...] "though one tends to go overboard as an actor most of the times, the way he handles the character as a director, Nagesh makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it is very simple for you to delineate the character." [...] Through his character of a bahuroopiya, Talpade was required to perform mimicry. While {{he was good at}} mimicry in college, it was during the filming of Iqbal, Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade's hands. About his co-actors, he said that it was refreshing to work with Panag and Takia despite the scorching heat of [...]|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, the {{inspiration}} for the song was a newspaper article about a woman who had gone back to get revenge on an abusive husband, [...] "so {{we thought it would be}} cool to get a bit of retribution in there." [...] Vig also said he noted violence could also come from psychological stand point by seeing the story of a sado-masochistic couple who could not keep away from each other. Lyrically, Manson claimed [...] "'Vow' is about having feelings [...] You have to face your feelings of revenge and work out why <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> way. It's about that conundrum when you're really angry but in reality you're in a pitiful state. Angry, twisted, but deep down, vulnerable." [...] During promotion for the song, Garbage joked to journalists that [...] "Vow" [...] was about John and Lorena Bobbitt.|$|E

She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for everything you do and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to Bale breaking {{his hand and}} Worthington hurting his back, special effects technician Mike Menardis almost lost his leg filming an explosion. The sequence required a manhole cover being blown into the air, which hit Menardis and partially severed his leg. McG noted it was {{a testament to the}} gritty style of the film. [...] "I say with respect, I didn't want that Star Wars experience of everything's a blue screen, tennis balls, and go for it. I had Stan Winston build all the machines. We built all the sets, the explosive power, the explosive power so <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> wind and that percussion and that heat blowing your eyebrows off. And with that, you get a couple bumps and bruises on the way, but you get it in an integrity and a realism that hopefully echoes Apocalypse Now. You couldn't say, 'Let's just shoot Apocalypse Now in Burbank, I think it's going to feel just as good.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he {{illustrated}} the Marvel Comics adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back with Carlos Garzon, {{as well as}} the 50th issue of the monthly Star Wars comic. Williamson was Lucasfilms' first choice as illustrator for the Star Wars newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the Empire Strikes Back adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited [...] "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best Star Wars artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do Star Wars material. There was that comfort factor in it as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and I will say that in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|The relegation of fighter {{units to}} what {{appeared}} to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain Clive Caldwell, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the [...] "mutineers", Group Captain Wilf Arthur, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, [...] "Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," [...] to which they replied, [...] "It {{has nothing to do with}} you." [...] Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General George Kenney. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.|$|E

Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", because, while gay characters are often isolated and attacked, audiences have rarely seen an openly gay character who [...] "wins and triumphs". He further explained, [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end.

500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you’re deceived you don’t {{want any part of}} the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At the time of his departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E
500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} album led to Shakira being deemed {{one of the most}} successful Latin crossover artists of all time, with Steve Huey from AllMusic calling her [...] "Latin pop's biggest female crossover artist since Jennifer Lopez" [...] and [...] "an instant pop sensation, thanks to her quirky poetic sense and a sexy video image built on her hip-shaking belly dance moves." [...] The success of the album also received considerable backlash, with many calling Shakira a [...] "sellout". This negative response was further heightened by the fact that Shakira, who was a natural brunette, had bleached her hair blonde at the time of the release of the album, which many viewed as a tactic to [...] "fit into the US market." [...] Regarding this backlash, Shakira said, [...] "I know my Latin people find this difficult. And I want [...] to be good news to my country. But it's typical that when you see somebody who is so close to you growing, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the very word 'growing' is synonymous with leaving. My hair is a coincidence. I dyed it more than two and a half years ago." [...] On the other hand, many viewed Shakira's crossover success as a [...] "strong cultural statement" [...] as her musical style was representative of her mixed ethnicity.|$|E
500|$|Rachel Saltz of The New York Times reviewed, [...] "The {{pleasure}} {{principle is}} palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying {{example of the}} new, thoroughly modern Bollywood. It may represent the newfangled Bollywood, but old-fashioned star power is what animates and elevates it above its occasional narrative flaws and longueurs." [...] Film Journal Internationals Ethan Alter said, [...] "Dhoom 2 has all {{of the benefits of}} a big-budget Bollywood production: big-name stars, exotic locales, well-produced musical numbers and elaborate (by Bollywood standards, anyway) action sequences. It makes no lasting contributions to world cinema, but if two-and-a-half hours of disposable entertainment are all you're after, you could do far worse." [...] L.A. Weeklys David Chute stated the film was, [...] "A movie meal as satisfying as this one can make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> nothing else matters." [...] Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC gave it a two-star rating, writing [...] "By roping in acclaimed action director Alan Amin {{to take care of the}} thrills and spills, you'd expect Gadhvi to have spent time crafting out a sophisticated storyline instead of simply sending his cast on a cat-and-mouse chase around the globe. It's only Roshan's charismatic performance as the criminal mastermind, and the sizzling chemistry he shares with Rai's sassy cohort, that rescues this adventure from becoming an elongated tourism commercial." [...] Manish Gajjar, Bollywood Correspondent for BBC Shropshire said, [...] "With its high-powered action sequences matching Hollywood standards, Dhoom 2 is a winner all the way at the box office!" ...|$|E

500|$|... "This Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Jepsen, Kelly Covell, Matthew Koma, and Stefan Kendal Gordy, also known as Redfoo from electropop duo LMFAO, through e-mails, text {{messaging}} and telephone calls. Jepsen explained that she had [...] "never written a song that way before so I'd definitely say it was new," [...] adding that [...] "there was something really exciting about being {{on the phone and}} singing ideas to each other and then calling each other back and re-writing lyrics in your BlackBerry and iPhone and seeing it all being exchanged." [...] The singer also revealed that she was pleased with the creative process of the song, commenting that [...] "despite all this craziness, [...] remains the same. And that same exciting feeling that I had before anybody knew me, when I was just beginning to work on 'Call Me Maybe', is the same feeling I had today with Redfoo from LMFAO. You can sense the people who really have it are about writing that right word or that right melody to make it lift and make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> perfect emotion." [...] "This Kiss" [...] was recorded at Party Rock Studio with Redfoo in 2012 after Redfoo recorded ideas at Sonic Vista Studios Ibiza, Spain, and was released as the second single from Kiss on September 10, 2012. [...] "This Kiss" [...] is a mid-tempo dance-pop track which lyrically speaks about a kiss being something Jepsen can't resist and the lips of her beloved, featuring lyrics such as [...] "This kiss is something I can't resist/ Your lips are undeniable/This kiss is something I can't risk/Your heart is unreliable" [...] during the chorus. Carl Williot of Idolator compared the lyrics to the ones of Hall & Oates' [...] "Kiss on My List" [...] (1981).|$|E
