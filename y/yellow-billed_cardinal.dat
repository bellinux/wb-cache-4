The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>cardinal</b> could be easily confused with the red-crested cardinal. The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>cardinal</b> does not have a crest.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>cardinal</b> (Paroaria capitata) is a {{bird species}} in the tanager family (Thraupidae). It was {{formerly}} placed in the Emberizidae and is not very {{closely related to the}} cardinals proper (Cardinalidae).|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>cardinal</b> (P. capitata) {{could be}} easily {{confused}} with the red-crested cardinal; both the red-cowled and yellow-billed have a very short crest that is not visible except in excited birds, {{and in the case}} of the latter, a black throat, darker upper parts and a bright yellow bill.|$|E
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. The objectives of this survey for lowland birds in Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park (HAVO) were to (1) document at least 90 % of bird species present, (2) estimate relative abundance and distribution of species, and (3) establish baseline information to use for future monitoring in the park. Results were derived from both area search and line transect methodologies. Counts were conducted on 25 days between 14 April and 14 July 2005. Our diversity index indicates that the HAVO lowland bird assemblage is relatively diverse and comprised of 25 species, including nine natives and 16 non-natives. We observed more than 80 % of the bird species expected to inhabit lowland areas of HAVO. Most species, including both native and non-natives, were relatively rare and were observed at only a few sites or transects. No federally listed endangered species were detected during our surveys. Extra search effort was given to detect the introduced Close-barred Francolin (Francolinus adspersus), but we conclude that the species, once found in the park, is no longer present. We documented the presence of two species new to HAVO, the <b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>Cardinal</b> (Paroaria capitata) and Yellow-fronted Canary (Serinus mozambicus). We make recommendations of sampling effort for future monitoring of the lowland bird community in HAVO. This project was carried out under a cooperative agreement (No. H 8080040012, task agreement No. J 8080040035) with the University of Hawaii at Manoa...|$|E
