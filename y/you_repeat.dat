You say it enough, <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> the lie, <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> the lie, <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's {{the same kind}} of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. You tell a lie over and over again. And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.|$|E

Following the events of September 11, Jackson rewrote [...] "What More Can I Give" [...] and expressed his views on the song, writing and music. [...] "I'm not one to sit back and say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to bring us together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> over and over.

2500|$|Many {{studies have}} used {{versions}} of the PRMQ since it was created. For example, the study by Crawford et al. (2003) used a PRMQ to test memory of {{a sample of the}} general adult population ranging in age from 17 to 94. Many questions are used to test all possible combinations of the different memory types assessed by the PRMQ. For example, questions such as [...] "Do you decide to do something in a few minutes' time and then forget to do it?" [...] assessed prospective memory, short-term memory, and self-cued memory. Questions such as [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> the same story to the same person on different occasions?" [...] assessed retrospective memory, long-term memory, and environmentally-cued memory.|$|E
2500|$|When CNN {{presenter}} Jeff Greenfield {{was asked}} why Chomsky was never on his show, {{he claimed that}} Chomsky might [...] "be {{one of the leading}} intellectuals who can't talk on television. [...] If you got a 22-minute show, and a guy takes five minutes to warm up, [...] he's out". Greenfield described this need to [...] "say things between two commercials" [...] as the media's requirement for [...] "concision". Chomsky has elaborated on this, saying that [...] "the beauty of [...] is that you can only repeat conventional thoughts. If <b>you</b> <b>repeat</b> conventional thoughts, you require zero evidence, like saying Osama Bin Laden is a bad guy, no evidence is required. However, if you say something that is true, although not a conventional truth, like the United States attacked South Vietnam, people are going to rightfully want evidence, {{and a whole lot of}} it, as they should. The format of the shows do not allow this type of evidence which is one of the reasons concision is critical." [...] He's continued that if the media were better propagandists they would invite dissidents to speak more often because the time restraint would stop them from properly explaining their radical views and they [...] "would sound like they were from Neptune." [...] For this reason, Chomsky rejects many offers to appear on TV, preferring the written medium.|$|E
