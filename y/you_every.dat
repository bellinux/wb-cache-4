[...] He seems to have loved Royston and spent considerable time there, hunting and feasting and enjoying himself—so much so that his favourite dog, Jowler, returned one evening with a note tied to his collar. [...] The note read: [...] "Good Mr Jowler, we pray you {{to speak to the}} King (for he hears <b>you</b> <b>every</b> day and so he doth not us) that it will please His Majesty to go back to London, for else the country will be undone; all our provision is spent already and we are not able to entertain him longer." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford <b>you</b> <b>every</b> facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|GamePro rated it {{a perfect}} 5 out of 5 score in its March 1992 issue. The {{reviewer}} Monty Haul {{stated that it}} [...] "truly redefines the standards for fantasy adventure games," [...] proclaiming that [...] "one-dimensional characters, needless hack 'em combat, and linear gameplay will be things of the past if other RPGs learn a lesson or two from this cart," [...] concluding that it [...] "is one small step for Square Soft, and one giant leap for SNES role-playing games." [...] In the November 1993 issue of Dragon, Sandy Petersen gave it an [...] "Excellent" [...] rating. He criticized the [...] "stylized" [...] combat system and the graphics as [...] "inferior" [...] to Zelda, but praised how every [...] "spell has a different on-screen effect" [...] and the difficulty for being [...] "just about right" [...] where bosses [...] "nearly beat <b>you</b> <b>every</b> time" [...] unlike other RPG's such as Ultima where [...] enough [...] "adventuring" [...] {{makes it possible to}} [...] "trash" [...] enemies [...] "with ease." [...] He praised the [...] "great" [...] music, preferring it over Zelda, stating what it [...] "lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in sound." [...] He praised the story in particular, noting that, in a departure from other RPGs where the party always [...] "sticks together through thick and thin," [...] the characters have their own motives for joining and leaving the group, with one that [...] "even betrays" [...] them. He stated that it is like [...] "following the storyline of a fantasy novel," [...] comparing it to The Lord of the Rings and Man in the Iron Mask, concluding that, because [...] "the characters often spoke up for themselves," [...] he [...] "got much more attached" [...] to the party [...] "than in any other computer game." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing <b>you</b> <b>every</b> day?
