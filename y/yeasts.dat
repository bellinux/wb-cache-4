5|$|On the {{practical}} side, microbes {{have been used}} in activities from biological warfare to fermentation in food processing; bread, beer and wine have been produced by <b>yeasts</b> from the dawn of civilisation, such as in ancient Egypt. Microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are important as pathogens, causing disease to humans, crop plants, and domestic animals. Fermentation is an important source of chemicals, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including enzymes and bioactive molecules such as hormones and competitive inhibitors for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as ethanol and methane; fuels may also be produced by algae. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in sewage treatment. In scientific research, <b>yeasts</b> serve as model organisms especially in genetics and related fields.|$|E

However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., <b>yeasts)</b> undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

40|$|This profile {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} <b>yeast</b> production industry with particular emphasis on the production of baker's <b>yeast.</b> <b>Yeast</b> can be obtained either as the primary product of a process, {{as in the case}} of baker's <b>yeast,</b> or as a secondary or by-product from alcoholic fermentations. Secondary <b>yeast</b> is usually preferred to primary <b>yeast</b> for use as animal feed for reasons of economy. Carbohydrates in the form of molasses or hydrolysed starches are the most commonly used substrates for <b>yeast</b> growth. Carbohydrate-containing waste streams from other processes and n-paraffins from oil have also been exploited for the production of feed <b>yeast.</b> Processes for the production of primary <b>yeast</b> vary but basically consist of materials preparation, seed <b>yeast</b> production, fermentation, <b>yeast</b> separation and pressing or drying steps, depending on the type of <b>yeast</b> required. About half a million tonnes are thought to be produced annually, slightly under half as baker's <b>yeast.</b> The size of plant can vary from half a tonne per day upwards.
