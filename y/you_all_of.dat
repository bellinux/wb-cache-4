25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about to, just give <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|E

500|$|Iginla {{responded to}} being named captain by {{capturing}} his second Rocket Richard Trophy, sharing the goal-scoring title with Ilya Kovalchuk and Rick Nash with 41goals. The Flames {{qualified for the}} 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs as the sixth seed, the team's first playoff appearance in eight years. Iginla led all playoff scorers with 13goals as he captained the Flames to their first Stanley Cup finals appearance in 15years. The Flames were unable to defeat the Tampa Bay Lightning, however, falling to the Eastern Conference champions in seven games. A dejected Iginla sat in the Flames locker room after the final game and was met by his father, who told his son that [...] "I'm proud of <b>you.</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> Canada is proud of you." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{politics}} and message in Harry Potter, Rowling explained, [...] "I wanted Harry to leave our world and find exactly the same problems in the wizarding world. So you have the intent to impose a hierarchy, you have bigotry, and this notion of purity, which is this great fallacy, but it crops {{up all over the}} world. People like to think themselves superior and that if they can pride themselves in nothing else they can pride themselves on perceived purity[...] It wasn't really exclusively that. I think you can see in the Ministry even before it's taken over, there are parallels to regimes we all know and love." [...] She also said, [...] "You should question authority and you should not assume that the establishment or the press tells <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the truth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on <b>you,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E
