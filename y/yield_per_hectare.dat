5|$|Like most of India, {{agriculture}} {{is one of}} the most significant sectors of the economy of Uttarakhand. Basmati rice, wheat, soybeans, groundnuts, coarse cereals, pulses, and oil seeds are the most widely grown crops. Fruits like apples, oranges, pears, peaches, litchis, and plums are widely grown and important to the large food processing industry. Agricultural export zones have been set up in the state for leechi, horticulture, herbs, medicinal plants, and basmati rice. During 2010, wheat production was 831 thousand tonnes and rice production was 610 thousand tonnes, while the main cash crop of the state, sugarcane, had a production of 5058 thousand tonnes. As 86% of the state consists of hills, the <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> is not very high. 86% of all croplands are in the plains while the remaining is from the hills.|$|E
25|$|For {{the year}} 1998, {{production}} of palay, the primary crop of the province, registered {{a total of}} 177,521 metric tons (mt.) or 4,438,025 cavans from 58,847 hectares with an average yield of 3.02 metric tons per hectare. An increase of 8,280 mt. or 16.37 percent over last years (1997) production was observed because the area harvested has increased by 9,822 hectares or 5.86 percent. However, the average <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> decreased by 0.3 mt. per hectare or 0.09 percent. The average <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> for irrigated lands is 3.39 mt., 2.63 mt. for rain-fed farms, and 1.57 for upland areas. The province regularly harvests enough to feed its population. This year, there is a surplus of 83,756 mt. or 2,093,900 cavans of palay.|$|E

25|$|Alfalfa {{is widely}} grown {{throughout}} the world as forage for cattle, and is most often harvested as hay, but can also be made into silage, grazed, or fed as greenchop. Alfalfa usually has the highest feeding value of all common hay crops. It is used less frequently as pasture. When grown on soils where it is well-adapted, alfalfa is often the highest-yielding forage plant, but its primary benefit is the combination of high <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> and high nutritional quality.|$|E
25|$|Between 1991 and 2000, {{the total}} area of forest {{lost in the}} Amazon rose from , {{with most of the}} lost forest {{becoming}} pasture for cattle. Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New research however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the <b>yield</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> becomes. So despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.|$|E

Its diffusion is probably due to its great productivity, vigor and suitability to different forms of training with high <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Its first documented citation dates back to 1825 in Acerbi’s work “delle viti italiane” (Acerbi 1825).|$|R

50|$|Extensive farming most {{commonly}} refers to sheep and cattle farming {{in areas with}} low agricultural productivity, but can also refer to large-scale growing of wheat, barley, cooking oils and other grain crops in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin. Here, owing to the extreme age and poverty of the soils, <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> are very low, but the flat terrain and very large farm sizes mean <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> unit of labour are high. Nomadic herding is an extreme example of extensive farming, where herders move their animals to use feed from occasional rainfalls.|$|R

It is estimated that over 11, 000, 000 hectares were seeded during the 1985 - 1986 Canadian crop year (Agriculture Canada, 1986). Statistics indicate that average wheat <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> have steadily increased throughout the world (Hanson, et al., 1982).

40|$|There is {{a crisis}} over rising food prices and {{increasing}} food shortages in Africa that has once again focused world attention {{on the problems of}} agricultural production in Africa. Over much of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) food production still fails to meet the basic needs of many millions of people. Why is it {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century that in so much of SSA food production has remained stubbornly low? Since the 1960 s, food production in Africa has risen modestly, but almost entirely through increasing the area under cultivation (Evensin & Collin 2003), with average <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> for most major crops remaining around 500 - 700 kg <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> (Anon 2004). This is in marked contrast to the situation in Asia and South America where the adoption of new technology, the “Green Revolution”, has boosted average <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> to two or three times that level and has helped lift many countries such as India, once chronically prone to famine, out of food insecurity. This issue, the causes of low agricultural productivity in Africa, is at the heart of a major development question: why is there still food insecurity for much of SSA? And it begs the further question of why agricultural research has had so little impact in erasing the spectre of food shortages across SSA...|$|R

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} milk production, organic milk production tends {{to have lower}} eutrophication potential per ton of milk or <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop <b>yields</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms.
