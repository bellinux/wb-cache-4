2500|$|The Gemara {{interpreted}} the words [...] "knowing {{the mind of}} the most High" [...] in [...] to mean that Balaam knew how to tell the exact moment when God was angry. [...] The Gemara taught that this was related to what Micah meant (in [...] in the haftarah for the parashah) when he told the Israelites (quoting God): [...] "O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; [...] [...] [...] that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>know</b> the righteous acts of the Lord." [...] The Gemara taught that by the words [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>know</b> the righteous acts of the Lord," [...] God meant to say to the Israelites, [...] "You should know how many acts of charity I performed for you, in that I did not become angry all that time, in the days of wicked Balaam; for had I become angry at that time, no Israelite would have remained alive or been spared." [...] And the Gemara indicated that this is why Balaam told Balak in [...] "How can I curse whom God has not cursed? or how shall I become angry, when the Lord has not become angry?" [...] For Balaam knew that God was not angry at the Israelites. [...] The Gemara thus concluded that for all of the time of the Balaam story, God had not been angry.|$|E
