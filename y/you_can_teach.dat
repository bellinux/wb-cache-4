500|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} in the England team following his club move to Notts County, and in doing so became the first Third Division footballer to represent England when he scored from the penalty spot in a 4–2 win over Sweden on 19 November. However he only won three further caps in 1948, his final appearance coming in a 0–0 draw with Denmark in Copenhagen on 26 September. He had become increasingly disillusioned with the England set-up, and told Winterbottom that [...] "if you think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> Stanley Matthews to play on the wing and me how to score goals, you've got another think coming!" [...] Winterbottom was also frustrated by Lawton's smoking habit, and preferred Jackie Milburn ahead of Lawton. Hopes of any future comeback were ended by the emergence of powerful centre-forward Nat Lofthouse, who made his England debut in November 1950.|$|E

2500|$|Ram {{was trained}} by Ronen Moralli at the Israel Tennis Centers in Jerusalem. [...] "My first {{inspiration}} was Jo Jo Lizmi, the famous Jerusalem tennis coach, who showed {{me all the}} basic techniques. I was with him {{four or five years}} and he taught me everything – how to hold the racket, forehand, and backhand. He was very tough." [...] "But the man who really developed my game was Ronen Moralli", says Ram. [...] "He was with me in Jerusalem from when I was 10 years old, but then he moved to Wingate as the national coach." [...] Moralli recalls: [...] "When I worked with Andy at the Jerusalem Tennis Center he was very very energetic and full of passion. [...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have it or you don't. [...] <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{next step}} in the {{learning}} to read process is the novice reading stage [...] also known as selective association. [...] This begins with the child learning to decode print and understanding the meaning of what has been decoded. To do this, the child must first figure out the Alphabetic principle and master it in only a few years. Most children know that the words on a page in a book mean something, but do not readily understand how the letters code the meaning. [...] They know that these words are made of the sounds of their particular language, and that letters convey these sounds. [...] Novice readers learn to hear and manipulate the smaller sounds into syllables and words. If a child is able to master this skill, called phonological awareness, {{it is one of the}} best predictors of a child's success in learning to read. One way that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>teach</b> children to become more aware of sounds within words is through such things as nursery rhymes that enhance the child's ability to hear and divide the structure of words. [...] Another way to teach a child to read is through little [...] "games" [...] in which the sounds in word are either clapped, written or danced to a beat. A novice reader will also memorize the most common letter patterns in their own language and most of the frequent words that will not necessarily follow the phonological rules such as in English the words [...] "have" [...] and [...] "who". It is in this stage that children will develop a vocabulary of words that is between 2,500 and 5,000 words. Children's vocabularies continue to grow as they enter elementary school, since they will continue to learn new words at a rate of about seven words per day. This shows that at this stage in reading the best piece of advice is to just practice, practice, practice or read, read more, and read again.|$|E
