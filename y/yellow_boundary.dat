When Catalina (Carolina Gaitán) is born, her father Albeiro Marín (Fabián Ríos) and mother Hilda Santana fear she will share her late older sister's fate, as many of the young women in their neighborhood have historically become involved with prostitution and organized crime. In order to protect their daughter, Albeiro and Hilda paint a <b>yellow</b> <b>boundary</b> line outside of their home, forbidding Catalina from crossing it. Catalina then {{falls in love with a}} boy named Hernán Darío (Juan Pablo Urrego). After witnessing an attack upon Hernán Darío by Yésica Beltrán's (Majida Issa) bodyguards, Catalina crosses the yellow line to defend Dario from them. Hilda and Albeiro intervene to defend their daughter and are apprehended by the bodyguards. Yésica, resentful of Hilda, Albeiro, and Catalina, then orders her men to plant jewelry in Hilda's house in order to incriminate them of a crime they didn't commit. The police, by Yésica's orders, arrest Hernán Darío, Catalina, Dona Hilda, and Albeiro, incarcerating them in different prisons. Catalina is sent to a prison institution, where she is beaten by the fellow inmates and guards and nearly drowned. Hernán Darío is beaten and humiliated as well until Yésica and her daughter Daniela (Johanna Fadul) force him to work for them, threatening to hurt his family. Albeiro, along with fellow inmate David, plots to break out of prison in order to escape. Journalist Daniel Cerón helps Catalina and her parents escape, but Hernán Darío, convinced that Catalina is still in prison and in danger, agrees to work for Yésica's daughter Daniela. Daniela, deeply infatuated with Hernán Darío and viciously jealous of his relationship with Catalina, continually attempts to seduce Darío while in her employ.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{symmetric}} KL divergence based agglomerative clustering framework to segment mul-tiple levels of depigmentation in Vitiligo images. The pro-posed framework starts with a simple merge cost based on symmetric KL divergence. We extend the recent body of work related to Bregman divergence based agglomerative clustering and prove that the symmetric KL divergence is an upper-bound for uni-modal Gaussian distributions. This leads to a very powerful yet elegant method for bottom-up agglomerative clustering with strong theoretical guaran-tees. We introduce albedo and reflectance fields as features for the distance computations. We compare against other established methods to bring out possible {{pros and cons of}} the proposed method.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} {{statistical}} color model of background extraction based on Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space instead of RGB which shows {{better use of}} the color information. HSV color space corresponds closely to the human perception of color and it has revealed more accuracy to distinguish shadows. The key feature of this segmentation method is processing hue component of HSV on image. The components of HSV are efficiently analyzed and treated separately so that the proposed algorithm can adapt to different environmental illumination conditions and shadows. Polar and linear statistical operations have been applied to extract the background from the video frames. Morphological operations are used to reduce the noise of foreground of the input frame. Label matrix has been determined for finding the object region in the foreground image. The proposed system considered age (duration of object existence) of the objects, misses, potential detections and potential for meeting stationary objects criterions. Finally, detected objects have been indicated with <b>yellow</b> <b>boundary</b> and frame number. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed foreground segmentation method can automatically segment video objects robustly and accurately in various illuminating and shadow environments.

40|$|Sensory Responsive Objects' were {{a series}} of works {{designed}} by Philippa Brock, Samuel Plant Dempsey and Priti Veja This collaboration brought together three researchers who had not previously worked together on textiles, but who all share an interest in smart materials. The collaboration has been as much {{about the process of}} the collaboration as it was the outcomes. Many ideas were discussed during the initial phases of the project, and the designers were particularly interested in exploring sensory experiences on the London underground – haptic, visual and sound for woven jacquard design. The designers discussed how these specific senses (haptic, visual and sound) respond and interact to sensory signal data on the London underground. Using the idea of contrasts for visual aids, tactility of moquette seat fabrics and platform blisters, and sounds of announcements, these ideas were further progressed into the design ideation phase using ludic methodology for design thinking. The designers collected a range of small analogue and digital toys/ objects, reactive materials and electronic components, that would help inform design thinking via hacking, making and linking key sensory themes of haptic, visual and sound. Some of the key objects that worked towards the final outcomes included: −	Digibirds – digital toy birds that respond by singing and moving when sensing sound −	Analog music machine – sound response to a punch card data when wound through analog music machine (reading a punch card relating back to jacquard data) −	Stereo earphones – digital music earphones −	Bike light – reflective and flashing mode bicycle safety light −	Tactile materials and yarns – materials including rubber, paper, mohair, plastics, monofilaments, vibration motors, reflective yarn, phosphorescent yarn, wire, chenille, polyester, UV-reactive −	E-textile materials – conductive yarn and sensory output components (LEDs, buzzers, pressure sensors, actuated soft circuits) Although multiple ideas were inspired by the ‘hacking and making’ session, only specific ones were taken through for jacquard design. The final jacquard designs were reflective QR code, multi-haptic graphic jacquard, giant speaker, digibird graphic e-textile tracks, mind the gap music/braille code. Each jacquard outcome is explained as follows: •	Reflective QR code (Sensory response: SIGHT) Visual contrasts to aid clarity and visibility are vital on Transport for London designs. This jacquard outcome grew from how visual contrasts could be transformed as data, and led to the idea of QR codes (digital data as a visual response). The graphics of QR codes are usually a black and white code, read by a digital reader much like a serial barcode. The contrast between the dark and light space is what enables the code to be encrypted to a weblink. Generating a QR code for the @WeavingFutures twitter handle resulted in the visual graphic. Pattern manipulation in some of the idle code areas enabled swirl pattern aesthetics. The QR code was woven in reflective yarn and phosphorescent yarn to give multiple visual contrasts effects depending on the lighting condition viewed in, while still working as an active code. •	Multi-haptic graphic jacquard (Sensory response: HAPTIC & SIGHT) A photograph of the iconic ‘mind the gap’ text between the train and platform, enabled the designers to think about the multiple details integrated in this one image i. e. text, <b>yellow</b> <b>boundary</b> lines, paving indentations. Every detail served a purpose, thus the jacquard translation could also respond via multiple tactile materials (e. g. mohair - furry, polyester -smooth/shiny, matt chenille - soft/moquette like, yellow - reflective) while still keeping the ‘mind the gap’ text in a single woven design. •	Giant speaker (Sensory response: SOUND & SIGHT) This sample was a reaction to all the sound data on the London underground. When hacking the digibird and earphones, small speakers play an integral part of these functions. One of the physical qualities required for a speaker are coils of copper around a magnetic field. This could be translated as a literal spiral graphic and specifically designed structures, which would enable the piece to operate as a speaker. A giant coil was woven and requires connection to active sound source and magnetic field. In addition, this piece is also woven with a UV-reactive yarn to change visually when exposed to UV light. •	Digibird graphic e-textile tracks (Sensory response: SIGHT, SOUND & HAPTIC) The digibirds were integral to inspire many trails of thought during the residency. The dissected digibirds enabled the designers to study the internal ‘guts’ and understand the methods of connections and actuation. The visual photograph of the step-by-step dissection was used as the graphic for the jacquard design, with multiple tactile yarns. Disguised amongst the aesthetic design, multiple conductive yarn tracks were woven in to act as a fabric electronic breadboard. The piece is able to connect to a circuit of multiple electronic outputs to emulate to multiple outputs of the digibirds. •	Mind the gap music code (Sensory response: SIGHT & HAPTIC) The wind up analog music machine inspired this piece. The punch card system that operates the music machine requires holes to be punched in a specific sequence to play notes/ tunes. The visual aesthetic of the punched music card resembled that of braille, leading the designers to research and analyse the configuration of the braille alphabet. The 2 x 3 dot configuration that can make any braille letter could be reconfigured as a linear 1 x 6; hence, each braille alphabet letter could be translated as a punch card music machine sound/ note. Using this method, phrases from the London underground were translated as complete tunes, including ‘mind the gap’. The visual aesthetic of this translated braille to music machine notes were woven as a jacquard design in this piece. The braille-music note hybrid coded dots were woven in structures that enabled raised surfaces, relating back to the original haptic of braille...|$|E

50|$|At that time, Later Tang was at {{a crucial}} {{juncture}} in Emperor Zhuangzong's long-term war against Later Liang — while Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan had recently launched a successful surprise attack against Later Liang's Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), capturing it, the two states were largely stalemated on the <b>Yellow</b> River <b>boundary.</b> (Tianping was south of the Yellow River, but Later Liang had recently captured Later Tang's key garrisons Wei Prefecture (衛州, in modern Puyang, Henan) and Liyang (黎陽, in modern Hebi, Henan), north of the Yellow River, and Li Sizhao's son and successor Li Jitao had rebelled against Emperor Zhuangzong and submitted to Later Liang recently.) At that time, the Later Tang army's military supplies were low, and there were rumors of an impending major Khitan attack to the north. Li Shaohong advocated negotiating a peace accord with Later Liang — exchanging Tianping for Wei Prefecture and Liyang, with the two states formally setting their <b>boundary</b> at the <b>Yellow</b> River. Guo opposed, however, believing {{that this was the}} time to use Tianping as a launchpad to destroy Later Liang. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed with Guo, and shortly after launched a surprise attack from Tianping against the Later Liang capital Daliang. Daliang was caught defenseless, and the Later Liang emperor Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang. Emperor Zhuangzong, while praising Guo and Li Siyuan for their contributions in this victory, did not demote or punish Li Shaohong.|$|R
40|$|Campi Flegrei is a densely {{populated}} active volcanic fi eld. Two major explosive volcanic events {{have led to}} the formation of nested calderas. Detailed stratigraphy of the volcanic rocks outcropping in part of this area contributes toward a better understanding and defi nition of the volcanic hazard. Our research activity focuses on the southwestern sector of Campi Flegrei including Procida Island. This area is particularly suitable for stratigraphic reconstruction due to the thick pyroclastic sequences exposed on the coastal cliffs. These sequences include several paleosol horizons and substantially represent the products of all the volcanic activity of Campi Flegrei. The onset of volcanic activity in this area is represented by products related to the activity of scattered vents of unconstrained age. From 74 to 55 ka, they were mantled by products erupted in the nearby island of Ischia. Circa 39 ka, the Campanian Ignimbrite eruption occurred in the Campi Flegrei area, producing a large caldera. A thick succession of welded pyroclasts, lithic breccias, and associated ash- and pumice-flow deposits was emplaced in the proximal area. The local activity resumed at 19 – 17 ka with the formation of monogenetic volcanoes. A phreatoplinian eruption (Neapolitan Yellow Tuff) occurred at 15 ka, which produced a second, nested caldera. Stratified yellow tuff volcanoes, ranging in age between 9 and 5 ka, developed along the Neapolitan <b>Yellow</b> Tuff caldera <b>boundary.</b> Minor tephra layers testify to the fi nal explosive activity vented in this area...|$|R
40|$|In Part 1, we {{separated}} surface ozone time series collected from EPA monitoring sites {{in and around}} Georgia from 1980 - 2002 using a Kolmogorov -Zurbenko Filter to assess the influences associated with characteristic timescales to the overall variability of ozone for individual communities. Comparison of time scale variabilities supports that the diurnal and synoptic variation are most influential timescales in small and large urban and rural locations, with the synoptic scale variation decreasing {{with the increase of}} urban size. We define boundaries of influence due to a communitys local chemistry and due to transport by utilizing the diurnal and synoptic ozone timescales respectively. We used the synoptic scale to evaluate the boundaries of similarity among sites that share synoptic scale trends due to transport. Results showed two-phased correlation decay with distance from urban centers. We evaluate the diurnal timescale as a means of evaluating the influence of an areas photochemistry, separated from long-range transport mechanisms. We consider isolation of the diurnal timescale extrapolated spatially for a relative sensitivity analysis based on ozone with respect to concentrations of the precursor group NOy. Results show differences base on urban scale and can define photochemical boundaries. In Part 2, a Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler with an anion/cation chromatograph (PILS-IC) was used to evaluate the fine particle desert dust mixed with urban pollution during the Asian Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia). Three flights in the <b>Yellow</b> Sea <b>boundary</b> layer captured high mineral dust mixed with pollutants from Asian urban centers. Results report on the fine particle ionic compositions and chemical evolution of dust and pollution during those flights. The main component of water-soluble mineral dust was Ca 2 + with Mg 2 +, which existed with significant fractions in the form of carbonates. Nitrate and sulfate measured after transport of nearly half a day, were connected to ammonium or potassium, the rest likely associated with mineral dust. Initial mass accommodation coefficients much less than 0. 1 for uptake of SO 2 or HNO 3 by mineral dust in urban plumes containing fossil fuel and biomass burning emissions could explain the observations. The data suggest a dependence of accommodation coefficient on relative humidity. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Rodney J. Weber; Committee Member: Ellery Ingall; Committee Member: Judith A.

40|$|The Oman Mountains {{provide some}} of the best {{sections}} of Permian and Triassic sediments from ocean sea floor to base-of-slope environments related to the distal South Tethyan margin. The central part of the range exposes the Buday'ah section of oceanic sediments in the so-called "Hawasina allochtons". The locality of Wadi Maqam in the north-western part of the Oman Mountains is among places where the thick Permian-Triassic base-of-slope sediments is exposed (Baud et al., 2001). Overlying 400 m of middle Permian limestones and dolomites, the upper Permian sediments consist of 50 m of ≈ 10 cm thick beds of cherts and dolomites rich in sponge spicules. The top of the Permian units is well bioturbated lime mudstone-wackestone, devoid of cherts and dated as late Changhsingian (Krystyn in Richoz et al., 2005). The <b>boundary</b> <b>yellow</b> shales are overlain by very thinly bedded, laminated microbial platy lime mudstone with H. parvus. The dramatic loss of the burrowing infauna indicates the appearance of oxygen-poor water. These Induan sediments are about 25 m thick and show at the top the first calcirudites, commonly clast-supported (edge-wise conglomerates), and are characterized by tabular clasts representing the sub- in situ reworking of the laminated, platy calcilutite. The very thick Smithian overlying litho-unit (up to 900 m) marks the onset on the base-of-slope of a deep-marine basin in which carbonate submarine fan deposits developed This very thick unit consists essentially of platy limestones, calcarenites and calcirudites. It comprises mainly grey-beige calcilutite, laminated and flaggy, interbedded with sparse beds of fine-grained calcarenite in cm beds. Channelized beds of intraformational calcirudite are also part of this succession which constitutes the greater part of the outcrop available. During the Spathian to Anisian, the sedimentation changes to terrigenous mudstone and siltstone that ended with Ladinian radiolarites...|$|R
