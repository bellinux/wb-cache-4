500|$|In two {{interviews}} {{describing the}} series Chi's creators, Clamp, {{said it would}} be much easier if computers could speak to <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> had errors. Chi is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The manga and anime follow Hideki's find of Chi and their relationship, but differ in the storyline. Chi's critical reception has been mostly positive, with reviewers calling her [...] "cute". In addition to Chobits, she is also a crossover character in the series [...] and is referenced in other works.|$|E
500|$|The fourth error, {{according}} to Peter the Venerable, {{was that the}} Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, [...] rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone {{the doctrine of the}} real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation. â€œThey deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, do not believe the bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so {{in the office of the}} altar, deceive <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> falsely profess to make the body of Christ, and give it to you for the salvation of your souls.'" [...] The term [...] "transubstantiation", used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. In less than two centuries, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.|$|E
