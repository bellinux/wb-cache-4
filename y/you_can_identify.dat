5|$|Subdivision {{surfaces}} in computer graphics use subdivision rules to refine a surface to any given level of precision. These subdivision surfaces (such as the Catmull-Clark subdivision surface) take a polygon mesh (the kind used in 3D animated movies) and refines it to a mesh with more polygons by adding and shifting points according to different recursive formulas. Although many points get shifted in this process, each new mesh is combinatorially a subdivision {{of the old}} mesh (meaning that for every edge and vertex of the old mesh, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> a corresponding edge and vertex in the new one, plus several more edges and vertices).|$|E

6000|$|At {{about two}} Sam and Carry {{were told to}} go into Court, and way was made for the old man to {{accompany}} them. At that moment the cross-examination was being continued of the man who, early on the Sunday morning, had seen the Grinder with his companion in the cart on the road leading towards Pycroft Common. A big burly barrister, with a broad forehead and grey eyes, was questioning this witness as to {{the identity of the}} men in the cart; and at every answer that he received he turned round to the jury as though he would say [...] "There, then, what do you think of the case now, when such a man as that is brought before you to give evidence?" [...] "You will swear, then, that these two men who are here in the dock were the two men you saw that morning in that cart?" [...] The witness said that he would so swear. [...] "You knew them both before, of course?" [...] The witness declared that he had never seen either of them before in his life. [...] "And you expect the jury to believe, now that the lives of these men depend on their believing it, that after the lapse of a year <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>identify</b> these two men, whom you had never seen before, and who were at that time being carried along the road at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour?" [...] The witness, who had already encountered a good many of these questions, and who was inclined to be rough rather than timid, said that he didn't care twopence what the jury believed. It was simply his business to tell what he knew. Then the judge looked at that wicked witness,--who had talked in this wretched, jeering way about twopence!--looked at him over his spectacles, and shaking his head as though with pity at that witness's wickedness, cautioned him as to the peril of his body, making, too, a marked reference to the peril of his soul by that melancholy wagging of the head. Then the burly barrister with the broad forehead looked up beseechingly to the jury. Was it right that any man should be hung for any offence against whom such a witness as this was brought up to give testimony? It was the manifest feeling of the crowd in the court that the witness himself ought to be hung immediately. [...] "You may go down, sir," [...] said the burly barrister, giving an impression to those who looked on, but did not understand, that the case was over as far as it depended on that man's evidence. The burly barrister himself was not so sanguine. He knew very well that the judge who had wagged his head in so melancholy a way at the iniquity of a witness who had dared to say that he didn't care twopence, would, when he was summing up, refer to the presence of the two prisoners in the cart as a thing fairly supported by evidence. The amount of the burly barrister's achievement was simply this,--that for the moment a sort of sympathy was excited on behalf of the prisoners by the disapprobation which was aroused against the wicked man who hadn't cared twopence. Sympathy, like electricity, will run so quick that no man may stop it. If sympathy might be made to run through the jury-box there might perchance be a man or two there weak enough to entertain it to the prejudice of his duty on that day. The hopes of the burly barrister in this matter did not go further than that.|$|E
