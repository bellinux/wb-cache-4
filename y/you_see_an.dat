25|$|Upamāṇa (उपमान), comparison, analogy. Some Hindu schools {{consider}} it as a proper means of knowledge. Upamana, states Lochtefeld, may be explained with {{the example of a}} traveler who has never visited lands or islands with endemic population of wildlife. He or she is told, by someone who has been there, that in those lands <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> animal that sort of looks like a cow, grazes like cow but is different from a cow in such and such way. Such use of analogy and comparison is, state the Indian epistemologists, a valid means of conditional knowledge, as it helps the traveller identify the new animal later. The subject of comparison is formally called upameyam, the object of comparison is called upamanam, while the attribute(s) are identified as samanya.|$|E

2500|$|What is now Everglades National Park {{was created}} in 1947, and is {{recently}} as 1998, {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the most endangered national park in America." [...] Some of the environmental issues facing the Everglades are, disrupted water flow, a drastic decline in the wading bird population, invasion of exotic species and the survival challenges facing the Florida panther, of which there are only 160 left in the wild, an increase from 20 wild Florida panthers in the 1970s. Additionally, species such as the wood stork, the Cape Sable seaside sparrow and the manatee have an uncertain future in the Everglades as a result of environmental issues. [...] Former Secretary of Friends of the Everglades, Sharyn Richardson said that she got started with the organization, attracted by its philosophical ideals, stating, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> injustice and you become aware of that injustice, you have to take responsibility for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2016, Beckham {{had more}} than 40 tattoos. There are names of his sons Romeo, Cruz and Brooklyn, and of his wife Victoria. His wife's name, tattooed on his left forearm, is in Hindi script because Beckham {{thought it would be}} [...] "tacky" [...] to have it in English. Unfortunately, this was misspelt as the {{equivalent}} of [...] "Vihctoria". In his autobiography David Beckham: My Side, he said that the idea of having tattoos came to him in 1999 after his son Brooklyn was born, following a conversation on the subject of tattoos with Mel B and her then-husband, Jimmy Gulzar. Beckham said: [...] "I ended up going to this Dutch guy who'd done all of Jimmy's. I'd finally realised what I wanted a tattoo to represent. Mine are all about the people in my life, my wife and sons, who I want with me always. When you see me, you see the tattoos. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>an</b> expression of how I feel about Victoria and the boys. They're part of me." ...|$|E
