500|$|Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda, the big-city pianist of {{the band}} {{providing}} the music. He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with {{a kick in the}} shins. After the party she goes to bed with Milda, although the comic frustrations continue, with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won't close, before he feels secure in making love. Afterward, as they lie in bed together, Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was [...] "angular". He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar: [...] "And you, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> guitar too", he tells her, [...] "but one painted by Picasso." [...] Before they part, he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime.|$|E
500|$|Hartley {{is quick}} to point out that before [...] "Justice", the series did not focus on [...] "the costumes and the capes, the flying and the superhero stuff", because they have their [...] "no flights, no tights" [...] rule in effect. That changed with [...] "Justice", and Hartley {{suggested}} that the actors really had to commit themselves to their roles while wearing the costumes, [...] "otherwise <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> standup comedian who doesn't like his jokes very much". Young stated that he was one of the luckiest out of the group, because he only had to wear a silver vest and regular pants, unlike Ritchson, who had to put on a [...] "onesie Speedo". Ritchson felt you could get distracted by what you were wearing, but it was best to try to take your mind off of the subject. Hartley, Ritchson, and Young stated that they felt sorry for Gallner for having to wear a costume that they believed [...] "sucked". The group described Gallner's costume as something his mom might have made with [...] "some cotton fabric and a Magic Marker".|$|E
2500|$|A blog named IHateCrocs.com {{was founded}} by two Canadian college {{students}} (one, Kate Leth, referred to the shoes as [...] "hideous"), while the website CrocFans.com documents uses of the shoes. [...] The Facebook group I Don't Care How Comfortable Crocs Are, <b>You</b> <b>Look</b> <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> Dumbass has been mentioned in the media.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{process was}} simple enough," [...] {{answered}} the Professor patiently. [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> policeman. I think so now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well said, Master Poet!' cried he of the spectacles. 'Hide {{it under}} thy cloak, sayest thou? Why, it will gleam through the holes, and make <b>thee</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jack-o'-lantern!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You stood quite still, {{for what}} seemed a long time. I saw your face {{sideways}} in the glass. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man thinking, and dissatisfied with his own thoughts." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{left the}} boat in September 1920. Without a job. Without a future, really. I accidentally met a boy who told me about an {{agricultural}} high school Choctaw County Agricultural High School. I went down and within 10 minutes of getting off the train I'd registered. The old superintendent didn't ask me one thing about my education. He didn't know if I could read or write. Said <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> big stout boy. You look like you'd make a good football player. So I was admitted as a football player. I went to that school for four years [...] reasonably basic preparation." ...|$|E
60|$|Saint. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sober {{discreet}} gentleman; {{there is}} grace in your countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe she}} did.... Ma'am, shall I call Liddy? You bain't well, ma'am, surely? <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lily--so pale and fainty!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well said, Master Poet!" [...] cried he of the spectacles. [...] "Hide {{it under}} thy cloak, sayest thou? Why, it will gleam {{through the holes}} and make <b>thee</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jack-o'-lantern!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wot are you a-roarin' at?' said Sam impetuously, {{when the}} old gentleman had {{discharged}} himself of another shout; 'making yourself so precious hot that <b>you</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> aggrawated glass-blower. Wot's the matter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "and {{cane and}} umbrella, if you like, and pocket-handkerchiefs, too. I will fit you out completely, and shall {{be glad to}} have <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> decent man." ...|$|R
60|$|HE. The tableau {{would be}} {{complete}} in its guiltiness. For Heaven's sake, Mrs Bompas, let that glove alone: <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pickpocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you came}} back, did you? Well, you don't look {{very proud of}} {{yourself}} this mawnin'. Gene Stewart, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coyote." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look as if}} you weighed {{about an}} ounce and a half. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bit of thistledown! You're a little fairy princess, dash it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{voice was}} low and not pleasant. With {{considerable}} haste the clerk took down the key, protesting, [...] "I never said <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sneak-thief. Just rules of the hotel. But if you want to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed we were, {{every one}} of us! Aunt Clara hasn't gotten over her cold yet. I slept all the next day, and <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ghost, for you'd been out every night for weeks, I think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know you}} have. Tell Mr. Beeton {{to give you}} a new suit and I'll brush it and keep it clean. You may be as blind as a barn-door, Mr. Heldar, but it doesn't excuse <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sweep.' ...|$|R
6000|$|LAWTON, as Mr. Bemis {{rises to}} his feet: 'A Gentleman of the Old School. Bemis, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{miniature}} of yourself by Malbone. Rather flattered, but--recognisable.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Topping!" [...] he said spaciously. [...] "No {{other word}} for it. All wool and a yard wide. Precisely as mother makes it. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thingummy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{an idiot}} you are!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You {{ought to be}} one of the happiest men in the world, and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> death's-head." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>You</b> might <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{friend of}} mine.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> don't <b>look</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Englishman. And {{who is that}} abortion, pray?" [...] and {{he pointed}} to Otter. [...] "I believe that you are spies, and, by the Saints, if you are, I am the man to deal with you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He hesitated, as if still {{uncertain}} of her mood from this intonation, {{and then he}} went on: [...] "But I had some little hope you would tolerate me, after all. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> friend I used to have.--Do you mind my telling you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is odd," [...] he remarked, with a {{whimsical}} smile. [...] "What the dickens {{are you doing}} in this respectable household, Arranmore? <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lost sheep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While on the subject," [...] he said, [...] "I {{suppose you}} know you don't look in the least like a lady's maid? <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{disguised}} princess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're white. Your {{eyes are}} big and purple. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> starved cannibal.... If that's what it's {{like to be}} in love--excuse me--I'll never fall for any man!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A month ago," [...] she answered, [...] "I had {{not seen}} you on your knees with a gun, seen your white face, heard the report, and seen Mr. Rochester fall. I {{had not seen}} you steal away through the bracken. Oh, it was terrible! <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> murderer! I shall never, never forget it." ...|$|R
60|$|GEOFFREY. But <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> good fairy. Mother does. You are not pretty, like mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Although {{you have}} given me no proof of your statements, which seem to be founded on conjectures, I have not said that I intend to let it drop. In the {{meantime}} I am entitled to ask for some information about yourself. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> Englishman and have not been here long. Did you leave home after the war broke out?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he {{answered}} half suspiciously; [...] "thank you very much. I think <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{man who can}} be trusted, and I will go with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Congdon gravely assented to this. [...] "You're {{perfectly}} right; that's {{the reason}} I keep our income down to fifteen hundred. I'd {{hate to see}} <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ready-made cloak advertisement." ...|$|E
60|$|Wild. Ay, by Alla, do I, most extremely: You have wit in abundance, {{you dance}} to a miracle, you sing like an angel, and, I believe, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cherubim.|$|E
6000|$|The {{little old}} lady screwed up the {{delicate}} skin about her eyes, examined Milt, and cackled, [...] "Boy, there's something wrong here. You don't belong with my family. Why, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> American. <b>You</b> haven't got an imitation monocle, and I bet you can't talk with a New York-London accent. Why, Claire, I'm ashamed of you for bringing a human being into the Boltwood-Gilson-Saxton tomb and expecting----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good afternoon, Mrs. Palmer," [...] said Murray, {{wondering}} where Mollie was. [...] "I'm {{sorry to see}} that <b>you</b> <b>look</b> something <b>like</b> <b>an</b> invalid." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Fountain: [...] "Well, <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> blue monk, <b>you</b> needn't flatter yourself, {{for there}} are none. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> like-- What are you {{thinking}} about?" ...|$|R
