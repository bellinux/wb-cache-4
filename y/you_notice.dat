25|$|I have an {{obsession}} with death and sex. Those two things are also the nexus of horror films, which I've been obsessing over lately. I’ve been watching horror movies and 1950s science fiction movies. My re-release is called The Fame Monster so I've just been sort of bulimically eating and regurgitating monster movies and all things scary. I've just been noticing a resurgence of this idea of monster, of fantasy, but {{in a very real}} way. If <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> in those films, there’s always a juxtaposition of sex with death. That's what makes it so scary. Body and mind are primed for orgasm and instead somebody gets killed. That's the sort of sick, twisted psychological circumstance.|$|E
500|$|So has {{continued}} to perform well in most retrospective reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commended So as the [...] "catchiest, happiest record he ever cut". Erlewine particularly praised Gabriel's fusion of art rock with African music and soul. Jude Rogers of the BBC wrote [...] "once you look past the bombast of [...] "Sledgehammer",... <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> how easily its artful ideas slipped inside the 80s mainstream". The Quietus Wyndham Wallace praised Sos sincerity and called it [...] "a heartfelt journey through intense emotional territory, assembled and arranged with intricacy and commitment, laboured over with such care that it sounds effortless".|$|E

500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby, in {{his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, noted that the song closed the Madonna album on a flat note. He called the music artificial, {{repetitive}} and uninspired. Don Shewey from Rolling Stone commented that [...] "At first, it [...] doesn't sound like much at all. Then <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> its one distinguishing feature, a girlish hiccup that the singer uses over and over until it's irritating as hell. Finally, you get hooked, and you start {{looking forward to that}} silly little catch in her voice." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli in his [...] commented that the song was a rhythmic call to party.|$|E
500|$|Thanks to {{developments}} in technology {{over the past}} few decades, consciousness has become a significant topic of interdisciplinary research in cognitive science, with significant contributions from fields such as psychology, anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroscience. The primary focus is on understanding what it means biologically and psychologically for information to be present in consciousness—that is, on determining the neural and psychological correlates of consciousness. [...] The majority of experimental studies assess consciousness in humans by asking subjects for a verbal report of their experiences (e.g., [...] "tell me if <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> anything when I do this"). [...] Issues of interest include phenomena such as subliminal perception, blindsight, denial of impairment, and altered states of consciousness produced by alcohol and other drugs, or spiritual or meditative techniques.|$|E
500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score for the 1980 film, the {{decision}} was made to play the music only alongside the killer so as not to trick the audience into believing that the killer was around during moments that they were not supposed to be. Manfredini explains that the lack of music for certain scenes was deliberate: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls [...] is setting up the archery area [...] One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if <b>you</b> <b>notice,</b> there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was about to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, which allowed the scare to become more effective.|$|E

500|$|... "Running to Stand Still" [...] earned {{critical}} praise upon The Joshua Trees release, {{which itself}} received very favourable reviews {{and went on}} to become the group's best-selling album. Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "After the first few times through , <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> the remarkable music... It sounds like a lovely, peaceful reverie – except that this is a junkie's reverie, and when that realization hits home, the gentle acoustic lullaby acquires a corrosive power." [...] In Time magazine's 1987 cover story on the band, Jay Cocks wrote that [...] "A U2 tune like 'Running to Stand Still', with a trancelike melody that slips over the transom of consciousness, insinuates itself into your dreams." [...] The Uncut magazine Ultimate Music Guide to U2 described the character sketch in the song as one of Bono's best. [...] The 1991 Trouser Press Record Guide, however, said that the song [...] "has mood but no presence".|$|E
500|$|There is a sharp {{contrast}} between Fink's living quarters and the polished, pristine environs of Hollywood, especially the home of Jack Lipnick. The spooky, inexplicably empty feel of the Hotel Earle was central to the Coens' conception of the movie. [...] "We wanted an art deco stylization", Joel explained in a 1991 interview, [...] "and {{a place that was}} falling into ruin after having seen better days". Barton's room is sparsely furnished with two large windows facing another building. The Coens later described the hotel as a [...] "ghost ship floating adrift, where <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> signs of the presence of other passengers, without ever laying eyes on any". In the movie, residents' shoes are an indication of this unseen presence; another rare sign of other inhabitants is the sound from adjacent rooms. Joel said: [...] "You can imagine it peopled by failed commercial travelers, with pathetic sex lives, who cry alone in their rooms".|$|E
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying.

People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them.

500|$|Wenger regards a {{well-balanced}} diet as {{an essential}} part of a player's preparation. He was influenced by his time in Japan, where [...] "the whole way of life there is linked to health. Their diet is basically boiled vegetables, fish and rice. No fat, no sugar. <b>You</b> <b>notice</b> when you live there that there are no fat people". At Arsenal, Wenger brought in dieticians to explain the benefits of a healthy lifestyle, and acquired the help of Philippe Boixel, an osteopath for the France national team, to realign the players' bodies each month. Plyometrics, exercises designed to strengthen the muscles, were introduced and Wenger routinely made players stretch before and after matches. Until 2004, he encouraged his players to take Creatine for increased stamina, later stopping when he noticed side-effects. The innovations had a desirable effect on the team as it prolonged the careers of his defence, and made Arsenal stronger {{in the second half of}} seasons. Though Wenger's methods were common in Italian football, they had been unsuccessfully trialled in England until his arrival.|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|Stone Rollin {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} was one of the year's best reviewed records. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Kellman deemed it not just a [...] "period-piece" [...] but also [...] "the high point of Saadiq’s career, his exceptional output with Tony! Toni! Toné! included", while Kevin Ritchie of Now said he exhibited [...] "the electrifying fervour and meticulous musicianship typical of his stage show" [...] on the record. Steve Horowitz from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "shows off Saadiq's genius as a singer, writer, instrumentalist, and producer of modern rhythm and blues that pays homage to its traditions", adding that it does not have [...] "a false step or even a dull note". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Saadiq [...] "plays with himself to beat the band" [...] like Prince and [...] "makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse. And then <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs." [...] However, he perceived a drop-off from The Way I See It in terms of songwriting and catchiness, singling out [...] "Go to Hell", [...] "Day Dreams", and [...] "Good Man" [...] as the highlights. Slant Magazines Matthew Cole was more critical, finding the record too involved in fabricating retro sensibilities [...] "to leave a lasting impression of its own ... even the highlights are complacent genre exercises".|$|E

500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... <b>You</b> <b>notice</b> the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until what <b>you</b> <b>notice</b> is not {{the movement}} itself but the distinctiveness of {{the bodies of the}} performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so that what you want to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do whatever it is they are doing.
