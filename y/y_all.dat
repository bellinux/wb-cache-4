But because the cancellation law holds, we can conclude that if ax = ay, then x = y, a contradiction. Therefore, our hypothesis is incorrect, and a row cannot contain the same element twice. Exactly the same argument suffices to prove the column case, and so we conclude that each row and column contains no element more than once. Because the group is finite, the pigeonhole principle guarantees that each element of the group will be represented in each row and in each column exactly once.|$|E

Given a {{mean square}} {{continuous}} stochastic vector process y with stationary increments and a rational spectral density such that (oo) is finite and nonsingular, consider {{the problem of}} finding all minimal (wide sense) Markov representations (stochastic realizations) of <b>y.</b> <b>All</b> such realizations are characterized and classified with respect to deterministic as well as probabilistic properties.
