500|$|... "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} Tove Lo {{alongside}} Alx Reuterskiöld and produced by The Struts with Reuterskiöld. It has a minimal instrumentation which incorporates [...] "a mesh of fizzing synthesizers". It was released {{as a single}} on 16 October 2013, and was later featured on the singer's debut extended play, Truth Serum (2014). According to the artist, the songs on the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship. In an interview with Coup de Main Magazine, she said that [...] "'Out Of Mind' for me {{is kind of the}} step after 'Habits'... Picked up the pieces again and now just trying to glue them back together, you know? But it never really works". She further explained, [...] "That comes after I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar. It will always be there. Those thoughts about this other person will always haunt you a bit". In another interview, she told that: ...|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Lo {{summarised}} the storyline of the EP; [...] "The song 'Love Ballad' {{is about}} the moment you decide to give everything to another person, while 'Habits' shows what happens when everything is screwed up and {{you just want to}} freak out. 'Out of Mind' deals with the stage after that, when your broken heart has mended, but the scars are still there". The EP's main genres are pop, electropop and indie pop. The Swedish edition of Truth Serum opens with [...] "Love Ballad", a pop song with drum instrumentation. It was described as a [...] "parody of love songs" [...] that talks about the [...] "carefree beginnings of a new romance". Lo also called it a [...] "way of telling the one I love I'd do anything for him". In the standard edition, the EP opens with [...] "Not on Drugs", a pop, dance and electropop song in which the artist compares falling in love to being under the influence of drugs. Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner. The electropop song [...] "Over" [...] details the part when Lo and her boyfriend end the relationship. The singer stated that it was about [...] "me making a big mistake and having to confess and come clean". [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] is a pop and electropop track which talks about the artist's hedonistic attempts to forget her former boyfriend. [...] "Out of Mind" [...] is a pop song with minimal instrumentation. According to Lo, it represents the part when [...] "I have the pain and I'm trying to get over this heartbreak. It's when <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> on and you're sort of okay, but you still have that little scar". The EP's last track is the downtempo [...] "Stay High", a remix version of [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] by record production duo Hippie Sabotage.|$|E

2500|$|In 1877, she {{had another}} success as Dona Sol in Hernani, a tragedy written 47 years earlier by Victor Hugo. Her lover {{in the play}} was her lover off-stage, as well, Mounet-Sully. Hugo himself was in the audience. The next day, he sent her a note: [...] "Madame, you were great and charming; <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> me, me the old warrior, and, at a certain moment when the public, touched and enchanted by you, applauded, I wept. The tear which you caused me to shed is yours. I place it at your feet." [...] The note was {{accompanied}} by a tear-shaped pearl on a gold bracelet.|$|E
2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{announced}} their departure from Relapse Records in 2009. The band had become {{dissatisfied with the}} music industry and music media, and decided {{to create their own}} record label to release their fourth studio album. Commenting on the dissolving [...] "indie band culture", Weinman stated, [...] "back in the day there were record labels that you trusted, loved and you bought everything on it and you discovered a lot of great new music because of it. You listen to every single song back to front a million times, it'd be worn out to death before <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> onto another record. You'd read everything in the booklet, you'd read all the lyrics, you'd read all the notes, you'd discover something new." [...] Speaking to Kerrang! about the decision, he said: [...] "The most important thing was to keep evolving and changing. We didn't want to be stuck in some long contract that won't be relevant in a few years time... Or possibly even tomorrow. So half out of necessity, half out of choice, we decided to do this ourselves. The hard part is figuring out whether you're sacrificing your creative side because you're so busy with the business. That's the challenge and we're figuring it out".|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{the term}} [...] "spyware" [...] has {{eventually}} declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices per se, but by the default settings created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, [...] on a Wall Street Journal analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of tracking users' browsing activity, linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: [...] "Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is New York Times. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also your identity within those accounts. Let's say <b>you</b> <b>moved</b> on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back {{who you are and}} that you went there." [...] The WSJ analysis was researched by Brian Kennish, founder of Disconnect, Inc.|$|E
