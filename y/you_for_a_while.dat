500|$|The {{biography}} is comprehensive, covering {{many different}} aspects of its subject's life. The author discusses Morrison's early life in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and how this influenced his perspective of [...] "no surrender", a reference to Ulster Unionism. Rogan writes how, a young boy, Morrison exhibited [...] "poor communication skills, aggressive impatience, and absence of empathy", and yearned for positive relations between his Protestant and Catholic friends. The author notes that a theme of Morrison's youth was his appreciation of music and his pleasure of creating music influenced by gospel and love. He cites Morrison's cousin Jackie Stitt who said: [...] "He {{could have been a}} good sportsman but he had no interest in it at all. He'd play along with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> until he got bored – he seemed to tire of it quickly. He'd go indoors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us {{shake hands}} for to-day," [...] she said; [...] "you have kept your promise, Jack--you have been quiet and good. I must leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Let me go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{the work}} is done. Now I, the Eating Fire, I the Messenger, get me to the West. Among <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> I cease to burn; yet {{remember}} me, for I shall come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Min, dear," [...] he said gently, [...] "you {{have been}} hurt--not seriously, I hope. I must leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute <b>while</b> I run for help--I {{will not be}} long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{with me in}} {{the pony}} carriage, Jasper. I've not had <b>a</b> drive with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> and should enjoy it so much," [...] said my lady, detaining him.|$|R
6000|$|At that he grew {{sober and}} his eyes glinted. [...] "You can't take a little fun. I'll leave <b>you</b> now <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> When I come back you'll have that suit on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will hold}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> you old loony," [...] I said to myself. I {{got up and}} lit my pipe, for I was needing a smoke. I walked around a bit, congratulating myself on my {{brilliant}} idea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. It {{makes me}} fear that <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{will be made}} miserable,--you whom I had thought that I could protect from all sorrow and from all care! O my darling! of course it frightens me; but it is for you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{first about}} your work. I know I hurt your {{feelings}} when I wouldn't listen. But I wasn't ready. I wanted to--to just be gay with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Don't think I wasn't interested. I was. And now, I'm ready {{to hear all}} about it--and everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Kirylo Sidorovitch, {{this is no}} {{laughing}} matter. They {{have left}} <b>you</b> alone <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but...! Indeed, <b>you</b> had better try to leave the country, Kirylo Sidorovitch, while there's yet time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir?" [...] said Mr. Bucket. [...] "Then {{you will}} be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment <b>while</b> I go and have half a word with him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well,” {{said the}} {{commander}} with a pleasant laugh, “my name is Julian Savine, and I have been hoping that I should come across <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while.</b> It is quite likely {{you have heard}} Miss Harding mention me.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am weary," [...] she said, [...] "and {{it may be}} that I leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to rest--beyond the mountains. A year, or a {{thousand}} years--I cannot say. If so, let Papave, with Oros as her counsellor and husband and their seed, hold my place till I return again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, when we {{come right}} down to dots, I don't suppose it is. Watch me when I leave here, and you'll {{have a chance to}} judge for yourself. I may want to leave my satchel with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and I reckon you're willing to take care of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{come with}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> to your study? I {{want to speak}} to you privately without your uncle knowing about it, or even what the subject is. You don't mind, do you? It is not idle curiosity. No, no. It is on the subject to which we are all committed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess I've {{seen the}} trouble {{trailing}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> quite <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Got to let up or play out. It's one I've been up against myself." [...] He made a vague gesture. [...] "A little rough on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the price}} I mentioned, yes," [...] said Carr; [...] "but so sure as I am a living man, if you lay your clumsy hands on me again, I’ll double it. Now, I’ll leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time <b>while</b> <b>you</b> think it over." ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor {{floating}} isle, tost on ill fortune's waves, [...] Ordain'd by fate to be {{the land}} of slaves; [...] Shall moving Delos now deep-rooted stand; [...] Thou fix'd of old, be now the moving land! [...] Although the metaphor be worn and stale, [...] Betwixt a state, and vessel under sail; [...] Let me suppose <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ship <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> [...] And thus address thee in the sailor style.|$|R
6000|$|He still lingered {{near the}} door, {{with his eyes}} fixed inquiringly on her. A man of a lower nature than his, or a man believing in Mercy less devotedly than he believed, would now have felt his first {{suspicion}} of her. Julian {{was as far as}} ever from suspecting her, even yet. [...] "Do you wish to be alone?" [...] he asked, considerately. [...] "Shall I leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and return again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, lad, it is true. It {{seems to}} have been done in her sleep, and death was instantaneous. There, I will leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> now. I will put the paper in your cabin, so that when you feel equal to reading the details you can do so. Try and think it is all for the best, lad. No one knows what trouble might have darkened her life and yours had this thing not happened. I know you {{will not be able to}} think so now, but you will feel it so some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{be killed}} soon enough," [...] the Arab said; [...] "but I want to keep <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> just to have the {{pleasure}} of showing you that girl in my hands. I was {{not good enough to}} look at her, you thought. Good or not, she shall be mine! I settled on that the first moment that I saw her. Bind him tightly and take him below. Be sure that his cords are tight. No!--tie him to the mast; we shall have the pleasure of looking at him and talking to him sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you think, Philip? Have you {{had enough}} of {{fighting}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> party who wilfully throw away all that they have won by their sacrifices? Are you thinking of returning home, or will <b>you</b> wait <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> to see how matters go on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] Mrs. Easterfield {{remarked to}} him that Sunday evening, [...] "if you must go on Tuesday, I suppose you must, {{although}} I {{think it would be}} better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> if I were to keep my eye on <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> longer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Philip!" [...] said Mr. Deane, {{when they}} entered the dining-room, [...] "I've not seen <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while.</b> Your father's not at home, I think, is he? I went after him to the office the other day, and {{they said he was}} out of town." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess that'll hold <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> George!" [...] said Finkelstein. [...] "I'll tell you, though, boys, what I did hear: George's missus {{went into}} the gents' wear {{department}} at Parcher's to buy him some collars, and before she could give his neck-size the clerk slips her some thirteens. 'How juh know the size?' says Mrs. Babbitt, and the clerk says, 'Men that let their wives buy collars for 'em always wear thirteen, madam.' How's that! That's pretty good, eh? How's that, eh? I guess that'll about fix you, George!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which the English law," [...] Father Benwell interposed, [...] "declares to be annulled by the {{marriage}} before the registrar, stands good, nevertheless, by the higher {{law of the}} Church. Mr. Winterfield is Miss Eyrecourt's husband, {{as long as they}} both live. An ordained priest performed the ceremony in a consecrated building--and Protestant marriages, so celebrated, are marriages acknowledged by the Catholic Church. Under those circumstances, the ceremony which afterward united you to Miss Eyrecourt--though neither you nor the clergyman were to blame--was a mere mockery. Need I to say any more? Shall I leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> by yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not fear, Deliverer, she {{shall be}} protected. As you know well, I hate you, and yet I keep you alive because without you she might die; therefore, for her sake be careful. Attempt no {{violence}} towards {{me or my}} father if we visit you alone, for we shall do so in order that {{she may not be}} discovered, and the moment that you lift a hand against us will be the beginning of her doom. And now I must leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> for something passes in the temple which I desire to see. If she awakes before I return, be careful not to frighten her. Farewell!" ...|$|E
5000|$|GameSpot said, [...] "If you're into micromanagement and {{can stand}} {{simplified}} combat and poor graphics, Cutthroats should {{provide you with}} enough to keep <b>you</b> happy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> But if you're looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> game that re-creates the drama and violence of 17th-century pirating, you won't find it here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You won't frighten me like that," [...] he went on. [...] "I {{am not a}} silly Kaffir, so give it up. Look here, Rachel, {{you know}} I have loved <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>while,</b> and though you treat me so badly I love you more than ever now. Will you marry me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faix, {{among them}} chaps it don't do {{to tell them}} {{too much of the}} truth. Look at that!" [...] And he brought out the sixpence again from his breeches'-pocket. [...] "And look at your reverence. Only that they've let <b>you</b> out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> they've been nigh as hard on you as though you were one of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all right. And as for you, do <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{think of}} your politics, and your speeches, and your colonies, rather than of your love. You are at home there, and no Lord Chiltern can rob you of your success. And if you are down in the mouth, come to me, and I will sing you a Scotch song. And, look you, the next time I ask you to dinner I will promise you that Mrs. Bonteen shall not be here. Good-bye." [...] She gave him her hand, which was very soft, and left {{it for a moment}} in his, and he was consoled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you {{are about}} to wake up and I must leave <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> But this I promise you, my most dear, my beloved, my own, that before you fall asleep again for the last time, you shall see me once more, for that is allowed to me. Indeed it shall be I who will soothe you to sleep and I who will receive you when you awake again. Also in the space between, {{although}} you do not see me, you will always feel me near, and I shall be with you. So swear to me once more that you will not grieve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{not one of}} the regulars," [...] he said to Vallance. [...] "I know {{tailored}} clothes when I see 'em. You {{just stopped}} for a moment on your way through the park. Don't mind my talking to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while?</b> I've got to be with somebody. I'm afraid--I'm afraid. I've told two or three of those bummers over about it. They think I'm crazy. Say--let me tell you--all I've had to eat to-day was a couple pretzels and an apple. To-morrow I'll stand in line to inherit three millions; and that restaurant you see over there with the autos around it will be too cheap for me to eat in. Don't believe it, do you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{decided not}} to croak you," [...] {{explained}} the young man. [...] "I'm just a-goin' to leave <b>you</b> here <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> They'll be lookin' all along the right o' way in a few hours--it won't be long afore they find you. Now so long, {{and take care of}} yerself, bo," [...] and Billy Byrne had gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not dead, for I {{can feel}} his heart beat feebly. One of <b>you</b> go <b>for</b> <b>a</b> physician, <b>while</b> the others help me carry {{him to the}} house." ...|$|R
6000|$|The youth flushed. [...] "Oh say!" [...] he cried; [...] "you needn't kid me {{just because}} I'm new at it. You {{all had to}} start sometime. I've always longed for the free life of a tramp; and if you'll let me go along with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while,</b> and teach me, I'll not bother you; and I'll do {{whatever}} you say." ...|$|R
