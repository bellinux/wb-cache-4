6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} that?" [...] said Cecil. [...] "Do you think my husband {{could have been}} my husband {{if he had not}} felt that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [after some hesitation] You {{have sworn}} an oath, {{see that you}} keep that oath. Boy, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know your secret, Your traffic with the Duchess? ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS DUBEDAT. Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> know? <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it {{has never}} {{happened}} before? Why does everybody turn against him? Can you not forgive him for being superior to you? for being cleverer? for being braver? for being a great artist? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose not. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> He dined here, you know, and, {{before going}} down-stairs, I {{told him that}} she was coming. I thought it only fair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "and didn't {{you really know}} too? You are not so wise a man as I thought you. Why, ever since I have known you {{it seems to me}} that--that--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{why should}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like you? Indeed, without flattery, I {{can assure you}} that I think you one of the most {{beautiful}} women I have ever seen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘What do you mean?’ he screamed, pausing {{with the}} pick {{buried in the}} soil. ‘Do you seek to drive me mad? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} the danger that I run?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All I {{mean to say}} is, {{that if you go}} on as you do, {{you will}} turn his head and spoil him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{know what is going on}} among you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Adela, <b>you</b> do; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am {{honest and}} open. At any rate, I {{strive to be}} so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sewell {{listened in}} silence, and then seemed quite {{at a loss}} what to say; but Lemuel {{saw that he was}} deeply afflicted. At last he asked, lifting his eyes anxiously to Sewell's, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong to say the thief was a friend of mine, and get him off that way?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Velez. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not scent it {{from the}} first? [...] An {{excellent}} scheme, and excellently managed. [...] 'Twill blow away her doubts, and now she'll wed you, [...] I'faith, the likeness is most admirable. [...] I saw the trick--yet these old eyes grew dimmer [...] 155 [...] With very foolish tears, it look'd so like him! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean?" [...] he screamed, pausing {{with the}} pick {{buried in the}} soil. [...] "Do you seek to drive me mad? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} the danger that I run?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not?" [...] {{said the}} doctor; [...] "I can tell {{exactly what you}} feel now. If I had not been an idle dog, I should have gone through it all many more times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] {{said the}} butler, {{turning to a}} sort of mottled pallor, [...] "that thing was not my master, and there's the truth. My master"--here he looked round him and began to whisper--"is a tall, fine build of a man, and this was more of a dwarf." [...] Utterson {{attempted}} to protest. [...] "O sir," [...] cried Poole, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know my master after twenty years? do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know where his head comes to in the cabinet door, where I saw him every morning of my life? No, sir, that thing in the mask was never Dr. Jekyll--God knows what it was, but it was never Dr. Jekyll; and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done." ...|$|E
60|$|GILBEY. [sarcastic] Do {{you want}} to lose him his character, Maria? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> see what it is? We're prison folk now. Weve been in the police court. [To Juggins] Well, I suppose you know your own {{business}} best. I take your notice: you can go when your month is up, or sooner, if you like.|$|R
6000|$|MRS WARREN. My own {{opinions}} {{and my own}} way of life! Listen to her talking! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was brought up like you? able {{to pick and choose}} my own way of life? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> what <b>I</b> <b>did</b> because <b>I</b> liked it, or thought it right, or wouldn't rather have gone to college and been a lady if I'd had the chance? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> much mischief?" [...] said Kate, raising {{herself on}} her arm. [...] "I am sure the fishes must have been frightened, and the water- lilies broken. Oh! <b>you</b> can't <b>think</b> how nasty their great coiling stems were--just like snakes! But those pretty blue and pink flowers! Did it hurt them much, do you think--or the fish?" ...|$|R
6000|$|WAITER. Thank you, Signore. But as I was saying, Signore, delicacy, purity.... <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{understand}} such sentiments. Alas, Signore, beneath the humblest shirt-front there beats a heart. And if the Signore's sentiments are {{too much for}} him, I have a niece. Eighteen years old, and what eyes, what forms! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you well enough," [...] she cried hotly, her cheeks flaming red of a sudden. [...] "I {{understand you}}, you thief, you trickster. Do {{you think that}} I heard nothing of what passed this morning between my uncle and you? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know whose name you have written on that paper? Answer me," [...] she commanded him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not understand?" [...] he continued. [...] "It is {{only because}} I {{am able to}} go, because the touch of your fingers, that look in your eyes, do not drive me half mad now, that {{you want me to}} stay. You would like to try your powers once more. I think not. I am {{satisfied}} that I am cured indeed, but perhaps it is safer to risk nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|PHOEBE (discovering {{only now}} what are the suspicions of her friends). <b>Is</b> that what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> am <b>doing,</b> Miss Willoughby? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm so glad <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> anything, for <b>I</b> {{perfectly}} ache to be useful; {{everyone is}} so good to me, especially Aunt Jessie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sammy!" [...] cried Mike. [...] "My good man, <b>you</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that, <b>do</b> <b>you?</b> What {{absolute}} rot! I {{never touched}} the poor brute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have an idea. I {{wonder if}} we dare----I have a friend, sort of a distant cousin, who married her a husband at Winklehurst, on the Palisades, not very far from the ferry. I {{wonder if we}} couldn't make her invite us both for dinner? Of course, she'll want to know all about you; but we'll be mysterious, and {{that will make it}} all the more fun, don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to prolong our jaunt, you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{there was}} no need to say. I know what it means. You sit there sulking all day. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I have to see to the children, I have to work and slave, I go on from day to day. I tell you I'll stop, I tell you I'll do as I like. I'll go as well. No, I wouldn't be such a coward, you know that. You know I wouldn't leave little children--to the workhouse or anything. They're my children; they mightn't be yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is in vain, Mr. Dallas, to talk thus to me," [...] said Edward, when, one day, {{with the}} strong eloquence of excited feeling, he painted the motives for {{attempting}} reformation; [...] "you might as well attempt to reclaim the lost in hell. Do you think," [...] he continued, in a wild, determined manner--"do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know all you can tell me? I have it all by heart, sir; no one can preach such discourses as I can on this subject: I know all--believe all--as the devils believe and tremble." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{had been}} {{kneeling}} before him in dressing his hurt, {{and then in}} critically regarding her handiwork, she got to her feet. [...] "I know you oughtn't," [...] she retorted, [...] "but I'm glad you done it. And I'm thankful every breath I draw. And now I want you to go. And don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>done</b> what <b>I</b> <b>done</b> out of love for you, Joseph Dylks. I'd 'a' done it for any hurt or hungry dog." ...|$|R
3000|$|Kenny: Then {{are there}} other things or lessons that you find very {{interesting}} in other subjects which <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> the same thing? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, Hunterleys," [...] he suggested, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{something}} for the crowd on my little boat--a luncheon party or a cruise, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} that?' said Barizy of the Tower; 'but {{he will be}} {{recalled}} for this purpose. The English will not {{go to war in}} Syria without Palmerston. Palmerston will have the command of the fleet {{as well as of the}} army, that no one shall say [...] "No" [...] when he says [...] "Yes." [...] The English will not do the business of the Turks again for nothing. They will take this city; they will keep it. They want a new market for their cottons. Mark me: England will never be satisfied till the people of Jerusalem wear calico turbans.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Sotillo {{advanced}} one leg and put {{his arms}} akimbo. [...] "It is you, Mitchell," [...] he said, emphatically, [...] "who are the thief, not my soldiers!" [...] He pointed at his prisoner a forefinger with a long, almond-shaped nail. [...] "Where is the silver of the San Tome mine? I ask you, Mitchell, where is the silver that was deposited in this Custom House? Answer me that! You stole it. You were a party to stealing it. It was stolen from the Government. Aha! <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know what I say; but I am up to your foreign tricks. It is gone, the silver! No? Gone {{in one of your}} lanchas, you miserable man! How dared you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{she always}} loved you,' replied Venetia; always, always. Before {{she knew her}} father she loved him. I dare say <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love you, because I am not used {{to speak to a}} father. Everything must be learnt, you know,' she said, with a faint, sad smile; 'and then it was so sudden! I do not think my mother knows it yet. And after all, though I found you out in a moment, still, I know not why, I thought it was a picture. But I read your verses, and I knew them by heart at once; but now my memory has worn out, for I am ill, and {{everything}} has gone cross with me. And all because my father wrote me verses. 'Tis very strange, is not it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' said Mary; 'I {{should like}} it better afterwards. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> might <b>do</b> one copy for you? Or {{would it not}} suit Lord Ormersfield?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Do</b> you know, <b>I</b> {{went into}} your room? I {{contrived}} to ascend alone; the good woman followed me, but I was there alone a moment, and, and, and, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>did?</b> <b>I</b> pressed my lips to your pillow. I {{could not help}} it; when I thought that his dear head had rested there so often and so lately, I could not refrain from pressing my lips to that favoured resting-place, and I am afraid I shed a tear besides.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. I will go. I will go {{and smoke}} a cigar. And <b>think</b> of <b>you,</b> dear.... But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> should <b>do</b> all this if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care?" ...|$|R
