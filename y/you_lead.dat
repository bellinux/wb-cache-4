25|$|While he {{supported}} the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if <b>you</b> <b>lead</b> correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E

We share a mutual excitement in what's happening on the medical scene right now." [...] "The Wave" [...] was filmed before [...] "Paddling Out", although the latter was released first. Wyatt explained to Billboard, [...] "We really liked [...] Andreas's images and I think they go together in a way that feels truthful with what we do ... and you can read into it in different ways." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the band}} {{regarded}} the album as a 'new progression'. Bassist Nathan Cochran said that [...] "It’s not a sharp left turn; it’s a step beyond what we’ve ever done. We feel like our message and calling are the same... We’re still worship leaders; we’re {{just on a}} different scale". As a whole, Undone is a guitar-driven album with a pop rock and adult contemporary sound. The album's opening track, [...] "Where <b>You</b> <b>Lead</b> Me", builds from an acoustic guitar-driven opening into a crescendo featuring synthesizers and guitars.

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. <b>You</b> <b>lead</b> all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row.
