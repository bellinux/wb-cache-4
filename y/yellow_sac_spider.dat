C. inclusum is closely related to Cheiracanthium mildei, an introduced species native to Europe which is similar in appearance and natural history and can also be found in North American homes.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous other spiders {{have been}} {{associated}} with necrotic bites in medical literature. Other recluse species, such as the desert recluse (found in the deserts of southwestern United States), are reported to have caused necrotic bite wounds, though only rarely. The hobo spider and the <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> have also been reported to cause necrotic bites. However, the bites from these spiders are not known to produce the severe symptoms that can follow from a recluse spider bite, and the level of danger posed by these has been called into question. So far, no known necrotoxins have been isolated from the venom of any of these spiders, and some arachnologists have disputed the accuracy of spider identifications carried out by bite victims, family members, medical responders, and other non-experts in arachnology. There have been several studies questioning the danger posed by some of these spiders. In these studies, scientists examined case studies of bites in which the spider in question was identified by an expert, and found that the incidence of necrotic injury diminished significantly when [...] "questionable" [...] identifications were excluded from the sample set.

50|$|Cheiracanthium punctorium, one {{of several}} species {{commonly}} known as the <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider,</b> is a spider found from central Europe to Central Asia.

40|$|Dermonecrotic arachnidism is the {{potential}} cutaneous reaction to spider bite venom. The <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider,</b> genus Cheiracanthium, is historically considered capable of inducing dermonecrotic lesions. However, recently this belief has been hotly debated. In this article, the authors provide {{a brief review of}} dermonecrotic arachnidism and describe a case of a 20 -year-old man who developed severe necrosis and edema of the left thigh, buttock, penis, and scrotum following the bite of a <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider.</b> Notably, the patient wore a tight-fitting garment for multiple hours following the spider bite, thus compressing the envenomated tissue.

40|$|Venom of the <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> Cheiracanthium punctorium (Miturgidae) {{was found}} unique {{in terms of}} {{molecular}} composition. Its principal toxic component CpTx 1 (15. 1 kDa) was purified, and its full amino acid sequence (134 residues) was established by protein chemistry and mass spectrometry techniques. CpTx 1 represents a novel class of spider toxin with modular architecture. It consists of two different yet homologous domains (modules) each containing a putative inhibitor cystine knot motif, characteristic of the widespread single domain spider neurotoxins. Venom gland cDNA sequencing provided precursor protein (prepropeptide) structures of three CpTx 1 isoforms (a–c) that differ by single residue substitutions. The toxin possesses potent insecticidal (paralytic and lethal), cytotoxic, and membrane-damaging activities. In both fly and frog neuromuscular preparations, it causes stable and irreversible depolarization of muscle fibers leading to contracture. This effect appears to be receptor-independent and is inhibited by high concentrations of divalent cations. CpTx 1 lyses cell membranes, as visualized by confocal microscopy, and destabilizes artificial membranes in a manner reminiscent of other membrane-active peptides by causing numerous defects of variable conductance and leading to bilayer rupture.

40|$|Although poleward range {{expansions}} {{are commonly}} attributed to global change, a complex interaction of ecological and evolutionary factors {{might contribute to}} expansion success. Here, we study {{the expansion of the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>sac</b> <b>spider</b> Cheiracanthium punctorium, a medically important species in Central Europe. Using microsatellite markers and DNA sequences, morphological and climate niche analyses, we identify factors associated with the spider's expansion success. Our results indicate that the species' initial expansion has been triggered by environmental change and preadaptation in the source populations. However, despite extensive gene flow, expanding populations maintain genetic and morphological differentiation from native ones, which is correlated with climatic niche differences. Moreover, expanding spiders might have temporarily escaped an eggsac parasite that causes high mortality in the native range. Hence, our results paint a complex picture of diverse factors associated with expansion success. We speculate that expanding populations might be capable of adapting to novel ecological conditions in northern Europe. This could allow a substantial range expansion, much farther than by environmental change alone. Our distribution model predicts that the spider will soon massively spread over most of northern Europe, bringing along considerable health concerns. © 2016 The Authors.
