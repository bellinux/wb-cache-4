25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our story, I hope <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> and understand us as we understand you, hoping to see you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
500|$|... "Tabloid Junkie" [...] is {{credited}} as a pop—funk song, {{that is similar}} to New Jack Swing. Throughout the song, Jackson sings in a quick-voice, which some music critics viewed as Jackson [...] "not singing" [...] but [...] "harrumphing". [...] It is a plea to the public to not believe everything in the tabloids; and the lyrics are about media bias and sensational journalism about Jackson and in general. This can be heard in lyrics such as, [...] "Just because <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the magazine or see it on the TV screen don't make it factual".|$|E

500|$|The {{story is}} set in the DC Universe but is non-canon, similar to an Elseworlds story. The content is divided into 60chapters which mostly {{alternate}} between the (third person) points-of-view of the two protagonists, Batman/Bruce Wayne and Superman/Clark Kent, though several chapters follow antagonists (Lex Luthor and Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov). While the novel is based on comic book characters, it consists solely of prose. Anderson commented on the difficulty in writing comics as prose stating, [...] "in the comics, several pages of superpowered action can propel the story, but when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in a book, it's not quite so interesting. You need more parts to the story..." ...|$|E
500|$|Alongside his {{parliamentary}} duties, Bottomley {{was engaged}} in launching his biggest and boldest publishing venture, the weekly news magazine John Bull, half of the initial capital for which was provided by Hooley. From its first issue on 12 May 1906 John Bull adopted a tabloid style that, despite occasional lapses in taste, proved immensely popular. Among its regular features, Bottomley revived his [...] "The World, the Flesh and the Devil" [...] column from The Sun, and also adapted that paper's slogan: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in John Bull, it is so". Bottomley persuaded Julius Elias, managing director of Odhams Limited, to handle the printing, but chaotic financial management meant that Odhams were rarely paid. This situation was resolved when the entire management of the magazine, including the handling of all receipts and payments, was transferred to Elias, leaving Bottomley free to concentrate on editing and journalism. Circulation rose rapidly, and by 1910 had reached half a million copies.|$|E
500|$|David Browne, of Entertainment Weekly, {{noted that}} [...] "Tabloid Junkie," [...] comes as [...] "close to {{transcendence}} as {{anywhere on the}} album" [...] and described the chorus, [...] "Just because <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> in the magazine or {{see it on the}} TV screen don't make it factual" [...] as Jackson's [...] "grabbiest, most driven refrain in years." [...] Although Browne praised the song, he commented, [...] "The rest of the song, however, is mucked up with fake tabloid-TV snippets about his 'life,' and on the verses Jackson's delivery is so terse (he's not singing, he's harrumphing) that his lyrics are all but obliterated. Handed a golden opportunity, he throws it all away — but then, it wouldn't be the first time." [...] Deepika Reedy, of The Daily Collegian, described the [...] "rust in songs" [...] like [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] as having a [...] "raw aspect" [...] that Jackson [...] "hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean'." [...] Patrick Macdonald, of The Seattle Times, noted that [...] "Tabloid Junkie" [...] was a [...] "disingenuous attack on sensational news stories" [...] about Jackson, remarked that most of stories were [...] "planted" [...] by Jackson himself.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, {{critics call}} Fear and Loathing Thompson's {{crowning}} achievement in gonzo journalism. For example, {{journalist and author}} Mikal Gilmore said the novel [...] "feels free wheeling when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> [...] it doesn't feel accidental. The writing is right there, on the page — startling, unprecedented and brilliantly crafted". Critics believe that Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas {{should be considered a}} work of gonzo journalism because the characteristics of gonzo journalism are all characteristics seen in the novel.|$|E

The plot involved an unpleasant TV talent-show judge who discovers he is dying. She said: [...] "It's sort of fiction but not fiction but it is made up and true, so when <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> you'll see it's fictional but also real, [...] and I hope it explains a few things about the pop business.". It was never published.|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{accuracy}} was playfully rebuffed in {{an episode}} of the television programme QI, itself having been forced to accept corrections at times, when Mitchell, one of the panellists {{on the subject of}} film and fame (Series F, Episode 11), found himself supplying answers based on information gathered from The Unbelievable Truth. [...] The answers received klaxons on QI, causing Mitchell to acknowledge that some of the show's [...] "unbelievable truths [...] out, unbelievably, to be untrue." [...] Mitchell then added in comic resignation, [...] "People give you this shit and <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it</b> out", and later jokingly accused QIs host Stephen Fry of trying to [...] "kill off the medium" [...] of radio. The show was nonetheless praised by Stephen Fry and fellow panellist Emma Thompson.|$|E

2500|$|Sackveille-West's novel Challenge also bears {{witness to}} her affair with Trefusis: Sackville-West and Trefusis had started {{writing this book}} as a {{collaborative}} endeavour, and the male character's name, Julian, had been Sackville-West's nickname when passing as a man. Challenge is a roman à clef with the character of Julian being only a male version of Sackville-West and Eve, the woman he desires so passionately is Trefusis. Notably, Sackville-West in Challenge defends Trefusis against several of the insults Nicolson had applied to her in his letters to her; for example Nicolson often called Trefussis a [...] "swine" [...] and a [...] "pig", and in the book Julian goes {{out of his way}} to say that Eve is neither a swine nor a pig. In the book, Julian says that [...] "Eve is not a 'little swine', she just has the weaknesses and faults of femininity carried to the 9th degree, but is also redeemed by a self-sacrifice, which is very feminine". Reflecting her obsession with the Romany people, Eve is portrayed as a seductive Romany woman with an [...] "insinuating femininity" [...] that Julian cannot resist, calling him away from his political mission of winning independence on a fictional Greek island during the Greek war of independence. [...] Nicolson wrote in a letter to his wife: [...] "Don't please dedicate it to Violet, it would kill me if you did". When Challenge was published in 1924, the dedication was written in Romany reading: [...] "This book is yours, honored witch. If <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> you will find your tormented soul changed and free". Throughout their relationship, Trefusis was given to threatening suicide if Sackville-West left her, a character trait shared by Eve, who finally attempts to drown herself in the sea while Julian tries to come to her rescue. As Eve changes her mind about taking her life and tries to swim ashore as Julian swims out to her, it is too late and she is swept away by the tide to drown. The book's ending reflected Sackville-West's guilt about breaking her relationship with Trefusis. Her mother, Lady Sackville, found the portrayal obvious enough to refuse to allow publication of the novel in England; but Vita's son Nigel Nicolson (1973, p.194) praises his mother: [...] "She fought for the right to love, men and women, rejecting the conventions that marriage demands exclusive love, and that women should love only men, and men only women. For this she was prepared to give up everything… How could she regret that the knowledge of it should now reach the ears of a new generation, one so infinitely more compassionate than her own?" ...|$|E
