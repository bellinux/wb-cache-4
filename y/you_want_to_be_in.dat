500|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent for the}} second consecutive summer, Hansen was taken to salary arbitration by the Canucks. Following his hearing on 20 July 2010, he was awarded a one-year, one-way deal worth $850,000, which the Canucks agreed to. Recording career-highs of 9 goals, 20 assists and 29 points over 82 games in 2010–11, Hansen received the Canucks' Fred J. Hume Award as the team's [...] "unsung hero" [...] (voted by the Canucks' booster club). He added three goals and nine points over 25 games in the 2011 playoffs as the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. In the off-season, Hansen filed for salary arbitration. Prior to his hearing, Hansen and the Canucks avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year, $4.05 million contract. Many in the media, including those from the local Province newspaper, suggested that he ceded to the Canucks' negotiations, to which Hansen responded, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a position to win, you have to make some sacrifices." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2001–02 season, Evra {{switched}} to the number 17 shirt and was promoted to the first team on a permanent basis. In the team's first league match of the season against Laval, he started in the team's 2–1 win. Towards {{the end of the}} match, reserve left-back Jean-Charles Cirilli, who was starting in place of the regular starter José Cobos, suffered an injury, which required the player to be substituted out. As a consequence, Evra dropped back into the role and played {{out the rest of the}} match in the position. Following the match, due to injuries to both Cobos and Cirilli, Evra was informed by Salvioni he would take over the position. The young player disagreed with the manager's decision, declaring he was a forward, however after Salvioni informed him, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the team you play there," [...] Evra agreed to fill the role. Evra made his debut in the position in the team's following league match against Strasbourg, a 3–0 defeat. He appeared regularly in the campaign and, following the return of Cobos, was even allowed to play in his preferred left wing role. With the club in the midst of a promotion battle, Evra scored his first and only goal for Nice in his last match with the club, a 4–3 win over Laval. The victory placed Nice in third place, which resulted in the club earning promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time since 1997. For his performances, Evra was named to the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Ligue 2 Team of the Year in the left-back position.|$|E

2500|$|While the Clinton {{campaign}} chose {{a strategy}} that emphasized experience, Axelrod helped to craft the Obama campaign's main theme of [...] "change." [...] Axelrod criticized the Clinton campaign's positioning by saying that [...] "being the consummate Washington insider is not where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a year when people want change... initial strategic positioning was wrong and kind of played into our hands." [...] The change message played a factor in Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses. [...] "Just over half of [...] Democratic caucus-goers said change was the No. 1 factor {{they were looking for}} in a candidate, and 51 percent of those voters chose Barack Obama," [...] said CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider. [...] "That compares to only 19 percent of 'change' caucus-goers who preferred Clinton." [...] Axelrod also believed that the Clinton campaign underestimated the importance of the caucus states. [...] "For all the talent and the money they had over there," [...] says Axelrod, [...] "they—bewilderingly—seemed to have little understanding for the caucuses and how important they would become." [...] In the 2008 primary season, Obama won a majority of the states that use the caucus format.|$|E

6000|$|The {{spring of}} {{activity}} in Mr Powell was released with great force. He jumped. The flare-up was kept inside the companion {{with a box of}} matches ready to hand. Almost before he knew he had moved he was diving under the companion slide. He got hold of the can in the dark and tried to strike a light. But he had to press the flare-holder to his breast with one arm, his fingers were damp and stiff, his hands trembled a little. One match broke. Another went out. In its flame he saw the colourless face of Mrs Anthony a little below him, standing on the cabin stairs. Her eyes which were very close to his (he was in a crouching posture on the top step) seemed to burn darkly in the vanishing light. On deck the captain's voice was heard sudden and unexpectedly sardonic: [...] "You had better look sharp, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> time." ...|$|E
