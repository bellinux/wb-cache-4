500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting <b>your</b> <b>instincts,</b> because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust <b>your</b> <b>instincts</b> and go with what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} why you have been so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp? It is because you {{have been trying to}} believe what you wish to believe. It is because you are trying to drown and stifle <b>your</b> <b>instinct,</b> which tells you another name----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank heavens we {{understand}} them {{better than you}} men!" [...] Philippa interrupted fiercely. [...] "You have but one idea--to strike--the narrow idea of men that breeds warfare.

6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you," [...] he replied, presently. [...] "An' I'm sure {{surprised that}} I can. I've read my books--an' reread them, {{but no one}} ever talked like that to me. What I make of it is this. You've the same blood in you that's in Bo. An' blood is stronger than brain. Remember that blood is life. It would be good for you to have it run an' beat an' burn, as Bo's did. Your blood did that a thousand years or ten thousand before intellect was born in your ancestors. Instinct may not be greater than reason, but it's a million years older. Don't fight <b>your</b> <b>instincts</b> so hard. If they were not good the God of Creation would not have given them to you. To-day your mind was full of self-restraint that did not altogether restrain. You couldn't forget yourself. You couldn't FEEL only, as Bo did. You couldn't be true to your real nature." ...|$|E

Am I not a mind that you must think of me as nothing but a woman? imagine me always as a thing to struggle for?" [...] She paused; then she made her distressful proposition to me.
