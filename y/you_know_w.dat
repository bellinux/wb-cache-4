60|$|The American army is a {{beautiful}} little army. Some day, when all the Indians are happily dead or drunk, it ought to make the finest scientific and survey corps {{that the world has}} ever seen; it does excellent work now, but there is this defect in its nature: It is officered, as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> from <b>West</b> Point.|$|R

I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides being in {{different}} places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar. But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies. We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> the <b>West</b> Indies." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{business}} was finally closed on one cold, gray {{afternoon in the}} early part of December. As Hiram tore his bond across and then tore it across again and again, Squire Hall pushed back the papers upon his desk and cocked his feet upon its slanting top. [...] "Hiram," [...] said he, abruptly, [...] "Hiram, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that Levi <b>West</b> is forever hanging around Billy Martin's house, after that pretty daughter of his?" ...|$|R

Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> Mr. <b>W.?</b> He wrote a dreadful {{article in the}} Independent, about the last poor lecture, which was indeed sad, sentimental, commonplace: and the critique is terribly comical. I could not help laughing, remembering some passages in it, when Barnes mentioned it: and my brother became so angry! They have put up a dreadful caricature of B. in Newcome: and my brother says he did it, but I hope not. It is very droll, though: he used to make them very funnily. I am glad he has spirits for it. Good-bye again.--E. N." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} morning. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun had thrown his bedclothes off very early and started to climb up the sky, smiling his broadest. Old Mother West Wind had swept his path clear of clouds. The Merry Little Breezes, who, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> are Mother <b>West</b> Wind's children, had danced across the Green Meadows up to the old orchard, where they pelted each other with white and pink petals of apple blossoms until the ground was covered. Each apple-tree was like a huge bouquet of loveliness. Yes, indeed, it was very beautiful that spring morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{hard to tell}} {{just where}} he stands. I suspect that a hopeful {{temperament}} and fondness for round numbers have always caused him to set his figures beyond his actual worth. I don't say that he's been dishonest about it, but he's had a loose way of estimating his assets; he's reckoned his wealth {{on the basis of}} his capital, and some of his capital is borrowed. He's lost heavily by some of the recent failures, and there's been a terrible shrinkage in his values. I don't mean merely in the stock of paint on hand, but in a kind of competition which has become very threatening. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> about that <b>West</b> Virginian paint?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'DEAR EDWARD--I am {{summoned to}} town. Tooke {{has no doubt}} forestalled me. We have had some curious interviews, in which he first, as I told you, persuaded {{me out of my}} senses that it was all right, and then, finding me still dissatisfied, tried in a {{delicate}} fashion to apprise me that I had a claim to a share of the plunder. When I refused to appropriate anything without sanction from headquarters, he threatened me with the consequences of presumptuous interference. [...] It came to bullying at last. I hardly know what I answered, but I don't think I gave in. Now, a sharp letter from old Frith recalls me. Say nothing at home; and whatever you do, do not betray Griff.

6000|$|Did <b>you</b> ever <b>know</b> Shackles--b. <b>w.</b> g., 15.13.8--coarse, loose, mule-like ears-- barrel {{as long as}} a gate-post--tough as a telegraph-wire--and the queerest brute {{that ever}} looked through a bridle? He was of no brand, being one of an ear-nicked mob taken into the Bucephalus at 4l.-10s. a head to make up freight, and sold raw and out of {{condition}} at Calcutta for Rs. 275. People who lost money on him called him a [...] "brumby;" [...] but if ever any horse had Harpoon's shoulders and The Gin's temper, Shackles was that horse. Two miles was his own particular distance. He trained himself, ran himself, and rode himself; and, if his jockey insulted him by giving him hints, he shut up at once and bucked the boy off. He objected to dictation. Two or three of his owners did not understand this, and lost money in consequence. At last he was bought by a man who discovered that, if a race was to be won, Shackles, and Shackles only, would win it in his own way, so long as his jockey sat still.|$|R
