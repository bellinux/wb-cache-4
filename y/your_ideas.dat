[...] She described the shooting process as [...] "the fun part" [...] because of: [...] "working with people I love—it’s always a great human moment because we’re sharing things and it’s good to see people who are here {{for you and your}} story, to tell your story. It’s really beautiful, it’s why I love making movies." ...|$|E
500|$|The nightly in-character guest {{interviews}} were initially {{of concern to}} Colbert, who worried his character's belligerent nature would be off-putting to guests. However, since the show's debut, {{he says he has}} found he is able to [...] "slide the intensity" [...] of his behavior depending on his interviewee's ability to respond to his aggressive approach. Colbert now often cites the interview segment as his favorite part of the show, because it allows him to improvise. Colbert advises his guests to disabuse the character of his ignorance. [...] "Don't let me get away with anything. Don't try to play my game. Be real. Be passionate. Hold <b>your</b> <b>ideas.</b> Give me resistance. Give me traction I can work against." ...|$|E
500|$|Rayner {{described}} Scherger as [...] "the most quoted {{and best}} known of contemporary military leaders" [...] in Australia from 1957 to 1966, recognised and admired by civilian and soldier alike. Detractors accused him of cunning and excessive politicking, Air Marshal Williams declaring that Scherger favoured his friends in the service and later in TAA and CAC, and Prime Minister John Gorton famously calling him [...] "a politician in uniform". Scherger was also labelled a self-publicist, but argued [...] "...you can't sell <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> unless you can sell yourself, {{and if you can}} sell yourself you're half way to selling the ideas that you've got". The newest of the northern air bases he proposed while CAS, near Weipa in Cape York, was opened in 1998 and named RAAF Base Scherger in his honour. His name is also borne by Sir Frederick Scherger Drive in North Turramurra, New South Wales.|$|E

500|$|The musicians {{created the}} album tracks through {{improvisation}} and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan {{to release a}} single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to [...] "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff {{that you want to}} bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and... be creative—See where your mind and <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> take you." [...] Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from Ghosts for his contributions on guitar, bass guitar, dulcimer, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from [...] "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" [...] and eventually into [...] "a collaboration on [...] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 82, indicating universal acclaim, based on 14 reviews. Pitchfork stated that [...] "One {{of the best}} things about Glass Swords is that, for all of its pop-goes-clubbing bluster, it's also as psychedelic, where the devil's in the zillion little details zigzagging across the tracks" [...] and that [...] "there's not a lot here that will redefine <b>your</b> <b>ideas</b> of what dubstep or electronic music in general can do. For all of Rustie's skill as a sculptor of very 21st-century beats, Glass Swords can feel just as much like a [...] "greatest bits" [...] collage." [...] Fact gave the album a five out of five rating, stating that [...] "you get the impression that it's the point Rustie has been building up to for the last five years; an album made in relative isolation, with zero self-consciousness, shame or thought for trend behind it." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album an eight out of ten rating, finding that the album is [...] "equally impressive is the fact that this formula (or lack thereof) never grows tired. Thirteen tracks of excess could easily have been a recipe for sighs, but instead it is consistently addictive and grin-inducing." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason said Chris was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was saying these things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing to change <b>your</b> <b>ideas.</b>|$|E

2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning. He encouraged them to love the work they do, and [...] "... Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe the things that you actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with <b>your</b> <b>ideas.</b> So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
