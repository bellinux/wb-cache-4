5|$|The parkway {{was opened}} in 2001 after just under a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and {{almost two decades}} of {{community}} requests. Local residents led by Doug and Bruce Stephens urged the state to connect I-84 directly to Adams Avenue, bypassing the congested US-89. Then-governor Mike Leavitt suggested that a private company rather than the state would need to build the road.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{planning}} and a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> WhiteWater World {{opened to the public}} on 8 December 2006. The ten Australian beach culture themed attractions cost approximately A$56million. These included The Green Room, Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, The Rip, The BRO, Temple of Huey, Cave of Waves, Wiggle Bay, and Pipeline Plunge. Since then, four additional water slides: two called Little Rippers, one called The Wedgie and one called the Triple Vortex, have been added.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} facade, oriented {{southwest and}} located behind the portico, was built {{together with the}} stone church built by the Jesuits in 1727. The facade is simply designed with its upper half hidden by an extended choir loft which houses an 1824 pipe organ. A way of glazed blue tiles connects the facade and the portico. The portico was added as an extension to the facade in 1875 by the Augustinian Recollects. An inscription on the portico's pediment based on the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> of the facade (1875) was invisible due to church renovations. Two religious images, both dated 1885, is found on the portico's niches: St. Joseph and the child Jesus on the uppermost niche and the Immaculate Conception, patroness, on the central niche.|$|E
5|$|U-37 {{was laid}} down by AG Weser of Bremen on 15 March 1937. Following just over a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> she was {{launched}} from the Bremen shipyards on 14 May 1938 and commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on 4 August 1938 {{under the command of}} Kapitänleutnant Heinrich Schuch {{as a member of the}} 6th U-boat Flotilla. U-37 was by far the most successful Type IXA U-boat and the sixth most successful U-boat in World War II, sinking 53 merchant ships for a total of , along with two warships during eleven war patrols from August 1939 to March 1941. In spite of these victories, U-37 was later withdrawn from combat service and was used for training submarine crews until the end of the war. On 8 May 1945, the crew of U-37 scuttled the U-boat in Sonderburg Bay off Flensburg to keep her from falling into the hands of the Allies.|$|E
25|$|Once {{construction}} of the building began, it proceeded at a very fast pace. The steel was so meticulously pre-cut that the frame went up {{at the rate of}} a floor each week. By February 1902 the frame was complete, and by mid-May the building was half-covered by terra-cotta tiling. The building was completed in June 1902, after a <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction.</b>|$|E

25|$|Among homeowners with {{household}} incomes {{in the top}} 10%, those {{earning more}} than $120,000 a year, home values were considerably higher while houses were larger and newer. The median value for homes in this demographic was $256,000 while median square footage was 2,500 and the median <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> was 1977. The vast majority, 80%, had two or more bathrooms. Overall, houses of those with higher incomes were larger, newer, more expensive with more amenities.|$|E
25|$|Six Flags Over Texas is a 212-acre (86 ha) {{theme park}} located in Arlington, Texas, east of Fort Worth and about 15 miles (24km) west of Dallas.

25|$|Division C (Classic):- All other 12 Metre class yachts {{built before}} 1968 but {{excluding}} Intrepid {{which is in}} Period B {{by virtue of its}} skeg mounted rudder design. Divisions D (Vintage) & E (Antique) are the remaining 2 Divisions based on the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> including Antique (most of which are in fact gaff rigged). Older sloop-rigged yachts like Vim and Onawa fit into the Vintage category, yachts like Erna Signe belong to the Antique division. In the early 21st century interest in ownership and restoration of 12 Metres was such that specialist restoration companies would speculatively locate old boats under threat of destruction and publicize the availability in order to attract the funding for a full restoration.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} Hathorn, a native of today's Delaware, {{had been on the}} {{surveying}} team that established the present land border between New York and New Jersey, which had been the subject of a lengthy conflict between the two colonies for much of the 18th century. He settled in Warwick and opened a store and iron forge in 1770, and built the house after marrying Elizabeth Welling, daughter of his local host, in 1772. The inscription of their initials and the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> {{in the side of the}} house is a tradition more commonly associated with Germanic building traditions, a sign of how influential settlers of that background were in the Hudson Valley.|$|E
500|$|... 21C1 Channel Packet {{originally}} had an inverted horseshoe on the smokebox door, indicating its Southern origin, but crews believed {{this to be}} unlucky. [...] A resultant re-design meant that this became a roundel, the gap being filled by the <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction,</b> so it acted as a builder's plate. The background was painted red. Early {{members of the class}} had cast-iron numberplates and gilt 'Southern' plates on the tender, but these were subsequently replaced by transfers.|$|E

[...] The $3.9million project was estimated to save almost 15 minutes of driving time through Blairmore. [...] Alberta Transportation estimated that work on a Coleman bypass would likely proceed within five years, but this did not come to fruition.|$|E

The median value of these homes was $112,000 with the median <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> being 1970. Middle income households tended to spend roughly 18% of their monthly income on housing.

500|$|The {{years of}} Jesus' {{ministry}} have been estimated using several different approaches.
