25|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that, depending on <b>your</b> <b>political</b> point of view, such government payments for offsetting the housing charge could be considered a subsidy of the low-income members, or a contractual business arrangement {{between the government and the}} co-op, which helps to stabilize revenue to the co-op in exchange for accomplishing a social goal for the government for a specific period. This dichotomy is typical of the fact that a housing co-op is somewhere between a private business corporation and a social agency, and where one places it depends on one's viewpoint—and the collective viewpoint of each housing co-op. Some observers would now simply categorize these co-op as a form of social enterprise.|$|E

He compared this attitude to the apartheid system. [...] "The poor and less-educated Thais in rural areas and in Bangkok want their political opinions counted as well. A lorry with 10 wheels cannot move forward with just one wheel dictating the speed. And so it is with Thailand". He called on his fellow Bangkokians to [...] "try harder to convince them through civil dialogue, rather than engaging in bouts of expletive-loaded hate speech and showing open indifference to loss of life of among protesters who don't share <b>your</b> <b>political</b> opinions. We need to give a space for our fragile and young democracy to grow and mature.
