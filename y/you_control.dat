500|$|... "Control Gifu and <b>you</b> <b>control</b> Japan" [...] was {{a common}} phrase during the Sengoku period (15th to 17th century), since Gifu's central {{location}} in Japan made it a desirable location for those trying to unify the country. For over 200 years, the Mino Province (including the present-day city of Gifu) was under control of the Toki Clan, a powerful regional clan. However, during the Sengoku period, Saitō Dōsan, a Toki vassal, rebelled against his clan and took control of Mino Province in 1542 and built Inabayama Castle atop Mount Inaba, from which he began his quest to unify Japan.|$|E
500|$|The {{presentation}} of the game was widely praised, especially the narration. Mackey said that the game [...] "could be sold on its presentation alone", focusing on the graphics, music, and story. Edge said that the narration added [...] "emotional resonance" [...] to the game, and Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer praised the [...] "dazzling visuals" [...] and [...] "artful commentary". Game Informers Matt Miller highlighted [...] "the well-written narration, excellent music, and bright visuals" [...] as factors that made the game feel [...] "like a storybook in which <b>you</b> <b>control</b> the outcome." [...] Of the presentation elements, the story was the least praised, though several reviewers such as Noble enjoyed it, saying that it [...] "just gets better the further you delve into it." [...] Ryan Scott of GameSpy, however, termed it a [...] "just-sorta-there plot", and Greg Miller said that it [...] "could have been better" [...] and never [...] "hooked" [...] him.|$|E

500|$|Cannon Fodder 3 has a {{basic premise}} {{involving}} American soldiers battling disparate terrorists who have united {{with the aim}} of world domination. Like the earlier games in the series, it features a mix of [...] "old school" [...] action and strategy gameplay viewed from an isometric perspective. The player directs a small squad of soldiers, primarily with the mouse though the keyboard is used to deploy additional weaponry. The control system [...] "is very similar to ‘twin-stick’ shooters like Geometry Wars, except here <b>you</b> <b>control</b> just one of the four soldiers while the others fall in line, shooting when the lead does." [...] Each squad begins with four soldiers. They are fragile (though, possessing health bars, are somewhat tougher than the protagonists of the originals), but increase in status and power should they survive; the player is provided with a replacement squad should all his platoon die. The player can also split the squad into smaller units should strategy so require. The game has an online cooperative mode for up to four players, though Strategy Informer noted this mode is unpopular. As well as facing large numbers of equally frail enemy infantry, the player must combat vehicles, buildings and turrets which cannot be destroyed with the standard machine guns. For this reason, the player must rely on explosive secondary weapons such as grenades and rockets, which are essential to destroy enemy structures and more powerful units. He can also make use of vehicles – such as tanks and helicopters – as well as various power-ups. The game features an extensively destructible environment and several settings, including the moon.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{artifacts}} are Equipment. Equipment cards {{enter the}} battlefield {{just like any}} other artifact, but may be attached to creatures using their Equip ability. This ability may only be used {{at the same time a}} player would be able to play a sorcery (i.e. only during the main phase of the player who controls it). The player who controls the Equipment pays the Equip cost and attaches it to a creature he or she also controls, unattaching it from any creature it was already attached to. In this way, the Equipment may be [...] "unequipped" [...] from a creature by paying the Equip cost and moving it to another creature. However, it may not be [...] "unequipped" [...] by choosing no creature; if for any reason the Equip ability cannot move the Equipment, it remains attached to its current creature. Like Auras, if control of the equipped creature changes, control of the Equipment does not change, nor is it unequipped. Unlike Auras, if an equipped creature is destroyed or otherwise leaves the battlefield, the Equipment stays on the battlefield unattached to anything; its controller can still attach it to a different creature by activating the Equip ability again. You can only equip equipment to creatures <b>you</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Accounts differ {{as to who}} popularized the term. President George W. Bush {{introduced}} the term officially during his presidency. According to Safire, author Christopher Hitchens was responsible for its diffusion, while Valerie Scatamburlo d'Annibale argues that its popularization {{is due to the}} work of Eliot Cohen, former counselor to Condoleezza Rice, reputed occasionally to be [...] "the most influential neocon in academe". It circulated in neoconservative circles for some years after 2001 and came into wider currency after President George W. Bush, still grappling to find a phrase that might identify the nature of the [...] "evil" [...] which would define the nature of his enemy in the War on Terror, stated in 2005 that Islamofascism was an ideology synonymous with Islamic radicalism and militant jihadism, which, he then clarified, was decidedly distinct from the religion of Islam. It moved into the mainstream in August 2006. [...] After the arrest of Islamic terrorists suspected of preparing to blow up airlines, Bush once more alluded to [...] "Islamic Fascists", apparently a [...] "toned-down" [...] variant of the word, The public use of the neologism and the analogous Islamic fascism during the run-up to the U.S. 2006 mid-term elections, perhaps with a specific focus group in mind, provoked an outcry, or storm of protest, and was quickly dropped from the president's rhetorical armory. Katha Pollitt, stating the principle that, [...] "if the control the language, <b>you</b> <b>control</b> the debate", remarked that while the term looked [...] "analytic", it was emotional and [...] "intended to get us to think less and fear". David Gergen, former speechwriter for Richard Nixon, commented that the phrase [...] "confuses more than it clarifies", for [...] "Islamic fascism has no meaning" [...] in the Arab world. Neoconservative writers, critics and scholars from Hitchens to Robert Wistrich however responded that the Muslim religion itself is fascistic, a view which, in identifying Islam with political fascism, was lambasted for being as offensive as the term Judeo-Nazi coined in the 1970s by Yeshayahu Leibowitz, editor of the Encyclopedia Hebraica, to characterize Messianic Jews settling in the occupied West Bank. Hitchens replied that the link is no more deleterious than that made by Leibowitz, or by left-wing analysts who wrote of clerical fascism.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see it in the way Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him.
