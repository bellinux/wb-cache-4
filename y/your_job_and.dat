500|$|Both {{managers}} {{approached the}} match {{with a view}} to win, in spite of the Shield's friendly feel. Arsenal manager George Graham opined [...] "Winning is a good habit, so why not start early?" [...] Graham lambasted those who found his team's playing style tedious: [...] "The criticism that we don't pass the ball and we don't have flair is overdone. We won two championships and in the second lost one game out of 38." [...] However, Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said [...] "Winning means keeping <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> it can be a delicate situation. But I tell myself I'm not going to fail in this game." [...] Ferguson spoke in glowing terms of new signing Roy Keane, a midfielder who gave United [...] "unbelievable options, a real edge to the squad".|$|E
500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the early}} {{release of the}} lyrics, it had {{garnered}} criticism from some Asian and Hispanic communities, including Latino groups MECha and Chicanos Unidos Arizona, claiming that the usage of the terms [...] "chola" [...] and [...] "orient" [...] was offensive and derogatory. In response to the lyrics, Robert Paul Reyes of Newsblaze.com stated that while he agreed with its pro-gay stance, he questioned {{the use of the}} term [...] "chola", asking, [...] "Are Latinos supposed to be grateful that a white superstar, born of privilege, included a racist shout out to our community? Not all Latino ladies are 'cholas' in the barrio, some of them are teachers, writers, engineers and nurses and doctors." [...] Radio stations in Malaysia chose to censor the part of the lyrics dealing with the acceptance of the LGBT community, due to censorship in the country of content that may be deemed offensive. In response, Gaga urged her Malaysian fans, who wanted the uncensored version to be played, to take action by stating: [...] "It is <b>your</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peaceably." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Marrs Piliero and filmed in Los Angeles, California. Spears first contacted Piliero {{and asked him to}} put together a concept for the video. The main idea for Marrs Piliero came from the lyric [...] "be a little inappropriate", which stood out for him, but {{he did not want to}} make a video about sexual inappropriateness. Piliero wrote the opening press conference scene as a tribute to the film Half Baked (1998), which he is a fan of. He explained, [...] "That scene resonates with everyone as the epitome of the greatest way to quit <b>your</b> <b>job,</b> <b>and</b> just blow people off. [...] I felt like that would just be such a perfect way for her to tell the reporters to eff off." [...] Marrs Piliero first asked actor Kellan Lutz to co-star the clip with Spears; however, Lutz turned down the role, saying that [...] "there were a couple of weird things about the part that didn't make sense", including the scene where he was going to pour milk on himself. Piliero then thought of asking one of the stars of Half Baked, Guillermo Díaz, to be part of the video, explaining that it [...] "would make it come full circle." [...] Piliero watched all of Spears' videos and wanted to pull what he loved from them, but also give it something fresh. Piliero felt that all of her references to the paparazzi in her previous videos had been more of a statement than an action, and for [...] "I Wanna Go", he wanted her to have the opportunity to fight back.|$|E
