When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and your shoulders and your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E

500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fourth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson was delighted with his performance, saying, [...] "The {{truth of it}} is, to do something that's never been done in this sport -- to love the sport like I do and respect it like I do -- and the greats: Petty, Earnhardt, Gordon ... to do something they've never done is so awesome. To win four championships in eight years, what this team has done ... I don't know where to start. It's unbelievable." [...] Burton, who finished second, commended Johnson's achievements saying, [...] "It’s hard to say he’s the best when you’re out there racing against him, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him on the list.” Martin, who finished second in points, said, ...|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is something <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people {{had the luxury of}} doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E

The live titles, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't know we were putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave the}} album a [...] "B" [...] rating {{and called it}} a [...] "mixed bag". He {{described}} performances by Vanessa Carlton and Bright Eyes as [...] "painful" [...] but also complimented the Barenaked Ladies and McLachlan for their collaboration. Willman considered Wilson's [...] "What a Year for a New Year" [...] the stand-out track of the album. Annie Zaleski of The Phoenix rated the album 2.5 out of 4 stars, calling some of the collection [...] "gorgeous and alluring" [...] {{but most of it}} [...] "subdued". Zaleski complimented the title track but criticized performances by Coldplay and Bright Eyes, the latter for its [...] "unsteady, wobbly twang". Zaleski and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times also praised [...] "12/23/95". Zaleski concluded: [...] "Not exactly your traditional take on traditional holiday fare, but a pleasant alternative to all the muzak <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with this time of year." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{gave the}} album {{a score of}} six out of ten: [...] "It tails off towards the end, and TBS never quite shake the feeling that other people are doing {{this sort of thing}} far more thrillingly elsewhere." [...] Now {{reviewer}} Evan Davies wrote that although the group's fans and label had expectations, it [...] "doesn't mean <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out the exact same fucking album twice in a row." [...] According to Davies, Taking Back Sunday writes two kinds of songs: [...] "energetic pop rock with whiny vocals, and midtempo power rock, again with whiny vocals." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone wrote that the group [...] "amped up their sound," [...] with Valentine [...] "delivering a turbocharged attack spiked with dark, catchy melodies and giant choruses." [...] Hoard called most of the album's songs [...] "skull-rattling slasher with enough pop smarts to keep the heartbroken agony from becoming too much to handle." [...] For Stylus Magazine, Ian Cohen wrote that the album [...] "tables the discussion" [...] of whether Taking Back Sunday [...] "embrace their arena destiny or disappear into the basement for cred that never really existed." [...] Cohen concluded, [...] "As was the case with pop-metal, 'albums' weren't the objective, so much as a few ace singles and album tracks that hold serve, which is Louder Now in a nutshell." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some area {{residents}} suggested the crossing itself was the problem. Lance Sexton, a Manhattan resident who commutes {{to the area}} to assemble electronic equipment, described using it to The New York Times: [...] "oming down the hill of the cemetery, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the brakes on earlier ... There's a bank there that always collects water, making it even more dangerous." [...] He also {{said he and his}} coworkers often complained about how quickly the train came after the gates went down, gates which had been installed after a 1984 crash killed a van driver. [...] "How safe is that crossing—for this to happen again?" [...] that victim's sister asked the newspaper. While the crossing had undergone upgrades in recent years, including brighter lights and an additional sign warning passing drivers not to stop on the tracks, in 2009 another upgrade, which would have added a sign with flashing lights [...] up the road west of the tracks was not installed.

2500|$|In the UK, {{the game}} entered the ELSPA video game charts at number four, then fell to number 19 {{in its second}} week of sale. By 29 November 2008, the game was at number 32 and had sold between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in the UK. In the US, the game sold 356,000 units during October and November placing it fourth amongst all PlayStation 3 {{software}} sales for that period. It entered October's all-platform video game chart at number eight before {{falling out of the}} top 20 by the end of November. Sony defended the game's sales, stating the abundance of other released titles at Christmas was a factor. A representative from SCEE said [...] "In other times of the year it would be a clear number one, so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the chart in context." [...] Due to the game's last-minute recall and subsequent delay, LittleBigPlanet was released mid-week and as a result, its first week performance indicators are based on four days instead of the usual seven. This has also been suggested as a contributing factor. Many supporters of the game have suggested that a lack of advertising has let it down although advertising campaigns were launched in North America and Europe which helped to boost the game's sales in the run up to Christmas. After the launch of the UK-based advertising campaign and a decrease in price, LittleBigPlanet sales increased by 58 percent and raised it from 32 to 16 in the videogame charts by mid-December and had sold over 300,000 units by the beginning of February 2009. In January 2009, Sony announced that the game had sold 611,000 units in North America up to the end of December 2008 and that there were 1.3 million unique users playing LittleBigPlanet. As of March 2010, the game has sold over 3 million copies worldwide. SCEE President Andrew House announced at Gamescom 2010 that the game has now sold over 4.5 million worldwide.|$|E
