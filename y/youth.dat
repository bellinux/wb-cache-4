40|$|Background  While {{existing}} {{research has shown}} higher prevalence of depression among incarcerated <b>youths</b> compared with non-incarcerated <b>youths,</b> none has studied incarceration {{as a cause of}} depression. Aims/hypothesis  This study suggests that incarceration, in particular placement of <b>youths</b> in adult incarceration, is a factor in developing depression. Method  A records based comparison of depression among <b>youths</b> in different types of incarceration with non-incarcerated <b>youths,</b> controlling for other predictors of depression, namely offence type, family poverty, parents' history of incarceration and demographic profile. Results  <b>Youths</b> in adult placements {{were significantly more likely to}} be depressed than <b>youths</b> in juvenile placements and community-based <b>youths.</b> Conclusion and implications  The findings suggest that there are mental health implications against incarcerating <b>youths</b> in adult prisons, a concern that current juvenile justice might not have considered adequately.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the {{criminal}} histories of juveniles who are incarcerated versus detained within the juvenile justice system. Specifically, this study compared <b>youths</b> with and without a special education diagnosis that were either detained or incarcerated on various delinquency variables. The variables that were examined were: ethnicity, age at first offense, number of referrals in criminal record, and level of most serious offense. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant associations between the incarcerated and detained <b>youths</b> on each of these variables when examining the observed frequencies. Additionally, it was hypothesized that there would be no significant associations between the special education and non-special education <b>youths.</b> In terms of ethnicity, there was a significant association between the special education and non-special education <b>youths</b> for the entire sample as well as the detained sample. There was a significant association found between the non-special education incarcerated and non-special education detained <b>youths</b> on the observed frequencies of age of first offense and between special education and non-special education <b>youths</b> in the incarcerated sample. When evaluating the total number of referrals, a significant association was found between the incarcerated and detained <b>youths,</b> incarcerated and detained non-special education <b>youths,</b> incarcerated and detained special education <b>youths,</b> and incarcerated and detained emotionally disturbed <b>youths.</b> There was also a significant association found between special education and non-special education <b>youths</b> in the detained sample as well as the incarcerated sample on the number of referrals. The analyses of the level of most serious offense revealed significant associations between the incarcerated and detained non-special education <b>youths,</b> incarcerated and detained special education <b>youths,</b> and incarcerated and detained emotionally disturbed <b>youths.</b> There were no significant associations found between the learning disabled incarcerated and learning disabled detained <b>youths</b> on any variables. The results highlight the many areas in which incarcerated <b>youths</b> and detained <b>youths,</b> as well as special education and non-special education <b>youths,</b> differ within the juvenile justice system. The implications of these findings, future areas for research, and the study's limitations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} whether {{mental health}} services for <b>youths</b> differ with respect to medical assistance aid category. METHODS: Computerized claims for 15, 507 <b>youths</b> with Medicaid insurance in a populous county of a mid-Atlantic state were used to establish population-based prevalence estimates of mental disorders and psychotherapeutic treatments during 1996. RESULTS: An analysis of service claims revealed that the prevalence of mental disorders among <b>youths</b> enrolled in foster care (57 %) was twice that of <b>youths</b> receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI; 26 %) and nearly 15 times that of other <b>youths</b> receiving other types of aid (4 %). Rates of mental health service use were pronounced among foster care <b>youths</b> aged 6 to 14 years. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and developmental disorders were the most prevalent disorders. Stimulants, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants were the most prevalent medications. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Youths</b> enrolled in foster care and <b>youths</b> receiving SSI use far more {{mental health services}} than do <b>youths</b> in other aid categories. Additional research should evaluate the complexity and outcomes {{of mental health services}} for <b>youths</b> in foster care...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the relationship between risk for, and manifestation of, anxiety disorders, and acquisition, extinction and spontaneous recovery of aversive associations. Three pilot groups of <b>youths</b> were compared: anxiety disordered (generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic or separation anxiety, n 519), high risk (anxious parents but non-anxious <b>youths,</b> n 515) and controls (non-anxious parents and non-anxious <b>youths,</b> n 512). After a series of habituation trials, <b>youths</b> underwent 16 trials of differential conditioning, including 8 trials in which a CS 1 (geometric figure) is paired with a loud tone. Then, following a 5 minute interval, <b>youths</b> underwent 8 extinction trials. One week later, they were assessed for spontaneous recovery with another 8 extinction trials. Measures included skin conductance, startle blink magnitude and subjective ratings of valence and arousal. Results indicate that anxious <b>youths</b> show less differential conditioning and rate the CS 1 as more arousing and more negative relative to high risk <b>youths,</b> but not relative to controls. In addition, anxious <b>youths</b> show delayed extinction relative to high risk <b>youths,</b> but not relative to controls. Finally, anxious <b>youths</b> showed more spontaneous recovery one week later than either high risk <b>youths</b> or controls. The findings are moderated by gender effects. It is conceivable that aversive learning is not a marker of risk for anxiety but is rather a manifestation of anxiety; it is also conceivable that high risk <b>youths</b> actually represent ''''super normals'''.

40|$|This study {{examines}} differences in self-reported {{mental health problems}} between detained <b>youths</b> from Dutch, Moroccan, and Surinamese origin and the usefulness of mental health problems to predict violent and property recidivism in these juveniles. A sample of 296 detained boys aged between 12 and 18 years were assessed {{by means of the}} Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). Official information regarding criminal history and recidivism was collected 3 - 6 years later. In general, Dutch <b>youths</b> and Surinamese <b>youths</b> reported more conduct problems than Moroccan <b>youths,</b> while Dutch <b>youths</b> also reported more hyperactivity than Surinamese <b>youths.</b> Mental health problems were not predictive of violent recidivism in any of the ethnic groups, while being related with property recidivism in Dutch and Surinamese <b>youths.</b> The current study showed that Moroccan <b>youths</b> present themselves on the SDQ as a less seriously disturbed group of <b>youths</b> than their Dutch and Surinamese counterparts. Our results also clearly showed that SDQ self-report scores are not predictive of future violent crimes in any of the three ethnic groups.
