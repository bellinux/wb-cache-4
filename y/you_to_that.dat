You go there, you click on a link of a picture that takes <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> person’s chat-log and that person has a scale—a sliminess scale as he calls it—and you can rate the pervert from, I think it’s, one to five. To me, that kind of gives a sense of entertainment. Anybody that finds entertainment value in exploiting children, I have a problem with it." ...|$|E
