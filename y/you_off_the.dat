500|$|The clean {{version of}} [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from music critics who noted the effective melding {{of the intense}} vocal delivery of Hilson with the rapid pace and banging beat of the song. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that all the five songs Hilson penned for No Boys Allowed, {{with the exception of}} the [...] "frantic electronic firework 'The Way You Love Me', are too featureless to make an impression." [...] Ben Hatliff of The New York Times commented that Hilson [...] "gets a certain energy out of bossiness" [...] on [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] which according to him, goes far for a mainstream female singer in its boasting and sexual hunger. He also added that [...] "it sometimes seems as if it were not a man at all she wants to boss around but Rihanna." [...] Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Hilson moves [...] "to a gritted-teeth half-rapped, half-sung approach" [...] for [...] "The Way You Love Me". He went on complimenting the heavy beat of the song which according to him, matches the [...] "shouted vocals" [...] of the singer on the song. Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] the most emblematic track on No Boys Allowed. He praised the line [...] "I got the kinda lovin' that'll keep <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> streets" [...] and describing the song as rowdy and sexually direct, he concluded that it could be ideal for [...] "the soundtrack to a straight-to-DVD Showgirls sequel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hours {{before the}} raid, {{the head of}} the İHH, Fehmi Bülent Yıldırım, declared, [...] "We're going to defeat the Israeli commandos–we're declaring it now. If you bring your {{soldiers}} here, we will throw <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship and you'll be humiliated {{in front of the whole}} world." [...] Later, according to the crew, a group of about 40 İHH activists took over the ship.|$|E
2500|$|After the Liberals Gerry Phillips and Gerald M. Butts accused Eves {{of having}} no plan {{to pay for}} his $10.4 billion in promises, Eves {{stumbled}} when he could not provide his own cost for his promises. [...] "I couldn't tell <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> top of my head," [...] he admitted. Then came a story {{on the front of the}} Globe and Mail saying that Ontarians would have to pay [...] "millions" [...] in extra premiums because the election call had delayed implementation of new auto insurance regulations promised by Eves on the eve of the campaign. On Wednesday the government was broadsided when - days after a raid at a meat packing plant exposed the sorry state of public health at some abattoirs - leaked documents showed the PC government had been sitting on recommendations to improve meat safety, leading to calls for a public inquiry by the opposition parties. The issue was made worse when Agriculture Minister Helen Johns refused all media calls and had to be literally tracked down in her riding by reporters.|$|E

2500|$|Delhomme {{finished}} {{the game with}} 16 completions out of 33 attempts for 323 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions for a passer rating of 113.6. He was seen standing on the field during the Patriots' post-game celebration; he later commented: [...] "I wanted {{to catch up to}} the moment of {{what it feels like to}} be on the other side, to be on this side, the losing side. To let it sink in, to hurt, so when we start practice in the fall, the two-a-days and there are days during the season when I’m tired and I want to go home, but I need to watch that extra film. I want to get back there, but I want to get on the other side of that field. They rope <b>you</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> losing team basically. I just want to get on the other side of that rope. I just wanted to watch and let it sink in and hurt a little bit. When I have a tough day, I’ll just think about that feeling and it will make me dig down just a little deeper." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} episode of Raw Is War, Foley then reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked {{shirt with a}} loose necktie and ended his feud with The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, the two competed in the second-ever Hell in a Cell match in June 1998 at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were {{discussing}} the previous year's Hell in a Cell (which took place at Badd Blood in October) that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming {{ideas about how to}} top that match when Funk said, laughing, [...] "Maybe you should let him throw <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> top of the cage", Foley replied: [...] "Yeah," [...] I shot back, [...] "then I could climb back up – and he could throw me off again." [...] Man, that was a good one, and we were having a good time thinking completely ludicrous things to do inside, outside, and on top of the cage. After a while I got serious and said quietly to Terry, [...] "I think I can do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{received}} some mixed reactions from critics. Filmfare rated the film 4 out of 5 and wrote, [...] "Guzaarish is unabashedly Sanjay Leela Bhansali. In a film where life {{itself is the}} villain everything is larger than life, no surprise there. The house is grand, the characters even more so, the laughter is magnificent, the pain operatic and the treatment {{of all of the}} above is colossal in a deafening, attention seeking way that leaves no room for subtext or imagination." [...] Writing for NDTV, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 and believed that the film would be effective if the writing was more organic and the emotions felt more authentic but Bhansali never gives us a chance to invest in these people. Reuters trashed the movie for its over the top performances and stated that the lead actor Hrithik Roshan is the only saving grace of the movie where [...] "everything else, like Aishwarya Rai's make-up, seems fake and loud, and puts <b>you</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> emotions, the set design, the dialogues, Hrithik Roshan's beard are all out of this world, residing in some alien planet that only Bhansali inhabits." [...] The Hindu reviewer Sudhish Kamath gave a negative review to the movie and heaped praises on the lead actor Hrithik Roshan saying that [...] "Hrithik Roshan gives one of the best performances of his career as a man trapped in a wheelchair/bad film, desperately craving for freedom.." [...] As a bottomline he said that Guzaarish is [...] "Highly pretentious, boring film with leftover craving-for-your-sympathy melodrama from Black and unused sets from Saawariya". The Times of India, which gave a 4.5 rating, mentioned that [...] "Guzaarish is an unusual film in many respects".|$|E
