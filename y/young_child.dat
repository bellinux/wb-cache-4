40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, {{and how these}} spaces are caught up with how societies understand <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and early childhood. It identifies three broad ways of theorising the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live their lives, and considers how these both reflect and produce young children’s position within society. First, the chapter considers those, adult-designated, spaces for <b>young</b> <b>children</b> that are so common in the minority world, which are intended to protect <b>young</b> <b>children</b> from {{the dangers of the}} adult world and to shape and ‘improve’ them in line with a range of desired outcomes (both developmental and societal). Second, the chapter explores theories of young children’s spaces, which emphasise the active role that <b>young</b> <b>children</b> play in responding to and shaping the spaces around them. Finally, the chapter develops ideas of inhabiting young children’s spaces to develop and consider a more vital account of the materiality of the spaces in which <b>young</b> <b>children</b> live, which moves beyond beyond the dualistic accounts that have tended to dominate post-Enlightenment Western thought...|$|R

40|$|About the Book:] <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as {{citizens}} explores how <b>young</b> <b>children</b> (birth to 12 years of age) {{can and should}} participate in civic life. It reflects new images of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> as social actors, together with the increased interest in children's rights in the public sphere. The contributors are early childhood researchers, pedagogues, children and policy makers from Australia and Europe. They present a rich diversity of research-based case studies in which policy-makers and educators have listened to young children¹s views on public issues and responded in respectful and ethical ways. <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> {{as citizens}} is a unique resource for policy-makers, those working in children's services and child advocates. It shows how best to consult <b>young</b> <b>children</b> and it presents a range of arguments that consulting <b>young</b> <b>children</b> about policies and decisions that affect them supports and enhances a vigorous democratic society. Students (undergraduate and postgraduate), teachers and researchers in early childhood studies can use individual chapters of <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> as citizens selectively to explore issues of increasing complexity in different courses. The book {{would be a good}} set text for Honours and Master's programs that address issues of children's rights...|$|R
