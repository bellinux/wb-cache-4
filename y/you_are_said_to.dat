Your interest in Eunice is a personal interest of some kind. I don't pretend to guess what it is. As for myself, it is plain that somebody else has been setting you against me, before Miss Jillgall got possession of your private ear." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{can only}} add to it, sir, {{my belief that}} every word you hear is true.

60|$|We at this distance, who {{see nothing}} of the spring of actions, are forced by mere {{conjecture}} to assign two reasons for your desiring us to repeal the Sacramental Test: One is, because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> imagine {{it will be one}} step towards the like good work in England: The other more immediate, that it will open a way for rewarding several persons who have well deserved upon a great occasion, but who are now unqualified through that impediment.|$|E

Look on, {{and you will see}} that a pretty young widow like her cannot fail to get into scrapes; have offers made to her, or at least the credit of them. I'd lay you ten pounds that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> be engaged to her {{yourself}} by this time, and it is no one's fault but your own that you are not. It is in the very nature of things that she will be driven to shelter herself from the persecution, with whoever has bided his time." ...|$|E

"Madam," [...] replied Mr. Cargill, [...] "in {{your present}} state of mind, and in such a scene as this, I cannot enter upon a topic for which the season is unfit, and you, I am sorry to say, are totally unprepared. It is enough that you know the grounds on which you stand.

And this you may rely on: if she pleases my taste, or if I think it worth while in a pecuniary point of view, I'll pounce on your prize and bear her away triumphant in spite of your teeth. Yet I don't like dumpies either, and Brown says she is little and stout--the better fitted for a wiry, starved-looking chap like you.

Let us look to your conduct to the party to which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> belong. Your votes are theirs, your influence is theirs; and for all this, what return, my Lord Marquess, what return? My Lord, I am not rash enough to suppose, that your Lordship, alone and unsupported, can make yourself the arbiter of this country's destinies. It would be ridiculous to entertain such {{an idea for a}} second. The existence of such a man would not be endured by the nation for a second. But, my Lord, union is strength. Nay, my Lord, start not; I am not going to advise you to throw yourself into the arms of opposition; leave such advice for greenhorns. I am not going to adopt a line of conduct, which would, for a moment, compromise the consistency of your high character; leave such advice for fools. My Lord, it is to preserve your consistency, it is to vindicate your high character, it is to make the Marquess of Carabas perform the duties which society requires from him, that I, Vivian Grey, a member of that society, and an humble friend of your Lordship, speak so boldly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Speaking morally, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> have a {{right to}} do a thing, if all persons are morally bound not to hinder you from doing it. But, in another sense, to {{have a right}} to do a thing is the {{opposite}} of having no right to do it, i.e., of being under a moral obligation to forbear doing it. In this sense, to say that you {{have a right to}} do a thing, means that you may do it without any breach of duty on your part; that other persons not only ought not to hinder you, but have no cause to think worse of you for doing it. This is a perfectly distinct proposition from the preceding. The right which you have by virtue of a duty incumbent upon other persons, is obviously quite a different thing from a right consisting in the absence of any duty incumbent upon yourself. Yet the two things are perpetually confounded. Thus, a man will say he has a right to publish his opinions; which may be true in this sense, that it would be a breach of duty in any other person to interfere and prevent the publication: but he assumes thereupon that, in publishing his opinions, he himself violates no duty; which may either be true or false, depending, as it does, on his having taken due pains to satisfy himself, first, that the opinions are true, and next, that their publication in this manner, and at this particular juncture, will probably be beneficial to the interests of truth on the whole.|$|E

60|$|Mr. The Englishman was not {{particularly}} strong in the French language {{as a means of}} oral communication, though he read it very well.

60|$|No man {{of letters}} ever had so great {{a measure of}} that gift as you; none gave of it more freely to all who came--to the chance {{associate}} of the hour, as to the characters, all so burly and full-blooded, who flocked from your brain. Thus it <b>was</b> that <b>you</b> failed when you approached the supernatural. Your ghosts had too much flesh and blood, more than the living persons of feebler fancies. A writer so fertile, so rapid, so masterly in {{the ease with which}} he worked, could not escape the reproaches of barren envy.

I intend to tell you, without disguise or prejudice, the opinion which the world has entertained of you: and to let you see I write this without any sort of ill will, you shall first hear the sentiments they have to your advantage. No man disputes the gracefulness of your person; you are allowed {{to have a good}} and clear understanding, cultivated by the knowledge of men and manners, though not by literature. You are no ill orator in the Senate; <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> excel in the art of bridling and subduing your anger, and stifling or concealing your resentments. You have been a most successful general, of long experience, great conduct, and much personal courage. You have gained many important victories for the commonwealth, and forced the strongest towns in Mesopotamia to surrender, for which frequent supplications have been decreed by the Senate. Yet with all these qualities, and this merit, give me leave to say, you are neither beloved by the patricians, or plebeians at home, nor by the officers or private soldiers of your own army abroad: And, do you know, Crassus, that this is owing to a fault, of which you may cure yourself, by one minutes reflection? What shall I say? You are the richest person in the commonwealth; you have no male child, your daughters are all married to wealthy patricians; you are far in the decline of life; and yet you are deeply stained with that odious and ignoble vice of covetousness:[8] It is affirmed, that you descend even to the meanest and most scandalous degrees of it; and while you possess so many millions, while you are daily acquiring so many more, you are solicitous how to save a single sesterce, of which a hundred ignominious instances are produced, and in all men's mouths. I will only mention that passage of the buskins,[9] which after abundance of persuasion, you would hardly suffer to be cut from your legs, when they were so wet and cold, that to have kept them on, would have endangered your life.|$|E

5000|$|The {{extensive}} use of affixes can give rise to long words, e.g. Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına, meaning [...] "Just like <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> {{be one of those}} that we couldnt manage to convert to a Czechoslovak". While this case is contrived, long words frequently occur in normal Turkish, as in this heading of a newspaper obituary column: Bayramlaşamadıklarımız (Bayram festival-Recipr-Impot-Partic-Plur-PossPl1; [...] "Those of our number with whom we cannot exchange the seasons greetings"). Another example {{can be seen in the}} final word of this heading of the online Turkish Spelling Guide (İmlâ Kılavuzu): Dilde birlik, ulusal birliğin vazgeçilemezlerindendir ("Unity in language is among the indispensables dispense-Pass-Impot-Plur-PossS3-Abl-Copula of national unity ~ Linguistic unity is a sine qua non of national unity").|$|E

5000|$|Having briefly {{spoken of}} the divine nature {{in the terms of}} Greek philosophy, Aristides {{proceeds}} to ask which of all the races of men will be at all partaken of the truth about God.

He chooses this order so as to work up to a climax of error and absurdity in heathen worship. The direct nature-worship of the Chaldeans is shown to be false because its objects are works of the Creator, fashioned for the use of men. They obey false laws and have no power over themselves. The Greeks had erred worse than the Chaldeans, [...] "calling those gods who are no gods, according to their evil lusts, in order that having these as advocates of their wickedness they may commit adultery, rape, plunder and kill, and do the worst of deeds". The gods of Olympus are challenged one by one, and shown to be either vile or helpless, or both at once. A heaven of quarrelling divinities not inspire a reasonable worship. These gods are not even respectable; how can they be adorable? The Egyptians have to be worse than all the nations; for they were not content with the worships of the Chaldeans and Greeks, but introduced, of moreover, as gods even brute beasts of the dry land and of the waters, and plants and herbs: ...|$|E
