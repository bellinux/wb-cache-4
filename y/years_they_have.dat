5|$|The Columbia and {{its tributaries}} have been central to the region's culture and economy for {{thousands}} of <b>years.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> been used for transportation since ancient times, linking the region's many cultural groups. The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish, which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline waters of the Pacific Ocean. These fish—especially the salmon species—provided the core subsistence for native peoples.|$|E
5|$|US Navy {{decompression}} tables {{have gone}} {{through a lot of}} development over the <b>years.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> mostly been based on parallel multi-compartment exponential models. The number of compartments has varied, and the allowable supersaturation in the various compartments during ascent has undergone major development based on experimental work and records of decompression sickness incidents.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. Spiders will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse spiders and widow spiders, would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 <b>years.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> been deemed to be the world's most dangerous spiders on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

5|$|Atrus {{calls the}} Stranger {{to his home}} in Tomahna to request his friend's assistance. Atrus is the writer of special books, which serve as links to worlds known as Ages. Twenty years earlier, his two sons, Sirrus and Achenar, {{destroyed}} his library on Myst and trapped their parents in order to plunder the wealth of Atrus' Ages. The Stranger's intervention saved Atrus, who had imprisoned his sons via traps intended for thieves. Atrus' wife Catherine hopes that, after twenty <b>years,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> finally repented for their crimes. Atrus is not as sure his sons have reformed, and so wishes the Stranger to act as an impartial judge. After being knocked unconscious by an explosion, the Stranger realizes that Yeesha, Atrus' daughter, has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|C. mutica {{are native}} to shallow {{protected}} {{bodies of water}} in the Sea of Japan. In as little as 40 <b>years,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become an invasive species in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and along the coasts of New Zealand. They are believed to have been accidentally introduced to these areas through the global maritime traffic and aquaculture. Outside of their native range, C.mutica are often exclusively synanthropic, being found in large numbers in and around areas of human activity. Their ecological and economic impact as an invasive species is unknown, but they pose a serious threat to native populations of skeleton shrimp in the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said Japan {{wanted to}} shed the passiveness it has {{maintained}} {{since the end}} of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Abe said Japan wanted to play a key role and offered neighboring countries Japan's support. In recent <b>years,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been engaged in international peacekeeping operations including the UN peacekeeping. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society. New military guidelines, announced in December 2010, will direct the JSDF away from its Cold War focus on the former Soviet Union to a focus on China, especially regarding the territorial dispute over the Senkaku Islands.|$|E

5|$|Tigers once ranged widely across eastern Eurasia, {{from the}} Black Sea in the west, to the Indian Ocean in the south, and from Kolyma to Sumatra in the east. Over the past 100 <b>years,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> lost 93% of their {{historic}} range, {{and have been}} extirpated from Western and Central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast, Southern, and Eastern Asia. Today, they range from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies have been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The global population in the wild is estimated to number between 3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 {{at the start of}} the 20th century, with most remaining populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other, in which about 2,000 tigers live on the Indian subcontinent. A 2016 global census estimated the population of wild tigers at approximately 3,890 individuals. Major reasons for population decline include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is estimated at less than , a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s. In 2016, the WWF declared that the world's count of wild tigers has risen for the first time in a century.|$|E
