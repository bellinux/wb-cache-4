And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims." [...] The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket ('The Threat from [...] the Darkness) condemning Islamic spiritual leaders [...] "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire." [...] In October 2005, Politiken, another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said {{they would be willing to}} draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.|$|E

In certain cases, the deduction may require off-setting income, while in other cases, the deduction may be used without corresponding income.

2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. I felt for her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
