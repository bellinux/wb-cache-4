The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in starry ray (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while red gurnard (0. 33 μg g- 1) and <b>yellow</b> <b>gurnard</b> (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Total mercury {{concentrations}} were measured from the muscle {{of different kinds}} of fish: <b>yellow</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Trigla lucerna), red gurnard (Aspitrigla cuculus) red fish (Helicolenus dactylopterus), skate spp. (Raje spp.), goldline (Sarpa salpa), atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) caught in the South Adriatic Sea (south Italy) in the period June/August 1995. The highest total mercury levels were found in the benthic marine organisms and particularly in skates (Raje spp.) whose values ranged from 0. 05 to 2. 65 mg/kg wet wt with a mean value of 1. 02 mg/kg wet wt. As for pelagic species, the highest mean levels were observed in Atlantic bonito (0. 34 mg/kg wet wt), while in goldline the mean content of total mercury was the lowest (0. 07 mg/kg wet wt).

According to the rules in force (Official Journal of the European Communities 1994) 53 % of skate and Atlantic bonito samples showed concentrations exceeding the peak value of 1 mg/kg, while for the other species, only 28 % of samples exceeded the peak value fixed at 0. 5 mg/kg. Correlations between total mercury concentration and specimen weight were evident in all examined species except for goldline and skates. [ [...] . ...|$|E
