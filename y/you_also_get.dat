But if you go with covers <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>get</b> all of the baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E

2500|$|PC Gamers Phil Savage {{praised the}} game's {{character}} interactions, noting that [...] "it's through these brief, unguarded conversations that the cyberpunk bartending sim slowly unfolds its story; {{not of a}} dystopian world, but of {{the people living in}} it." [...] Reviewing the game's prologue trailer, he added that [...] "it's an interesting concept, and well executed in what is—at this stage—a somewhat limited capacity." [...] Julian Benson of Kotaku wrote that [...] "Valhalla is a cocktail of game genres. It draws from visual novels, with each customer who visits your bar having a different story to tell. There's a healthy measure of Papers, Please, too, with you having to perform a mundane job (drink mixing) by following a complicated list of tasks. [...] And, on top of that <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>get</b> to manage and decorate your bar, so there's a dash of Animal Crossing for flavour." [...] He also quipped that [...] "year after year, nothing seems to slow the pace of successful cyberpunk bartender simulators." [...] Push Square's Nicola Hayden additionally added that [...] "gaining cult success around the more niche areas of the Internet, VA-11 HALL-A, a cyberpunk bartending simulator, has managed to stir up quite a fuss." [...] Pete Davison of MoeGamer praised the prologue's characters, dialogue, as well as cohesion between the gameplay and storytelling, finding it to be an [...] "enormously interesting prospect".|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, {{the writing}} team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being {{considered}} {{to direct the}} film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for [...] "chemistry". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers, the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who [...] wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close {{to the age of}} Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to [...] "see what they were doing with it" [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like [...] "so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said, [...] "I was really excited about that, because the other movies have shown what I described as the Penthouse level of the Marvel world, what it’s like to be Thor, Iron Man, you know, a billionaire playboy and all of that stuff. But what’s great about Spider-Man is that he’s a regular kid and so by showing his story <b>you</b> <b>also</b> <b>get</b> to show what the ground level is like in a world where the Avengers exist".|$|E
