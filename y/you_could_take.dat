Speaking with SCMagazineUS.com, a security strategist for Top Layer Networks, Ken Pappas {{said that he}} thought that botnets were involved in the Anonymous operation: [...] "There are circles out there where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> ownership of the bot machines that are already owned and launch a simultaneous attack against [...] like the church from 50,000 PCs, all at the same time".|$|E
500|$|National Review writer Mark Hemingway lauded the film's {{celebration of}} liberty. [...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, I {{have yet to}} see it. If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> one day and do absolutely anything, piling into a convertible with your best girl and your best friend and taking in a baseball game, an art museum, and a fine meal seems about as good as it gets," [...] wrote Hemingway.|$|E

500|$|For {{fifteen years}} Nolan {{had wanted to}} shoot in the IMAX format, and he also used it for [...] "quiet scenes which pictorially we thought would be interesting." [...] The use of IMAX cameras {{provided}} many new challenges for the filmmakers: the cameras were much larger and heavier than standard cameras, and produced noise which made recording dialogue difficult. In addition, the cameras had short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes {{and the cost of}} the film stock was much greater than standard 35mm film. Nevertheless, Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie." [...] In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines.|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} of the original investigation stated that, [...] "the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> out {{two thirds of the}} columns in a tower and the building would still stand." [...] The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7WTC caused floor beams and girders to heat and subsequently [...] "caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down".|$|E
500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E

2500|$|Frank Gibeau, {{president}} of Electronic Arts' Games Label announced that Electronic Arts {{may use the}} underlying technology of Spore to develop eclectic software titles, such as action, real-time strategy and role-playing video games, focusing on player-creation concepts. Gibeau stated, [...] "What's so beautiful about Spore is that it's extremely malleable... <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> it to different platforms, like (Web-page) flash games, the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Nintendo's Wii. It really travels well to other platforms." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jinkins {{was also}} very {{involved}} in the show's music. One of the show's most notable elements is its unique soundtrack, which consist of various mouth sounds by voice actor Fred Newman. [...] "Fred showed me how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>take</b> out a guitar and use a tuna can filled with water that you'd thump with your finger," [...] said Jinkins. In the series' Doug's favorite rock group is the Beets, a play on the Beatles. The band's members also visually resemble Ringo Starr of the Beatles and Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin, and their penchant for endless reunion tours owes to the Who. Jinkins viewed the series' music as an accent to the storytelling.|$|E
