However, since the timescale of the speed variation {{is much greater than}} that of the variation in angle of attack, its effects are negligible as far as the directional stability of the vehicle is concerned. Similarly, the effect of roll on yawing motion was also ignored, because missiles generally have low aspect ratio configurations and the roll inertia is much less than the <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia,</b> consequently the roll loop is expected to be much faster than the yaw response, and is ignored. These simplifications of the problem based on a priori knowledge, represent an engineer's approach.

5000|$|Slow {{response}} - sideways acceleration {{does not}} start immediately when the steering is turned {{and may not}} stop immediately when it is returned to center. This is partly caused by body roll. Other causes include tires with high slip angle, and yaw and roll angular inertia. Roll angular inertia aggravates body roll by delaying it.

5000|$|The {{rearward}} weight bias {{preferred by}} sports and racing cars results from handling effects {{during the transition}} from straight-ahead to cornering. During corner entry the front tires, in addition to generating part of the lateral force required to accelerate the car's center of mass into the turn, also generate a torque about the car's vertical axis that starts the car rotating into the turn. However, the lateral force being generated by the rear tires is acting in the opposite torsional sense, trying to rotate the {{car out of the}} turn. For this reason, a car with [...] "50/50" [...] weight distribution will understeer on initial corner entry. To avoid this problem, sports and racing cars often have a more rearward weight distribution. In the case of pure racing cars, this is typically between [...] "40/60" [...] and [...] "35/65". This gives the front tires an advantage in overcoming the car's moment of <b>inertia</b> (<b>yaw</b> angular <b>inertia),</b> thus reducing corner-entry understeer.|$|R
40|$|More {{accurate}} {{information about the}} basic vehicle parameters can improve the dynamic control functions of a vehicle. Methods for online estimation of the mass, the rolling resistance, the aerodynamic drag coefficient, the <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> and the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity of an electric hybrid vehicle is therefore proposed. The estimators use the standard vehicle sensor set and the estimate of the electric motor torque. No additional sensors are hence required and no assumptions are made regarding the tyre or the vehicle characteristics. Consequently, all information about the vehicle is available to the estimator. The estimators are evaluated using both simulations and experiments. Estimations of the mass, the rolling resistance and the aerodynamic drag coefficient {{are based on a}} recursive least-squares method with multiple forgetting factors. The mass estimate converged to within 3 % of the measured vehicle mass for the test cases with sufficient excitation that were evaluated. Two methods to estimate the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity and the <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> are also proposed. The first method is based on the equations of motion and was found {{to be sensitive to the}} measurement and parameter errors. The second method is based on the estimated mass and seat-belt indicators. This estimator is more robust and reduces the estimation error in comparison with that obtained by assuming static parameters. The results show that the proposed method improves the estimations of the inertial parameters. Hence, it enables online non-linear tyre force estimators and tyre-model-based tyre–road friction estimators to be used in production vehicles...|$|E

50|$|Although {{a typical}} jet {{aircraft}} has {{most of its}} mass distributed close to its centerline, and the aerodynamics in planes designed to be stable (such that small fluctuations in control tend to return it to attitude equilibrium) provide some stabilization, {{it is important to}} remember that aircraft realistically always fly with a small non-zero random rate of <b>yawing</b> and pitching. <b>Inertia</b> coupling on an aircraft usually manifests itself as a downward pitching; rolling causes the tail mass to be flung upward and thus the nose to tip down.

It {{was found that the}} dominant factors affecting stability were the trailer <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia,</b> nose mass (mass distribution), and trailer axle position. The tyre pressure also affects the stability, although this effect is less significant. It is interesting to see that the trailer mass alone does not dramatically affect the high-speed stability, as this runs contrary to current guidelines relating to limits on the relative mass of the car and trailer. Experimental tests on a friction stabilizer and on car electronic stability programs demonstrate that both of these improve the high-speed stability and help to delay the onset of 'snaking'...|$|E
40|$|A flutter test using a scaled {{model of}} an {{advanced}} composite wing for a Navy attack aircraft {{has been conducted}} in the NASA Langley Research Center Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The model was a wall-mounted half-span wing with a semi-span of 6. 63 ft. The wing had an aspect ratio of 5. 31, taper ratio of 0. 312, and quarter-chord sweep of 25 degrees. The model was supported {{in a manner that}} simulated the load path in the carry-through structure of the aircraft and the symmetric boundary condition at the fuselage centerline. The model was capable of carrying external stores from three pylon locations on the wing. Flutter tests were conducted for the wing with and without external stores. No flutter was encountered for the clean wing at test conditions which simulated the scaled airplane operating envelope. Flutter boundaries were obtained for several external store configurations. The flutter boundaries for the fuel tanks were nearly Mach number independent (occurring at constant dynamic pressure). To study the aerodynamic effect of the fuel tank stores, pencil stores (slender cylindrical rods) which had the same mass and pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> as the fuel tanks were tested on the model. These pencil store configurations exhibited a transonic dip in the flutter dynamic pressure, indicating that the aerodynamic effect of the actual fuel tanks on flutter was significant.

The analysis gave satisfactory predictions of flutter for the pencil store configurations, but unsatisfactory correlation for the actual fuel tank configurations...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{powertrain}} faults {{that could}} occur during normal driving {{can affect the}} dynamic behaviour of the vehicle and might result in significant course deviations. The severity depends both {{on the characteristics of}} the fault itself as well as on how sensitive the vehicle reacts to this type of fault. In this work, a sensitivity study is conducted on the effects of vehicle design parameters, such as geometries and tyre characteristics, and fault characteristics. The vehicle specifications are based on three different parameter sets representing a small city car, a medium-sized sedan and a large passenger car. The evaluation criteria cover the main motions of the vehicle, i. e. longitudinal velocity difference, lateral offset and side slip angle on the rear axle as indicator of the directional stability. A design of experiments approach is applied and the influence on the course deviation is analysed for each studied parameter separately and for all first order combinations. Vehicle parameters of high sensitivity have been found for each criterion. The mass factor is highly relevant for all three motions, while the additional factors wheel base, track width, <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> and vehicle velocity are mainly influencing the lateral and the yaw motion. Changes in the tyre parameters are in general less significant than the vehicle parameters. Among the tyre parameters, the stiffness factor of the tyres on the rear axle has the major influence resulting in a reduction of the course deviation for a stiffer tyre. The fault amplitude is an important fault parameter, together with the fault starting gradient and number of wheels with fault. In this study, it was found that a larger vehicle representing a SUV is more sensitive to these types of faults. To conclude, the result of an electric powertrain fault can cause significant course deviations for all three vehicle types studied. QC 20140909 </p...|$|E
50|$|Unless {{the vehicle}} is very short, {{compared}} to its height or width, these are about equal. Angular inertia determines the rotational inertia of an object for a given rate of rotation.The <b>yaw</b> angular <b>inertia</b> tends to keep the direction the car is pointing changing at a constant rate. This makes it slower to swerve or go into a tight curve, and it also makes it slower to turn straight again.The pitch angular inertia detracts from {{the ability of the}} suspension to keep front and back tire loadings constant on uneven surfaces and therefore contributes to bump steer.Angular inertia is an integral over the square of the distance from the center of gravity, so it favors small cars even though the lever arms (wheelbase and track) also increase with scale. (Since cars have reasonable symmetrical shapes, the off-diagonal terms of the angular inertia tensor can usually be ignored.)Mass near the ends of a car can be avoided, without re-designing it to be shorter, by the use of light materials for bumpers and fenders or by deleting them entirely. If most of the weight {{is in the middle of}} the car then the vehicle will be easier to spin, and therefore will react quicker to a turn.|$|R
40|$|Summary. The <b>yawing</b> {{moment of}} <b>inertia</b> has been {{obtained}} {{by measuring the}} acceleration in yaw resulting from {{the release of a}} wing-tip parachute. Lateral accelerometers mounted near the fore and aft extremities of the aircraft on a line parallel to the principal axis of inertia were used to measure the yawing acceleration. The principal axis is known in this case from previous ground measurements, but it is shown that 1 degree error in axis inclination would only produce an error of about 3 per cent in the measured inertia. The results obtained from the flight tests are encouraging and are about 3 per cent lower than earlier measurements on a ground rig and about 2 per cent greater than the manufacturer's original estimate.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to use numerical optimisation to investigate the on-limit behaviour of an open wheel downforce type race car using the best compromise of modelling accuracy and computational effort. The current state of lap simulation methods are identified, and the GG speed diagram is described. The use of constrained optimisation, which is a form of optimal control, is used to develop the methods described in this thesis. A seven degree of freedom vehicle model validated by other researchers is used for method validation purposes, and is extended, where possible, to make the modelling of vehicle components more physically significant, without adversely affecting the computational time. This research suggests a quasi steady state approach that produces a GG speed diagram and circuit simulation tool that is capable of optimising vehicle parameters and subsystems in addition to the prevailing control vector of steer and throttle response. The use of numerical optimisation to optimise the rear differential hydraulic pressure and the roll stiffness distribution to maximise vehicle performance is demonstrated. The optimisation of the rear differential hydraulic pressure showed a very small improvement in vehicle performance in combined high speed braking and cornering, but highlighted the ability of the differential to affect the cornering behaviour of the vehicle. The optimisation of the roll stiffness distribution research showed that a significant improvement in the lateral acceleration capability of the vehicle could be achieved at all vehicle speeds between 20 and 80 m/s, especially in combined braking and cornering. In addition, a parameter sensitivity study around a realistic Formula One vehicle setup was conducted, looking at the sensitivity of vehicle mass, <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia,</b> tyres, centre of gravity location and engine torque to vehicle performance.

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} {{have the}} potential to significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions for personal and commercial road transport and number of electric vehicles is likely to increase in the future due to stricter emission legislations. In order to accelerate market penetration, the competiveness of electric vehicles should increase in comparison to conventional vehicles. Active safety is an area where electric vehicle have a possible advantage over conventional vehicle and that could reduce the number of fatalities and injuries in road traffic accidents. However, the performance of active safety systems today is limited by the knowledge of vehicle state estimates and vehicle parameters, e. g. vehicle speed and the tyre-road friction coefficient. This thesis investigates the potential benefits of using the electric motor as a sensing element to improve state and parameter estimations and thereby also active safety systems. In particular, accurate torque estimation provided by electric propulsion is utilized as an additional source of information. The possibility of using active tyre force excitation for the estimation of the tyre-road friction coefficient is also investigated. The results show that there is a potential to improve the longitudinal and, in some situations, the lateral tyre force estimation using electric motors. However, the estimates are sensitive to errors in the inertial parameters. A method for estimating the vehicle inertial parameters was therefore proposed. The estimate of the vehicle mass converged to within 3 % of the measured value for the evaluated test cases. However, the estimation of the longitudinal centre of gravity position and the <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> of the vehicle is sensitive to measurement errors and disturbances. This is mainly due to the weak link between lateral and longitudinal dynamics in normal driving conditions. An alternative method using the seat belt indicators was therefore proposed. This method improves the estimates of these parameters on average when compared to assuming default values. A method to estimate the tyre-road friction coefficient with active tyre force excitation was also proposed. This method enables the estimation of the tyre-road friction coefficient when demanded from an active safety system. Electric motors offer several advantages for active tyre force excitation. The fast response and the ability to apply both positive and negative torque can improve the slip control of the wheels, which is crucial for vehicle stability during the intervention. In summary, the improved wheel torque estimation has the potential to improve the tyre force estimation in both the longitudinal direction directly and in the lateral direction through improved inertial parameter estimation. Furthermore, the electric motor as an actuator provides further opportunities during active tyre force excitation...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} work is {{an investigation of}} active and passive methods to reduce rollover tendency of a three wheeled platform. This configuration is common in small to medium aircraft landing gears, mobile robots, and fuel efficient futuristic concept vehicles. In developing countries three wheeled vehicles (TWV) have a significant share in point to point public transport. Such vehicles have a higher rollover risk resulting in significant single vehicle fatal crashes, and thus are {{the main focus of}} the current research. In Delta configuration the front single wheel offers no roll resistance, hence no lateral load transfer takes place during cornering at the front axle. The effect on directional behaviour is evaluated for this unique lateral load transfer setup. Dynamics of the vehicle are studied in the state space spanned by the yaw rate and side slip angle. These states encompass the directional behaviour of the vehicle fairly well. The effect on roll over and directional behaviour is assessed. For aircraft tricycle landing gears limit handling behaviour in the form of over-steering behaviour appears much before an un-tripped rollover. This is also observed for existing commercial three wheeled vehicles used for public transport when operated on low friction surfaces. This results in immediate loss of control resulting in collision with other vehicles or road sides resulting in tripped rollovers. Factor effecting passive rollover propensity are related to possible changes in directional response of the vehicle. For delta configuration vehicles, braking unloads the rear axle, reducing the lateral load transfer required for rollover. Due relatively low <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> the vehicle response to steering inputs is also better for three wheeled platforms. Based on these observations an active front steering based sliding mode controller is presented for rollover prevention. A vehicle model for direct control of roll angle using steering as an input is developed. An adapting reference based on roll angle at steady state conditions corresponding to a threshold lateral load transfer ratio, is used for sliding surface design. The robustness of the controller is demonstrated using a nonlinear model of CarSim software. The yaw rate error introduced by increasing the turn radius by the controller is than compensated using a brake based system. Both differential braking based Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and proportional braking are evaluated for efficacy. Giving a higher priority to rollover mitigation, the active front steering is always activated after a threshold lateral load transfer value. The brake based systems are also evaluated for directional control of the vehicle on low friction surfaces. A rule based integration scheme based upon performance of the steering and brake based controllers is proposed. Standard critical driving maneuvers are used to gauge efficacy of the integrated controller...|$|E

This thesis concerns accurate plausibilisation of two of these sensors, namely the yaw rate sensor and the lateral acceleration sensor.

The unknown and time-varying cornering stiffnesses are adapted and other unknown quantities such as <b>yaw</b> moment of <b>inertia</b> is estimated. The Kalman filter transforms the measured signals into a sequence of residuals that are then investigated with the aid of various change detection methods such as the CuSum algorithm. An investigation into the area of adaptive thresholding has also been made.

The results of the flight tests of the model were correlated with calculated stability and control characteristics and, in general, good agreement was obtained. The tests showed the following effects of increased rolling and yawing moments of inertia: no appreciable change in spiral stability; reductions in oscillatory stability that were serious at high values of dihedral; {{a reduction in the}} sensitivity of the model to gust disturbances; and a reduction in rolling acceleration provided by the ailerons, which caused a marked increase in time to reach a given angle of bank.

40|$|As {{manufacturers}} are pushing their {{research and development}} toward more simulation based and computer aided methods, vehicle dynamics modeling and simulation become more important than ever. The challenge lies in how to utilize the new technology to its fullest, delivering the best possible performance given certain objectives and current restrictions. Here, optimization methods in different forms can be a tremendous asset. However, the solution to an optimization problem will always rely on the problem formulation, where model validity plays a crucial role. The main emphasis in this thesis lies within methodology and analysis of optimal control oriented topics for safety-critical road-vehicle maneuvers. A crucial element here is the vehicle models. This is investigated as a first study, evaluating {{the degree to which}} different model configurations can represent the lateral vehicle dynamics in critical maneuvers, where it is shown that even the low-complexity models describe the most essential vehicle characteristics surprisingly well. How to formulate the optimization problems and utilize optimal control tools is not obvious. Therefore, a methodology for road-vehicle maneuvering in safety-critical driving scenarios is presented, and used in evaluation studies of various vehicle model configurations and different road-surface conditions. It was found that the overall dynamics is described similarly for both the high- and low-complexity models, as well as for various road-surface conditions. If more information about the surroundings is available, the best control actions might differ from the ones in traditional safety systems. This is also studied, where the fundamental control strategies of classic electronic stability control is compared to the optimal strategy in a safety-critical scenario. It is concluded that the optimal braking strategy not only differs from the traditional strategies, but actually counteracts the fundamental intentions from which the traditional systems are based on. In contrast to passenger cars, heavy trucks experience other characteristics due to the different geometric proportions. Rollover is one example, which has to be considered in critical maneuvering. Model configurations predicting this phenomenon are investigated using optimal control methods. The results show that the simple first go-to models have to be constrained very conservatively to prevent rollover in more rapid maneuvers. In vehicle systems designed for path following, which has become a trending topic with the expanding area of automated driving, the requirements on vehicle modeling can be very high. These requirements ultimately depend on several various properties, where the path restrictions and path characteristics are very influential factors. The interplay between these path properties and the required model characteristics is here investigated. In situations where a smooth path is obtained, low-complexity models can suffice if path deviation tolerances are set accordingly. In more rapid and tricky maneuvers, however, vehicle properties such as <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> are found to be important. Several of the included studies indicate that vehicle models of lower complexity can describe the overall dynamics sufficiently in critical driving scenarios, which is a valuable observation for future development...|$|E
40|$|Racing teams use {{numerous}} computational tools (CAD, FEA, CFD) {{to aid in}} {{the design}} of racing cars and the development of their performance. Computer simulation of racing car handling through Lap Time Simulation (LTS) packages complements these tools. It also allows teams to examine the effect of different vehicle parameter setups to optimise vehicle performance. In similarity with the automotive industry, time is limited and rapid development of new ideas and technology is essential. Thus, the use of a more sophisticated computer simulation would allow a team to gain a significant advantage over their competitors. As LTS are computationally intensive,previous packages have simulateda full lap using a quasi-static method which splits the path of the vehicle into segments. An analysis is then made of the vehicle at each segment point using the external forces acting on the vehicle. Due to the constant acceleration(i. e. steady state) assumption across each segment, this method {{does not take into account}} the effect of roll, pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> as well as damping and tyre lag effects. Another aspect that is not accounted for is the variation in the fastest effective vehicle path along the circuit (i. e. racing line) due to change in driver control inputs or vehicle parameters. The overall aim of this thesis is to develop a transient LTS methodology, which adopts a strategy to vary the racing line taken in order to address the problems found with the existing quasi-static LTS packages. In parallel an investigation of the accuracy of vehicle models in relationship to racing car performance has been developed. The thesis begins with a study of racing car modelling techniques and a review of current LTS packages. A description is then given of the collection of vehicle handlingd ataf rom an actualr acingc ar (alongw ith attaining a vehicle parametesr et) and the measured results displayed and discussed. The creation of two vehicle models, a simple and sophisticated version, is detailed and the measured results are compared to the simulated results of each vehicle model. It was found that the simple vehicle model does not fully represent the actual vehicle's lateral dynamic behaviour, although its steady state response was deemed to be accurate. The sophisticated vehicle model was seen to not only accurately predict the full range of lateral dynamic behaviour of the actual vehicle, but also the actual vehicle's longitudinal and combined lateral and longitudinal dynamic behaviour. To further investigate LTS techniques, a comparison study was made between various simulation approaches which indicated that the transient approach, although more complicated and time consuming, allows for more accurate tuning of a greater number of vehicle parameters. Finally, the creation of two simulation packages has been detailed and case studies are presented to provide further insight into the look and feel of the packages. The first package is a quasi-static approach based LTS package, where a case study is made into the sensitivity of overall lap time to a range of vehicle parameters. The second is a transient approach based simulation package which optimises the driver controls,varying the racing line taken by the vehicle and ensuring the manoeuvre is completed in the quickest time for that vehicle parameter set.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to make {{advances}} {{in the design of}} humanoid bipedal running robots. We focus on achieving dynamic running locomotion because it is one metric by which we can measure how far robotic technologies have advanced, in relation to existing benchmarks set by humans and other animals. Designing a running human-inspired robot is challenging because human bodies are exceptionally complex mechanisms to mimic. There are only a few humanoid robots designed specifically for running and the existing robots are either constrained to a plane, do not yet exhibit human-like motion, or are unstable. One aspect of bipedal running dynamics that could be understood better, and could improve the performance of these robots, is the role of foot placement in the transverse plane, via rotation of the hip, in the sagittal and coronal planes. To achieve this objective, I have developed and studied a running simulation, designed and built a bipedal running robot, and then conducted an experimental study on the effects of step width on overall whole-body locomotion dynamics. The planar running simulation investigates foot placement in the sagittal plane, by changing the angle of the hip {{at the beginning of each}} stance phase. The model effectively mimics a human-like response to a horizontal or vertical velocity disturbance while running. This is achieved by implementing a controller which changes the hip angle at touch down and by using the energy of the system as control feedback. This controller effectively reduces the time required to recover from a perturbation, reduces the overall energy expended recovering from a perturbation, and allows the legged model to function at significantly lower torque values. The bipedal running robot is designed as a research platform for systematic investigation of key mechanisms and control methods, in order to progressively move towards a more biologically accurate and stable running robot. The result of this design is a simple, lightweight, and powerful research platform which can easily be expanded on in order to systematically study the effects of individual parameters. The step width study investigates the effects of step width in the coronal plane on a 3 D 1 DOF per leg bipedal running gait. The results of this study help to confirm biological hypothesis on how stable running is achieved and suggests the next steps in moving towards a more biologically correct 3 D running robot. A range of step widths were found for which stable locomotion existed, where stability is empirically assessed by checking if a run surpasses 20 steps. The smallest step width studied exhibited unstable rolling behavior, which confirms previous theory stating that dimensionless inertia, a function of step width and mass moment of inertia, effects roll stability. Similarly, yaw stability was observed to increase with wider step widths. The inability to stabilize roll and yaw for narrow step widths is consistent with biological studies where roll and yaw stability are thought to be mainly achieved by active use of the upper body. The widest step width studied exhibited unstable behavior in pitch. Pitching could be significantly impacted by lateral ground reaction forces, the distance from the hip to the center of mass, and changes in the relative magnitudes of roll, pitch, and yaw inertias. It was found that lateral ground reaction forces increase and the vertical distance from hip to center of mass decreases with increasing step width. Further, the magnitude of <b>yaw</b> <b>inertia</b> gets closer to that of pitch. The convergence of these factors suggest that a presently unidentified coupling in roll, pitch, and yaw occurs that yields the observed behavior for wide step widths. ...|$|E

By employing a linear, two-degree-of-freedom bicycle model, it is shown that the general form of the normalized yaw impulse can be written {{as a function of the}} steer angle and the forward, lateral and yaw velocities of the vehicle. This form is referred to as the kinematic yaw impulse. It is demonstrated that the combined application of the dynamic and kinematic expressions of the yaw impulse not only facilitates the explicit assessment and quantification of the transient behaviour of a vehicle, but also reveals the influence of parameters such as the <b>yaw</b> moment of <b>inertia,</b> which traditionally leave the steady-state behaviour unaffected...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} vehicle {{parameter identification}} algorithms, and applies identified parameters to a controller designed for safe path following. A tire-road friction coefficient is estimated using an in-tire accelerometer to measure acceleration signals {{directly from the}} tires. The proposed algorithm first determines a tire-road contact patch with a radial acceleration profile. The estimation algorithm is based on tire lateral deflections obtained from lateral acceleration measurements only inside the contact patch. A new model is derived for the lateral deflection profiles, which provides robustness to orientation-variation of the accelerometer body frame during tire rotation. A novel algorithm is developed to identify three inertial parameters: sprung mass, <b>yaw</b> moment of <b>inertia,</b> and longitudinal position {{of the center of}} gravity. A correlation of inertial parameters is derived and is used for the identification algorithm. Inertial parameters and vehicle states are simultaneously estimated with a dual unscented Kalman filter based on a nonlinear vehicle model. In order to activate and de-activate different modes of the proposedalgorithm, a local observability analysis is performed with the nonlinear vehicle model. The performance and robustness of the proposed approach are demonstrated with extensive CarSim simulations and experimental tests on a flat road with a constant tire-road friction coefficient. Following a curved road can be dangerous if autonomous vehicles do not take roll motion into consideration. A control algorithm is designed to prevent a dangerous vehicle state induced by roll motion while following a curved road. Roll motion is suppressed throughout cornering with model predictive control. A four-wheel nonlinear vehicle model with roll dynamics and a tire brush model are utilized for the prediction of the vehicle state. An optimal balance in the trade-off between vehicle speed androll motion is achieved with full braking as a control actuator. Identified vehicle inertial parameters are incorporated into the designed controller. CarSim simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed controller and the effect of the vehicle parameter estimator...|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} {{research}} on the minimum time vehicle manoeuvring problem, with a particular application to finding the minimum lap time for a Formula One racing car. The proposed method allows to solve the general problem of evaluating the vehicle lateral and longitudinal controls which yield the minimum time required to traverse a lap of a circuit. The minimum time vehicle manoeuvring problem is formulated as one of Optimal Control and is solved using mathematical programming methods. Novel techniques are employed to solve the resulting non-linear programming problem which allow to achieve effective optimisation with satisfactory accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency. Particularly, the proposed solution strategy is generally applicable to any arbitrarily complex vehicle mathematical model. Car and circuit models are set up, and the optimisation program is applied to investigate {{the sensitivity of the}} vehicle performance with respect to vehicle design parameters, such as the <b>yaw</b> moment of <b>inertia,</b> the total mass and the weight distribution. Furthermore, the minimum time manoeuvring problem is solved for very different vehicle configurations. The optimisation program accurately quantifies the vehicle performance in terms of manoeuvre time, {{and the nature of the}} optimal solution is shown to be always in excellent agreement with the dynamic properties of the vehicle model. A part of the work is devoted to the development of a strategy to obtain an initial estimate of the racing line and of the vehicle lateral and longitudinal controls to be used at the start of the optimisation. Two algorithms to compute the racing line using on board measured data from the real car are presented. A new mathematical model for the vehicle steering control is derived. The model uses multiple preview information of the intended path. Its structure derives from linear optimal preview control theory, but it is adapted to deal with non-linear vehicle operations arising from the inevitable tyre force saturation in vigorous manoeuvring. The excellent path following capability of the model is demonstrated by solving various path following tasks involving moderate manoeuvring and racing speeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to {{evaluate}} the flying qualities of a half-scale radio controlled airplane based on the Unmanned Airplane for Ecological Conservation via flight simulation. The stability coefficients of the half-scale airplane were obtained by vortex lattice method using the code Tornado. The radio controlled aircraft simulator CRRCSim was used to perform the virtual flights. Aerodynamic, geometry, thrust and mass characteristics of the airplane were introduced to the simulator by a code written in C++. Virtual test flights were carried out and the flying qualities were obtained. It could be concluded that the half-scale airplane has excellent flying qualities, rating the aircraft in level 1. The simulator is recommended as a training tool for test pilots of the real model.
