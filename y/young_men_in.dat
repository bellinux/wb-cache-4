5|$|When Johnson {{returned}} to Franklin from New Market he was reunited with James, and they founded a private classical school where he taught {{during the winter}} of 1865–66. The Johnsons' school offered an opportunity for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> Franklin whose studies were interrupted by the war to complete their education.|$|E
5|$|As {{the factory}} bell rings, the {{cigarette}} girls emerge and exchange banter with <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the crowd ("La cloche a sonné"). Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the untameable nature of love ("L'amour est un oiseau rebelle"). The men plead {{with her to}} choose a lover, and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José, who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman who}} {{achieved}} the greatest {{prominence in the}} ancient world for her learning was Hypatia of Alexandria, who educated <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> mathematics, philosophy, and astronomy, and advised the Roman prefect of Egypt on politics. Her influence put her into conflict with the bishop of Alexandria, Cyril, who may have been implicated in her violent death in 415 {{at the hands of a}} Christian mob.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{in early}} 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood {{with the group}} of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, {{risk-taking}} men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, Victor Fleming, Jack Conway, Harold Rosson, Richard Rosson, Arthur Rosson and Eddie Sutherland. During this time, Hawks first met Irving Thalberg, the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. (Eventually many of the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.) Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer aviators at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like Moye Stephens.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy was {{promoted}} {{as a junior}} officer of the Royal Hungarian Army and served {{on the faculty of}} the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, Commandant Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the Hungarian Scout Association at the time. Bánáthy became committed to training the <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development {{and a member of the}} National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.|$|E
5|$|Costly {{signalling}} can {{be applied}} to situations involving physical strain and risk of physical injury or death. Research on physical risk taking is important because information regarding why people, especially young men, take part in high risk activities can help in the development of prevention programs. Reckless driving is a lethal problem among <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> western societies. A male who takes a physical risk is sending the message that he has enough strength and skill to survive extremely dangerous activities. This signal is directed at peers and potential mates.|$|E

5|$|In addition, the {{outbreak}} {{coincided with the}} deaths and media focus on the First World War. Another explanation involves the age group affected by the disease. The majority of fatalities, from both {{the war and the}} epidemic, were among young adults. The deaths caused by the flu may have been overlooked due to the large numbers of deaths of <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the war or as a result of injuries. When people read the obituaries, they saw the war or postwar deaths and the deaths from the influenza side by side. Particularly in Europe, where the war's toll was extremely high, the flu may not have had a great, separate, psychological impact, or may have seemed a mere extension of the war's tragedies.|$|E
5|$|Pro-{{feminism}} is {{the support}} of feminism without implying that the supporter {{is a member of}} the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, men's studies, and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Asian {{cultural}} {{influence is}} also evident in Malagasy cuisine, in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one {{of a variety of}} flavorful vegetable or meat dishes. African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland. Cattle rustling, originally a rite of passage for <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the plains areas of Madagascar where the largest herds of cattle are kept, has become a dangerous and sometimes deadly criminal enterprise as herdsmen in the southwest attempt to defend their cattle with traditional spears against increasingly armed professional rustlers.|$|E

5|$|Xerxes's {{estimated}} time {{of arrival}} at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia. For the Spartans, warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious. Despite the uncomfortable timing, the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard (the Hippeis) of 300 men. The customary elite <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children. Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities, and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae. The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass, rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass, and waited for Xerxes's arrival.|$|E
5|$|Rupert {{arrived in}} England {{following}} his period of imprisonment and final release from captivity in Germany. In August 1642, Rupert, {{along with his}} brother Prince Maurice {{and a number of}} professional soldiers, ran the gauntlet across the sea from the United Provinces, and after one initial failure, evaded the pro-Parliamentary navy and landed in Newcastle. Riding across country, he found the King with a tiny army at Leicester Abbey, and was promptly appointed General of Horse, a coveted appointment at the time in European warfare. Rupert set about recruiting and training: with great effort he had put together a partially trained mounted force of 3,000 cavalry by the end of September. Rupert's reputation continued to rise and, leading a sudden, courageous charge, he routed a Parliamentarian force at Powick Bridge, the first military engagement of the war. Although a small engagement, this had a propaganda value far exceeding the importance of the battle itself, and Rupert became an heroic figure for many <b>young</b> <b>men</b> <b>in</b> the Royalist camp.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of the}} 17th century, a {{university}} education for settlers of Virginia required a journey to England or Scotland.

However, Jacob refuses and stays with the woman.|$|R
