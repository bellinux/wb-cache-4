"Steve Burdick" [...] {{scored a}} Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to {{approximately}} 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television {{sets in use}} during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it.

No matter how in control you think are about sexuality in a relationship there is always the power struggle... always a certain amount of compromise. Of being beholden, if you love them. You do it because <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> to. No one put the chain around this neck but me. I wrote 'Express Yourself' to tell women around the world that pick and choose the best for yourself, before that chain around your neck, kills you instead. It's my take on how man can express what they want, the same prerogative should be there for a woman too." ...|$|E

The White House stated that this was merely a brainstorming exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible. In her 2003 autobiography Living History, Clinton titled an entire chapter [...] "Conversations with Eleanor", and stated that holding [...] "imaginary conversations [...] actually a useful mental exercise to help analyze problems, provided <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> the right person to visualize. Eleanor Roosevelt was ideal." ...|$|E

It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> to persevere."- Barack Obama ...|$|E
