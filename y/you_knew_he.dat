500|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2010–11 NHL season, Reimer again was {{assigned}} to the AHL's Marlies. [...] Reimer was not expected to contribute to the Maple Leafs at the NHL level during the 2010–11 season. Expectations for the young netminder were low heading into the season, with head coach Ron Wilson saying [...] "We wanted him to play in the minors and continue to get better, develop and try to stay healthy." [...] He was recalled by the Maple Leafs several months into the season, making his NHL debut on December 20, 2010 in relief of Jonas Gustavsson against the Atlanta Thrashers. [...] He played 14 minutes in the third period, stopping all four shots he faced. [...] Reimer made his first NHL start against the Ottawa Senators on January 1, 2011. [...] The Maple Leafs won the game 5–1, with Reimer recording 32 saves while picking up his first career NHL win. [...] On February 3, 2011, Reimer recorded 27 saves and picked up his first career NHL shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes. [...] A combination of injuries and poor play by Gustavsson and Jean-Sebastien Giguere provided an opportunity for Reimer at the NHL level. [...] His strong play caused the Leafs to carry three goalies on their NHL roster, a fact which did not surprise Giguere, who said [...] "The way he played the last time he was up, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was going to get another chance." [...] Leafs head coach Ron Wilson acknowledged Reimer as the team's starting goalie as they set out on a late-season run for a playoff spot, saying [...] "It’s going to be his ball the rest of the way. [...] As long as we stay in the race. And I think he’s up to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Red Wings were {{prepared}} to send Yzerman back to Peterborough for one more year, but [...] "after one (training camp) season, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a tremendous hockey player," [...] said Ken Holland, the current Red Wings general manager who was then a minor league goaltender for the Wings during Yzerman's rookie training camp. Yzerman tallied 39 goals and 87 points in his rookie season and finished second in Calder Memorial Trophy (rookie of the year) voting. That season, Yzerman also became the first 18-year-old to play in an NHL All-Star Game (18 years, 267 days) since the current format was adopted in 1969. This stood as an NHL record for 27 years until Jeff Skinner broke it by eight days.|$|E
2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, and the next thing <b>you</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>he</b> would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you {{have to learn how to}} kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Goldwater {{was painted}} as a {{dangerous}} figure by the Johnson campaign, which countered Goldwater's slogan [...] "In your heart, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> right" [...] with the lines [...] "In your guts, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he's</b> nuts", and [...] "In your heart, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>he</b> might" [...] (that is, he might actually use nuclear weapons as opposed to using only deterrence). Johnson himself did not mention Goldwater in his own acceptance speech at the 1964 Democratic National Convention.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Didn't you know? Oh yes!--I thought <b>you</b> <b>knew.</b> <b>He</b> and {{his brother}} were playing {{together}} with a gun. He told his brother to look down the gun, and it was loaded, and blew {{the top of his}} head off. Isn't it a horrible story?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] he resumed. [...] "I met Miss Brown at {{the alameda}} and {{understand}} you know Wolf is gone. I {{did not know}} until I arrived, but begin to see light. It's possible his going did not surprise you. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a rogue!" ...|$|E

[...] "When Kit wanted to go back you lent him the Cayman. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was rash, but this did not count.

6000|$|Also <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} {{understand}} that I could play billiards, and regarded every stroke I made as a fluke. For a beginner I didn't play so badly, I thought.

You had been in London--you were in Brussels--anywhere; when you arrived it was all over; you have seen his headstone. Dr. Vimpany had him in his care; <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was ill, but you thought it was a trifling matter which time would cure; you go to the lawyers and present the will. They have the policies, and will do {{everything}} else; you will not even have to sign anything. The only thing that you must do is to get a complete rig-out of widow's weeds. Mind--there will not be the slightest doubt or question raised. Considering everything, you will be more than justified in seeing no one and going nowhere." ...|$|E
60|$|So it is {{with these}} poor European peoples. They pass me in the street. They do not guess that I am {{ready and willing to}} take them under my care, to teach them common sense with a smattering of intelligence--to be, as one might say, a father to them. They look at me. There is nothing about me to tell them that I know what is good for them better than they do themselves. In the fairy tales the wise man wore a conical hat and a long robe with twiddly things all round the edge. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> was a clever man.
