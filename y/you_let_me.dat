500|$|According to Neil McCormick of The Sydney Morning Herald, {{he writes}} that the lyrics [...] "I don't {{want to be a}} soldier", is a way that Martin can conjure John Lennon into the song's melody.

500|$|In {{the album}} closer, [...] "Street Choir", Morrison repeats the questions, [...] "Why did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> down / And now {{that things are}} better off / Why do you come around". Because of these lyrics Heylin wrote that [...] "such songs [...] were spawned by an {{increasing}} awareness of just how badly ripped off he had been". Ken Brooks {{has said that the}} lyric [...] "Move On Up" [...] is another reference on the album to a Curtis Mayfield song. The track prominently features Keith Johnson's trumpet and Morrison's harmonica.

But you're asking me– with Chinese blood– to do the only unsympathetic role in the picture featuring an all-American cast portraying Chinese characters." [...] The role Wong hoped for went to Luise Rainer, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her performance. Wong's sister, Mary Liu Heung Wong, appeared in the film {{in the role of}} the Little Bride.

500|$|Crystal Bell of Billboard {{gave the}} song a {{generally}} positive review stating [...] "much {{as he did}} on his debut single, [...] "One Time," [...] Bieber {{makes a strong case}} for why he's the next pop heartthrob. 'I'm gonna put you first, I'll show you what you're worth/If <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> inside your world,' he sings. The stump speech is hard to resist, especially when set to an arrangement that follows the lineage of hit midtempo ballads [...] "With You", and [...] "Irreplaceable". Although the lyrics are generic, Bieber's smooth delivery is right on point, and his tender vocals blend well with the song's easy-flowing beat." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song along with [...] "Down to Earth", [...] "uncomplicatedly beautiful and earnest." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic listed the song as one of his recommended tracks from the album.|$|E

500|$|Describing [...] "Lay You Down" [...] {{as one of}} {{the more}} sensual songs on Versus, Mark Nero of About.com wrote [...] "the best of which might be the piano-laced 'Lay You Down,' on which Usher sings: 'This ain't bump 'n grind, I'll show you what love is if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> lay you down. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe commended Usher's use of falsetto, whilst writing that the song [...] "is an urgent boudoir jam that draws a neat line"– she also commented on how it takes {{inspiration}} from both Prince and Marvin Gaye. Los Angeles Timess Jeff Weiss also pointed out the influence from pop musician Prince, and how Usher is [...] "unctuously cooing about wanting to be the: one who keeps your body warm."

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can do for <b>you.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hold you down. This is what I want to do for you as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies.

[...] On the chorus, Norwood sings [...] "You know how I get when <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go", {{and later in the}} song she makes reference to Twitter and her mother. The song interpolates [...] "Tonight" [...] by Swedish pop singer Lykke Li. Deluxe edition bonus track [...] "Can You Hear Me Now?”, producer Danja's sole contribution on Two Eleven, works up an extended musical foreplay around a single mind-numbing groove. Built around an instrumental that was originally produced for Diddy – Dirty Money's 2010 album Last Train to Paris, it was re-constructed by Love for Norwood. Danja used heavy vocoding during production of the song.|$|E

But he didn't, and Moss won his first Formula One race on home soil. Moss later asked Fangio [...] "did <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> through?"
