He recounted: [...] My last game in New York was my greatest day in hockey...Everything you enjoy about the sport of hockey as a kid, driving to practice with mom Phyllis and dad Walter, driving to the game with mom and dad, looking in the stands and seeing <b>your</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>dad</b> and your friends, that all came together in that last game in New York.|$|E
5000|$|The third chapter, {{illustrated}} by Ben Oliver, The Just features {{a world of}} legacy characters and children of superheroes from Earth-16, such as Connor Hawke and the Super-Sons. [...] "This is those guys but they're not the main heroes. There's a whole younger generation of heroes—kind of media brats almost." [...] Morrison describes them as [...] "children of superheroes—a son of Superman, a son of Batman, et cetera—who exist {{in a world where}} they have incredible abilities, but the previous generation had ushered in a utopia, so they don't really have any notion of where to direct it, and they're very unhappy with the world as is." [...] Morrison cites MTV's The Hills as his inspiration for The Just. Morrison described the idea as: [...] "What happens when <b>your</b> <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>dad</b> fix everything? Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman have kind of fixed everything so the kids have nothing to do," [...] instead resorting to battle reenactments, [...] "these kids, they dress up but they've never fought anything." [...] Morrison had originally conceptualized a [...] "Super-Sons" [...] story as part of his All-Star Superman series, where Superman and Batman had stopped all crime, noting that [...] "one day, I might get to them or some version of it. There's {{a little bit of that}} in the [...] "Multiversity" [...] series that I'm doing". Morrison originally designated this universe as Earth-11. The one-shot was published in October 2014. Dame Merciless is the Gentry member who is assigned to this world, working confusion and disorientation into the lives of Kyle Rayner/Green Lantern, Alexis Luthor and Offspring, appearing in an artwork by Kon-El/Superboy.|$|E

You can’t raise the kid this way!’ Then I felt, why in the office, I was hearing all kinds of complaints and unhappiness, and I had to listen these again while I was at home.

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{inspired}} by Fieger's as-yet-unrequited passion for Sharona Alperin, who also inspired other Knack songs such as [...] "My Sharona," [...] and Averre has called it a [...] "teasing, playful look" [...] at her.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank all of my friends and family for not realizing, or at least being {{endlessly}} kind enough not to point out, that I am completely and utterly out of my mind. Firstly, to the only people in this entire world who have {{had to put up with}} all of the disassembled electronics, watches, bicycles, appliances, and occational personal belongings, the small and large disasters, fires, broken windows, and not least of all the destruction of <b>your</b> will; <b>mom</b> <b>and</b> <b>dad</b> I love you with all of my heart. You have provided me with the best thing any one could ask for, you gave me the ability to understand the important things in life, even if I lose track of them from time to time. I could have never become the man I am today without your wisdom and love. Secondly, to the woman who made me into the man I am today. Kortney, my love, there are no words that are worthy of praising the accomplishments you have provided me. Ask anyone who has known me, and all of them will tell that what you have done with my life is nothing short of a miracle. You are the reason I live from day to day. I cannot tell you how much I love you so I will leave it at just that; Kortney I love you...|$|R

Thank you for allowing me to present at a dozen conferences, for encouraging me to pursue somewhat-related tangents, for flying me {{across the country to}} “see who will wander by”, for letting me do the fun stuff while you handled the unpleasant things, and for always knowing when not to tell me the answer. Thank you also to the graduate students, past and present, in the Drake research group; Carolyn Kuranz, Eric Harding, Tony Visco, Korbie Killebrew Dannenberg, and Kelly Korreck for many useful discussions, brainstorming sessions, homework arguments, and your enduring friendship, fellowship, and support.
