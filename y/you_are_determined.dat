500|$|Schulz {{was one of}} {{the larger}} {{football}} players of his time and was known as a fierce hitter. [...] Schulz liked to tell a story about an incident during Michigan's 1904 game against Oberlin College. [...] He recalled: [...] "We were playing Oberlin in 1904. [...] Their regular center was hurt and a little 155-pound fellow came in. [...] I hit him as hard as I could. [...] Imagine my surprise when he looked up and said, 'please sir, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to be fierce, let me know and I'll get out of the way.' [...] I was no good the rest of the afternoon. [...] Every time I looked at the little fellow, I had to break out laughing".|$|E
500|$|Although Marshall was not {{frequently}} {{active in}} {{debate on the}} Senate floor, he was a strong advocate of nearly every Federalist measure considered in that body. Many of these were unpopular in Kentucky, including the Alien and Sedition Acts. Marshall's {{vote in favor of}} the Jay Treaty was particularly unpopular with his constituents, and when he returned home after the vote, a mob of angry citizens in Frankfort stoned him. Next, the mob tried to throw Marshall into the Kentucky River. Marshall appealed to the Baptists in the crowd, declaring, [...] "Now allow me to say that according to Baptist rules, it is irregular to administer baptism before the receiver gives his experience. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to proceed, let the exercise be performed in decent order. Let me give my experience first." [...] The thought of hearing a religious testimony from Marshall, a noted atheist, so humored the mob that it disbanded in a fit of laughter, and Marshall escaped. In the subsequent senatorial election, however, Breckinridge defeated Marshall for his seat.|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't {{understand}} you. What things? Why should <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>determined</b> {{to disagree}} with my mother? Surely you ought at any rate to endeavour to think as she thinks." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{this world}} {{it is very}} {{important}} where you come from, and that is because people are prejudiced and afraid of strangers. Different places produce different kinds of people, and who <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>is</b> <b>determined</b> by where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> from.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{thinking}} of it, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to persevere. You are impetuous, not thoughtless, with your brain clouded with drink, {{and for the}} mere excitement of the thing, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to risk all in a contest {{for which there is}} no chance for you,--and by which you acknowledge you will be driven to self-destruction, as the only natural end." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD. There is no {{pleasing}} you, Mr Mangan. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> to {{be neither}} rich nor poor, honest nor dishonest.|$|E

6000|$|... "Aha! So {{they saw}} what I felt. You cant say I {{did not make}} my {{intentions}} plain enough to every unbiassed person. The Countess <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to get Constance off her hands; Constance <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to have me; and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> to stick up for your own notions of love and honeysuckles." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Se√±or," [...] he said, [...] "since I {{understand}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> to see me, it is {{an honor}} to welcome you, and my house and self are at your command. I imagine, however, that neither of us often wastes much time on compliments." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed!' replied Mrs. Goodman. 'Well, I {{thought this}} might be the end of it: <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>determined</b> on the point; and I am not much {{surprised}} at your news.

6000|$|... "I thought--I thought," [...] she whispered. [...] "O, now I see how wicked I seem to you! Believe me--believe me, on my soul, I {{never thought}} {{but that you}} could! I hoped you would not; yet I believed, without a doubt, that you could cast me off if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>determined,</b> and didn't love me at--at--all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, when Mrs. Tallboys had {{a padlock}} and key? I see <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>determined</b> {{to laugh at}} it all. Most likely they {{consulted}} you beforehand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> still <b>determined</b> on {{directing}} {{operations in}} person? I was commencing {{to wonder if}} you had any reason for modifying your plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Tess, [...] "I'll {{not move}} since <b>you</b> <b>be</b> so <b>determined!</b> But I--thought <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> kind to me, and protect me, as my kinsman!" ...|$|R
