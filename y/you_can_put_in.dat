6000|$|... 'So I did, and now I'm redividing it. I'd {{rather have}} a company. It's pleasanter. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a couple of {{thousand}} pounds or so between you, you can travel about and see the country, and your money'll be working for you all the time. Did you ever see a gold mine?' ...|$|E

In {{some parts of}} Greenland you can get moss that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> soup, but it doesn't amount to a very hearty meal. In a cold climate like that, one needs to eat plenty of meat, and the more fat, the better. The Esquimaux live on the fattest kind of meat they can get, and on blubber, and they think tallow candles a real delicacy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And all this, if you please, for Mr. Pinkerton's dollars!" [...] {{the captain}} {{suddenly}} exclaimed. [...] "There's many a fine fellow gone under, Mr. Dodd, because of drivers like your friend. What do they {{care for a}} ship or two? Insured, I guess. What do they care for sailors' lives alongside of a few thousand dollars? What they want is speed between ports, and a damned fool of a captain that'll drive a ship under as I'm doing this one. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the morning, asking why I do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy enough," [...] {{asserted}} Mershone. [...] "You may {{pretend to}} keep this job, but go home and take life easy. I'll send you a daily statement of what I've been doing, and you can fix up a report to your superior from that. In addition to this <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a few hours each day {{trying to find out}} who is annoying me in this rascally manner, and for this service I'll pay you five times the agency price. How does that proposition strike you, Mr.--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You sit down," [...] {{the scout}} said. [...] "A nice sort of fire {{we should get}} with sticks of your picking up! Why, {{we should have a}} smoke that would bring all the Injuns in the woods on to us. No, the sticks as the Seneca and me'll pick up won't give as much smoke as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a teacup; but I wouldn't risk even that if we was nigh the lake, for it might be seen by any redskins out in a canoe. But we are miles back from the lake, and there aint no other open space where they could get a view over the tree-tops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{the other}} hurriedly disclaimed. [...] "Just {{congratulations}} on your birthday. Of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> me <b>in</b> the snow. What chance have I against a man that lifts nine hundred pounds?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> things <b>in</b> order, {{and wash}} {{up the new}} china. The old set needs washing also, for my last girl was apt to leave it in a sad state after a party." ...|$|R

60|$|And {{then the}} {{knowledge}} {{they have that}} they must subsist on charity, and so often reluctant charity, it would renew their lives {{if they could have}} something to do with their hands and pass their time and at the same time earn their bread, and know the sweetness of the bread which is the result of the labor of one's own hands. They need that cheer and pleasure. It is the only way you can turn their night into day, to give them happy hearts, the only thing <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the place of the blessed sun. That you can do in the way I speak of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pepper-box!" [...] {{repeated}} the captain, in disgust; [...] "why, it's a plate-glass outlook, where I can sweep the horizon with my glass all round, an' smoke my pipe {{in peace and}} comfort, and sometimes have you up, my girl, to have a chat about old times. But that's not all, Molly. Here's a letter which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> your pocket an' read at your leisure. It says that the tin mine in which you have shares has become so prosperous that you could sell at ten or twenty times the price of your original shares; so,--you see, you are independent of me altogether as to your livelihood. Now, old girl, what d'ye think of all that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR SIR:--Yours of the 15th is just received. I wrote you {{the same}} day. As to the pecuniary matter, I am willing to pay {{according}} to my ability; but I am the poorest hand living to get others to pay. I have been on expenses so long without earning anything that I am absolutely without money now for even household purposes. Still, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> {{two hundred and fifty}} dollars for me toward discharging the debt of the committee, I will allow it when you and I settle the private matter between us. This, with what I have already paid, and with an outstanding note of mine, will exceed my subscription of five hundred dollars. This, too, is exclusive of my ordinary expenses during the campaign, all of which, being added to my loss of time and business, bears pretty heavily upon one no better off in [this] world's goods than I; but as I had the post of honor, it is not for me to be over nice. You are feeling badly,--"And this too shall pass away," [...] never fear.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] he answered. [...] "Look here, Ida, I {{will give}} you those {{mortgage}} bonds as a wedding present, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them <b>in</b> the fire; and I will make a good settlement on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are good}} enough {{as far as}} they go. Two flannel shirts, one on and one off, is enough for any man. Two or three pairs of thick stockings. Them as is very {{particular}} can carry an extra pair of breeches in case of getting caught in a storm, though for myself I think it is just as well to let your things dry on you. You want a pair of high boots, a buffalo robe, and a couple of blankets, one with a hole cut in the middle to put your head through; that does as a cloak, and is like what the Mexicans call a poncho. You don't want a coat or waistcoat; there ain't no good in them. All you want to carry <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> your saddle-bag. Get a pair of the best blankets you can find. I will go with you and choose them for you. You want a thing that will keep you warm when you sleep, and shoot off the rain in bad weather. Common blankets are no better than a sponge.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Willy; [...] "but it's this! What are {{you going}} to do in that big house, with all the bedrooms, parlor, library, and so forth? You say that you are going to have one room, and that I'm to have another, and that we'll go into the old house to feel at home {{whenever}} we want to; but I believe we'll be like a couple of flies in a barrel! You're going to furnish your new house with everything but people! You ought to have more people! You ought to have a family! That house will look funny without people! You can't ask Mr. Burke, because it would be too queer to have him come and live with us, and besides, he'll want a house of his own. Why don't you ask the Thorpedykes to come and live with us? Their roof is dreadfully out of repairs. I know to my certain knowledge that they have to put tin wash-basins on every bed in the second story when it rains, on account of the holes in the shingles! If they had money to mend those holes, they'd mend them, but as they don't mend them, of course they haven't the money. And it strikes me that they aren't as well off as they used to be, and they'll have a hard time gettin' through this winter. Now, there isn't any piece of furniture that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> your house that will give it 'such an air of distinction,' as Miss Eleanor calls it, as she herself will give it if you put her there! If you could persuade Miss Eleanor to come and sit in your parlor when you are having company to see you, it would set you up in Plainton a good deal higher than any money can set you up." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{they walked}} to the shooting-point, Jerry showed the lad how to hold the rifle, {{instructed}} him as to the backsight, and showed him how to get the foresight exactly on the nick of the backsight. [...] "You must just see the bead as if it were resting in the nick, and the object you aim at must just show above the top point of the bead." [...] He showed him how to load, and then told him to lie down, as he had done, on his chest, and to steady the rifle with the left arm, the elbow being on the ground. [...] "You must be quite comfortable," [...] he said; [...] "it is of no use trying to shoot {{if you are in a}} cramped position. Now, take a steady aim, and the moment you have got the two sights in a line on the rock, press the trigger steadily. Press pretty hard; it is only a pull of about two pounds, but it is wonderful how stiff a trigger feels the first time you pull at it. You need not be at all afraid of the kick. If you press the butt tightly against your shoulder you will hardly feel it, for there is plenty of weight in the barr'l, and it carries but a small charge of powder. You won't want to shoot at anything much beyond this range, but sometimes you may have to try at four or five hundred yards when you are in want of a dinner. In that case <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a charge and a half of powder. Now, are you comfortable? You need not grip so hard with your left hand, the gun only wants to rest between your thumb and fingers. That is better. Now take a steady aim, and the moment you have got it press the trigger. Well done! that is a good shot for a first. You hit the dust an inch or two to the right of the stone. If it had been a red-skin you would have hit him in the shoulder. You will do, lad, and by the time we get to Fort Bridger I guess you will bring down a stag as clean as nine out of ten hunters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have lost}} my way," [...] said the stranger. [...] "Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> me <b>in</b> the path again." [...] He wiped his {{forehead}} with the air of one suffering under an agitation more than that of simple fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. I am {{indeed a}} stranger, and {{happen to have}} neither friend nor {{acquaintance}} in the town, so if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> me <b>in</b> the way of finding a respectable lodging--a--a cheap one, you will greatly oblige me." ...|$|R
6000|$|L. Yes, that's {{the first}} way. You cannot string {{ultimate}} atoms; but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> them <b>in</b> a row, {{and then they}} fasten themselves together, somehow, into a long rod or needle. We will call these 'Needle-crystals.' What {{would be the next}} way? ...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{completion}} of the 2017 draft, ESPN reporter Adam Schefter said about Allen's NFL prospects, [...] "There was one personnel director who told me this week that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> the books, Josh Allen will be the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft next year." ...|$|E

During his talk at Echappée Voléé 2016 in Paris, Sjöblad disclosed that he has also implanted himself between his forefinger and thumb and uses it to unlock doors, make payments, and unlock his phone (essentially replacing anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> your pockets).
