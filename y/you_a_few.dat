500|$|In a floridly worded proclamation, {{published}} on 10 November and addressed “To The Men of New York”, Smyth wrote that, “in {{a few days}} the troops under my command will plant the American standard in Canada” and he urged New Yorkers not to “stand with your arms folded and look on in this interesting struggle” but to “advance…to our aid. I will wait for <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days.” [...] Smyth’s statement of intent appears to have attracted no attention from his opponents across the border.|$|E
500|$|Hartman first {{performed}} his Clinton {{impression on}} {{an episode of}} The Tonight Show. When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked, [...] "I guess I owe <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> apologies", adding later that he [...] "sometimes [...] a twinge of guilt about [...] ". Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're not the president, but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E
2500|$|On one {{occasion}} Humph {{announced that they}} had a very distinguished actor as a guest who would join in the game of Mornington Crescent. When the game started, after great ceremony, the penultimate player, the last of the panellists, won on his first move, thus denying the distinguished guest the opportunity to make a single move. The chairman apologised but explained that this was an unavoidable possibility and the guest left without having uttered a word. The show was allegedly inundated with complaints at the treatment of Sir Alec Guinness as on the actual recording Lyttelton can be heard to say, [...] "Well I'm very sorry about that. Rather unfortunate. We would like to go on and ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things about what you're doing currently, Sir Alec, but we do have to hurry on to the next game." [...] This story became a favourite of Lyttelton's, who claimed in interviews that the [...] "distinguished actor" [...] had never actually been named on the show.|$|E

2500|$|Lucca {{decided on}} the Teatro Grande (now the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi) in Trieste as the {{location}} for the Spring 1848 premiere, but political events in Lombardy postponed it until the autumn. The opera house management felt that Muzio would be capable to handling the staging, but having fled to Switzerland, he became unavailable and the task was handled by Luigi Ricci who, along with his brother Federico, were minor composers of the day. [...] Verdi {{did not attend the}} first performance. However, Verdi's biographer Mary Jane Phillips-Matz feels that Lucca chose a good house and a cast [...] "almost as good as anyone could have mustered in Europe at the time." [...] In addition, she quotes from a long letter which Verdi wrote to the soprano Marianna Barbieri-Nini, who had been his Lady Macbeth at the 1847 premiere of that opera. In the letter, Verdi said that he wanted [...] "to tell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> things about your pieces", and gives her some very explicit advice on how to sing Gulnara.|$|E
