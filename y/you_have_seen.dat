25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; that when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; that you have also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, but that you must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others may think as they please, but this is your way of thinking, {{and has been for}} many years...|$|E

It was the eye of a wild beast, [...] the baleful glitter <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the eyes of snakes, panthers, catamounts, or other creatures of the reptile or feline kind." ...|$|E

6000|$|... ‘We shall miss you, Jasper, at the “Alternate Musical Wednesdays” to-night; but {{no doubt}} you are best at home. Good-night. God bless you! “Tell me, shep-herds, te-e-ell me; tell me-e-e, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> (<b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>seen)</b> my-y-y Flo-o-ora-a pass this way!”’ Melodiously good Minor Canon the Reverend Septimus Crisparkle thus {{delivers}} himself, in musical rhythm, as he withdraws his amiable face from the doorway and conveys it down-stairs.|$|R

500|$|Friedrich's written {{commentary}} on aesthetics {{was limited to}} a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained {{the need for the}} artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to [...] "close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." [...] He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its [...] "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803–84) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768–1839).|$|E
500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director did a good job with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, like <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E

500|$|In addition, the {{suspension}} of the Indian Hockey Federation in April 2008 also indicated the film's influence. India Today used the title to label the event in two articles, titled [...] "Operation Chak De impact: Jothikumaran resigns" [...] and [...] "Operation Chak de impact: Furore in Lok Sabha". The Indiatimes, in an article titled, [...] "Five wise men set for a Chak De act" [...] also argued, [...] "It looks like Indian hockey has done a real Chak de this time around". In addition, former hockey player Aslam Sher Khan, who was appointed by the Indian Olympic Association to head a committee which will replace the IHF, pointed to the film as a model to work towards. He stated in an interview, [...] "We {{have to make a}} Team India as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in Bollywood blockbuster Chak De! India. There are players from several parts of the country. We have to unite them to make a powerful force." [...] In another interview, he emphasised that he wants [...] "to create a Chak De effect" [...] on hockey in India.|$|E
500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational difference among American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the past though we have had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought." [...] Dragon's team principal Jay Penske revealed the drivers were allowed to battle each other cleanly but if one of them eliminated the other from contention, that driver would be required to miss the following race.|$|E
60|$|I saw {{the pony}} {{harnessed}} myself. In the infernal network of mysteries and uncertainties that now surrounded us, I declare {{it was a}} relief to observe how well the buckles and straps understood each other! When <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the pony backed into the shafts of the chaise, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> something there was no doubt about. And that, let me tell you, was becoming a treat of the rarest kind in our household.|$|R

2500|$|Again, {{the details}} of exactly what {{happened}} in the duel are debated and still unclear. In the version found in the Kaijo monogatari, Gonnosuke and Musashi meets in Akashi instead of Edo, and the former is also brandishing a long four shaku staff instead of a wooden sword. It states that Gonnosuke had previously encountered Musashi's father, Shinmen Munisai, who was an expert of the jitte and had defeated him. Gonnosuke, in a condescending tone of voice, asked Musashi if he was as skilled as his father and if he used similar techniques. Musashi supposedly said: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> my father's technique <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> mine", after which Gonnosuke attacked Musashi and was defeated.|$|E
2500|$|If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> {{my article}} in the Fortnightly, I would feel obliged by your noticing it in your letter this week. The cynical Saturday Review noticed it fairly enough, but I have seen no notice of it in any Irish paper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vin Scully's call of {{the final}} play in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series on NBC {{television}} would quickly become an iconic one to baseball fans, with the normally calm Scully growing increasingly excited: [...] "So the winning run is at second base, with two outs, three and two to Mookie Wilson. [...] little roller up along first... behind the bag! It gets through Buckner! Here comes Knight, and the Mets win it!" [...] Scully then remained silent {{for more than three}} minutes, letting the pictures and the crowd noise tell the story. Scully resumed with [...] "If one picture is worth a thousand words, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> about a million words, but more than that, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> an absolutely bizarre finish to Game6 of the 1986 World Series. The Mets are not only alive, they are well; and they will play the Red Sox in Game7 tomorrow!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Le Guin {{resigned}} from the Authors Guild in protest over its endorsement of Google's book digitization project. [...] "You decided {{to deal with the}} devil", she wrote in her resignation letter.

2500|$|The {{narrative}} in Acts 1 takes place 40 {{days after the}} Resurrection: Jesus, {{in the company of}} the disciples, is taken up in their sight after warning them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the Holy Spirit; as he ascends a cloud hides him from their view, and two men in white appear to tell them that he will return [...] "in the same way <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> him go into heaven." ...|$|E
2500|$|That evening Jesus {{appeared}} among them, {{despite having}} locked the doors, {{and gives them}} power over sin and forgiveness of sin. A week later he appears to doubting Thomas, who has not believed, but when Thomas is instructed to touch the wounds of Jesus he says, [...] "My Lord and my God!" [...] Jesus replies: [...] "Because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> me, you have believed; blessed {{are those who have}} not seen and yet have believed".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Oberman became {{engaged to}} music {{producer}} Rob Cowan. The couple were honeymooning in Thailand when the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami struck. In {{an interview with}} The People, Oberman described the experience as [...] "one of those crystallized moments in my life. It's made me focus on the people I love. It also showed me the incredible generosity people are capable of. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> something like that, you also stop taking the trivia so seriously".|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{writing in}} the {{afterword}} of Doctor Sleep, King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it [...] "...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember — for reasons I have never quite understood — {{as one of the}} scariest films they have ever seen. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family." ...|$|E
2500|$|Welch {{excluded}} {{himself from}} {{the remainder of the}} hearings with a parting shot to McCarthy: [...] "Mr. McCarthy, I will not discuss this further with you... <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> fit to bring [...] out, {{and if there is a}} God in heaven, it will do neither you nor your cause any good!
