Eder concluded that on Elvis Is Back!, Presley [...] "comes off better than on any of his other albums since arriving at RCA". Will Hermes of Rolling Stone praised its [...] "wildly varied material, revelatory singing, impeccable stereo sound". [...] Writing for Rough Guides in 2004, Paul Simpson commented: [...] "Among the 1800 or so records in Elvis's collection at Graceland is a copy of Elvis Is Back!, almost white {{from the number of}} times it was played. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> this would be his favourite album." [...] Simpson admired Presley's blues singing on [...] "Like a Baby" [...] and [...] "Reconsider Baby", and added, [...] "it's hard to believe that this commitment and exhilaration was to be heard only fitfully for most of the 1960s, often on songs buried on B-sides or as bonuses on dodgy soundtrack albums." ...|$|E

On Schröder's initiative to join forces with President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir Putin of Russia in opposing the war, Schäuble commented: [...] "This triangular relationship involving Berlin, Paris and Moscow was a dangerous development. It was very dangerous for the small countries in Europe because they perceived it as an axis and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why.</b> We want good relations with Russia but we do not want those relations to be misunderstood." [...] Schäuble, in contrast to many German politicians, subsequently defended the United States' decision to invade Iraq. By 2006, he said he thought the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in itself correct, but that he was [...] "doubtful" [...] from the outset about the Iraq war because it resulted from a unilateral decision by the US.|$|E

I {{have come}} to the {{conclusion}} that I should have a form letter made up to send to the Bryant Service Club every month to thank the members of the Club for the cigarettes that I receive at almost regular intervals. It is an honor that I am sure I do not deserve, but one that I very greatly appreciate. 2. We in the Services certainly are appreciative of anything you kind people back home do for us and I can truthfully say that to be the recipient of a gift such as those the Bryant Service Club so willingly sends out makes a fellow feel that this old world isn’t so bad after all, in spite of all the cataclysmic uprisings taking place all over its face. Your fine gifts have the happy faculty of raising the morale of those who are fortunate enough to receive them. 3. May I take it upon myself to thank the BSC in behalf of all the men who received gifts from the Club, but who were unable to acknowledge them. At times it is very difficult to take even a minute to write a note or a card. Here in my own organization, we labor for seven days a week and eighteen hours a day. As a matter of fact, this letter is being written at 2 : 30 in the morning. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> readily <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> your gifts were very often not acknowledged. 4. You are accomplishing something that no writer can completely describe. I trust that you will continue to get the wholehearted support of the student body of Bryant College which you have had in the past. 5. THANKS A MILLION! Nicholas C.

Peter Vlautin {{addressed}} the jurors in confidential tones, contrasting with O'Mara's shouting:"We are here today to determine one thing: What {{is the value of}} Dorothea Puente's life? That is the question. Does she have to be killed?" [...] Vlautin spoke gently about Puente's childhood touching on the traumatic aspects that shaped her life and urged the jurors to see the world through her eyes. [...] "You have heard of the despair which was the foundation of her life, the anger and resentment...If anyone in the jury room tells you it was not that bad, ask them would you want that to happen to yourself? Would you want that to happen to your children? ... I am led to believe if there is any reason for us to be living here on this earth, it is to somehow enhance one another's humanity, to love, to touch each other with kindness, to know that you have made just one person breathe easier because you have lived. I submit to you ladies and gentlemen that is why these people came to testify for Dorothea Puente ... I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> only truly <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> so many people testified and asked you to spare Dorothea's life only if you have ever fallen down and stumbled on the road of life and had someone pick you up, give you comfort, give you love, show you the way. Then you will <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> these people believe Dorothea's life is worth saving. That is mitigating. That is a human quality that deserves to be preserved. It is a flame of humanity that has burned inside Dorothea since she was young ... That is reason to give Dorothea Puente life without the possibility of parole." ...|$|R

On the way to the Pic, Archie had told me that what first attracted him to her was {{the fact that she was}} so utterly unlike Mabel Doughnut; but that had not prepared me for what she really was. She was kind of intense, if you know what I mean--kind of spiritual. She was perfectly pleasant, and drew me out about golf and all that sort of thing; but all the time I felt that she considered me an earthy worm whose loftier soul-essence had been carelessly left out of his composition at birth. She made me wish that I had never seen a musical comedy or danced on a supper table on New Year's Eve.

60|$|Kingsbury, my brothers, {{is in the}} old State of Alabama. For {{three hundred}} years the Vanderwaters have owned Kingsbury and its slave pens and {{factories}}, and slave pens and factories in many other places and States. You {{have heard of the}} Vanderwaters--who has not?--but let me tell you things you do not know about them. The first Vanderwater was a slave, even as you and I. Have you got that? He was a slave, and that was over three hundred years ago. His father was a machinist in the slave pen of Alexander Burrell, and his mother was a washerwoman in the same slave pen. There is no doubt about this. I am telling you truth. It is history. It is printed, every word of it, in the history books of our masters, which you cannot read because your masters will not permit you to learn to read. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> they will not permit you to learn to read, when there are such things in the books. They know, and they are very wise. If you did read such things, you might be wanting in respect to your masters, which would be a dangerous thing... to your masters. But I know, for I can read, and I am telling you what I have read with my own eyes in the history books of our masters.|$|E
60|$|In an {{unexpected}} manner, again, these reefs afford {{us not only}} an indication of change of place, but they afford an indication of lapse of time. The reef is a timekeeper of a very curious character; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>understand</b> <b>why.</b> The coral polype, like everything else, takes a certain time to grow to its full size; it does not {{do it in a}} minute; just as a child takes a certain time to grow into a man so does the embryo polype take time to grow into a perfect polype and form its skeleton. Consequently every particle of coral limestone is an expression of time. It must have taken a certain time to separate the lime from the sea water. It is not possible to arrive at an accurate computation of the time it must have taken to form these coral islands, because we lack the necessary data; but we can form a rough calculation, which leads to very curious and striking results. The computations of the rate at which corals grow are so exceedingly variable, that we must allow the widest possible margin for error; and it is better in this case to make the allowance upon the side of excess. I think that anybody who knows anything about the matter will tell you that I am making a computation far in excess of what is probable, if I say that an inch of coral limestone may be added to one of these reefs {{in the course of a}} year. I think most naturalists would be inclined to laugh at me for making such an assumption, and would put the growth at certainly not more than half that amount. But supposing it is so, what a very curious notion of the antiquity of some of these great living pyramids comes out by a very simple calculation. There is no doubt whatever that the sea faces of some of them are fully a thousand feet high, and if you take the reckoning of an inch a year, that will give you 12,000 years for the age of that particular pyramid or cone of coral limestone; 12,000 long years have these creatures been labouring in conditions which must have been substantially the same as they are now, otherwise the polypes could not have continued their work. But I believe I very much understate both the height of some of these masses, and overstate the amount which these animals can form in the course of a year; so that you might very safely double the period as the time during which the Pacific Ocean, the general state of the climate, and the sea, and the temperature has been substantially what it is now; and yet that state of things which now obtains in the Pacific Ocean is the yesterday of the history of the life of the globe. Those pyramids of coral rock are built upon a foundation which is itself formed by the deposits which the geologist has to deal with. If we go back in time and search through the series of the rocks, we find at every age of the world's history which has yet been examined, accumulations of limestone, many of which have certainly been built up in just the same way as those coral reefs which are now forming the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. And even if we turn to the oldest periods of geologic history, although the nature of the materials is changed, although we cannot apply to them the same reasonings that we can to the existing corals, yet still there are vast masses of limestone formed of nothing else than the accumulations of the skeletons of similar animals, and testifying that even in those remote periods of the world's history, as now, the order of things implies that the earth had already endured for a period of which our ordinary standards of chronology give us not the slightest conception. In other words, the history of these coral reefs, traced out honestly and carefully, and with the same sort of reasoning that you would use in the ordinary affairs of life, testifies, like every fact that I know of, to the prodigious antiquity of the earth since it existed in a condition in the main similar to that in which it now is.|$|R
