This was less of an issue for The Phantom Menace, in which set height was generally achieved by digital means. [...] "Our visual choices get channeled and violent," [...] Heinrichs elaborated, [...] "so <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up with liabilities that you tend to exploit as virtues. When you've got a certain ceiling height, and you're dealing with painted backings, you need to push atmosphere and diffusion." [...] This was particularly the case in several exteriors that were built on sound stages. [...] "We would mitigate the disadvantages by hiding lights with teasers and smoke." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up, Mars explained that the song [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn" [...] is dedicated to his father who is from Brooklyn, adding that: [...] "everyone can agree that New York is a special place". Lyrically, a girl {{is the subject of}} Mars' attention. After they met briefly, he tries to find her again somewhere in Brooklyn. Ari Levine talked in {{an interview}} with Sound on Sound about producing some of Mars' songs. [...] "The Other Side", whose production was re-arranged, was intended for somebody else, and several people wrote parts of the track. Concerning the lyrics' concept Mars said that they describe: [...] "the lifestyle <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up living as an artist".|$|E

500|$|In her {{testimony}} and replies to {{questions from the}} commissioners, Dworkin denounced the use of criminal obscenity prosecutions against pornographers, stating, [...] "We are against obscenity laws. We do not want them. I {{want you to understand}} why, whether <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up agreeing or not." [...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction. Their basic presumption is that it's women's bodies that are dirty." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the case}} also aroused {{controversy}} about the court itself. [...] David Marr described the four to three decision as indicating a new {{division in the}} composition of the court, the [...] "liberty divide", and noted that the result on the liberty question moved the court in the opposite direction to the contemporary trends of the Supreme Court of the United States and the House of Lords. Arthur Glass observed that the minority judges began their judgments from the position that indefinite non-judicial detention and the curtailment of personal freedom were troubling consequences, and noted that [...] "as is not uncommon in statutory construction, where you start from is critical to where <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up." [...] Marr accused the majority of deciding that [...] "saving Australia from boat people counts for more than Al-Kateb's raw liberty." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The List" [...] a B+, describing it as [...] "standard but well executed". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, had {{mixed feelings about}} it, ultimately rating it a B-. He felt that [...] "The List" [...] embodied a bland stand-alone X-Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script, with [...] "attempts at drama" [...] that had no depth, and [...] "sideplots [...] have so {{little effect on the}} main narrative as to be basically padding". Handlen however praised the cinematography and art direction, the performances of both Ken Foree and J.T. Walsh, and the final scene, but ultimately considered that [...] "once you get past the set-design and cinematography, <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up with some good lines and a few scary moments, and that's it." ...|$|E

500|$|In late 2003 Farrell starred as a {{criminal}} who plots a bank robbery with Cillian Murphy in the dark comedy Intermission, which held the record for highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box-office history {{for three years and}} remains a cult classic there. In 2004, he appeared in several other independent films receiving limited theatrical release in most countries, including A Home at the End of the World (adapted from Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World). Roger Ebert praised Farrell, saying that he was [...] "astonishing in the movie, not least because the character is such a departure from everything he has done before". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle differed, saying that the actor [...] "is keen on making good....The effort is there, but it's a performance <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up rooting for rather than enjoying, because there's no way to just relax and watch".|$|E

When reading the comic for the part, Morgan stopped when he saw his character was killed off three pages in. When telling his agent {{he did not want}} the part, he was told to continue reading it and find out how important his character was. Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't hate this guy even though he does things that are unmentionable. [...] My job is to kind of make that translate, so as a viewer <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up not making excuses to like him, but you don't hate him like you should for doing the things that he does." [...] Of his casting, Snyder said, [...] "It's hard to find a man's man in Hollywood. It just is. And Jeffrey came in and was grumpy and cool and grizzled, and I was, like, 'OK, Jeffrey is perfect!'" ...|$|E

[...] Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, [...] he was having trouble remembering the trip. [...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming of The Old Man and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book. [...] He wrote to his editor, [...] "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book."

500|$|Mass Effect 2 {{contains}} {{voices from}} 90 voice actors who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording {{for the game}} took {{twice as long as}} the original Mass Effect. The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, [...] "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters." [...] Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first Mass Effect game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.|$|E
500|$|A {{new design}} for the website was {{launched}} on April 25, 2007, with the comment, [...] "Fark site redesign is now live. Hope nothing breaks, we're all out drinking." [...] The new design was initially received with some controversy by many users, mostly due to the change in layout and a seemingly indifferent attitude by site moderators to user impact or feedback. In response, Drew Curtis noted the following reasons for the redesign: [...] "Websites have to evolve over time. Otherwise <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up with a layout anachronism like the Drudge Report. The old design was put into place years ago, over time changes were nailed on to the design like loose shingles on a leaky roof. It was time to reformat and remove a bunch of the clutter while {{trying to keep the}} core design intact." [...] The site layout was refined {{over the next few weeks}} in accordance with many suggestions.|$|E
500|$|FLCL has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it [...] "downright hilarious" [...] and [...] "visually superb" [...] with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD {{as the only}} weakness of Synch-Point's original release. Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "FLCL {{may not have a}} straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. It is fun to watch!" [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life." [...] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, [...] "It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation." ...|$|E

She starts off manipulative and not the nicest person you've ever met, but she's not a bad guy when you first meet her." [...] Fazekas additionally noted how the sexist themes of the times were handled, by showing [...] "that the only way Whitney Frost felt she could exert power in the world was through her husband, because she had been told her whole life, 'Nobody cares how smart you are, they care about how pretty you are.'" [...] On Frost's relationship with Chadwick, Everett called him [...] "her best friend.

500|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} March 2011, with Connie Britton {{first to be}} cast, portraying female lead Vivien Harmon. Britton stated that she took a risk in taking the role of Vivien. When Murphy presented the role to her, he said, [...] "This is something we've never seen you do before. It will be turning what you've just been doing on its ear." [...] She was intrigued by what he had presented her and ultimately {{decided to take the}} part. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die in the first season. [...] "We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning," [...] he said. [...] "In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [...] and Jessica , as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series." ...|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E

500|$|Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell {{in autumn}} of 1990 to begin {{working on the}} next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up making the Christmas album".|$|E
500|$|During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans {{from the}} low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone {{to that of a}} [...] "child whisperer" [...] due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it [...] "a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an {{identity}} crisis". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including [...] "When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing [...] "Shine!" [...] and Williams screaming [...] "Hey!". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, [...] "So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up in good hands in the fancy British nation" [...] and [...] "that bear with the red hat", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include [...] "Pharrell's 'Happy"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge" [...] that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents [...] "without sounding overly patronizing". [...] "Shine" [...] ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.|$|E
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff <b>you</b> <b>end</b> up doing in animation. I had no idea that he was referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
