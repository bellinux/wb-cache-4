And then we'd work all day. We're very much the odd couple.|$|E

Next to it, there is a Latin inscription that reads domus dei aedificata est supra firmam petram (<b>your</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> built on firm rock) which echoes with the inscription {{on the base of}} the dome.|$|E

500|$|Wilson was {{notable for}} making anagrams {{based on the}} names {{of his friends and}} acquaintances. [...] M'Clure {{described}} them as numerous and nimble, and if not exact, they were always instructive, and he would rather force a poor match than lose the moral.
