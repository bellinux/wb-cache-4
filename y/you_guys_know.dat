You know, finding {{my way back to}} being happy despite having my heart broken. Despite everything going wrong in love, finding my way back to loving myself and just keeping it, what's the word? Non-spiteful, not mean, being an adult about it and loving yourself above everything else because that's number one, so that's what [...] "Back to Love" [...] is about." ...|$|E

In his blog, Steinman also {{described}} the show as [...] "DOTV, which <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>know</b> I hated & was disgusted by, & was FIRED by my manager, acting as producer!"

5000|$|King {{asked the}} group {{if they had}} {{recorded}} live-in-the-studio before, to which they replied they hadn't.

[...] I don't know why we haven't said anything. I guess it's because there is always that [...] "maybe if something happens, etc..etc..." [...] Or maybe it's hard for us to realize the reality of our situation, the bands situation, to finally let go. I'll be honest when I say the following: Periphery and Never Say Die were our last tours together as a band." ...|$|E

50|$|The racing {{community}} is a large family, as <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>know.</b> Everyone's saddened with this tragedy. I {{want to thank all}} my friends and family for their support through this tough, emotional time. And the support from the NASCAR community, my partners, all of our employees has been overwhelming. I've taken the last couple weeks off out of respect for Kevin and his family and also to cope with the accident in my own way. It's given me the time to think about life and {{how easy it is to}} take it for granted. I miss my team, my teammates, and the other drivers very much and I miss being back in the race car. I think that being back in the car this week with my racing family will help me get through this difficult time.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2013 {{legislative}} session, Edwards {{sponsored a}} bill that would allow judges to avoid mandatory minimums and exercise discretion with regard to prescription drug addicts; under the law, prescription drug addicts were treated the same way {{in the criminal justice system}} as were the traffickers. She argued, [...] "What my bill does is recognize that we need some discretion at the judicial level during sentencing. We need some criteria and factors in place to make sure that the person who hooked on oxycotin with 7 pills does not go to jail for three years. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>know</b> that person belongs either in drug court or in treatment. They don't belong in a prison." [...] Following a failed attempt to pass legislation that would have legalized medical marijuana in 2013, Edwards authored legislation during the 2014 legislative session with Republican State Representative Matt Gaetz that would allow [...] "people suffering from cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease and other illnesses" [...] to be receive [...] "cannabis-derived therapies rich in cannabidiol," [...] which would otherwise be illegal.

5000|$|The Panthers (5-2, 2-1 ACC) {{held the}} Cavaliers without a {{completion}} in a scoreless third quarter, outgaining them 80-15, and limited them to 108 {{yards and a}} 36-yard field goal by Sam Hayward with 2:04 remaining. It was Hayward's first career 3-pointer. Virginia (2-4, 1-1 ACC) had its two-game winning streak end. Nathan Peterman threw two touchdown passes for Panthers, the last on a shovel pass to George Aston making it 42-28 with 9:47 left. The Panthers have scored at least 36 points in six consecutive games, a program record, so offense isn't a problem. Their run defense is statistically solid, but might be artificially so because its pass defense is spotty. Kurt Benkert thrived in the first half, when Pitt had no sacks, but the Cavaliers quarterback seemed rattled after the Panthers sacked him three times in four plays early after halftime. Whitehead isn't Pittsburgh's only two-way player anymore. The safety, who also carried the ball three times for 28 yards, was joined in that versatility by Conner, who took a few snaps at defensive end. [...] "We've been kind of working that in and as <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>know,</b> he was recruited as a defensive lineman," [...] Narduzzi said. [...] "... James is a super football player. I was happy he got a hurry on the quarterback and we'll {{have a little bit}} more of that." [...] The Panthers have a bye next weekend, and will then play Virginia Tech at Heinz Field on Thursday night.|$|E
5000|$|On Friends, Joey was a womanizer, but {{we enjoyed}} his exploits. He {{was a solid}} friend, a <b>guy</b> <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> you could count on.

5000|$|In July, 1981, WEAN-AM {{radio in}} Providence, Rhode Island {{reached out to}} Wilson and hired him to report sports in {{afternoon}} drive and to start a nightly sports talk show (the market was without one). 'I told WEAN that if they wanted a show {{with a lot of}} flash and sizzle, they didn't want me,' said Wilson. 'I told them I wanted to do a guest-oriented program that would treat the callers with respect.' [...] “Chuck Wilson on Sports” broke twenty wire stories in its first three years and was first to correctly report the postponement of the Hearns-Hagler fight. “At the time I went on the air (to break the news that the fight in Detroit would be postponed), the promoter (Bob Arum) was in Detroit saying that the fight was still on. That night, Goody and Pat Petronelli (Hagler’s handlers) called me and said ‘Chuck, please stay in touch with us tonight. <b>You</b> <b>guys</b> <b>know</b> what’s going on more than we do.’ “If you hustle, {{you get a lot of}} breaks like that, said Wilson.” [...] The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson has slowly and surely developed a first-class show in Providence. And it’s not just that he routinely has quality guests on, that he’s given local callers a chance to talk with the likes of John Wooden, Al McGuire, Red Barber, Ted Williams, Marvelous Marvin Hagler…or that “Chuck Wilson on Sports” has broken some big stories in this market…or that it’s a program involved in the business of sports reporting, not merely in conversing with callers....It’s that the show has established its niche without having to resort to gimmicks. No laugh tracks. No screaming. No making fun of callers” [...] The Boston Globe wrote: “Wilson was a pioneer in having quality guests from other media: The (Boston) Globe’s Bob Ryan, football guru Mel Kiper Jr., ESPN’s Peter Gammons, and local Providence writers were regulars”. [...] The Providence Journal wrote “Wilson’s logical, even-handed approach and sharp interviewing technique have served him well…Last fall (1984), it claimed more adult male listeners during its time period than any other program in the market.” ...|$|E

In 1989, the Saints again had a winning record (9-7) but finished 3rd in the NFC West and missed the playoffs.
