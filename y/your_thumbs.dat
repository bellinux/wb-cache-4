2500|$|The {{hand drill}} {{is a similar}} tool, but uses a longer, thinner spindle; and instead of a bearing block and bow combination, the {{downward}} pressure and spinning is achieved by rubbing the hands together around the spindle. As the hands move downward to the base, where the drill is pinched and the hands are brought quickly to the top one at a time. This can be made unnecessary by cutting a nock {{at the top of}} the drill, tying a cord through this, and then putting <b>your</b> <b>thumbs</b> through loops in the cord. However, skilled operators can either maintain pressure with their hands almost stationary vertically; or, in a movement comparable to floating, can [...] "float" [...] their hands back to the top of the drill. There is a more limited choice of materials to use with this method, needing much softer materials, such as mullein, yucca, cattail, and root wood.|$|E

25|$|Thumb Guard: A {{hard plastic}} guard that forms around <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> to prevent <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> from being broken from a pitch from the pitcher. The thumb guard {{is located on}} the inside of the glove (if worn) and is usually very helpful in protection.|$|R

50|$|The north orbital pole of a {{celestial}} body {{is defined by}} the right-hand rule: If you curve the fingers of your right hand along the direction of orbital motion, with <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> extended parallel to the orbital axis, the direction <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> points is defined to be north.|$|R

5000|$|Old Norwegian cast-on: Also {{known as}} the [...] "German Twisted cast-on" [...] and similar to the [...] "long-tail cast on" [...] but uses a longer tail due to a second twist in the thumb loop. Leaving a tail the {{necessary}} length, make a slipknot {{and place it on}} a needle held in your right hand. The slipknot counts as the first stitch. Place the thumb and index finger of your left hand between the yarn ends so that the strand connected to the ball is around your index finger and the tail end is around <b>your</b> <b>thumb.</b> Secure the yarn ends with your other fingers and hold your palm upwards, making a V of yarn. Bring the needle in front of <b>your</b> <b>thumb,</b> under both yarns around the thumb, down {{into the center of the}} thumb loop, back forward, and over the top of the yarn around your index finger. Use the needle to catch this yarn, then bring the needle back down through the <b>thumb</b> loop, turning <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> slightly to make room for the needle to pass through. Drop the loop off <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> and place <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> back in the V configuration while tightening up the resulting stitch on the needle.

50|$|When {{sending a}} bowl {{you have two}} ways to send it, on or against the bias. When sending a bowl with <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> on the biased side it is known as thumb peg and when sending a bowl with <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> on the non-biased side it is known as finger peg. Sending your bowls {{different}} pegs will determine which direction your bowl will go.|$|R

50|$|A jet flow is a {{fluid flow}} {{in which a}} stream of one fluid mixes with a {{surrounding}} medium. An example is a water jet that forms when you put <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> over {{the end of a}} hose. The water mixes with air to form a jet. If you increase the flow of water or move <b>your</b> <b>thumb</b> to change the diameter of the exit, the jet will change dramatically.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are about}} right there, sir. I aint afraid of Malays, {{but it gives}} me the creeps down my back when I think {{of one of them}} chaps getting hold of me by the leg. Bob Pearson told me that the only chance you have is to send your knife, or if you can't get at that, <b>your</b> <b>thumbs,</b> into the creature's eyes. But it would require a mighty cool hand to find the eyes, with the brute's teeth in one's leg, and the water so thick with mud that you could not see an inch beyond your nose." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{pleasant}} to see Mr. Plomacy as, {{leaning on his}} stout stick, he went about among the rural guests, acting {{as a sort of}} head constable as well as master of the revels.

Come, girls, what do you stand there for, twirling of <b>your</b> <b>thumbs?</b> Come out, and let the lads see you; you've no need to be so ashamed of your faces. Hollo there, who are you?

6000|$|If {{you marry}} me you will be much happier with me than with your brother. But you must first go into the sitting-room and look in the cupboard. There you will find three bottles. In one of them there is a healing {{ointment}} which you must put on my chin to heal the wound; then if I drink {{the contents of the}} second bottle it will make me well, and the third bottle will make me stronger than I ever was before. Then, when your brother comes back from the wood with his beasts you must go to him and say, [...] "Brother, you are very strong. If I were to fasten <b>your</b> <b>thumbs</b> behind your back with a stout silk cord, could you wrench yourself free?" [...] And when you see that he cannot do it, call me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{official}} eye is more eloquent {{than the}} official lips and asks almost urgently, [...] "What in this immeasurable universe have {{you managed to}} do to <b>your</b> <b>thumbs?</b> And why?" [...] But he is only a very inferior sort of official indeed, a mere clerk of the post, and {{he has all the}} guarded reserve of your thoroughly unoriginal man. [...] "You are not the two persons I ascertained you were," [...] he says, with the note of one resigned to communion with unreason; [...] "because you"--he indicates me--"are evidently at your residence in London." [...] I smile. [...] "That gentleman"--he points a pen at the botanist {{in a manner that is}} intended to dismiss my smile once for all--"will be in London next week. He will be returning next Friday from a special mission to investigate the fungoid parasites that have been attacking the cinchona trees in Ceylon." ...|$|E
6000|$|Platt was white-faced and dark, and {{disposed}} to undertones and mystery and a curiosity about {{society and the}} demi-monde. He kept himself au courant by reading a penny paper of infinite suggestion called Modern Society. Parsons was of an ampler build, already promising fatness, with curly hair {{and a lot of}} rolling, rollicking, curly features, and a large blob-shaped nose. He had a great memory and a real interest in literature. He knew great portions of Shakespeare and Milton by heart, and would recite them at the slightest provocation. He read everything he could get hold of, and if he liked it he read it aloud. It did not matter who else liked it. At first Mr. Polly was {{disposed to}} be suspicious of this literature, but was carried away by Parsons' enthusiasm. The Three Ps went to a performance of [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] at the Port Burdock Theatre Royal, and hung over the gallery fascinated. After that they made a sort of password of: [...] "Do you bite <b>your</b> <b>thumbs</b> at Us, Sir?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} half a dozen lions," [...] Mr Harvey said; [...] "although {{certainly}} one lion is an easier foe to tackle than an alligator. But one can never be too careful about bathing in this country. In the smallest pools, {{only a few yards}} long and a few feet wide, an alligator may be lurking, especially if the weather is dry and the pools far apart. Even when only drawing water at such places it is well to be careful, and it is always the best plan to poke the bottom for a short distance round with a pole before dipping in a bucket. Remember, if you should ever happen to be seized by one of these animals, there is but one chance, and that is to turn at once and stick <b>your</b> <b>thumbs</b> into his eyes. It requires nerve when a brute has got you by the leg, but it is your only chance, and the natives, when seized by alligators, often escape by blinding their foes. The pain and sudden loss of sight always induces them to loose their hold." ...|$|E
6000|$|How to quarrel {{well and}} often {{has ever been}} {{something}} of an art, and it becomes more of an art with the general decline of spirit. For {{it takes two to}} make a quarrel. Time was when you turned to the handiest human being, and with small care or labour had the comfortable warmth you needed in a minute or so. There was theology, even in the fifties it was ample cause with two out of three you met. Now people will express a lamentable indifference. Then politics again, but a little while ago fat for the fire of any male gathering, is now a topic of mere tepidity. So you are forced to be more subtle, more patient in your quarrelling. You play like a little boy playing cricket with his sisters, with those who do not understand. A fellow-votary is a rare treat. As a rule you have to lure and humour your antagonist like a child. The wooing is as intricate and delicate as any wooing can well be. To quarrel now, indeed, requires an infinity of patience. The good old days of thumb-biting--"Do you bite <b>your</b> <b>thumbs</b> at us, sir?" [...] and so to clash and stab--are gone for ever.|$|E
