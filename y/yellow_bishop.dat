50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>bishop,</b> Cape bishop, Cape widow or yellow-rumped widow (Euplectes capensis) is a {{resident}} breeding bird species in Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.|$|E
50|$|The male in {{breeding}} plumage resembles the <b>yellow</b> <b>bishop,</b> but the latter species is larger and lacks the yellow crown. Non-breeding {{males and females}} can be confused {{with those of the}} southern red bishop, but have white rather than the buff-coloured underparts of the latter.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>bishop</b> is {{a stocky}} 15 cm long bird. The {{breeding}} male is black {{apart from his}} bright yellow lower back, rump, and shoulder patches, and brown edging to the wing feathers. He has a short crest, thick conical black bill, and a relatively short tail. His bill size varies dramatically between races.|$|E
50|$|Red-collared widowbirds feed on {{seeds of}} sorghum and other grass seeds. They also feed on nectar, small berries, and insects, {{specifically}} ants, caterpillars, and termites. They often form large roosts, with between 50 and 100 individuals, which feed {{together on the}} ground. These roosts included breeding males. They are often formed with association with other species, like red-billed quelea, fan-tailed widowbird, southern red bishop, white-winged widowbird, and <b>yellow</b> <b>bishop.</b>|$|E
40|$|Red-collared Widows) have moult {{durations}} of two months, {{while the}} widows with shorter tails (White-winged and Fan-tailed Widows) had moult durations of 1. 5 – 1. 7 months. Moult ends in late May or early June. Long-tailed Widows have rounder wings than other weaver species, possibly because their larger size affects flight aerodynamics. In the winter rainfall region, Southern Red Bishops and Yellow Bishops E. capensis start breeding after the winter rains, from August–November, and moult starts in early December. Primary moult duration in Yellow Bishops is relatively long, at 3. 4 months. Yellow Bishops grow individual primary feathers {{at an average}} rate of 21. 3 days per feather, while the other species moult primaries more quickly: White-winged Widow 8. 1 days, Fan-tailed Widow 11. 3 days, and Red-collared Widow 14. 4 days. The number of primaries growing simultaneously is similar in the different species. The longer duration of primary moult of the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Bishop</b> {{may be related to}} food...|$|E
