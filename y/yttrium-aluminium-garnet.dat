The FCS also has an automated tracking system, and is capable of engaging moving or stationary targets while moving in day or night. The automatic target tracking system uses a thermal image display which can be controlled by either the tank gunner or commander. It is capable of tracking soldiers, vehicles and helicopters. The targeting computer can also calculate lead on moving targets.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Ninety seven {{patients}} with tracheobronchial tumours {{have been treated}} with the neodymium <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Nd YAG) laser {{over a period of}} 33 months. Fifty one of these patients were treated under local anaesthesia and 46 under general anaesthesia. The results obtained with the two methods have been compared retrospectively. The numbers of patients responding to treatment, the magnitude of the response, and the duration of palliation were similar in the two groups; significantly more treatment sessions, however, were required during each course of treatment under local anaesthesia. This advantage of general anaesthesia was thought to arise from the ability to continue treatment for longer and with greater efficiency. The use of the rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation under general anaesthesia was also thought to provide better control of the airway and to allow more efficient clearance of blood and mucus. Two operative deaths occurred under local anaesthesia, when bleeding led to asphyxiation, but none have occurred under general anaesthesia. Treatment under general anaesthesia is not, however, without risk and is potentially hazardous in {{patients with}} severe chronic hypoxic lung disease. During the last six years the neodymium <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Nd YAG) laser has become established as an important method of palliative treatment in patients with tracheobronchial tumours. " The thermal action of the laser is used to resect and cauterise intraluminal tumour within the proximal tracheobronchial tree and breathlessness and haemoptysis can be relieved in selected patients. Treatment may be given under either local or general anaesthesia. Although each method has gained favour among different groups, no attempt has been made to compare them. We describe our experience with both methods in two hospitals...|$|E
30|$|Hysteroscopic surgery {{became a}} well-recognised {{alternative}} to hysterectomy {{for women with}} therapy-resistant menorrhagia. Initially, coagulation or vaporisation of the endometrium {{was used in the}} first generation hysteroscopic techniques (thermal, electrical or laser). In 1981, the neodymium <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Nd-YAG) laser was adopted by Goldrath and colleagues [1]. Electrosurgical techniques to perform transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) followed in 1983 [2]. In 1989, Vancaille [3] introduced Rollerball coagulation. These techniques, however, carry some potentially serious risks such as excessive fluid overload (cerebral, pulmonary and peripheral oedema), uterine perforation and haemorrhage. In addition, they require a relatively long learning curve. This has led, over the last 12  years, to the development of simpler, safer and effective, second generation ablation techniques: microwave endometrial ablation (MEA) and thermal balloon therapies [4].|$|E
40|$|Laser {{irradiation}} has numerous favorable characteristics, such as ablation or vaporization, hemostasis, biostimulation (photobiomodulation) and microbial inhibition and destruction, which induce various beneficial therapeutic {{effects and}} biological responses. Therefore, {{the use of}} lasers is considered effective and suitable for treating a variety of inflammatory and infectious oral conditions. The CO 2, neodymium-doped <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Nd:YAG) and diode lasers have mainly been used for periodontal soft-tissue management. With development of the erbium-doped <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Er:YAG) and erbium, chromium-doped yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) lasers, which can be applied not only on soft tissues but also on dental hard tissues, the application of lasers dramatically expanded from periodontal soft-tissue management to hard-tissue treatment. Currently, various periodontal tissues (such as gingiva, tooth roots and bone tissue), as well as titanium implant surfaces, can be treated with lasers, {{and a variety of}} dental laser systems are being employed for the management of periodontal and peri-implant diseases. In periodontics, mechanical therapy has conventionally been the mainstream of treatment; however, complete bacterial eradication and/or optimal wound healing may not be necessarily achieved with conventional mechanical therapy alone. Consequently, in addition to chemotherapy consisting of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents, phototherapy using lasers and light-emitting diodes has been gradually integrated with mechanical therapy to enhance subsequent wound healing by achieving thorough debridement, decontamination and tissue stimulation. With increasing evidence of benefits, therapies with low- and high-level lasers {{play an important role in}} wound healing/tissue regeneration in the treatment of periodontal and peri-implant diseases. This article discusses the outcomes of laser therapy in soft-tissue management, periodontal nonsurgical and surgical treatment, osseous surgery and peri-implant treatment, focusing on postoperative wound healing of periodontal and peri-implant tissues, based on scientific evidence from currently available basic and clinical studies, as well as on case reports...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{cutaneous}} applications of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (laser) concerns the treatment of vascular lesions. During the past two decades, very significant advances in the application of laser technology in dermatology have occurred, with selective photothermolysis being the most important. This review focuses on the application of modern laser devices (Pulsed Dye Laser, or PDL; potassium titanyl phosphate laser, or KTP; diode laser; and neodymium-doped <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> laser, or Nd:YAG), as well as the combination of laser and photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of vascular lesions.

40|$|Q-switched pulses from a neodymium/YAG (<b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet)</b> laser {{were passed}} through corneal discs {{taken from the}} enucleated eyes of three baboons and four rabbits. The time course of heat {{dissipation}} following absorption of laser energy by the tissue was studied {{with the use of}} a second continuous wave laser beam acting as a probe. It was found that the absorption of each neodymium/YAG pulse created a transient divergent lens within the cornea as theoretical considerations predicted. The relaxation time that characterised the decay of this thermal lens for a 1 /e laser beam diameter of 2. 0 mm was found to be 2. 3 +/- 0. 1 s (mean +/- standard error for 12 separate groups of measurements). Our results show that Q-switched laser pulses passing through apparently unaffected transparent tissues can induce thermal lens effects which persist for several seconds. The optical transfer of each pulse in a stream will be identical only if enough time is left between pulses for the tissues to return to their initial state. Therefore, when such laser pulses sharply focused to perform high precision intraocular surgery are used, thermal lensing in the transparent ocular media must limit the rate at which pulses can be usefully delivered...|$|E
40|$|Dry sliding wear {{of laser}} {{hardened}} {{low alloy steel}} at room and elevated temperatures P Dinesh Babu 1, G Buvanashekaran 2 and KR Balasubramanian 1 This paper discusses about the wear behaviour of as-received and laser hardened EN 25 low alloy steel performed in dry sliding condition using a pin-on-disc method. A 2 kW continuous wave neodymium <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> laser source is used for transformation hardening to improve the hardness and wear resistance. The laser transformation hardened steel samples are characterized by optical microscope, x-ray diffractometer and microhardness tester. The sliding wear study is conducted for different loads (10 N, 25 N, 40 N), sliding distances (1000 m, 2000 m, 3000 m) at various elevated temperatures (200 C, 400 C and 600 C) with constant sliding speed of 0. 15 m/s. The study at room temperature is also carried out for comparison. The friction and wear characteristics in sliding contact are evaluated and the worn surfaces are analysed through a scanning electron microscope. The experimental work indicates that wear resistance of laser hardened steel is five {{times higher than the}} as-received steel. The results also indicate that the wear resistance increases at 400 C due to the oxide layer formation and decreases at 600 C due to fracture of the oxide layer...|$|E

The two groups (21 patients each) were well matched for factors affecting outcome. Surgery was performed for continued haemorrhage uncontrolled by endoscopic treatment or rebleeding after two endoscopic treatments. Haemostasis after one treatment was similar in the two groups: adrenaline 16 / 21 (76 %), adrenaline + laser 18 / 21 (86 %). Haemostasis after two treatments was numerically (0. 05 less than p less than 0. 10) greater in the adrenaline + laser group: 21 / 21 (100 %) v 18 / 21 (86 %). Three patients (14 %) in the adrenaline group underwent uneventful emergency surgery. There were no deaths or procedure related complications in either group.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Experience {{of the use}} of the Holmium: <b>Yttrium-Aluminium-Garnet</b> (Ho:YAG) laser in {{children}} has been limited. However, the Ho:YAG laser has been in clinical use in urology for several years but has mainly been used for the treatment of renal stones and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Due to its unique combination of vaporization and coagulation, the Ho:YAG laser allows a precise cutting action. The depth of penetration in water and tissue is limited to < 0. 5 mm and therefore provides a safety margin. The Ho:YAG laser can be used {{in children}}, as the energy can be delivered via fibers that range from 200 to 1000 mu in diameter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Ho:YAG laser in 5 children (2 - 15 years) : one child (2 years) with bladder exstrophy had a urethral stricture after bladder neck reconstruction, two children (6 years and 14 years) had ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) stenosis and refused open surgery and two children (5 years and 15 years) suffered from cystine stones (ESWL failed). The urethral stricture was incised in a retrograde fashion. We performed an antegrade incision of the UPJ with the Ho:YAG laser in the 6 -year-old child and a retrograde incision in the 14 -year-old child. We removed the stones in antegrade fashion in the 5 -year-old child and in retrograde fashion in the 15 -year-old child. RESULTS: All children now have more than 12 month's follow-up. There were no immediate or late complications. The boy with urethral stricture remained free of recurrence, the boy with UPJ stenosis obtained improved drainage on the excretory renogram and the two children with cystine stones remained stonefree. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the safety and efficacy of the Ho:YAG laser is also reproducible in urologic pathology in children. In addition, due to its vaporizing quality, the Ho:YAG laser is more effective in the treatment of cystine stones and allows minimaly invasive treatment in children. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Rosacea is {{a common}} chronic skin {{condition}} affecting the face, characterised by flushing, redness, pimples, pustules and dilated blood vessels. The eyes are often involved and thickening of the skin with enlargement (phymas), especially of the nose, can occur in some people. A range of treatment options are available but it is unclear which are most effective. To assess the efficacy and safety of treatments for rosacea. We updated our searches, to July 2014, of: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974) and Science Citation Index (from 1988). We searched five trials registers and checked reference lists for further relevant studies. Randomised controlled trials in people with moderate to severe rosacea. Study selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment and analyses were carried out independently by two authors. We included 106 studies, comprising 13, 631 participants. Sample sizes of 30 - 100 and study duration of {{two to three months}} were most common. More women than men were included, mean age of 48. 6 years, and the majority had papulopustular rosacea, followed by erythematotelangiectatic rosacea. A wide range of comparisons (67) were evaluated. Topical interventions: metronidazole, azelaic acid, ivermectin, brimonidine or other topical treatments. Systemic interventions: oral antibiotics, combinations with topical treatments or other systemic treatments, i. e. isotretinoin. Several studies evaluated laser or light-based treatment. The majority of studies (57 / 106) were assessed as 'unclear risk of bias', 37 'high risk ' and 12 'low risk'. Twenty-two studies provided no usable or retrievable data i. e. none of our outcomes were addressed, no separate data reported for rosacea or limited data in abstracts. Eleven studies assessed our primary outcome 'change in quality of life', 52 studies participant-assessed changes in rosacea severity and almost all studies addressed adverse events, although often only limited data were provided. In most comparisons there were no statistically significant differences in number of adverse events, most were mild and transient. Physician assessments including investigators' global assessments, lesion counts and erythema were evaluated in three-quarters of the studies, but time needed for improvement and duration of remission were incompletely or not reported. The quality of the body of evidence was rated moderate to high for most outcomes, but for some outcomes low to very low. Data for several outcomes could only be pooled for topical metronidazole and azelaic acid. Both were shown to be more effective than placebo in papulopustular rosacea (moderate quality evidence for metronidazole and high for azelaic acid). Pooled data from physician assessments in three trials demonstrated that metronidazole was more effective compared to placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1. 98, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 29 to 3. 02). Four trials provided data on participants' assessments, illustrating that azelaic acid was more effective than placebo (RR 1. 46, 95 % CI 1. 30 to 1. 63). The results from three studies were contradictory on which of these two treatments was most effective. Two studies showed a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in favour of topical ivermectin when compared to placebo (high quality evidence). Participants' assessments in these studies showed a RR of 1. 78 (95 % CI 1. 50 to 2. 11) and RR of 1. 92 (95 % CI 1. 59 to 2. 32),which were supported by physicians' assessments. Topical ivermectin appeared to be slightly more effective than topical metronidazole for papulopustular rosacea, based on one study, for improving quality of life and participant and physician assessed outcomes (high quality evidence for these outcomes). Topical brimonidine in two studies was more effective than vehicle in reducing erythema in rosacea at all time points over 12 hours (high quality evidence). At three hours the participants' assessments had a RR of 2. 21 (95 % CI 1. 52 to 3. 22) and RR of 2. 00 (95 % CI 1. 33 to 3. 01) in favour of brimonidine. Physicians' assessments confirmed these data. There was no rebound or worsening of erythema after treatment cessation. Topical clindamycin phosphate combined with tretinoin was not considered to be effective compared to placebo (moderate quality evidence). Topical ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion demonstrated effectiveness and improved quality of life for people with ocular rosacea (low quality evidence). Of the comparisons assessing oral treatments for papulopustular rosacea there was moderate quality evidence that tetracycline was effective but this was based on two old studies of short duration. Physician-based assessments in two trials indicated that doxycycline appeared to be significantly more effective than placebo (RR 1. 59, 95 % CI 1. 02 to 2. 47 and RR 2. 37, 95 % CI 1. 12 to 4. 99) (high quality evidence). There was no statistically significant difference in effectiveness between 100 mg and 40 mg doxycycline, but there was evidence of fewer adverse effects with the lower dose (RR 0. 25, 95 % CI 0. 11 to 0. 54) (low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence from one study (assessed at high risk of bias) that doxycycline 100 mg was as effective as azithromycin. Low dose minocycline (45 mg) was effective for papulopustular rosacea (low quality evidence). Oral tetracycline was compared with topical metronidazole in four studies and showed no statistically significant difference between the two treatments for any outcome (low to moderate quality evidence). Low dose isotretinoin was considered by both the participants (RR 1. 23, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 43) and physicians (RR 1. 18, 95 % CI 1. 03 to 1. 36) to be slightly more effective than doxycycline 50 - 100 mg (high quality evidence). Pulsed dye laser was more effective than <b>yttrium-aluminium-garnet</b> (Nd:YAG) laser based on one study, and it appeared to be as effective as intense pulsed light therapy (both low quality evidence). There was high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of topical azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, brimonidine, doxycycline and isotretinoin for rosacea. Moderate quality evidence was available for topical metronidazole and oral tetracycline. There was low quality evidence for low dose minocycline, laser and intense pulsed light therapy and ciclosporin ophthalmic emulsion for ocular rosacea. Time needed to response and response duration should be addressed more completely, with more rigorous reporting of adverse events. Further studies on treatment of ocular rosacea are warrante...|$|E
