60|$|Mr Pickering was convinced. His spirits soared. Marriage! What was marriage? Slavery, {{not to be}} endured by {{your man}} of spirit. Look at all the unhappy marriages you saw everywhere.

According to the novelists and playwrights, shrewd fellows who knew what was what, if <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> wife about your {{business}} she said you had no soul; if you didn't, she said you didn't think enough of her to let her share your life.

5000|$|The {{bullying}} continued when King {{transferred to}} E.O. Green Junior High School {{in the seventh}} grade. It intensified when he began attending school wearing women's accessories and clothing, high heels and makeup in January 2008. King's younger brother Rocky also suffered bullying because of Larry's appearance. The school could not legally stop King from dressing as he chose because of a California anti-discrimination law that prevents gender discrimination, although teachers at the school thought that his clothing was clearly in violation of school code, which prevents students from wearing clothing considered distracting. The school issued a formal notice via email to every teacher on January 29, 2008. Written by eighth-grade assistant principal Sue Parsons, it said, in part: We have a student on campus who has chosen to express his sexuality by wearing make-up. It is his right to do so. Some kids are finding it amusing, others are bothered by it. As {{long as it does}} not cause classroom disruptions he is within his rights. We are asking that <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> students about being civil and non-judgmental. They don't have to like it but they need to give him his space. We are also asking you to watch for possible problems. If you wish to talk further about it please see me or Joy Epstein. Several teachers and King's father accused Joy Epstein, one of the school's assistant principals, of encouraging Larry's flamboyance as part of her [...] "political agenda." [...] King also taunted boys in the halls, saying [...] "I know you want me" [...] and was known to make inappropriate comments to boys while they were changing for gym class. Prosecuting attorneys later filed court documents that stated King was not sexually harassing other students in the weeks before the shooting. McInerney and King had been in several verbal altercations described as [...] "acrimonious" [...] by the prosecutor.|$|E

40|$|M. Ed. This study investigates {{how much}} {{knowledge}} do parents {{and families in}} the informal settlements have about sexuality education. It appears {{that there is little}} or even no communication about sexuality education between parents, families and their children in informal settlements. There is also a misconception between sexuality education and family planning. Most parents encourage their children to do family planning with the hope that they will receive guidance on sexuality. Parents and families also shift their responsibilities to schools and clinics, they expect schools and clinics to teach their children sexuality without them being involved. Against the above background the question below was used to try and get different views from a number of parents and families in the Mamelodi informal settlements. Do <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> children about sexuality? A qualitative research method was used during the investigation where parents and families from the Mamelodi informal settlement were interviewed in order to collect data.

40|$|This leaflet is {{for anyone}} {{who would like to}} try {{complementary}} medicines for a mental health problem. It covers: 	Brain function and dementia 	Anxiety and sleep problems 	Depression and bipolar disorder 	Psychotic states 	Movement disorders 	Addictions 	Finding a practitioner 	Useful websites What are complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) ? They are ways of treating illness that have developed outside the mainstream of modern medicine. Many are traditional remedies that have developed in different cultures over the centuries. They include: 	herbal medicines 	foods 	nutritional supplements, such as vitamins and minerals All these treatments can be used on their own, or with conventional medicine. CAMs and mental health problems Many CAMs have been used for mental health problems, but there is little good evidence to support their use. Some of these treatments may work, but most have not been thoroughly tested. The studies have often been too small to give a clear answer. We know most about the treatments for depression, anxiety and insomnia. Despite the lack of evidence, {{people all over the world}} take CAMs, and many report that they find them helpful. Ultimately, whether taking CAMs is a good idea depends on individual circumstances. We recommend that <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> GP or mental health team first. If you are considering taking CAMs, you should seek specialist advice if: 	you are pregnant or breastfeeding 	you want to give CAMs to children 	you are competing in sports to make sure that the CAM you are considering taking is not in breach of doping regulations. How to use CAMs safely? Do 	choose a qualified practitioner who is a member of a recognised society 	ask about their qualification and experience 	ask about side-effects 	if in doubt, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist 	tell the professionals involved in your care, including your CAM practitioner, about all your treatments and medications 	tell them if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant or breast-feed 	tell them about your physical health and allergies 	discuss your concerns about treatment 	seek medical advice if you experience unusual symptoms 	make special time for your treatment sessions 	find a reliable source for your information about therapies Don’t 	stop conventional medicines without telling your doctor 	believe claims for 'wonder cures' 	take high doses of supplements unless confirmed with an experienced health professional 	combine many different remedies 	take complementary medicines without knowing what they are for 	take somebody else’s complementary medicines 	give remedies to children without seeking specialist advice 	take remedies from an unreliable source - this includes the internet 	eat or drink raw plant material, such as flowers, fruits, leaves, seeds or the root unless you are sure it is absolutely safe (many plants are poisonous and need to be processed before they can be used safely) 	prepare your own teas and extracts unless you are sure it is safe 	smoke raw plant material 	pay large sums of money up front 	practice acupuncture or any other physical treatment on yourself unless you have been trained 	blame yourself if a treatment does not work.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to these challenges, {{many of the}} nursing students credited supportive nursing faculty members with assisting them through the process to receive approval for testing accommodations. Students mentioned teachers on several occasions as the impetus or the support structure. Taylor shared, “I had a teacher that I went to and spoke {{with him in his}} office and he kind of told me that I needed to look into it and so I went to my doctor…he wrote a note for the school for the student services, and when I had that, then they set up accommodations for my testing.” She added, “Many of the teachers have this big open-door policy for everyone.” Emerson also noted, “and I went <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> my professor and he was like, ‘are you sure you don’t have anxiety? Have <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> doctor about it?’ And I was like, ‘Yea, I have,’ but, I was just really in denial’ (fanning herself with her hands). And he was like, ‘you really should look into it, I think it would help a lot.’” Students appear to appreciate the support offered by their faculty members and suggest that many students would not make the effort to secure testing accommodations without the encouragement of their teachers.|$|R
