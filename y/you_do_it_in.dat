[...] Meirelles set the film in a contemporary large city, seemingly under a totalitarian government, as opposed to the novel that he believed took place in the 1940s (actually, the book is more likely to take place in the 80s or later, as evident {{by the fact that the}} characters stumble upon a store with modern appliances like microwave ovens and dishwashers, and referral to AIDS as a feared disease). Meirelles chose to make a contemporary film so audiences could relate to the characters. The director also sought a different allegorical approach. He described the novel as [...] "very allegorical, like a fantasy outside of space, outside the world", and he instead took a naturalistic direction in engaging audiences to make the film less [...] "cold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Uber {{announced}} on September 25, 2016, {{that it was}} looking into urban transportation with flying vehicles. At Re/code's Nantucket Conference, the head of Uber's products, Jeff Holden stated that the company wanted to [...] "someday offer our customers as many options as possible to move around ... {{doing it in a}} three-dimensional way is an obvious thing to look at." [...] A statement at the American Helicopter Society International-led joint workshop on Transformative Vertical Flight on September 29, Uber product manager Nikhil Goel stated that [...] "To us, urban air transportation is simply a key initiative or our mission, right? Not only because it can cut congestion – it's got massive potential to do that – but it allows us to move people from Point A to B much, much faster than you would otherwise. If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> all-electric vehicles, you can do it with zero emissions." [...] Uber published a 99-page [...] "white paper" [...] exploring the possibility of developing a [...] "fully electric, vertical-takeoff-and-landing plane" [...] network (called [...] "Elevate") within ten years, for use in short journeys. Although technically feasible, the development of such a program is expected to encounter safety and regulatory obstacles.|$|E

6000|$|... "When the {{opportunity}} offers," [...] he resumed, [...] "I shall {{go up to}} my room. I shall ring the dining room bell first. You will go up before me when you hear that--and you will show me how <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the empty house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pity on a murderess, a thief!" [...] he cried. [...] "Not I! I have {{suffered}} enough for my folly. I will go {{and tell the}} truth to-morrow. It was you who killed him. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the cab and stole back to his rooms to rob--afterwards. Horrible! Horrible!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not angry}} {{with you for}} blaming my purpose, Dennis," [...] {{answered}} the Norman, [...] "for I know <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> love to me and mine. But, Dennis Morolt, this thing must be--we must fight the Welshmen within these three hours, or the name of Raymond Berenger must be blotted from the genealogy of his house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so, perhaps so," [...] said my grandmother, [...] "but {{you must}} {{remember}} this: it may be all very well to be faithful, but you should be careful how <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> some respects Mother Anastasia is entirely right, and your faithfulness, if injudiciously shown, may make miserable the life of this young woman." [...] I sighed but said nothing. My grandmother looked pityingly upon me.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Clym! please don't go {{setting down}} as my fault {{what is your}} obstinate wrong-headedness. If you wished to connect {{yourself}} with an unworthy person {{why did you come}} home here to do it? Why didn't <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Paris?--it is more the fashion there. You have come only to distress me, a lonely woman, and shorten my days! I wish that you would bestow your presence where you bestow your love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> great shape!" [...] Carrots insisted. [...] "Even if {{we never}} get another cent of our dollar back I'll be satisfied, 'cause that bully Skip's done {{for in this}} town now. He can't scare any more fellers, an' I reckon all Teenie Massey said about that Brooklyn fight was true." ...|$|R
6000|$|Romayne thought--not unkindly--of his wife. Stella {{had once}} {{asked him how}} long a time he was usually {{occupied}} in writing one page. The reply had filled her with pity and wonder. [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take all that trouble?" [...] she had gently remonstrated.

6000|$|... "And that--I see--happens to {{be another}} of the {{questions}} you can't ask her. You {{have to do it}} all," [...] said Bob Assingham, [...] "as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn up--though who's to come down on you if you break them I don't quite see. Or must <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> three guesses--like forfeits on Christmas eve?" [...] To which, as his ribaldry but dropped from her, he further added: [...] "How much of anything will have to be left for you {{to be able to go}} on with it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The trader laughed. [...] "There were," [...] he said. [...] "Well, I'm {{willing to}} admit that I have once or twice pitched a nigger who was a trifle impudent over the veranda rails. It's {{one of the things}} you have to do, and if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> one way they don't seem to mind. No doubt they {{understand}} it's only natural the climate and the fever should make you a trifle hasty. Still, I don't think a Kroo was ever done out of his earnings, or had things thrown at him when he didn't deserve it, in my factory." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harold {{fell back}} feebly and wearily upon the pillows. [...] "Ernest, Ernest," [...] he cried, gasping, [...] "you might forgive me! {{you ought to}} forgive me! you must forgive me! and I'll tell you why. I didn't want to say it, but now you force me. I know {{it as well as}} if I'd seen <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> my place, I know to a certainty, Ernest, you'd have done exactly as I did. Ernest Carnegie, you can't look me {{straight}} in the face and tell me that you wouldn't have acted exactly as I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Of course!” said Nettie. “Well, {{my father}} once peddled oranges on the trains; {{and they make}} quite a fuss over {{people who are on}} the stage in London, while I don’t think many of them could have done that last piece of yours half as cunningly. Anyway, I haven’t laughed as much since I’ve been <b>in</b> England. If <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> New York you’d coin money.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Director Jennifer Peedom {{said about}} making the film that [...] "There's a very fine line between making it and not making it, and he didn’t make it. And it's only then that people turn around and say, [...] "Well, you know, what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the first place for?," [...] you know. So, it is an {{interesting}} kind of area, and I think there is no black and white." ...|$|R

Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> twenty minutes!' ...|$|E
6000|$|They stared like schoolboys caught {{plotting}} mischief {{and looked}} so guilty {{that she took}} pity on them, innocently imagining the brothers were indulging in a little sentiment on this joyful occasion, so she added quickly, as she beckoned, without crossing the threshold, [...] "Women not allowed, of course, but both of you dear Odd Fellows are wanted, for Aunt Plenty begs we will have an old-fashioned contra dance, and I'm to lead off with Uncle Mac. I chose you, sir, because <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> style, pigeon wings and all. So, please come and Phebe is waiting for you, Uncle Alec.

6000|$|He come a-loping into Washington, {{and put up}} {{his horse}} and shoved out to the President's house with his letter, and they told him the President {{was up to the}} Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia--not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat 'most dropped, it made him so sick. His horse was put up, and he didn't know what to do. But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his chance. He rushes out and shouts: [...] "A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> twenty minutes!" ...|$|E

He must give the sweat of his tensest effort, the uttermost toil of his body--all, in fact, that has been given him. Then he must shut his eyes tight to the hazards against him, or look at them without wavering--the drought, the hail, the harvest frost, I mean. If his teams fall sick, or the season goes against him, he must work double tides. Still, it now and then happens that things go right, and the red wheat rolls ripe right back across the prairie.
