500|$|Smith told Matthews [...] "there are no {{shackles}} here... express yourself... {{play your}} own game and {{whatever you do}} on the pitch, {{do it in the}} knowledge that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> full support." [...] He assembled a talented frontline in Matthews, Stan Mortensen, Jimmy McIntosh, and Alex Munro; with an emphasis on entertaining football. The Seasiders finished in ninth place and reached the 1948 FA Cup Final. On 23 April 1948, the eve of the final, Matthews won the inaugural Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year award. Despite taking the lead twice in the match, Blackpool lost out 4–2 to Matt Busby's Manchester United in the final, with Matthews assisting Mortensen for Blackpool's second.|$|E
500|$|He {{served in}} New York during the American War of Independence. While William was in America, George Washington {{approved}} {{a plot to}} kidnap him, writing: [...] "The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause; and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as your judgment may direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral..." [...] The plot {{did not come to}} fruition; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William, who had up till then walked around New York unescorted.|$|E

500|$|The {{remains of}} the crew members of HH-53C Jolly Roger 67—Chapman, Call, Avery, Prater, and Pearson, and Alley—were {{returned}} to the United States on October 1, 1997. The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of you played a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help me get out of the jungles of Vietnam. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> deepest sympathy—you and these six brave men." ...|$|E
500|$|Lucie Delarue-Mardrus wrote love poems to Barney in {{the early}} years of the century, and in 1930 {{depicted}} her in a novel, L'Ange et les Pervers (The Angel and the Perverts), in which she said she [...] "analyzed and described Natalie at length as well as the life into which she initiated me". [...] The protagonist of the novel is a hermaphrodite named Marion who lives a double life, frequenting literary salons in female dress, then changing from skirt to trousers to attend gay soirées. Barney is Laurette Wells, a salon hostess who spends much of the novel trying to win back an ex-lover loosely based on Renée Vivien. The book's portrayal of her is, at times, harshly critical, but she is the only person whose company Marion enjoys. [...] Marion tells Wells that she is [...] "perverse... dissolute, self-centered, unfair, stubborn, sometimes miserly... a genuine rebel, ever ready to incite others to rebellion.... ou are capable of loving someone just as they are, even a thief—in that lies your only fidelity. [...] And so <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> respect." ...|$|E
500|$|The idea of abdicating and {{returning}} to Portugal took root in his mind, and, beginning in early 1829, he talked about it frequently. An opportunity soon appeared to act upon the notion. Radicals within the Liberal Party rallied street gangs to harass the Portuguese community in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 March 1831, in {{what became known as}} the [...] "noite das garrafadas" [...] (night of the broken bottles), the Portuguese retaliated and turmoil gripped the streets of the national capital. On 5 April, PedroI fired the Liberal cabinet, which had only been in power since 19 March, for its incompetence in restoring order. A large crowd, incited by the radicals, gathered in Rio de Janeiro downtown on the afternoon of 6 April and demanded the immediate restoration of the fallen cabinet. The Emperor's reply was: [...] "I will do everything for the people and nothing [...] by the people." [...] Sometime after nightfall, army troops, including his guard, deserted him and joined the protests. Only then did he realize how isolated and detached from Brazilian affairs he had become, and to everyone's surprise, he abdicated at approximately 03:00 on 7 April. Upon delivering the abdication document to a messenger, he said: [...] "Here <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> act of abdication, I'm returning to Europe and leaving a country that I loved very much, and still love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hammarskjöld's only book, Vägmärken (Markings), was {{published}} in 1963. A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends the month {{before his death in}} 1961. [...] This diary was found in his New York house, after his death, along with an undated letter addressed to then Swedish Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Leif Belfrage. In this letter, Hammarskjöld wrote: [...] "These entries provide the only true 'profile' that can be drawn ... If you find them worth publishing, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> permission to do so". The foreword is written by W.H. Auden, a friend of Hammarskjöld's.|$|E

The following year, he {{was quoted in the}} Radio Times as having said, [...] "Since Helen passed on I can't find anything; the heart, quite simply, has gone out of everything.

2500|$|During their 2013 divorce proceedings, Elson {{entered into}} {{evidence}} an e-mail White {{had sent her}} that included disparaging remarks about The Black Keys. When asked about the email in a 2014 Rolling Stone magazine interview, White stood by the remarks saying, [...] "I'll hear TV commercials where the music's ripping off sounds of mine, to the point I think it's me. Half the time, it's the Black Keys." [...] He later apologized for the comments. However, in September 2015, Patrick Carney of the band posted a series of tweets alleging that White tried to fight him in a bar. White denied the claim {{in a statement to}} the online magazine Pitchfork, saying that Carney should talk to him directly, and not on the internet. The following day, Carney posted a tweet saying, [...] "Talked to jack for an hour he's cool. All good." [...] White tweeted on the Third Man Twitter account, [...] "From one musician to another, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> respect Patrick Carney." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{were able}} to release their {{increasingly}} popular material thanks to lead singer Martin Smith and keyboardist Tim Jupp's roles as recording engineers and producers at a local recording studio. During this period, the lineup of the band began to take shape. Permanent guitar duties were taken up by Stu G shortly {{after the release of}} the band's first EP, whilst Jon Thatcher became permanent bassist for the band's fourth release, 'Cutting Edge Fore'. In total, four EPs were released under the [...] "Cutting Edge" [...] name, in addition to a solo EP from guitarist Stu Garrard, which featured the entire band. Many of the band's most famous songs were written and recorded during this time, including possibly their most famous: 'I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever.' Others included 'The Happy Song', 'Lord, <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>My</b> Heart', 'Thank You For Saving Me', 'Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble?', 'I've Found Jesus', 'I'm Not Ashamed', 'Find Me In The River', 'Shout To The North', 'All I Want Is You' and 'Obsession'. The music became well known in Christian circles, and demand grew for recordings. By 1996, they had sold over seventy thousand EPs by mail order. These EPs were later released as two albums in the UK, and one double album in the US. A similar composite edition of Cutting Edge was released to retail and achieved 'Gold' status in Canada.|$|E
