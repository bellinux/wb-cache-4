[...] In Puerto Rico and Cuba, and the Dominican Republic it is sometimes called malanga or <b>yautia.</b> [...] In some countries, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Dominica, the leaves and stem of the dasheen, or taro, are most often cooked and pureed into a thick liquid called callaloo, which is served {{as a side dish}} similar to creamed spinach. Callaloo is sometimes prepared with crab legs, coconut milk, pumpkin and okra. It is usually served alongside rice or made into a soup along with various other roots.|$|E
2500|$|The {{influence}} of the African culture began to make itself felt on the island. They introduced a mixture of Portuguese, Spanish, and the language spoken in the Congo in {{what is known as}} [...] "Bozal" [...] Spanish. They also introduced what became the typical dances of Puerto Rico such as the Bomba and the Plena, which are likewise rooted in Africa. African women also contributed to the development of Puerto Rican cuisine that has a strong African influence. The melange of flavors that make up the typical Puerto Rican cuisine counts with the African touch. Pasteles, small bundles of meat stuffed into a dough made of grated green banana (sometimes combined with pumpkin, potatoes, plantains, or <b>yautía)</b> and wrapped in plantain leaves, were devised by African women on the island and based upon food products that originated in Africa.|$|E

50|$|As an {{alternative}} to side dishes like French fries, arepitas de yuca are consumed, which are deep-fried buttered lumps of shredded cassava. Bollitos, similar to the Colombian ones, are also made. Also, a type of empanada called catibía has its dough made out of cassava flour. It is also just peeled and boiled then eaten {{with olive oil and}} vinegar and served with other root vegetables like potatoes, ñame, yams, batata (sweet potatoes) and <b>yautía</b> (dasheen). Cassava is also used to make chulos, mainly in the Cibao region: grated cassava and other are shaped into a cylindrical form, much like a croquette, and fried. Also, cassava is an important ingredient for sancocho.|$|E

50|$|From {{the diet}} of the Taíno people come many {{tropical}} roots and tubers like <b>yautía</b> (taro) and especially Yuca (cassava), from which thin cracker-like casabe bread is made. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a slightly hot habanero pepper, recao/culantro (spiny leaf), achiote (annatto), peppers, ají caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (tropical pumpkins), and guanabanas (soursops) are all Taíno foods. The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maize/corn, but maize {{was not as}} dominant in their cooking {{as it was for}} the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of maize, leaving more safeguarded plants like conucos (hills of yuca grown together).|$|E
50|$|Xanthosoma is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} arum family, Araceae. The genus is native to tropical America but widely cultivated and naturalized in other tropical regions. Several are grown for their starchy corms, an important food staple of tropical regions, known variously as malanga, otoy, otoe, cocoyam (or new cocoyam), tannia, tannier, <b>yautía,</b> macabo, ocumo, macal, taioba, dasheen, quequisque, ape and (in Papua New Guinea) as Singapore taro (taro kongkong). Many other species (including especially X. roseum) are used as ornamental plants, and in popular horticultural literature are known as ‘ape or elephant ear (from the purported resemblance of the leaf to an elephant's ear), although the latter name is sometimes also applied to members with similar appearance and uses in the closely related genera Caladium, Colocasia (i.e., taro), and Alocasia.|$|E

50|$|From {{the diet}} of the Taíno (culturally related with the Maya and Carib peoples of Central America and the Caribbean) and Arawak people come many {{tropical}} roots and tubers (collectively called viandas) like malanga (Xanthosoma) and especially Yuca (cassava), from which thin cracker-like casabe bread is made. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a slightly hot habanero pepper, recao/culantro (spiny leaf coriander), sarsaparilla, pimienta (allspice), achiote (annatto), peppers, ají caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (West Indian pumpkin), and guanabanas (soursops) are all Taíno foods. The Taínos also grew varieties of beans and some maíz (corn/maize), but maíz {{was not as}} dominant in their cooking {{as it was for}} the peoples on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of maíz, allowing more safeguarded plants like yuca conucos (hills of yuca grown together) to flourish. Maíz when used was frequently made into cornmeal and then into guanime, cornmeal mixed with mashed <b>yautía</b> and yuca and wrapped in corn husk or large leaves.|$|E
50|$|Cocoyams are {{herbaceous}} {{perennial plants}} {{belonging to the}} family Araceae and are grown primarily for their edible roots, although {{all parts of the}} plant are edible. Cocoyams that are cultivated as food crops belong to either the genus Colocasia or the genus Xanthosoma and are generally composed of a large spherical corm (swollen underground storage stem), from which a few large leaves emerge. The petioles of the leaves (leaf stems) stand erect and can reach lengths in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft). The leaf blades are large and heart-shaped and can reach 50 cm (15.8 in) in length. The corm produces lateral buds that give rise to side-corms (cormels, suckers) or stolons (long runners, creeping rhizomes) depending on the species and variety. Cocoyams commonly reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and although they are perennials, they are often grown as annuals, harvested after one season. Colocasia species may also be referred to as taro, old cocoyam, arrowroot, eddoe, macabo or dasheen and originates from the region of Southeast Asia. Xanthosoma species may be referred to as tannia, <b>yautia,</b> new cocoyam or Chinese taro and originates from Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|The root, in its boiled {{and peeled}} form, {{is present in}} the typical Puerto Rican stew, the sancocho, {{together}} with plantains, potatoes, <b>yautía,</b> among other vegetables (it can also be eaten singly as an alternative to boiled potatoes or plantains). It can be ground and used as a paste (masa) to make a typically Puerto Rican Christmas dish called pasteles. These are similar to Mexican tamales in appearance but are made with root vegetables, plantains, or yuca instead of corn. Pasteles are rectangular and have a meat filling in the center, usually chicken or pork. They are wrapped in a plantain leaf. Guanimes are also smilier to tamales; they are made with yuca or plantains mashed with spices, coconut and wrapped in banana leaf and are shape like a log. Masa made from cassava is also used for alcapurrias. These are filled with meat similar to pasteles but are fried instead. Yuca in Puerto Rico is also fried, smashed with garlic, olive oil, broth and then stuffed with chicharrón or bacon to make mofongo de yuca. Casabe bread also is a traditional food made from yuca, but is no longer very commonly eaten. Escabeche de yuca, cassava and chicken gizzards pickled in a garlicky brine with onions and olives. Serernata de Bacalao, salted cod fish mixed with cassava and other tropical root vegetables, green bananas, cabbage, chayote, hard boiled eggs, and avocado. Cassava spiced cookies called alfajor are sold all over the island and very popular during the Christmas season.|$|E
