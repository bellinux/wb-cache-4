500|$|In 2013, Khan {{appeared}} in three films, the first being Vishal Bhardwaj's Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola, a political satire {{set in the}} rustic surroundings of a village in Haryana. Co-starring with Pankaj Kapur, Anushka Sharma and Shabana Azmi, Khan played Hukum Singh Matru, an educated community activist and Kapur's right-hand man. To prepare for the role, he lived in Delhi for three months and learned to speak Haryanvi from theatre group Act One. The film (and his performance) generated mixed reviews from critics, and its eventual box-office profit was poor. Reuters Shilpa Jamkhandikar wrote, [...] "Imran Khan goes {{red in the face}} trying to muster up a Haryanvi accent and act tough. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the effort in his acting and that's why it jars all the more." [...] Subhash K Jha described it as a good effort, at best. Khan also sang for the film's soundtrack in [...] "Chaar Dina Ki".|$|E
500|$|The team {{decided to}} {{incorporate}} anime elements for the game's animation. Inafune explained, [...] " [...] hand transforms into {{a gun and}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> it {{come out of his}} arm. We {{wanted to make sure that}} the animation and the motion was realistic and actually made sense. So with Mega Man, we had this perfect blending of game character with animation ideas." [...] The gameplay for Mega Man was inspired by the game rock-paper-scissors. The project supervisor wanted a simple system that offered [...] "deep gameplay". Each weapon deals a large amount of damage to one specific Robot Master, others have little to no effect against them, and there is no single weapon that dominates all the others. Mega Man was originally able to crouch, but the team decided against it since it made players' ability to determine the height of onscreen projectiles more difficult. Naoya Tomita (credited as [...] "Tom Pon") began work on the Mega Mans scenic backgrounds immediately after his Capcom training. Tomita proved himself amongst his peers by overcoming the challenges of the console's limited power through maximizing the use of background elements.|$|E
60|$|But {{what good}} do the aphides {{themselves}} {{derive from the}} power of secreting honey-dew? For we know now that no animal or plant is ever provided with any organ or part merely {{for the benefit of}} another creature: the advantage must at least be mutual. Well, in the first place, it is likely that, in any case, the amount of sugary matter in the food of the aphides is quite in excess of their needs; they assimilate the nitrogenous material of the sap, and secrete its saccharine material as honey-dew. That, however, would hardly account for the development of special secretory ducts, like the honey-tubes, in which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the little drops of honey rolling, under the microscope. But the ants are useful allies to the aphides, in guarding them from another very dangerous type of insect. They are subject to the attacks of an ichneumon fly, which lays its eggs in them, meaning its larvæ to feed upon their living bodies; and the ants watch over the aphides with the greatest vigilance, driving off the ichneumons whenever they approach their little protégés.|$|E

60|$|I have {{a drawing}} here, sketched {{many years ago}} by Hooker, {{when he made his}} investigations. It is the drawing of the flame of a lamp, but it will apply to the flame of a candle. The cup of the candle is the vessel or lamp, the melted {{spermaceti}} is the oil, and the wick is common to both. Upon that he sets this little flame, and then he represents what is true--a certain quantity of matter rising about it which you do not see, and which, if you have not been here before, or are not familiar with the subject, you will not know of. He has here represented the parts of the surrounding atmosphere that are very essential to the flame, and that are always present with it. There is a current formed, which draws the flame out--for the flame which you see is really drawn out by the current, and drawn upward to a great height--just as Hooker has here shewn you by that prolongation of the current in the diagram. You may see this by taking a lighted candle, and putting it in the sun so as to get its shadow thrown on a piece of paper. How remarkable it is that that thing which is light enough to produce shadows of other objects, can be made to throw its own shadow on a piece of white paper or card, so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> streaming round the flame something which {{is not part of the}} flame, but is ascending and drawing the flame upwards. Now, I am going to imitate the sunlight, by applying the voltaic battery to the electric lamp. You now see our sun, and its great luminosity; and by placing a candle between it and the screen, we get the shadow of the flame.|$|E

50|$|I like reminiscing {{about the}} things that made me psyched on skating as a kid, it helps me go out there and keep doing it.

It feels like they are going too far, we’ve got to go back in time… It just doesn’t look fun anymore. I think that’s why the DGK video was so successful.

50|$|It is a large, stocky breed, and {{is often}} crossed with other breeds to enhance meat production. There are two variates, the Cornish Game and the Jubilee Cornish Game. The Cornish Game is dark blue - green in color, with brown {{patterning}} on the hens. Jubilee Cornish Game are much lighter, and less stocky than their counterparts. They are usually light wheaten in color, with light brown patterning.The Indian game, also known as Cornish, is sometimes called the bulldog among chickens; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the roast chicken shape in it. It was created because people wanted to cross the Asian game breeds with old English game to create a fantastic fighter.

[...] Across the series Mega Man was given new skills to add more variety to the gameplay.

5000|$|Love's Secret Domain (abbreviated LSD) {{followed}} in 1991 {{as the next}} [...] "proper" [...] Coil album, although a few minor releases had been produced since Horse Rotorvator. LSD represents a progression in Coil's style and became a template for what would be representative of newer waves of post-industrial music, blended with their own style of acid house. Although the album was more upbeat, it was not intended as a dance record, as Christopherson explained [...] "I wouldn't say it's a party atmosphere, but it's more positive." [...] "Windowpane" [...] and a Jack Dangers remix of [...] "The Snow" [...] were released as singles, both of which had music videos directed by Christopherson.

5000|$|A {{few years}} beforehand, Ashbaugh {{had written a}} fan letter to {{cyberpunk}} novelist William Gibson, whose oeuvre he had admired, and the pair had struck up a telephone friendship. Shortly after the project had germinated {{in the minds of}} Begos and Ashbaugh, they contacted and recruited Gibson. The project exemplified Gibson's deep ambivalence towards technologically advanced futurity, and as The New York Times expressed it, was [...] "designed to challenge conventional notions about books and art while extracting money from collectors of both". Some people have said that they think this is a scam or pure hype … maybe fun, maybe interesting, but still a scam. But Gibson thinks of it as becoming a memory, which he believes is more real than anything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see.</b> Kevin Begos Jr., End Notes The project manifested as a poem written by Gibson incorporated into an artist's book created by Ashbaugh; as such it was as much a work of collaborative conceptual art as poetry. Gibson stated that Ashbaugh's design [...] "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only once, then eat itself." [...] Ashbaugh was gleeful at the dilemma this would pose to librarians: in order to register the copyright of the book, he had to send two copies to the United States Library of Congress, who, in order to classify it had to read it, and in the process, necessarily had to destroy it. The creators had initially intended to infect the disks with a computer virus, but declined to after considering the potential damage to the computer systems of innocents.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, just as Fayer was {{beginning}} his career, advances in laser technology were occurring to make pulses {{of light that}} were short enough {{to get to the}} time scales of molecular motions. While Fayer contributed to laser development, his real ground breaking contributions are in the methods that we use to look at molecular motions. Even with ultrashort pulses of light, it is still not possible to look, in the normal sense of the word, at molecules moving. Fayer developed and continues to develop and apply what are called ultrafast nonlinear optical experiments to the study of molecular dynamics in complex molecular systems such as liquids, glasses, crystals, and biological systems. Ultrafast nonlinear methods involve sequences of light pulses. In a typical experiment, three pulses of light impinge on a sample, and remarkably, the nonlinear interactions in the sample give rise to a fourth pulse of light that leaves the sample in a unique direction. If the experiments are conducted with visible light, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> this nonlinear production of an additional light pulse. Three beams of ultrashort light pulses go into the sample, but four beams of light come out of the sample. It is this fourth beam of light that contains the information about the sample. There are many versions of this type of experiment that Fayer developed and applied to understanding molecular materials. Depending on the timing of the pulses, the colors of the pulses, and the directions of the pulses coming into the sample, different properties can be investigated. Fayer drove the field of ultrafast optical spectroscopy through his developments and use of these new methods to explicate the properties of complex molecular systems.|$|E
