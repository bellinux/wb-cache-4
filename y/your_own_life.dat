500|$|Released in {{the fall}} of 2014, the album's title [...] "refers to {{recurring}} themes in her work: the dichotomy of not feeling entirely present in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> and the feeling of having to fight against different aspects of yourself, {{while at the same time}} being drawn to what is fragile and raw." [...] Nilsen describes these songs as [...] "more mature, darker", and the ukulele is almost completely absent.|$|E
500|$|The Experiment is a pop rock album, {{featuring}} {{guitar and}} synth riffs, and incorporates elements of dance-pop, pop rap and power pop. Some {{parts of the}} album contain auto-tuned vocals, and the record {{has been described as}} having an [...] "international" [...] feel. Rumble said that this was because he and Campbell made sure that the album [...] "sounded big [...] it could compete on the world stage". Thematically, The Experiment is [...] "about love, heartbreak, getting what he wants and knowing he is in charge of his own destiny", although [...] "Let You Down" [...] is [...] "quite dark and weighty". Many of the song's discuss Rumble's own life experiences; some are reflective while others [...] "just try to get other people enthused about what they're doing with their lives". [...] "Always Be Here" [...] discusses maintaining a romantic relationship while constantly travelling, and [...] "What Are You Waiting For?" [...] is [...] "about being motivated and assessing <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> which is exactly what happened to [...] ".|$|E

500|$|IGN staff rated [...] "The Moth" [...] as the 36th best {{episode in}} all of Lost, explaining, [...] "The moth of the episode's title appears both as a metaphorical and {{physical}} symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself, as Locke explains to Charlie, and {{to take charge of}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> without relying on anyone else to do it for you." [...] In a review focusing solely on [...] "The Moth", Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, writing that the episode [...] "does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show", and that [...] "Locke's analogy of 'The Moth' in comparison to Charlie's situation perfectly encapsulates what many of the characters are going through on the island." [...] In a ranking of all of Losts episodes, Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times placed [...] "The Moth" [...] at number 102, complimenting Monaghan and O'Quinn's acting, but criticizing the storyline for containing [...] "nonsensical drug abuse storytelling." [...] "The Moth", along with [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "House of the Rising Sun", won a PRISM Award for Charlie's drug storyline.|$|E
500|$|... "742617000027" [...] is the intro {{track to}} the album. It {{contains}} some guitar scratches and abstract sound {{samples from the}} sampler Craig Jones. Some of the dialogue was reportedly taken from a Charles Manson documentary. The dialogue is [...] "The whole thing, I think it's sick." [...] In an interview shortly after the album was released, Joey Jordison claimed the voice is Corey Taylor's, sped up. 742617000027 was the barcode number on their 1996 self-released album Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. All of the band members wear that number on their jumpsuits. [...] "Wait and Bleed" [...] is {{about a man who}} keeps having repetitive black and white dreams about laying in a bathtub full of his own blood with his wrists slit. One day, he wakes up and sees that his dream has become a reality. However, he doesn't want to believe it and he tries to fall back asleep again. Chris Fehn said that [...] "Surfacing" [...] "basically encompasses everything. Kind of encompasses the attitude of the band and the attitude of how we feel about life: Don't judge me. Everything that you think that you know about the world, and about Slipknot, and about <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> might not be the case. So I think it's just openmindedness and just be cool." [...] Paul Gray said about the meaning behind [...] "Surfacing" [...] chorus: [...] "Basically, we dedicate it to the kids as their new national anthem. It's our way of saying don't worry about everybody else. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about the people judging and the people coming down on you and all the fake crap. Stick to what you believe in." [...] "Spit It Out" [...] was written in response to some individuals who worked at a local radio station in Des Moines, Iowa, where Slipknot is from. These individuals worked hard to keep Slipknot off the air. [...] "Prosthetics" [...] was inspired by the 1965 film The Collector, which is about a butterfly collector who chose to collect humans, too.|$|E

[...] Top Spot was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, much to Emin's dismay, as she intended the film for a teenage audience.|$|E

No spear wounded Heliodore while I was near her, and when I was not near her your Greeks were too far away for any spears to be thrown. Indeed, unless you stabbed her secretly, she was not wounded, and I am sure that, however much you have hated her, this {{you would not have}} dared to do for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life's</b> sake. Augusta, for <b>your</b> <b>own</b> {{purposes}} you are trying to deceive me. I will not marry you. Do your worst.

Her family responded to what she called this [...] "bizarre form of evil" [...] by laughing at the landlord rather than falling into despair. Morrison later said her family's response demonstrated how to keep your integrity and claim <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> in the face of acts of such [...] "monumental crudeness." ...|$|E

[...] At {{the end of the}} show, he and Ziva have a brief discussion about their relationship but are interrupted when Ray calls her.

2500|$|Another {{distinction}} {{is that the}} first case is similar to a pilot in an airplane that has lost power and is about to crash and currently heading towards a heavily populated area.

It may well be considered noble to sacrifice <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life</b> to protect others, but morally or legally allowing murder of an innocent person in order to save five people may be insufficient justification.|$|E
2500|$|Sean O'Connor, former EastEnders series story {{producer}} and then-editor on radio soap opera The Archers, was announced {{to be taking}} over the role. Treadwell-Collins left on 6 May and O'Connor's first credited episode was broadcast on 11 July Although O'Connor's first credited episode aired in July, his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. I think we need to be ourselves and go back to the origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>life,</b> it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E

You're putting yourself in the way of her welfare; and though I'm sorry to hurt you after what you've done, and what I've left undone, I feel now it's my duty to insist on taking care of my own daughter.

500|$|Shirley Manson later recalled, [...] "'Run Baby Run' {{is about}} trying to {{engineer}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> peace of mind and being unafraid {{to make changes in}} your life in order to try and facilitate that.
