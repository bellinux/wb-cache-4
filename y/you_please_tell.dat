In a Q session hosted by Newsarama.com, 52 editor Michael Siglain answered {{a series of questions}} regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series.

One of the more {{interesting}} aspects of this debate came when Allen was questioned by WUSA-TV anchor Peggy Fox. Fox said: [...] "It has been reported [...] your grandfather Felix, whom you were given your middle name for, was Jewish. Could <b>you</b> <b>please</b> <b>tell</b> us whether your forebears include Jews and, if so, at which point Jewish identity might have ended?" [...] This led to a booing from the crowd and anger from Allen who admonished Fox for [...] "making aspersions" [...] and responded: [...] "To be getting into what religion my mother is, I don't think is relevant...Why is that relevant -- my religion, Jim's religion or the religious beliefs of anyone out there?...My mother is French-Italian with a little Spanish blood in her." [...] The next day, Allen issued a statement both confirming and distancing himself from his mother's Jewish ancestry. The statement read: ...|$|E
