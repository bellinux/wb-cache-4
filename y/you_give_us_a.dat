They played their first gig as the Stone Roses on 23 October 1984, supporting Pete Townshend at an anti-heroin concert at the Moonlight Club in London, Brown having sent the demo with an accompanying letter stating [...] "I'm surrounded by skagheads, I wanna smash 'em.

The band received management offers and more gigs soon followed.|$|E
2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "â€¦two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E

6000|$|... "All {{places have}} their dangers to your sleepy navigator, deacon; {{but the man}} who keeps his eyes open has little to fear. Had <b>you</b> <b>given</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> chronometer, there {{would not have been}} {{one-half}} the risk there will be without one." ...|$|R

6000|$|It was the {{twilight}} of a late spring evening when the congregation streamed out of Church, and Elvira, who had managed hitherto to avoid all intercourse with the River Hollow party, found herself grappled by Lisette without hope of rescue.

6000|$|Here he was {{interrupted}} by the inquisitor, who had suffered him to go on thus far, in hopes of gathering something from his unguarded enthusiasm. [...] "Senor," [...] said he, [...] "this is all rambling, visionary talk. You are charged with sorcery, and in defence <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> rhapsody about alchymy.

6000|$|... "Thank you, my dear," [...] said Mrs. Wragge, meekly, drying her eyes; [...] "thank you kindly. Don't notice my handkerchief, please. It's such a {{very little}} one!

6000|$|... "Yuh, I {{guess that}} was it. Do you {{remember}} how <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>an</b> imitation of him telling the class that if they'd work like sixty they might get to be little tin gods on wheels like himself, and how he'd always keep dropping his eye-glasses and fishing 'em up on a cord while he was talking--don't you remember how you took him off? Why, I thought Mrs. Hunt-that-is--I've forgotten what her name was before Sandy married her--why, I thought she'd split, laughing. She admired you a whole pile, lemme tell you; I could see that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon you {{remember}} when we were aboard the boat. <b>You</b> <b>gave</b> <b>us</b> <b>a</b> narrative {{of what happened in}} that Community of yours, which I can truly characterise as a combination of native eloquence and chastening good sense. I put the question to myself, sir, what has become of that well-informed and discreet young Christian, now he has changed the sphere to England and mixed with the Farnabys? It's not to be denied that I see him before me in the flesh when I look across the table here; but it's equally true that I miss him altogether, in the spirit." ...|$|R
