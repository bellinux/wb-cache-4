500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be like if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make." [...] He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon: ...|$|E
500|$|Markus and McFeely {{wanted to}} adapt Ed Brubaker's Winter Soldier storyline from the comics, which they {{described}} as [...] "the tone of Cap’s modern franchise", {{but it took}} the duo six months to convince themselves {{that they could do}} it. In the meantime, while thinking how to progress from the war film tone of The First Avenger, the writers settled on the conspiracy genre for the screenplay, and cited Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man as influences, feeling it better conveyed Captain America's trust issues and contrasting values in the new world he was living in, with Markus saying, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> 1940s man into present day geo-politics everything is going to seem like a conspiracy. It's just going to seem dirty and underhanded and shifty, and people won't be telling the truth." [...] Three Days of the Condor in particular was used as the main source of the script structure, following the idea that the protagonist is being chased by a threat they, along with the audience, only discover halfway through the film.|$|E

2500|$|Capt. Stewart Parker, the Command and Control Special Forces {{commander}} at Bagram Air Base {{during the}} battle, said of Rhyner: [...] "Rhyner {{is out of}} training {{less than a year}} and is {{in one of the most}} difficult situations ... it is an absolute testament to his character and the training these guys take. It tells me we are doing something right." [...] During a Fox News interview with Glen Beck, Beck asked Rhyner [...] "... there are only — what is it? — 192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross ... How do <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>that</b> together in your head? I mean, you are in a very elite group." [...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E
