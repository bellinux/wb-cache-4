5|$|Doro's album Fear No Evil was {{released}} in January 2009 and entered in many charts all over Europe. It was her last collaboration with guitarist Joe Taylor, who left to join Cycle of Pain. His place in the band {{was taken by the}} Dutch guitarist Bas Maas (ex-After Forever). The line-up of Pesch, Maas, Princiotta, Douglas and Dee went on a world tour for most of 2009 and 2010, reaching North and South America, Russia, China and, for the first time, Japan. Doro supported Saxon in their 2009 UK tour and Motörhead in Germany in 2010. During this prolonged time on the road, guitarist Princiotta was sometimes substituted by Robert Katrikh or by Harrison Young. Doro's band appeared at festivals all over the world, including Wacken Open Air and Metal Female Voices Fest 7 (where she dueted again with Tarja Turunen) in 2009, Hellfest in France, Bang <b>Your</b> <b>Head!!!</b> <b>in</b> Germany and Bloodstock Open Air in Great Britain in 2010.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the album's lead single, [...] "You Get What You Give", drew much attention—particularly its bridge, as it {{contained}} insults directed at Beck, Hanson, Courtney Love, and Marilyn Manson. Alexander stated in a 1998 Billboard {{interview that the}} song's lyrics are [...] "mostly about remembering to fly high and be completely off <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a world where we can't control all the elements. You have to maintain balance because you only get what you give."

500|$|Max Bemis {{was raised}} [...] "in a strong Jewish environment." [...] Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain {{elements}} of Jewish humor. [...] While most of band's earlier songs {{are free of}} any such inspiration, the songs of ...Is a Real Boy and In Defense of the Genre include references to Jewish heritage. [...] "Alive with the Glory of Love," [...] Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by World War II and the Holocaust, based on Bemis's grandparents, [...] while [...] "Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too" [...] includes mentions of [...] "the old shul" [...] and a rabbi's teachings. [...] A strong example from In Defense comes from the lyrics of [...] "Died a Jew". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and its history along with mentions of [...] "the murder of God" [...] and Bemis' departures from kosher. [...] References to religion come again in [...] "Fed to Death" [...] on Say Anything, referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life to smile and clear your name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> shame.' ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do the best you can, listen to your favorite band, bury <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the sand, before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!" ...|$|E
500|$|Overall, {{reviews of}} the film were highly positive. Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman awarded the film an [...] "A" [...] grade, hailing the film as a [...] "procedural thriller for the {{information}} age" [...] that [...] "spins <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still." [...] Nathan Lee in his review for The Village Voice wrote that director Fincher's [...] "very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory {{of life in the}} information age, it blew my mind." [...] Todd McCarthy's review in Variety praised the film's [...] "almost unerringly accurate evocation of the workaday San Francisco of 35–40 years ago. Forget the distorted emphasis on hippies and flower-power that many such films indulge in; this is the city as it was experienced by most people who lived and worked there." [...] David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek magazine, wrote, [...] "Zodiac is meticulously crafted – Harris Savides's state-of-the-art digital cinematography has a richness indistinguishable from film – and it runs almost two hours and 40 minutes. Still, the movie holds you in its grip from start to finish. Fincher boldly (and some may think perversely) withholds the emotional and forensic payoff we're conditioned to expect from a big studio movie." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film 4 stars out of a possible 4, writing: [...] "The film is a police procedural crossed with a newspaper movie, but free of most of the cliches of either. Its most impressive accomplishment is to gather a bewildering labyrinth of facts and suspicions over a period of years, and make the journey through this maze frightening and suspenseful." [...] Ebert also praised the casting (critical in an ensemble film) and, as a longtime columnist for The Chicago Sun-Times, asserted Zodiac was [...] "intriguing in its accuracy" [...] in showing the operation of a major newspaper.|$|E

This tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo, New York. The Evanescence Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London's Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band plans to take an extended break after the tour, saying, [...] "At the end of any really long tour you need to get <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> order.

2500|$|The Talmud states, [...] "Cover <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{order that}} the fear of heaven may be upon you." [...] Rabbi Hunah ben Joshua never walked 4 cubits (6.6 feet, or 2 meters) with his head uncovered. He explained: [...] "Because the Divine Presence is always over my head." [...] This was {{understood}} by Rabbi Yosef Karo in the Shulchan Arukh as indicating that Jewish men should cover their heads and should not walk more than four cubits bareheaded. Covering one's head, such as by wearing a kippah, is described as [...] "honoring God". The Mishnah Berurah modifies this ruling, adding that the Achronim established it as a requirement to wear a head covering even when traversing fewer than four cubits, and even when one is standing still, indoors and outside. Kitzur Shulchan Aruch cites a story from the Talmud (Shabbat 156b) about Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak who might have become a thief had his mother not saved him from this fate by insisting that he cover his head, which instilled in him the fear of God. In many communities, boys are encouraged to wear a kippah from a young age in order to ingrain the habit.|$|E

2500|$|After {{nearly two}} years, the NWW SuperCrush Battle Royal Championship was won by Pierre Vachon in Sandwich, Massachusetts on March 31, 2007.

On March 29, Allen defeated Brickhouse Baker at the Plymouth Community Intermediate School in Plymouth, Massachusetts. On April 5, in East Sandwich, Massachusetts, Allen and New World Wrestling participated in a benefit show for the Sandwich High School wrestling team The Blue Knights. During the event, Allen accepted an open challenge put out by then NWW Tag Team Champions Moondog Maximus & Professor Sushi. Sushi had substituted for regular tag team partner Tony Kahuko.

2500|$|The Fault in Our Stars {{received}} critical acclaim. Critics mostly {{praised the}} book for its humor, strong characters, language, themes and new perspective on cancer and romance. The New York Times review of the book called it [...] "a blend of melancholy, sweet, philosophical and funny" [...] and said that it [...] "stays the course of tragic realism", while noting that the book's unpleasant plot details [...] "do nothing to diminish the romance; in Green's hands, they only make it more moving." [...] NPR's Rachel Syme noted that [...] " [...] voice is so compulsively readable that it defies categorization," [...] saying that the [...] "elegantly plotted" [...] book [...] "may be his best." [...] Time called The Fault in Our Stars [...] "damn near genius." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] " [...] love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that come early in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking", and gave the novel an overall A grade. Amazon.com calls it [...] "insightful, bold, irreverent, and raw" [...] and Green's [...] "most ambitious and heartbreaking work yet." [...] The Manila Bulletin says that the book is [...] "a collection of maudlin scenes and trite observations about the fragility {{of life and the}} wisdom of dying. And while it does talk about those things and more, the treatment of it is far from being maudlin or trite." [...] The Manila Bulletin also added that [...] "Just two paragraphs into the work, and he immediately wallops the readers with such an insightful observation delivered in such an unsentimental way that its hard not to shake <b>your</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> admiration." [...] The Manila Bulletin stated that The Fault in Our Stars was a triumph for John Green. USA Today called it a [...] "elegiac comedy."
