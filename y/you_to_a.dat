25|$|B. F. Skinner, theorist of operant conditioning, {{shows how}} a pigeon has {{been taught to}} {{distinguish}} between two words and behaves appropriately depending on which one is being presented. It learned each response with a reward of food therefore its behaviour is being shaped by controlling its environment. An example of this conditioning in a consumer behaviour context is a cinema using a consumer incentive scheme. As a consumer, if one is given a card which entitles <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> free movie if you bring a friend and free popcorn on Tuesdays with {{the purchase of a}} ticket per se, one is more likely to go to a movie when perhaps you wouldn’t have otherwise.|$|E

500|$|Molotov, like Stalin, was pathologically mistrustful of others, {{and because}} of it, much crucial {{information}} disappeared. As Molotov once said [...] "One should listen to them, but {{it is necessary to}} check up on them. The intelligence officer can lead <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very dangerous position... There are many provocateurs here, there, and everywhere." [...] Molotov continued to claim, in a series of published interviews, that there never was a secret territorial deal between Stalin and Hitler during the Nazi-Soviet Pact. Like Stalin, he never recognised the Cold War as an international event. He saw the Cold War as, more or less, the everyday conflict between communism and capitalism. He divided the capitalist countries into two groups, the [...] "smart and dangerous imperialists" [...] and the [...] "fools". Before his retirement, Molotov proposed establishing a socialist confederation with the People's Republic of China (PRC); Molotov believed socialist states were part of a bigger, supranational entity. In retirement, Molotov criticised Nikita Khrushchev for being a [...] "right-wing deviationist".|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{have criticized}} the game for its high and unforgiving {{difficulty}} level especially late in the game, {{and it has been}} considered an example of [...] "Nintendo Hard" [...] video games. A review from 1UP.com referred to the latter levels as an [...] "unfair display of intentional cheapness". In his review of the Virtual Console version, GameSpot's Alex Navarro said [...] "the game will beat <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pulp" [...] and that it [...] "assaults you time and time again with its punishing difficulty, insidiously placed enemies, and rage-inducing boss fights". According to his review, the game starts easy, but the difficulty starts to increase halfway through the second Act and continues through the sixth Act; Navarro describes the sixth Act's difficulty as being [...] "one of the bottom levels of gaming hell". IGN said that this game {{was one of the most}} difficult video games of all time, setting the trend for the rest of the series; however, they pointed out that its difficulty and graphics are [...] "defining characteristics [...] have carried over through the years into modern day [...] Gaiden sequels". ScrewAttack listed the game as the seventh hardest title in the NES library.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

The Economic Times gave a rating of 4 stars out of 5, noting that the film is {{well on its way to}} being one of the most praised sports-based films since Chak De India and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and wrote [...] "This is one of those boxing movies which is much more than boxing.

[...] Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 3 out of 5 noted it as a [...] "worthy attempt" [...] and said that the film had sincerity and was crafted with care. Mayank Shekhar also rated the film with 3 stars, stating that his biggest concern before getting into the film was that the film-makers (Sanjay Leela Bhansali) would excessively [...] "Bollywood-ise" [...] Kom's story.

500|$|She also {{performed}} a disco-styled {{version of the}} song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. The stage was decked in Mylar curtains and glittering disco balls. The performance began with a distorted voice claiming [...] "I'm gonna take <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> place you've never been before". Afterwards, Madonna descended from the ceiling on a giant disco ball, wearing a blond afro wig, 1970's style halters and royal blue bell-bottom pants. Then her two back-up dancers appeared {{on the stage and}} the three women started singing the song together. The end of the performance was connected to the next song, [...] "Deeper and Deeper". According to Guilbert, Madonna was inspired by actress Marlene Dietrich in the 1932 film Blonde Venus for the performance. It was included on The Girlie Show – Live Down Under home video release, recorded on November 19, 1993, at Sydney, Australia. [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was included in the military segment of the Re-Invention World Tour in 2004, with the opening line altered to [...] "Come on boys!". She and her dancers were dressed in military gear and performed a rifle choreography, with Madonna acting as a sergeant. As Drew Sterwald from News Press noted, the song in its military version was talking about both personal love, as well as patriotic love. Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that the song was contravened as cynical, when Madonna sang the line, [...] "What you need is a big, strong hand/To lift you to your higher ground", and raised a rifle above her head. Author Dirk Timmerman pointed out that [...] "in the context of the show, with [...] performances like 'American Life' and 'Imagine', it added to the anti-war message of the tour." [...] In 2008, during the Sticky & Sweet Tour, she performed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the request song in some of her shows, including the show at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E
