6000|$|... "A month back--when I changed sudden-like," [...] mused Bo. [...] "I {{wonder what}} he meant by that.... Nell, did I change--right after the talk <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> me--about him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{told me you}} had progressed a {{long way}} in her favours during the half-hour's talk <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her the other night; have you not {{followed}} up the advantage?' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What's {{the reason}} you haven't got {{as much of a}} one with me as <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Seth? We're partners, an' he never said half the rough things about you that I have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more of that, young man--no more of that--But I {{recollect}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> {{you that}} beautiful dancing siren.--Buckingham, I will hold you gold to silver, {{that she was}} the intended tenant of that bass-fiddle?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A good deal, off and on. But it's getting chilly and I half {{expect a}} reproving lecture from Miss Hume when I go in. First, though, {{tell me a}} little more about the young Canadian <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what would}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> Miss Mowbray?" [...] said the fair wearer of the {{beautiful}} shawl, but without turning round her head.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cash account}} is an account <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> a {{brokerage}} firm, {{in which you}} deposit cash to buy stocks, bonds and other securities ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You are {{as stupid}} about {{such matters as}} were {{the men of the}} Old World," [...] she said, shaking her head and laughing. [...] "I thought that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you {{pictures}} of ladies you have known which would show me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Profited?" [...] she echoed, between scorn {{and bitter}} amusement. [...] "Profited, did ye say? I think your dotage is surely upon you--you that have sunk nigh all your fortune {{and all that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> me in this thieving venture--d'ye talk of profits?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you must}} know, I'm {{speaking}} about Ruth Stevenson, who goes to a young ladies' school not far from Colby Hall. She and I are very good friends, and she has told me {{a good deal about}} this quarrel <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh fatally! See how I have. And see how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> ME. She's intelligent, moreover, remarkably pretty, remarkably good. And she'll adore you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pooh!" [...] she scoffed. [...] "Nothing will happen. You are invincible, John. You will conquer {{with these}} men as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> poor me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, her {{documentary}} film Would <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> Sex <b>with</b> an Arab?, produced by Yves Chanvillard and Nadim Cheikhrouha (Screenrunner), was selected at the Venice International Film Festival. Shot in Israel, {{the film is}} an orchestration of interviews with people who all answer the same questions posed by the author - [...] "Would <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> Sex <b>with</b> an Arab?" [...] and [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> sex <b>with</b> an Israeli Jew?".|$|R
6000|$|... "And, mother," [...] said Cis, [...] "she {{says she}} is nearly certain that she knows who my true parents were, and {{that she could be}} certain if she saw the {{swaddling}} clothes and tokens <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> me. Have you, mother? I never knew of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} at you three, and did not notice who <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you. In that letter the chap brought me, {{you said that the}} chief was going with you, and Sam Hicks and Ben Gulston. I did not know them so well; that is, I never worked with them, though they have stopped here many a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had almost}} forgot a message I have for you, my son. Father Claude sent word last evening {{that he had}} been called {{suddenly}} south, and that some appointment <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> him must therefore be deferred until later. He said that you would understand." [...] The old man eyed his companion narrowly through the eye slit in his helm.|$|E
6000|$|But {{for your}} son, believe it--oh, believe it-- [...] Most dangerously <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> him prevailed, [...] If not most mortal to him. [...] CORIOLANUS.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do write," [...] she begged, as {{she walked}} into the hall with him. [...] "Dear me, what a strange-looking person <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in the taxicab!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Give her up!' {{cried the}} old man. 'Come! Give {{her up to}} me! Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>with</b> her. Quick! I have made no {{promises}} on that score. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>with</b> her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "II. You {{have married}} a wife here, and {{given her a}} great many fine things, and you {{maintain}} her like a princess, and sometimes call her so. Pray what portion have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her? what fortune has she been to you? and where does her estate lie, that you keep her so fine? I am afraid that you keep her in a figure a great deal above her estate, at least above all that you have seen of it yet. Are you sure you han't got a bite, {{and that you have}} not made a beggar a lady?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God will temper {{the wind}} to the shorn lamb," [...] said she. [...] "Neither I, nor Marie will leave our brothers, nor will Madame de Lescure leave her husband; it is little {{we can do to}} hasten victory, but we can lessen {{suffering}} and administer comfort, when comfort is most required. Had you, Cathelineau, loved some woman above all others, and been loved by her; had <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you in your struggle some dear sister, or perhaps still dearer wife, would you have asked her to go from you, that you might have battled on, and struggled, and at last have died alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{examined}} everything narrowly, and at last, I {{found a few}} {{streaks of}} the paint {{on the inside of}} your dressing-gown--not the linen dressing-gown you usually wore in that summer season, but a flannel dressing-gown which <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you also. I suppose you felt chilly after walking to and fro in nothing but your nightdress, and put on the warmest thing you could find. At any rate, there were the stains, just visible, {{on the inside of the}} dressing-gown. I easily got rid of these by scraping away the stuff of the flannel. This done, the only proof left against you was the proof locked up in my drawer.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man <b>you</b> {{are after}} <b>has</b> {{been dead for}} two centuries," [...] the Speaker said. [...] "This is {{all that remains of}} him. And this is all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> which to find him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, sir--sir," [...] {{answered}} the lady, rather eagerly than anxiously, [...] "you {{have not yet}} told me what business <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> my marriage, or what arguments you can bring against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ma foi, master, {{what would}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> the Prussians in sight and all Paris in the streets--five minutes mean neither here nor there. I {{expected}} praise for having come at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lad," [...] he said, [...] "do not think, because I am a {{long time}} coming to the point, that I think lightly of the service you have {{rendered}} me. Ah, lad! I could scarce believe my ears, when Fergus told me that you and your henchman had got the lasses out of the Bairds' hands, and had gone off on horseback with them. I had to put the question, again and again, as to whether he was sure that it was really the girls <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> you. It {{seemed to me to be}} altogether impossible; but I had to believe him, at last, though how it came about he could not tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{knew you}} wouldn't believe {{him if he}} had said the clothes were given to him," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Cicely, [...] "so I don't see where the moral influence comes in. As to her periling her life, those Marsh people are amphibious anyway, or would be in those clothes. And as to her motive, why, papa, I heard you say in this very room, and afterwards to Mr. Calvert, when you gave him instructions, that you believed those Culpeppers were capable of enticing away deserters; and you forget the fuss <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> her savage brother's lawyer about that water front, and how you said it was such people who kept up the irritation between the Civil and Federal power." ...|$|E
6000|$|Calibree {{handed her}} over to his wife, a thick woman who called her [...] "dearie," [...] {{and asked if she}} was hot and, visibly searching for conversation, produced, [...] "Let's see, you and the doctor have a Little One, haven't you?" [...] At dinner Mrs. Calibree served the corned beef and cabbage and looked steamy, looked like the steamy leaves of cabbage. The men were {{oblivious}} of their wives as they gave the social passwords of Main Street, the orthodox opinions on weather, crops, and motor cars, then flung away restraint and gyrated in the debauch of shop-talk. Stroking his chin, drawling in the ecstasy of being erudite, Kennicott inquired, [...] "Say, doctor, what success have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> thyroid for treatment of pains in the legs before child-birth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tain't {{none of my}} fault," [...] {{replied the}} owner of the cow, quickly. [...] "I have as much right on this road with my cow as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>with</b> that there autymobile." ...|$|R
6000|$|After we {{had been}} silent for some time, I said: [...] "Old man, {{the result of the}} grand {{discussion}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>with</b> Rima is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> agreed to take her to Riolama, but about my accompanying you not one word has been spoken by either of you." ...|$|R
