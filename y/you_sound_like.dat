500|$|Most of the melodies on Get to Heaven {{originated}} from Robertshaw's guitar, though he recalled to Rich Chamberlain of MusicRadar that Higgs would occasionally approach {{the rest of}} the group with [...] "an insane laptop creation" [...] which would have to be translated to work as a group. Several tracks feature complex guitar solos, as noted by Chamberlain; one such solo, featured on the title track [...] "Get to Heaven", was originally recorded in a hotel room. Another, on the single [...] "Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread", makes heavy use of an MWFX Judder pedal. Robertshaw told Chamberlain that [...] " [...] is a bit of a signature for the new record... You can do totally unrealistic things with it and it makes <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> Steve Vai on crack." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like,</b> before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. Back in the day, when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for a drink at the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E

"If <b>you</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the Beatles {{and also}} {{could write a}} hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought <b>you</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, {{attracted}} attention to you. It was good for us because everyone {{thought it was the}} Beatles under a different name." ...|$|R
2500|$|During 1959, Irvine and Elliott also {{recorded}} audio tapes to send Guthrie and, after recording one of Guthrie's songs, Elliott exclaimed: [...] "Andy, <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> more <b>like</b> Woody than I do!", just as Guthrie had {{once said to}} Elliott: [...] "Jack, <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> more <b>like</b> me than I do!". However, Irvine's dream to join Guthrie in the States eventually faded when his mother died in 1961.|$|R

5000|$|The {{score was}} heavily criticized for its {{similarity}} {{to the work}} of composer Hans Zimmer, with Broxton stating [...] "Jackman’s theme is so nondescript, it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years, and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade." [...] Southall wondered [...] "When will filmmakers grow a pair of balls and reject this sort of approach to their films - when will they say that no thanks, we don’t want <b>you</b> to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> a fourth-rate Hans Zimmer impersonator, we want <b>you</b> to <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> you." ...|$|R

5000|$|Danielle O'Donoghue caught their live {{performance}} in May 2007 in Adelaide {{and felt that}} their [...] "new song 'Mind Reader' fitted in well with the band's heavier rock past".

5000|$|In a more mixed review, Pitchfork Medias Stephen Deusner {{was less}} {{receptive}} to the albums mainstream sound, writing [...] "Every instrument sounds perfectly placed, and thats a shame because the Avetts got more mileage out of their rough edges than most bands this decade." [...] Deusner also called the album [...] "predictable" [...] and concluded: [...] "Its not that theres no room for such studio nuance in the Avetts music, but it gives I and Love and You a quotidian sheen, making their signature sincerity seem sappy and much less special." [...] Despite the mixed review, Deusner praised the track [...] "Laundry Room." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian also praised the track [...] "Laundry Room" [...] in his otherwise mixed review, writing [...] "The finest moment may be when Laundry Room unexpectedly abandons the blueprint after three and half minutes and explodes into a thrilling bluegrass coda.

5000|$|In 1943, Stitt {{first met}} Charlie Parker, {{and as he}} often later recalled, the two men found that their styles had an {{extraordinary}} similarity that was partly coincidental and not merely due to Stitt's emulation.

5000|$|Hard to {{classify}} your own sound, {{especially when you}} feel it constantly changing under your feet. But I try to write full structured songs that make people feel. They’re usually based around my piano or keyboard playing, and production could be reminiscent of anything from an old paul simon track to a new mgmt track. That’s where the fun comes in I guess. People have said --which musicians LOVE hearing --"Oh, <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> David Gray, James Taylor, or Zero7!" [...] I take them all as compliments, and keep doing my thing. Ironically enough, I compare my style {{to a lot of}} the musicians who people tell me I could compare myself to. David Gray, James Taylor, The Fray, Elton John. I find it hard to be objective about my own sound. I guess if I didn’t have outside opinions, I’d probly just say I sound like me. Brendan James ...|$|E

McAlpine went on to describe the way the rhythm of the vocal cuts across the beat and back again in the verses, and Angela Hunte's vocal pronunciation as brilliant.|$|R
