500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
2500|$|The central {{message of}} the book is that gay men must accept {{responsibility}} for their lives, and that those who are still living must give back to their community by fighting for People With AIDS (PWA's) and LGBT rights, for, as Kramer states, [...] "I must put back something into this world for my own life, which is worth a tremendous amount. [...] By not putting back, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> that your lives are worth shit, and that we deserve to die, and that the deaths of all our friends and lovers have amounted to nothing. [...] I can't believe that in your heart of hearts you feel this way. [...] I can't believe you want to die. [...] Do you?" [...] The first publication provides a portrait of Kramer as activist, and the 1994 edition contains commentary written by him that reflects on his earlier pieces and provides insight into Larry Kramer as writer.|$|E
