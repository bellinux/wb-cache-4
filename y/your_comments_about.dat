[...] He later invited reporters from the Portland Press Herald and WMTW to an interview to explain the comments, saying that [...] "I wish it were 1825 and we would have a duel, that's how angry I am, and I would not put my gun in the air, I guarantee you... I would point it right between his eyes, because he is a snot-nosed little runt and he has not done a damn thing since he's been in this legislature to help move the state forward." [...] Gattine responded by calling LePage's message [...] "upsetting, inappropriate and uncalled for." [...] LePage produced a binder of drug arrestees and went through some of the mugshots with the press. Producing a page with a photo and press clipping of a young white woman who had been arrested, LePage called her a [...] "very lovely young Mainer, maybe 20 years old." [...] He then held up another page with a picture of a black man on it and said [...] "that's the other culprit". He also admitted that the binder had a mixture of black and white people in it. LePage's comments has been widely condemned by Democrats and some Republicans, including U.S. Senator Susan Collins, State Senate President Michael Thibodeau, State House Minority Leader Kenneth Fredette, State Senator Roger Katz, State Senator David Woodsome. Leading Democrats have called LePage [...] "unfit" [...] to serve as Governor and have demanded his resignation.|$|E

40|$|High {{technology}} has touched almost {{every aspect of}} human experience all around the world. Global Positioning System (GPS) technology is no exception. In fact, it has many prospective values because it provides the coordinates of any location in its area. This is of great help especially when mobile devices are involved because the GPS makes it possible for people never to get lost. For example, a physician faced an unusual disease in a patient or new onset of epidemic (e. g. H 1 N 1 flu) in certain area and he was in urgent need to consult and share the patient‟s symptoms, signs and the place with other people (including another physician on the internet network) for a rapid and accurate action regarding this situation. A journalist wanted to be the first in getting a scoop by swiftly informing the newspaper. An emergency event (e. g. Fire, Theft or accidents) happened and the authorities should be informed. Or simply to publicizes fabulous restaurant, a new specialty store, or a great new park for the kids to play. Therefore, communication among people should be facilitated by software that utilizes the available resources to allow people to communicate easily and immediately in another way. We aim with our project “B with me” System to implement an exciting new dimension to social networking which is the ability to share your exact geographic location with your friends using GPS technology equipped in mobile phones. The software will improve the benefit of phone‟s GPS capabilities to locate where you are, allow you to write <b>your</b> <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> the place and then send it to your social network space for your group to see. By combining the technology of GPS system, web social networking and Google maps in developing this application, we will facilitate sharing special moments with friends, family or social network. “B with me” is an application that allows mobile user to post comment, picture and a link to his location on the Google map to certain social networks on the Internet by using the mobile GPS capability. The idea is to simplify the transferring of information regarding a place to the social network and to ease sharing with other users in the Internet. The application depends mainly on the GPS and Google maps in localizing the location then the mobile user can add comment on the place, post a photo for it, then simply forward these data to a social network by a touch of a button. The application is not only helpful for the general user but it is also helpful in many professional fields e. g. in documentation of the newsflashes, early effective reporting of an epidemic, {{keeping an eye on the}} outlaws and in many other field (we don‟t want to give more examples to avoid mind restriction). Nowadays, GPS and Internet connection are common among regular mobile phones users. It is mandatory to have a mobile phone equipped with GPS software and hardware in addition to internet connection to be able to use this application...|$|R

40|$|In Reply Dr. Ortiz and Dr. Romero-Quezada {{evaluated}} {{our study}} precisely and authors {{are grateful for}} their great survey on our article. There were some questions and concerns {{that we are going}} to answer. We wish it could help others to come up with better ideas and conclusions. 1. ACL tear may occur in two scenarios and we believe that there is not a third one: 1 st- the ACL injury functionally disables the patient and becomes symptomatic; in this scenario the patient would suffer from giving way and the “Lachman test” is definitely positive (3 + or 4 +) (1). Intra-operatively (post anesthesia) “Pivot shift test” is almost positive in all cases. 2 nd- ACL injury does not conflict with the patient’s routine and social activity and giving way are usually negative and Lachman test can be negative, 1 + and in the most severe condition 2 + positive. Partial ACL tear may be reported in MRI, however authors believe these cases do not benefit from a surgical intervention, and conservative treatment should be performed. 2. Although most of our patients were suffered from sports trauma, mechanisms of ACL tears were not the same in all patients. The duration between traumas to surgeries in all patients enrolled in this study were at least 6 weeks which were included the proceeding from acute trauma phase to performing physical therapy and accomplishing full range of motion pre-operatively. Since the present study was not about surgical technique and pre or post rehab protocols and programs, authors avoided such additional issues. 3. About Pethidine issue, this drug is the main protocol one in our hospital to provide analgesics for post-operative pain, so authors routinely decided to utilize the pethidine as analgesics such as recent relative article (2). We used the pethidine intravenously and by patient’s demand; if a patients requested for pain killers, we provided him/her with 0. 5 mg-per-Kg pethidine which was injected intravenously. The time and amount of requested pethidine for every patient were different and patient-dependent and were registered in the medical file for further evaluations. 4. Since randomization was performed prior to surgery, all eligible cases were first randomized in the intervention or control groups. So to our knowledge, primary demographic characteristics were better to contain all eligible case rather than those who remained in the trial. If we would demonstrated the data, as you had commented, one may object that the data is not complete and how can someone be sure about the randomization, so we prefer to put all the data. 5. The criticism about table 2 is correct. The table we have sent to the journal has been probably mis-typed during the publishing process. The original table is attached to the end of this manuscript. <b>Your</b> <b>comment</b> <b>about</b> the table 3 is correct again; it is the mean pethidine consumption during the first 6 and 24 hour (in milligrams). 6. The main purpose of this study is to apply another agent to decrease the opioid consumption after arthroscopic surgeries such as recent works (3, 4). It was the main reason of utilizing Gabapentin as an adjuvant to the pethidine to evaluate whether it could facilitate the decrease of opioid consumption and its complication. Finally authors wanted to show their appreciations to Dr. Ortiz and Dr. Romero-Quezada for their precise and meticulous comments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify ways in which people think about climate change and possible responses to it, and the value of events such as the Floating Land Festival. We invited artists, visitors to the Floating Land event and residents of Boreen Point to participate in a photovoice workshop. Participants were asked to take photos with their digital cameras about their perceptions of being at or living at the water’s edge in a time of uncertainty caused by climate change. Each of the 3 categories of participants then shared their photos in a small group and selected photos to present the group’s views to a wider audience {{on the last day of}} the festival.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of The Future of Children is to {{disseminate}} timely informationon major issues related to children’s well-being, with special emphasis on providing objective analysis and evaluation, translating existing knowledge into effective programs and policies, and promoting constructive institutional change. In attempting to achieve these objectives, we are targeting a multidisciplinary audience of national leaders, including policymakers, practitioners, legislators, executives, and professionals in {{the public and private}} sectors. This publication is intended to complement, not duplicate, the kind of technical analysis found in academic journals and the general coverage of children’s issues by the popular press and special interest groups. Home visiting in various forms has been proposed as an important component in delivering health, welfare, and education services to children and families. Information and misinformation about home visiting spans a number of disciplines and, therefore, it seemed a particularly appropriate subject for this journal. Our hope is that by providing a multidisciplinary perspective on home visiting as well as a critical analysis of what is known about its effectiveness and how best to design such programs, public policies incorporating this approach will {{have a better chance of}} improving the well-being of children. We invite your comments and suggestions as you read this issue of The Future of Children. Our intention is to encourage informed debate about this strategy for delivering services to children and families. To this end we invite correspondence to the Editor.

40|$|Students {{seeking to}} inspire in South Africa CUE: Our next report {{comes from the}} University of the North, in Pietersburg, South Africa. Lesibana Mantshiu spoke {{to some of the}} {{students}} there, about the problems facing young people who live in rural areas. Many of the students are involved in projects to improve the opportunities for rural people. We hear now from two of them, Grace Angel Mhlodi and Michael Mokwala, both students of agriculture, who have taken on the role of inspiring and teaching their fellow villagers about improved farming methods. The first interview is with Grace Angel; Lesibana asked her why she decided to study agriculture at university in the first place. IN:		?I was born and bred ? OUT:		? more especially in our economy. DUR?N	 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Michael Mokwala suggesting that local workshops could help more rural youth to profit from agriculture. Transcript Angel	I was born and bred in a township surrounded all over by rural areas, and almost everyday children from the rural areas come to the township to sell maize and even ? morokho?- I don?t know how to call it in English, but sort of vegetables. So I decided that maybe {{it would be better for}} me to acquire more skills in agriculture so that I can come back and implement at home, thereby improving or developing the rural community, in particular. Mantshiu	What projects have you been involved in so far? Angel	I was involved in projects mostly when I was a registered student already, always during holidays, we were at times urged to go to government places around our areas and look around any kind of agricultural project, and then you volunteer as a worker, thereby trying to gain information. At times we were working with extension officers, whereby you would find mostly women, most of them are single parents who didn?t have jobs, and didn?t even have husbands to work for them, so they had to depend on ploughing, and all those kind of things, and then make an income or a living out of the money produced from those vegetables. Mantshiu	If we talk presently what projects are you directly involved in? Angel	Presently I?m involved in a project conducting research on witchcraft. While working in the field, most women cannot work together, because they are pointing fingers at each other ?I cannot work with so-and-so. It?s a witch?, and they are not aware of contributing to their own poverty, because if they avoid each other you find that for a project to be sponsored, at least there should be a minimum of ten women, only to find that you will find two or one. And some are complaining about their plants not growing well because they?ve been bewitched, and all those kind of things. So now this project is helping me with how to handle such conditions, because while interviewing these people, they are somehow counselled. They become aware of the dangers they are causing among themselves. Mantshiu	Now lastly, Angel, what are your comments on the involvement of the youth, especially ladies, in agriculture? Angel	Most of our young ladies in particular, are having a problem of teenage pregnancies. From there they stop going to school, the parents can no longer afford to send them to school, while at the same time feeding their own children. So I think if some of us youth who have been trained, and have the necessary skills in agriculture, go implement these projects at home, and then put on or employ the youth around there, try to develop them. Maybe to encourage more and more of them to participate, you just have to perform and let everybody follow what you are doing, and not just point. Because if you point, these adults in most cases are not encouraged, are not motivated to work on their own, but if you are there with them, they learn from us and then they get motivated and work together. Mokwala	I became so interested in agriculture in the sense that, my grandfather was having so many cattle, but due to the fact of lack of education, some of them died due to the dryness of the places they were grazing. Mantshiu	Now since then have you ever been involved in an agricultural project, that taught you how to deal with cattle, sheep, grazing or anything of that type? Mokwala	There is a new project, which has been established in my village, and I hope from that project I?ll learn so many things. Mantshiu	What is the actual aim of the project? Mokwala	The actual aim is poultry. We are dealing with chickens, whereby we will be selling the chickens if they are big enough for us to sell them, outside our village, in order to gain an income, and also to extend that particular project for us to ask the youth to get employed in our project, which we have established at this present moment. Mantshiu	Now what are <b>your</b> <b>comments</b> <b>about</b> the involvement of the youth in agriculture, especially around your area? Mokwala	The youth in my area, are so interested in our project, but not all of them, as some they take agriculture as a very dirty job, whereby you have to look after chickens, sheep, cattle, they don?t have interest, but at least part of them they are having interest in that project. Mantshiu	Now what do you think can be done, Michael, so as to attract these youth into agriculture? Mokwala	I think that by conducting some workshops in our area, the youth might become interested in agriculture, as they will be seeing the importance of agriculture in general. It plays a very important role, more especially in our economy. End of tape. Two students from the University of the North in South Africa, describe their participation in projects, through which they are supporting rural development in their home areas, and improving their own farming practices. One of the students describes her work with women who are prevented from working together by their fears of witchcraft...|$|E
