25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to tell you is shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E

500|$|Week ten {{featured}} the Bears attempting to avoid suffering the first sweep by the Lions since 2007, while {{also trying to}} claim the division lead; {{the last time the}} two teams faced each other in a late-season game for the division lead was in 1991, which ended in a Chicago 20–10 win. However, the Bears had won the last five games against the Lions at Soldier Field. On November 7, Marc Trestman announced that Jay Cutler has been cleared by doctors to return against Detroit, despite having been projected to be out for approximately four weeks. Against the Lions, Cutler was 7–2, and won all four home games. On the offensive side, Jeff Joniak states that the Lions defensive line [...] "are ferocious up the middle, they are physical, and they make <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> poor technique," [...] but that [...] "there is growing confidence that the Bears offense is a resilient one;" [...] the Bears had the fewest pre-snap penalties in the league, and only one false start. The Bears could also seize the Lions' cornerback corps, which struggled during the season, allowing 11 plays of 40 yards or more, along with 4.7 yards per carry. Defensively, Sports Illustrated writers Chris Burke and Doug Farrar wrote the Bears must attempt to hinder Reggie Bush, and improve their performance from the previous week, when the Packers' running game ran for 190 yards and two touchdowns. The Bears also had to prevent Calvin Johnson from excelling; against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson recorded 329 receiving yards.|$|E

I left her for dead, and {{if there had been}} a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn't have come to life again. But it warn't Old Orlick as did it; it was you.

2500|$|Fulham coach Gaute Haugenes {{was glad}} to put the {{previous}} year's defeat by Arsenal behind them: [...] "The feeling we had here last year [...] we didn't {{want to have that}} again." [...] He added: [...] "It was a tough game but we expected a tough game. Many people put us as favourites but that is the price <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> being professional." [...] Midfielder Margunn Haugenes, the manager's wife, told Dagbladet that private celebrations in the Haugenes household were unfit for description in a newspaper.|$|E
2500|$|TV {{critic and}} {{columnist}} Charlie Brooker stated on his show, Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, his {{worry that the}} controversy {{would lead to a}} chilling effect on comedy, and that the BBC and others would self-censor too much in future. He {{went on to say that}} the attitude displayed by the complainants and the BBC's backing down would have, in earlier times, precluded the production of much of what was at the time edgy comedy and made culture poorer for it (citing Monty Python's Flying Circus, The Day Today and The Young Ones amongst others as shows that would have not been commissioned owing to their controversial content). While pouring scorn on those who had complained without seeing the programme, and attacking newspapers that attempted to stir up further controversy (in particular the Daily Mail), he did not appear to defend Brand and Ross in particular, stating that the possibility of people being offended by some misjudged humour is [...] "the price <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> freedom of speech." [...] In a further column in The Guardian, he reiterated this point as well as saying that [...] "people who retrospectively complain to Ofcom about material they've only read about second-hand are, in essence, a bunch of sanctimonious crybabies indulging in a wretched form of masturbation." ...|$|E
