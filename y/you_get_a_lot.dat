500|$|Joel Bullock from The Coaster Critic and Mike from NewsPlusNotes both {{praised the}} g-forces {{experienced}} while {{going through the}} helix, {{and the amount of}} airtime Goliath has. Bullock described Goliath as, [...] "not only the park’s best roller coaster, but arguably the best coaster in the South East (south of Virginia)." [...] Mike Collins from Coaster Radio particularly enjoyed the section of the roller coaster that takes riders outside of the park boundaries. He also said that, [...] " [...] a fun and fast coaster. It’s all about the airtime... and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} on the show in series 6, Richard Herring wrote on his blog: [...] "What a delightful and fascinating programme this is (and one that I think might benefit from an extended podcast release - two hours of material is recorded for the 27 minute show and it's pretty much all gold!). At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that I {{was meant to be}} taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love the way it has a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E

Kahne produced [...] "That Girl", {{to which}} Green provided additional production and was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. U4L produced [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass", which was mixed by Green. Asked about {{the choice of}} using several producers, Barakat said [...] "We're all about using multiple producers on our records. ... I'm not 100% into the one producer/one record thing because <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the same sounding songs. It's cool to {{have a bunch of}} variety." [...] Gaskarth added [...] "working with a lot of different producers is good, because it pulls you in all kinds of new directions." [...] He added that, similar to Nothing Personal, they [...] "kinda split up the [...] with different producers that we wanted to work with in the past, but for scheduling or monetary reasons, we couldn’t lock them in for the whole record." ...|$|E

Caption: "One gripe of the youngsters {{attending}} the annual leadership conference of the Future Business Leaders of America held at the Skirvin Hotel is the reluctance of employers to hire persons who are not experienced.

60|$|At {{one time}} they {{got the idea that}} what the public wanted was not {{anything}} instructive but something light and amusing. Mullins said that people loved to laugh. He said that if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people all together and get them laughing {{you can do anything you}} like with them. Once they start to laugh they are lost. So they got Mr. Dreery, the English Literature teacher at the high school, to give an evening of readings from the Great Humorists from Chaucer to Adam Smith. They came mighty near to making a barrel of money out of that. If the people had once started laughing it would have been all over with them. As it was I heard a lot of them say that they simply wanted to scream with laughter: they said they just felt like bursting into peals of laughter all the time. Even when, in the more subtle parts, they didn't feel like bursting out laughing, they said they had all they could do to keep from smiling. They said they never had such a hard struggle in their lives not to smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is the way," [...] {{said the}} boy who had studied mechanics. [...] "You take a saw, and then, about two feet from the ground, you begin and saw down diagonally, for {{a foot and a}} half, to the centre of the trunk. Then you go on the other side, and saw down in the same way, the two outs meeting each other. Now you have {{the upper part of the}} trunk ending in a wedge, which fits into a cleft in the lower part of the trunk. Then, about nine inches below the place where you first began to saw, you bore a hole {{straight}} through both sides of the cleft and the wedge between them. Then you put an iron bolt through this hole, and you have your tree on a hinge, only she wont be apt to move because she fits in so snug and tight. Then you get a long rope, and put one end in a slipknot loosely around the trunk. Then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of poles, and tie them end to end, and push this slip-knot up until it is somewhere near the top, when you pull it tight. Then you take another rope with a slip-knot, and push this a little more than half-way up the trunk. By having two ropes, that way, you prevent too much strain coming on any one part of the trunk. Then, after that, you take a mallet and chisel and round off the lower corners of the wedge, so that it will turn easily in the cleft. Then we take hold of the ropes, let her down gently, pick off the fruit, and haul her up again. That will all be easy enough." ...|$|E

When you look after three pairs of twins <b>you</b> {{naturally}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of experience. They all had croup regularly.

5000|$|About {{the name}} [...] "The Moth Gatherer" [...] Alex commented in an interview: [...] "When you lose someone, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of things in}} your world is upside down, and it’s hard to see {{something}} positive. <b>You</b> also <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of questions about why? More or less, we fumble in darkness. Moths always searches for a source of light, like you do. So for me, the name stands for a search for hope. [...] " ...|$|R
5000|$|Lockyer {{was also}} quoted as telling Democratic legislators that, [...] "fair or not", angry voters blamed them for [...] "12 years of flowing red ink". [...] "Why don't {{you start with}} the {{realization}} that probably none of {{you are going to be}} back here next year?", after the 2010 elections. [...] "You're not going to get reelected.

5000|$|Maddux credits Pole {{as a major}} influence, and a {{significant}} contributor to his success. In a 2005 interview, he said, [...] "I remember when Dick Pole told me one day, 'Why don't you stop trying to strike guys out?

5000|$|Holmes {{was soon}} {{on the covers}} of {{magazines}} such as Seventeen, TV Guide, and Rolling Stone.

Sure, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to do, but not many ways to do it.
