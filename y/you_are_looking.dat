500|$|Gaga {{announced}} [...] "You and I" [...] as {{the fourth}} single from Born This Way on July 22, 2011. Its cover, released on August 5, 2011, via TwitPic, {{was accompanied by}} the line: [...] "You will never find what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for in love, if you don't love yourself." [...] It features two black-and-white images of Gaga's male alter ego Jo Calderone smoking a cigarette and sporting sideburns. The Calderone character made a previous appearance in June 2011, when Gaga posed as him in London {{for a series of}} photos by photographer Nick Knight, arranged by stylist Nicola Formichetti. One shot features him wearing a blazer and white T-shirt with his head down smoking a cigarette. The other image is of Jo Calderone in silhouette exhaling a cloud of smoke.|$|E
500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, but all I know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E

500|$|British Open Championship Golf was a {{commercial}} failure. Following its release, Looking Glass ceased self-publishing operations and closed {{a division of}} the company, laying off a group of employees that included Warren Spector. Writing for Maximum PC, T. Liam McDonald called the game [...] "a costly bomb that bled the company." [...] Looking Glass employee Tim Stellmach later characterized it as [...] "a disaster". However, it was generally well received by critics. A reviewer for Next Generation Magazine hailed it as [...] "one of the best golf games in years", praising the atmosphere and calling the graphics [...] "among the best ... around." [...] The writer cited the game's lack of a course editor as its main downside, and summarized, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for a golf simulation, this one delivers." [...] PC Magazines Shane Mooney cited it as the best of eight golf titles reviewed in the magazine's September 1997 issue—a group that included Jack Nicklaus 4, Links LS 1998 and PGA Tour Pro. He highlighted its [...] "outstanding graphics" [...] and detailed course reproductions, and noted that it [...] " [...] players in a realistic tournament atmosphere." [...] The writer considered the inclusion of only two courses to be the game's [...] "one major drawback".|$|E
500|$|Play Magazine {{noted that}} [...] "they've caressed {{the music to}} great effect, made the bosses a bit more challenging, [...] adhered to a massive replayability {{standard}} that would drive any developer to drink." [...] Game Informer felt that [...] "every little morsel of platforming goodness in The Wrath of Cortex {{has already been done}} to death on the Playstation." [...] Carlos McElfish of GameZone warned that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for an innovative and original experience that does justice to the series you’ll have to look elsewhere." [...] Official Xbox Magazine concluded that [...] "this is a game for those who want what Crash has always had to offer – good graphics, jump-and-spin gameplay, and tons of collectible items. Nothing more, nothing less." [...] Hilary Goldstein felt that while Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was [...] "a fun game for the most part," [...] "it fails in some areas, like proper game balance and correct use of surround sound." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro concluded that [...] "love it or hate it, Wrath of Cortex Xbox is more of more of the same." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that [...] "save for a few additions to WOC, like some cool hamster-ball levels, it's almost identical to its predecessors." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Landcruisin {{garnered}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Pitchfork Medias Marc Hogan opined that the song [...] "both {{lives up to}} the expectations and sidesteps them", writing: [...] "With a sound like this, why stay on land?" [...] Similarly, Collin Brennan, of Consequence of Sound, said it was [...] "totally worth all the buzz", and Stereogum writer James Rettig dubbed the track: [...] "more than good enough on its own, an enticing and theatrical piece of futuristic pop music". Fact published a review of [...] "Landcruisin, to which five journalists contributed with commentary, and their score out of 10 points. Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy and Tayyab Amin awarded it a rating of 9– the latter deemed it [...] "wonderfully complete", whereas Montesinos-Donaghy stated: [...] " [...] has a Technicolour ambition held within its blog-cycle frame, and Paul sounds as eager as possible to outgrow his frame as soon as possible." [...] Aurora Mitchell of the same publication explained her score of 8 by saying she was [...] "definitely here for it". With respective ratings of 5 and 6, Chris Kelly and Son Raw were more critical of the song– both negatively compared A.K. Paul's artistry to that of Jai, as Kelly called the single [...] "fun but forgettable" [...] and Raw quipped: [...] "this is not the Paul <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for, move along." [...] It entered the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart on the week ending 9 April 2016, at number 12.|$|E

500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you to believe that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of your bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but seem to work with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by commentators; some reviewers praised it for its composition, while other critics {{felt that the}} lyrics were not profound. Billboard Chuck Taylor called the song [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and praised its instrumentation for being different [...] "from the scores of adolescent thrust-rockers currently dominating the scene." [...] Dubbing it [...] "elegant, timeless pop/rock", Taylor qualified it as [...] "one of the great discoveries of the year", while Pete Waterman, writing for The Guardian in 2007, stated it was [...] "one of [...] favourite songs of recent years". Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant [...] classified it as the best track on the album, while Erlewine called it [...] "the template {{for the rest of}} his debut". In contrast, Wilson Kung said the song [...] "pales in comparison to some of the truly strong songs" [...] on the album Daniel Powter. Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine said it is a typical sentimental song but that in [...] "Bad Day"'s case [...] "there's even less detail". He said the song [...] "is so low on the specifics, there are some couplets that feel like they've been translated from a foreign language, possibly by a computer". A writer for The Daily Edge called it [...] "a song so sweet it gave you a toothache", while a reviewer from The Scotsman called it a [...] "horrible song". Bill Lamb said it [...] "feels genuine" [...] but [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for depth, this is not your song", Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times said the song is [...] "baleful but soulful", and People commented: [...] "'Bad Day' may be catchy enough to overcome its trite lyrics".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2006, {{emergency}} contraception expert Anna Glasier wrote a BMJ editorial entitled [...] "Emergency Contraception. Is it worth all the fuss?" [...] that said in closing: [...] "So is {{emergency contraception}} worth the fuss? If {{you are a}} woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the CMAJ’s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it." ...|$|E
