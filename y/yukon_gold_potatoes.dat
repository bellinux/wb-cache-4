In addition it also has the H 1 gene present which confers resistance to the potato cyst nematode, Globodera rostochiensis, which has been confirmed by bioassay to pathotype Ro 1. The size profile of Huckleberry Gold is smaller than <b>Yukon</b> <b>Gold,</b> allowing a better fit into specialty markets that are geared to smaller size for fresh use.
