25|$|The {{earliest}} {{accounts of}} Blue Licks {{describe it as}} a place where animals gathered to lick the salt deposits flowing from the springs in the area. The Reverend James Smith provides this account in his 1795–97 diary: As <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the Licks, at the distance of 4 or 5 miles from it, you begin to perceive the change. The earth seems to be worn away; the roots of the trees lie naked and bare; the rocks forsaken of the earth, that once covered them, lie naked on the neighboring hills, and roads of an amazing size, in all directions, unite at the Licks, as their common center. Here immense herds of buffalo used formerly to meet and with their fighting, scraping etc., have worn away the ground to what it is at present.|$|E
500|$|Aether is a space {{adventure}} {{game with}} washed-out pastel colors and a varying soundtrack {{consisting of a}} piano, synthesizer, guitar, and percussion piece. There are four monochrome planets to explore, which have subdued hues. Players control a lonely boy from Earth and an octopus-like monster he befriends. The monster's tongue is used to propel itself and the boy through space and onto other planets. Each planet has a unique soundtrack that gets louder as <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> it. Each moon or planet exerts gravity over the player character, requiring momentum {{to escape from the}} planet's orbit. To escape a planet, the tongue must first be latched onto a cloud floating above the planet's surface, which can then be used to swing the player around. By propelling themselves from the initial cloud using swinging momentum, players can latch onto the next and repeat the process to leave the planet's orbit. After reaching space the process is repeated with stars and asteroids. In space the lack of gravity causes the player to drift until the direction is changed by swinging on another object.|$|E

"On the bench, {{swivelling}} {{his body}} away as <b>you</b> <b>approach,</b> chary of words when not downright hostile, Sean Kelly remains for a journalist the hardest {{of the great}} riders to fathom. In an age when most of his brethren rate themselves, and are paid, according {{to the amount of}} publicity inches they have gleaned in a season, this farmer's son... remains very much the exception, closed, withdrawn, and extremely suspicious. Yet one has only to look at him joking with Stephen Roche, or know the respect with which he is held by the peloton, to see that he gets along very well without us." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prosthetics {{designers}} should {{carefully consider}} {{the nature of}} dimensionality alteration of sensorimotor signaling from and to the CNS when designing prothesitic devices. As reported in literatures, neural signaling from the CNS to the motors is organized {{in a way that}} the dimensionalities of the signals are gradually increased as <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the muscles, also called muscle synergies. In the same principal, but in opposite ordering, on the other hand, signals dimensionalities from the sensory receptors are gradually integrated, also called sensory synergies, as they approaches the CNS. This bow tie like signaling formation enables the CNS to process abstract yet valuable information only. Such as process will decrease complexity of the data, handle the noises and guarantee to the CNS the optimum energy consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Walrus {{are often}} hunted {{during the winter}} and spring since hunting them in summer is much more dangerous. A walrus is too large to be {{controlled}} by one man, so it cannot be hunted alone. In Uqalurait: An Oral History of Nunavut, an Inuit elder describes the hunt of a walrus in these words: [...] "When a walrus was sighted, the two hunters would run to get close to it and at a short distance it is necessary to stop when the walrus's head was submerged... the walrus would hear <b>you</b> <b>approach.</b> [...] then tried to get in front of the walrus and it was harpooned while its head was submerged. In the meantime, the other person would drive the harpoon into the ice through the harpoon loop to secure it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heather Phares {{opined that}} [...] "Danilova's throatily majestic voice" [...] is [...] "as unmistakable as ever. Her {{instrument}} is undeniably powerful, and more controlled here {{than it was}} before", but still demonstrates [...] "remarkable rawness and vulnerability". Sam Shepherd wrote that [...] "er voice is so unique and haunting that it is instantly recognisable." [...] Brian Howe of Pitchfork commented, [...] "Whatever biosphere you choose to project on it , Danilova's voice remains fixed on a faraway horizon, receding as <b>you</b> <b>approach.</b> When she bursts into the foreground on 'Avalanche' and stays there {{for the remainder of}} the album, the impression of impassable distance lingers. This is partly because of the authority of Danilova's voice, and partly because the music gives nothing away, thrumming along with power that shades into ambivalence toward the shifting emotional register of the singing. The results are dramatic but never melodramatic, as Danilova maps the dimensions of her self-imprisonment with resolve." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later Hearthstone card {{expansions}} {{have also}} been well received. Game Informer rated the Curse of Naxxramas expansion 9/10, stating [...] "Naxxramas is an excellent addition to the core game, and an exploration of sorts to examine the potential for additional single-player Hearthstone content [...] the adventure provides {{a substantial amount of}} new content that spills over into ranked, casual, and arena mode and changes how <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> the game." [...] PC Gamer found that [...] " [...] a much-needed and fun refresher for Blizzard’s card battler", however [...] "the next card expansion will need to be more sizeable", rating it 78/100. Reception for Goblins vs. Gnomes has also been positive, with Game Informer writing [...] "the first expansion set for Hearthstone is a major step forward for the already accessible and fun game", and awarding it a score of 9.25/10, while Eurogamer scored it an 8/10, writing [...] "whatever happens to Hearthstone in the future, the new content has stumbled a little by strengthening certain deck archetypes that needed no such help [...] it's re-introduced a thoughtfulness to play that's been absent for too long." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Temple family fortune {{was based}} on sheep farming, they were first {{recorded}} as such at Witney in Oxfordshire.

The Stowe estate was leased from Thomas Gifford in 1571 by Peter Temple, his son John Temple bought the manor and estate of Stowe in 1589 and it became {{the home of the}} Temple family. In the late 17th century, the house was completely rebuilt by Sir Richard Temple, 3rd Baronet, (c.1683) on the present site. This house is now the core of the mansion known today. The old medieval stronghold was located near Stowe Parish Church that is about 100 yards to the south-east of the current house. Having been redesigned subsequently over the years, the whole front is now [...] in length and can be seen as <b>you</b> <b>approach</b> from the direction of Buckingham. A long, straight driveway ran from Buckingham {{all the way to the}} front of the house, passing through a [...] Corinthian arch on the brow of the hill on the way. The driveway approach to the house is still in use today, although it no longer runs through the arch.|$|E
