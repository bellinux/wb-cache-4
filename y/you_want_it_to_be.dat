In one characteristic excerpt she said that, [...] "There's a feeling of movement in telling a story {{and there is a}} flow. A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and you will feel it, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like that. On Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E

It was made at the purpose built factory in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, under a government initiative to bring employment to the area.|$|E
2500|$|Sir , {{you will}} see that they want to place the word [...] "East Pakistan" [...] instead of [...] "East Bengal." [...] We had demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word [...] "Bengal" [...] has a history, has a {{tradition}} of its own. You can change it only after the people have been consulted. So far as the question of One Unit is concerned it can come in the Constitution. Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken up just now? What about the state language, Bengali? We will be prepared to consider one-unit with all these things. So I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.|$|E

[...] "Part of me, I pulled into victory lane and I pinched myself once to make sure I wasn't dreaming. These are nights you don't forget as a driver and you live for. The Miller Lite Ford Fusion was just flying, and this is I'm couldn't ask for a better way to enter the Chase than to win and take the first seed. We're ready. We want to run for another Cup.

2500|$|Dare {{was almost}} universally {{critically}} acclaimed in the UK, and featured {{strongly in the}} year end polls for 1981. In Melody Maker Steve Sutherland celebrated the fact the album would irritate the guitar-rock traditionalists, saying, [...] "All let's-pretend-pompous it's cornily consistent, cultured, crude, elegant, cheap... anything <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Me? I think it's a masterpiece. Sure to upset some, sell to millions more and so it should the way it tramps all over rock traditions. A trite sound, a retarded glam image and a mock respect. All the appeal in the world... Dare should show up the pathetic farce of pop mythology once and for all." [...] Smash Hits critic David Hepworth called it [...] "chock-full of precise, memorable melodies delivered with style and humour". Noted music critic Paul Morley wrote in the NME, [...] "Dare is the second intoxicating intervention to be produced out of the great split , and already it's the first Human League greatest hits collection... Much more than ABBA or whoever you like, The Human League signify that deliciously serious, sincerely disposable MOR music can possess style, quality and sophistication... I think that Dare {{is one of the}} GREAT popular music LPs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

5000|$|On directing, Stewart {{noted on}} Lazarus's show that [...] "The Daily Show" [...] {{influenced}} his directing process {{more than his}} acting gigs did. He said, [...] "It's about the collaboration. It's about understanding. Doing a show taught me this process of clarity of vision, but flexibility of process. So know your intention, know where you're wanting {{to go with the}} scene with the way that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> go, the momentum shifts, the emphasis, where <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be."
