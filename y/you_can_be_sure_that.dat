2500|$|On the one hand, {{film and}} {{television}} producers seem to find Catholicism irresistible. There {{are a number of}} reasons for this. First, more than any other Christian denomination, the Catholic Church is supremely visual, and therefore attractive to producers and directors concerned with the visual image. Vestments, monstrances, statues, crucifixes – {{to say nothing of the}} symbols of the sacraments – are all things that more [...] "word oriented" [...] Christian denominations have foregone. The Catholic Church, therefore, lends itself perfectly to the visual media of {{film and television}}. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> any movie about the Second Coming or Satan or demonic possession or, for that matter, any sort of irruption of the transcendent into everyday life, will choose the Catholic Church as its venue. (See, for example, [...] "End of Days," [...] "Dogma" [...] or [...] "Stigmata.") ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the lynching on October 16, 2000, Riccardo Cristiano, {{the deputy}} {{head of the}} Jerusalem bureau of Italy's state {{television}} channel RAI, published a letter (...) in Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority (PA). In the letter (entitled [...] "Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident {{and that one of}} the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, [...] "We [...] emphasize to all of you that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work." [...] The Italian correspondent also praised the PA, declaring, [...] "We congratulate you [...] and think that it is our duty to put you in the picture (of the events) of what happened on October 12 in Ramallah.... We thank you for your trust, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this is not our way of acting. We do not (will not) do such a thing." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{other places}} people {{operated}} on a patient's mind, {{without saying a}} word to him, and cured him. In others, experts assembled patients in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and those patients went away cured. Wherever you find a king who can't cure the king's-evil <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the most valuable superstition that supports his throne--the subject's belief in the divine appointment of his sovereign--has passed away. In my youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil, but there was no occasion for this diffidence: they could have cured it forty-nine times in fifty.|$|E
60|$|Servants.--Nature of Engagements.--The general duties that {{a servant}} should be bound to, {{independently}} of those {{for which he}} is specially engaged, are--under penalty of his pay being stopped, and, it may be, of dismissal--to maintain discipline, take share of camp-duties and night-watch, and do all in his power to promote the success of the expedition. His wages should not be payable to him in full, till the return of the party to the town from which it started, or to some other civilised place. It is best that all clothing, bedding, etc., that the men may require, should be issued out and given to them as a present, and that none of their own old clothes should be allowed to be taken. They are more careful of what is their own; and, by supplying the things yourself, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they are good in quality, uniform in appearance, and equal in weight, while this last is ascertainable.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} mode, you {{begin with a}} {{definition}}, and that definition is necessarily assumed as the truth. As the argument proceeds, the conclusion from the first proposition becomes {{the base of the}} second, and so on. Now, it is quite impossible that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you have included all the necessary, and none but the necessary, terms in your definition; as, therefore, you proceed, the original speck of error is multiplied at every remove; the same infirmity of knowledge besetting each successive definition. Hence you may set out, like Spinosa, with all but the truth, and end with a conclusion which is altogether monstrous; and yet the mere deduction shall be irrefragable. Warburton's [...] "Divine Legation" [...] is also a splendid instance of this mode of discussion, and of its inability to lead to the truth: in fact, it is an attempt to adopt the mathematical series of proof, in forgetfulness that the mathematician is sure of the truth of his definition at each remove, because he creates it, as he can do, in pure figure and number. But you cannot make any thing true which results from, or is connected with, real externals; you can only find it out. The chief use of this first mode of discussion is to sharpen the wit, for which purpose it is the best exercitation.|$|E
