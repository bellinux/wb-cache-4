When nearly all our {{officers}} were gone, we had a man come out--a man called Margeritson, from India--big merchant people out there. They all said he was no good--not a bit of good--nervous chap.

6000|$|... 67. It is an evil {{precisely}} {{similar in}} kind {{to that which}} existed in the Middle Ages, respecting good books, and which everybody then, I suppose, thought as natural as we do now our small supply of good pictures. You could not then study {{the work of a}} great historian, or great poet, any more than you can now study that of a great painter, but at heavy cost. If you wanted a book, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it written out for you, or to write it out for yourself. But printing came, and the poor man may read his Dante and his Homer; and Dante and Homer are none the worse for that. But it is only in literature that private persons of moderate fortune can possess and study greatness: they can study at home no greatness in art; and the object of that accumulation which we are at present aiming at, as our third object in political economy, is to bring great art in some degree within the reach of the multitude; and, both in larger and more numerous galleries than we now possess, and by distribution, according to his wealth and wish, in each man's home, to render the influence of art somewhat correspondent in extent to that of literature. Here, then, is the subtle balance which your economist has to strike: to accumulate so much art as {{to be able to give}} the whole nation a supply of it, according to its need, and yet to regulate its distribution so that there shall be no glut of it, nor contempt.|$|E

How am I to mince small when it's all mixed up and running? 'Put a piece of butter {{the size of your}} thumb into the frying-pan.'--Look at my thumb, and look at yours! whose size does she mean? 'Boil, but not brown.'--If it mustn't be brown, what color must it be? She won't tell me; she expects me to know, and I don't. 'Pour in the omelette.'--There! I can do that. 'Allow it to set, raise it round the edge; when done, turn it over to double it.'--Oh, the number of times I turned it over and doubled it in my head, before you came in to-night! 'Keep it soft; put the dish on the frying-pan, and turn it over.' Which am I to turn over--oh, mercy, try the cold towel again, and tell me which--the dish or the frying-pan?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{temperature}} in the engine-room had gone up to a hundred and seventeen degrees. Irritated voices were ascending through the skylight and through the fiddle of the stokehold in a harsh and resonant uproar, mingled with angry clangs and scrapes of metal, as if men with limbs of iron and throats of bronze had been quarrelling down there. The second engineer was falling foul of the stokers for letting the steam go down. He {{was a man with}} arms like a blacksmith, and generally feared; but that afternoon the stokers were answering him back recklessly, and slammed the furnace doors with the fury of despair. Then the noise ceased suddenly, and the second engineer appeared, emerging out of the stokehold streaked with grime and soaking wet like a chimney-sweep coming out of a well. As soon as his head was clear of the fiddle he began to scold Jukes for not trimming properly the stokehold ventilators; and in answer Jukes made with his hands deprecatory soothing signs meaning: [...] "No wind--can't be helped--you can see for yourself." [...] But the other wouldn't hear reason. His teeth flashed angrily in his dirty face. He didn't mind, he said, the trouble of punching their blanked heads down there, blank his soul, but did the condemned sailors think you could keep steam up in the God-forsaken boilers simply by knocking the blanked stokers about? No, by George! <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some draught, too--may he be everlastingly blanked for a swab-headed deck-hand if you didn't! And the chief, too, rampaging before the steam-gauge and carrying on like a lunatic up and down the engine-room ever since noon. What did Jukes think he was stuck up there for, if he couldn't get one of his decayed, good-for-nothing deck-cripples to turn the ventilators to the wind? ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have said}} that in these days Sherringham {{wondered}} about many things, {{and by the time}} his leave of absence came this practice had produced a particular speculation. He was surprised that he shouldn't be in love with Miriam Rooth and considered at moments of leisure the causes of his exemption. He had felt from the first that she was a [...] "nature," [...] and each time she met his eyes it seemed to come to him straighter that her beauty was rare. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the good view of her face, but when you did so it was a splendid mobile mask. And the wearer of this high ornament had frankness and courage and variety--no end of the unusual and the unexpected. She had qualities that seldom went together--impulses and shynesses, audacities and lapses, something coarse, popular, and strong all intermingled with disdains and languors and nerves. And then above all she was there, was accessible, almost belonged to him. He reflected ingeniously that he owed his escape to a peculiar cause--to {{the fact that they had}} together a positive outside object. Objective, as it were, was all their communion; not personal and selfish, but a matter of art and business and discussion. Discussion had saved him and would save him further, for they would always have something to quarrel about. Sherringham, who was not a diplomatist for nothing, who had his reasons for steering straight and wished neither to deprive the British public of a rising star nor to exchange his actual situation for that of a yoked impresario, blessed the beneficence, the salubrity, the pure exorcism of art. At the same time, rather inconsistently and feeling that he had a completer vision than before of that oddest of animals the artist who happens to have been born a woman, he felt warned against a serious connexion--he made a great point of the [...] "serious"--with so slippery and ticklish a creature. The two ladies had only to stay in Paris, save their candle-ends and, as Madame Carré had enjoined, practise their scales: there were apparently no autumn visits to English country-houses in prospect for Mrs. Rooth. Peter parted with them on the understanding that in London he would look as thoroughly as possible into the question of an engagement. The day before he began his holiday he went to see Madame Carré, who said to him, [...] "Vous devriez bien nous la laisser." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meantime, {{returning}} to our immediate subject, I say to my generous hearers, who want to shower Titians and Turners upon us, like falling leaves, [...] "Pictures {{ought not to be}} too cheap;" [...] but in much stronger tone I would say to those who want to keep up the prices of pictorial property, that pictures ought not to be too dear, that is to say, not as dear as they are. For, as matters at present stand, it is wholly impossible for any man in the ordinary circumstances of English life to possess himself of a piece of great art. A modern drawing of average merit, or a first-class engraving, may perhaps, not without some self-reproach, be purchased out of his savings by a man of narrow income; but a satisfactory example of first-rate art--masterhands' work--is wholly out of his reach. And we are so accustomed to look upon this as the natural course and necessity of things, that we never set ourselves in any wise to diminish the evil; and yet it is an evil perfectly capable of diminution. It is an evil precisely similar in kind to that which existed in the middle ages, respecting good books, and which everybody then, I suppose, thought as natural as we do now our small supply of good pictures. You could not then study the work of a great historian, or great poet, any more than you can now study that of a great painter, but at heavy cost.

50|$|Orange County Astronomers (OCA) started life in 1967 when a {{small group}} of intrepid amateur astronomers got {{together}} to form a club. Those were the days when an amateur built his own telescope, usually a Newtonian reflector. It was a laborious process of grinding a mirror to as close to a 1/4 wave as you could get. Then you built the tube and assembly so you could actually search out a dark patch of sky to look up at the stars. It helped to know about stepping motors and who was building the best drives to keep your telescope tracking your object. And that was another thing - <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on intimate terms with the night skies for all seasons. That was a daunting task for many and proved to be a barrier to many but the most dedicated observer.|$|E

An orangutan named Manis {{was brought in to}} play Clyde; also cast were Geoffrey Lewis as the dimwitted Orville, Beverly D'Angelo as his girlfriend, and Sondra Locke as Lynn Halsey-Taylor, the country and western barroom singer.
