25|$|The {{script was}} {{developed}} by recording songs beforehand; much of the songs in the play were previously recorded for other albums, including Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Is and Ship Arriving Too Late To Save A Drowning Witch. New vocals were combined with previously released tracks and new Synclavier music. In addition to the new songs, the previously recorded songs include new overdubs moving this storyline forward. As the recording process continued, Zappa brought in revised scripts and improved the work by editing or changing aspects with which he was dissatisfied.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Savoy Truffle" [...] as {{a tribute}} to Clapton's {{chocolate}} addiction. He derived the title and much of the lyrics from a box of Mackintosh's Good News chocolates, which Clapton began eating during one of his visits to Harrison's home. Many of the confectionery names used in the song are authentic; others, such as cherry cream, coconut fudge and pineapple heart, were Harrison's invention, based on the flavours listed inside the lid of the box. For the lyrics to the second of the song's middle eight sections, Harrison received assistance from Derek Taylor, the press officer for the Beatles' new record label, Apple Records. In keeping with the theme of Harrison's composition, Taylor drew inspiration from the title of the American counterculture film <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Eat, which was itself titled after a fashionable macrobiotic slogan.|$|E
500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but you know what, I {{think this is a}} better fit for you. I think you should rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{same year}} the double album <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Is was released. Most {{of it was}} {{recorded}} in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with the Reagan era and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|E
500|$|MTV {{stated that}} [...] "'Dress' {{continues}} [...] {{return to the}} soulful old-school sounds he championed in his early work" [...] and that [...] "West works an easy flow over the midtempo joint replete with feathery falsetto backing vocals an overall buttery '70s feel. Despite the laidback groove, West shows his vulnerable side, as he laments being loved and left." [...] "Devil in a New Dress" [...] contains lyrics about lust and heartache, with sexual and religious imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". Rap-Up called it a [...] "female-focused song" [...] and a [...] "soulful track, boasting a slow-rolling beat with a haunting vocal sample.” Alex Koening of Knightnews wrote [...] "over piano flourishes and a scintillating string section contain some of the funniest tongue-in-cheek lyrics about women Kanye ever managed: 'I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat/ I ordered the jerk, she said <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> eat.' Kanye might be on his quest for love, but he still isn’t able to tolerate gold-digging girls who are only after his cash: 'And outta all the colors that are still up the skies/ You got green on your mind, I {{can see it in}} your eyes.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} {{constructed}} during the recording sessions, which included producing new overdubs for recordings which previously appeared on Zappa's albums Zoot Allures, Tinseltown Rebellion, <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Is and Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch. [...] The {{release of the}} album was delayed when Barking Pumpkin Records' previous distributor, MCA, refused to distribute the album. It was instead released by Capitol Records in the United States, accompanied by a [...] "Warning/Guarantee" [...] written by Zappa himself. Thing-Fish was initially received poorly by critics, who criticized the use of previously recorded material, but has since been reappraised for its highly satirical content.|$|E

He ended AAB and began a new solo project; the year saw the release of a cassette-only single {{entitled}} Room to Breathe on Hanson Records. A follow-up release entitled <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Eat was scrapped when the master recordings went missing. W.K. also recorded the soundtrack for an independent film named Poltergeist made by Aaron Dilloway and himself, one track of which appeared on the Hanson Records compilation Labyrinths & Jokes.

2500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} both Accardi and Lacey, are more {{abstract}} compared {{to many of}} those featured on previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. While Accardi had previously had some involvement in writing lyrics, Daisy saw him contribute far more compared to previous albums. Accardi and Lacey both affirmed {{that there had been}} no conscious decision made by the band on Accardi writing more. Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks. During writing, both Lacey and Accardi had unintentionally begun to reuse certain themes and imagery, such as nature and forests, as well as lyrics relating to an absence of love. Lacey also used his writing as a means of venting anxieties, comparing it to therapy proclaiming [...] "Daisy was just the venting of anxiety, of letting go and doing the right thing for us personally and as a band. It’s a very hard way to do something but it is the best way. There’s a lot of pent up emotion that goes into owning up to who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> are doing and the choices you are making so Daisy was us rejoicing in that".|$|E

MTV reported that T.I. confirmed collaborations from Lady Gaga, Kid Rock, Young Dro, Mac Boney and Eminem.
