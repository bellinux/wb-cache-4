"Follow Me Home" [...] {{was written}} by the Sugababes—Keisha Buchanan, Mutya Buena, and Heidi Range—in {{collaboration}} with Jonathan Lipsey, Karen Poole, and Jeremy Shaw, for the group's fourth studio album, Taller in More Ways (2005). Lipsey developed {{the idea of a}} close person as the song's inspiration. Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia, who was born in March 2005. While writing the verse, she pondered questions such as 'What would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her if she was ever in trouble?', and 'How would you say, I’ll always be there for you?'. Buena wanted people to interpret the verse in different ways, and stated that the lyrics came naturally. Buchanan drew inspiration from her close friend when she wrote the other verse. Lipsey produced the song under his production name Jony Rockstar. [...] "Follow Me Home" [...] was mixed and engineered at Metropolis Studios by Tom Elmhirst and Richard Wilkinson, respectively.|$|E

The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, what do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> a bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line {{at the beginning of the}} song. After [...] "Look at Me" [...] peaked only at number two, her record company wanted her to release [...] "Lift Me Up", while the Absolute team wanted [...] "Bag It Up", but she chose to release [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] after receiving good reception from children.
