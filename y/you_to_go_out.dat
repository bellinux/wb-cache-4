6000|$|... "Quite well, grampa, {{and very}} happy; but I do wish {{so much that}} you were here. Oh. it would be so nice to have <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> with every day!" ...|$|E

60|$|KEITH. Now listen, Larry. When {{you leave}} here, go {{straight}} home, {{and stay there}} till I give <b>you</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again. Promise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} will not go round by Flushing now? It will be shorter for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{straight}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea through the islands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{and smoke}} or something?" [...] she asked calmly. [...] "I {{do not feel}} like talking at all. The music is wonderful!" ...|$|R

3000|$|<b>You</b> want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>go</b> {{have a good}} time, do it; <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> gamble, do it, {{just not}} {{at the expense of other}} people. (Peter, Unemployed, 19  years old) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{believed}} so and his wide--experience--gives a special value to his counsel. You will {{write to me}} once a week, {{and when you have}} had your dinner get to bed at once. On no account are <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> into the streets. Goodbye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> Ruth," [...] Dr. Arrowsmith said, when {{he reached}} her after the jury had retired. [...] "They may be {{an hour or more}} before they make up their minds. You are as white as death, child. Let me lead you out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It won't do {{any good}} for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again," [...] said Mr. Endicott. [...] "I'll go out, and so will most of the hands. You can remain here with Mrs. Endicott, who is very nervous because of the storm {{and the absence of}} Belle." ...|$|E

When I see you, my dear Watson, with a week's {{accumulation}} of dust upon your hat, and when your wife allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in such a state, I shall fear that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's affection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle;" [...] said Mabel, [...] "if {{you have}} breakfasted, I will thank <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> upon the bastion with me again.

6000|$|... "Well, it ain't no use taking on, all the same," [...] she said, {{in a tone}} {{somewhat}} less deferential and kind than before.

6000|$|... "That's right, old June. There's {{nothing they}} want so much, as such as you. How glad my aunt will be! Perhaps {{you will see}} David! Oh, if <b>you</b> were <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Loyalty group!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Munro {{was deeply}} {{impressed}} with {{my ability to}} ride through the traffic. He traced me to the Women's Emergency Corps and... said, 'Would <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Flanders' and I said 'Yes, I'd love to'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Dennisford," [...] I said, [...] "of course, {{my guest}} may have misled me; {{but he seemed}} to think that an abrupt meeting might be undesirable.

6000|$|... "You {{must give}} {{up going to}} stay with your aunt Moss the day after to-morrow, Maggie; write a note to her, and tell her you have put it off at my request, and I'll send the man with it.

6000|$|She met him squarely. [...] "Victor, {{death to}} me is merely a passing from one plane to another. Besides, I don't think your mother has {{altogether}} left us. But if she has, you can do no good by remaining here. Mrs. Post and I are quite sufficient. It is a glorious spring day. I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> and take the air. It will do you infinite good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Granting {{that you}} owed him no gratitude, were <b>you</b> obliged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{of your way}} to take his wife from him? Until you {{came on the scene}} they were happy. Why couldn't you leave them alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not you think, Ennia, {{that it is}} {{foolish and}} wrong of <b>you</b> thus <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{unprotected}} at night to such a place as this, and, as I suppose, without the knowledge of your father and mother?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... "This is how grassroots, {{democratic}} politics work. To a certain extent, {{this is how}} {{democratic politics}} {{is supposed to work}} in general. You convince people of the validity of your ideas. <b>You</b> have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there and convince people." ...|$|R
