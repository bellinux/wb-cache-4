2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E

2500|$|The 2006 film She's the Man modernises {{the story}} as a {{contemporary}} teenage comedy (as 10 Things I Hate About <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>with</b> The Taming of the Shrew). It {{is set in a}} prep school named Illyria and incorporates the names of the play's major characters. For example, Orsino, Duke of Illyria becomes simply Duke Orsino ("Duke" [...] being his forename). The story was changed to revolve around the idea of soccer rivalry but the twisted character romance remained the same as the original. Viola, the main character, pretends to be her brother Sebastian, and a girl named Olivia falls in love with Viola as Sebastian. She also goes to a restaurant named [...] "Cesario's". Two of Duke's Illyria soccer teammates are named Andrew and Toby. A nod is given to the omitted subplot by naming a briefly-onscreen tarantula Malvolio. Several characters, such as Monique and Malcolm, do not seem to stem from any Shakespearean inspiration.|$|E
