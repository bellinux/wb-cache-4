2500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version was}} {{generally}} considered the weakest {{version of the}} game. IGN's Marc Nix scored it 6 out of 10, and was especially critical of the combat; [...] "enemies get the jump on you with the first attack, and since there can be several enemies on screen, it can {{take a long time}} for your turn to come up. Then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> every swipe of battle, which all begin and end with the characters taking a LONG walk across the screen to attack and then retreat - just the time that it takes for sprites to rotate back into the ready position is enough time for you to lose interest." [...] He called the game [...] "a rough start for the journey." [...] GameSpy's Avi Fryman scored it 1.5 out of 5, criticizing the graphics, and finding the game buggy, writing [...] "I wonder if it was even tested prior to its clearly rushed release." [...] GameSpot's Frank Provo scored it 2.1 out of 10, writing, [...] "the range of interactivity is so low and the action is so infrequent that Frodo's quest to Mount Doom is reduced to nothing more than a trivial errand. What's more, the entire game is so unpolished and full of bugs that it's unfathomable how it ever passed quality assurance in the first place." ...|$|E

60|$|Now, in {{that your}} art {{presents}} all this material to you, {{you have already}} much to rejoice in. But you have more to rejoice in, because all this is submitted to you, not to be dissected or analyzed, but to be sympathized with, and to bring out, therefore, what may be accurately called the moral part of imagination. We saw that, if we kept ourselves among lines only, we should have cause to envy the naturalist, because he was conversant with facts; but you will have little to envy now, if you make yourselves conversant with the feelings that arise out of his facts. For instance, the naturalist coming upon a block of marble, has to begin considering immediately how far its purple is owing to iron, or its whiteness to magnesia; he breaks his piece of marble, and {{at the close of}} his day, has nothing but a little sand in his crucible and some data added to the theory of the elements. But you approach your marble to sympathize with it, and rejoice over its beauty. You cut it a little indeed; but only to bring out its veins more perfectly; {{and at the end of}} your day's work you leave your marble shaft with joy and complacency in its perfectness, as marble. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> an animal instead of a stone, you differ from the naturalist in the same way. He may, perhaps, if he be an amiable naturalist, take delight in having living creatures round him;--still, the major part of his work is, or has been, in counting feathers, separating fibres, and analyzing structures. But your work is always with the living creature; the thing you have to get at in him is his life, and ways of going about things. It does not matter to you how many cells there are in his bones, or how many filaments in his feathers; what you want is his moral character and way of behaving himself; it is just that which your imagination, if healthy, will first seize--just that which your chisel, if vigorous, will first cut. You must get the storm spirit into your eagles, and the lordliness into your lions, and the tripping fear into your fawns; and in order to do this, you must be in continual sympathy with every fawn of them; and be hand-in-glove with all the lions, and hand-in-claw with all the hawks. And don't fancy that you will lower yourselves by sympathy with the lower creatures; you cannot sympathize rightly with the higher, unless you do with those: but you have to sympathize with the higher, too-- with queens, and kings, and martyrs, and angels. Yes, and above all, and more than all, with simple humanity in all its needs and ways, for there is not one hurried face that passes you in the street that will not be impressive, if you can only fathom it. All history is open to you, all high thoughts and dreams that the past fortunes of men can suggest, all fairy land is open to you--no vision that ever haunted forest, or gleamed over hill-side, but calls you to understand how it came into men's hearts, and may still touch them; and all Paradise is open to you--yes, and the work of Paradise; for in bringing all this, in perpetual and attractive truth, before the eyes of your fellow-men, you have to join in the employment of the angels, as well as to imagine their companies.|$|E

5000|$|.....set {{the deal}} with United Artists, {{and they had a}} {{commitment}} for a film with Elliott Gould, so either you take Elliott Gould or you don't make the film. Elliott Gould was not exactly my idea of Philip Marlowe, but anyway there we were. Also, as far as the story was concerned, time had gone by—it was twenty-odd years since the novel was written, and the private eye had become a cliché.

[...] and that it's a [...] "progression from the last two albums. Live instruments, songs about life, love and friendships, with the neo-soul vibe still in tact". Walker co-wrote eight of the ten tracks on the album and also co-produced the album track [...] "I Don't Care".

50|$|The River Ogmore estuary is {{flanked by}} Ogmore beach {{on one side and}} the dunes of Merthyr Mawr on the other. The estuary makes bathing unsafe from most of the beach. The rocky {{shoreline}} is well known as a rock climbing location. It is an interesting place geologically with a variety of fossils clearly visible. Many people use the car-park by the estuary to the River Ogmore, which is just as you enter the village, others move on to Southerndown. Ogmore had many beaches and if you walk along the path from the car park you will find Hardies Bay and Horseshoe Bay which are fantastic for bathing.
