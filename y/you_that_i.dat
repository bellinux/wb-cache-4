25|$|Hear ye! I {{make known}} to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am in perplexity {{by reason of}} {{difficulties}} into which I have been brought without cause, therefore I have given away the life of our land.

25|$|Before I forget it, let {{me remind}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall want the trunk and the things you took away from my house as soon as possible. I learn that instead of taking old things, you took my best. Mrs. Rogers is at the White Mountains. I am going to Fairhaven this afternoon. I hope {{you will not be}} there. By the way, I have been using a pair of your gloves in the Mountains, and they don't seem to be much of an attraction.|$|E

[...] "Only it is not true, and {{you know}} it is not true. <b>You</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> acted for the best; <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hurt <b>you,</b> insulted you; <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> behaved like a fish-wife, and <b>you</b> do know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> disgusted you--" ...|$|R

25|$|Be {{it known}} unto <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have {{discovered}} that {{you and the other}} Sir W. H. are reciprocal polars with respect to me (intellectually and morally, for the Scottish baronet is a polar bear, and you, I was going to say, are a polar gentleman). When I send a bit of investigation to Edinburgh, the W. H. of that ilk says I took it from him. When I send you one, you take it from me, generalize it at a glance, bestow it thus generalized upon society at large, and make me the second discoverer of a known theorem.|$|E
25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I invite you to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours. Signed, Jewett, Colonel of the Navy of the United Provinces of South America and commander of the frigate Heroína.|$|E

6000|$|... "Adolphe," [...] he said, [...] "why do {{you raise}} your sword against your friend? Don't <b>you</b> see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have come as your friend: don't <b>you</b> see <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no sword?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MR. Kendricks!" [...] cried Mrs. March, with burlesque severity. [...] "Do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would offer}} <b>you</b> a heroine who was NOT in society? <b>You</b> forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am from Boston!" ...|$|R

500|$|In September 2012 Pratchett stated: [...] "I {{have to tell}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought I'd be a {{lot worse}} than this by now, and so did my specialist." [...] In the same interview, he stated that the {{cognitive}} part of his mind was [...] "untouched" [...] and his symptoms were physical (normal for PCA). However, in July 2014 he cancelled his appearance at the biennial International Discworld Convention, saying: [...] "the Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments".|$|E
500|$|Haley {{writes that}} during {{the last months of}} MalcolmX's life [...] "uncertainty and confusion" [...] about his views were {{widespread}} in Harlem, his base of operations. In an interview four days before his death MalcolmX said, [...] "I'm man enough to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't put my finger on exactly what my philosophy is now, but I'm flexible." [...] MalcolmX had not yet formulated a cohesive Black ideology {{at the time of his}} assassination and, Dyson writes, was [...] "experiencing a radical shift" [...] in his core [...] "personal and political understandings".|$|E
500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is good for <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> leave; for if I did not go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do believe}} thee, oh Holly," [...] she {{answered}} coldly, [...] "and well {{it is for}} <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do--then does the whole guilt rest upon her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So true, my good woman, that my {{greatest}} hopes depend on this voyage. Did <b>I</b> not tell <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> went at the bidding of an angel?" ...|$|R

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a drum solo before the other {{instruments}} enter to form the musical foundation. Selena sings to her absent lover about how much she misses him, saying that he is [...] "always on [...] mind" [...] and that she feels lonely {{when he is not}} with her. Three times she sings, [...] "I often think of the happy times we spent together / And I just can't wait to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> love you". In the chorus, she sings of wanting to hold him tight and feel his heartbeat.|$|E
500|$|On 18 October, he {{made the}} token gesture of {{formally}} dismissing Diệm. The following day, he denounced [...] "the police methods" [...] of Diệm's [...] "dictatorship" [...] and warned the Vietnamese populace [...] "against a regime that was bound to lead them to ruin, famine, and war". Bảo Đại accused Diệm of trying to foment conflict between the French and the Americans. On {{the eve of the}} poll, Bảo Đại stated [...] "I can even tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know the percentage of favourable votes that Mr. Diem has decided to obtain." ...|$|E
500|$|I have {{to inform}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was not {{satisfied}} with the first proof of the Lincoln cent. [...] I found that you had not dropped the Lincoln portrait down so that the head would come nearer the center of the coin... Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded {{that it would be better}} to put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust". [...] This change has made a marked improvement in the appearance of the coin.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} you have come," [...] said he. [...] "I hope <b>you</b> {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would have gone}} to <b>you,</b> only <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought it might be better for both of us to be here." ...|$|R
500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good for <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for nothing in My name, BWV 87).|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|... "I Need A Girl" [...] is a mid-tempo R ballad, {{featuring}} guitar riffs. According to Mark Edward Nero of About.com, {{the song}} contains familiar qualities of Songz's breakout hit [...] "Can't Help But Wait", also produced by Stargate. The song is lyrically about finding and pleasing the right woman, through lines such as, [...] "I don't even know your name, but I know that I'm your man {{and you are}} my girl, if I ever meet you I'm gonna give you the world, Baby please believe me when I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> need a girl." [...] The song has been described to be a mix of Usher and Justin Timberlake, and {{has been compared to}} Chris Brown's [...] "With You." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have been}} the victim of your plots and conspiracies?' {{continued}} Mr. Pickwick. 'Do <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the man whom you have been imprisoning and robbing?

6000|$|... "Who {{would not}} thrive there?" [...] said Ambrose. [...] "Nay, aunt, tarry a little, I {{have a message}} for <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would fain give before we go in to Aldonza." ...|$|R

500|$|According to Cinema Vision India, the film's {{theme is}} [...] "that people change [...] and they must". Ramachandran notes that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels {{helpless}} and emasculated; Kumaran, his , becomes an easy target, adding that Kali refuses {{to see the}} benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy, educated man (even when Valli and his wife Manga ask for his consent), but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her defiant wedding preparations to join her brother: [...] "My sister has shown all of <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{the most important person}} in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry." ...|$|E
500|$|At his {{confirmation}} hearings in 2017, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch recalled being moved by reading Sumner's gravestone {{as a law}} student at Harvard. Gorsuch closed his opening statement by reading a portion of Sumner's epitaph and adding [...] "hose words stick with me. I keep them on my desk. They serve {{for me as a}} daily reminder of the law's integrity, that a useful life can be led in its service, of the hard work it takes, and an encouragement to good habits when I fail and when I falter. At the end of it all, I can ask for nothing more than to be described as he was. And if confirmed, I pledge to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will do everything in my power to be that man." ...|$|E
500|$|The bailout {{referendum}} on 5 July {{resulted in a}} 'No' vote {{to the adoption of}} the bailout package. The following day, Varoufakis resigned as finance minister. As he left the finance ministry, he suggested that Tsakalotos was likely to succeed him, and Tsakalotos was subsequently sworn-in later that day. In the process of this, Tsakalotos relinquished his previous ministerial position of Alternate Minister for International Economic Relations. Tsakalotos was noted for his differences with Varoufakis, for example, the Financial Times noted that he [...] "could hardly be more different from his flamboyant predecessor". At a press conference shortly following his appointment, Tsakalotos said: [...] "I cannot hide from <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am quite nervous. I am not taking on this job at the easiest point in Greek history." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Won't <b>you</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{mean to do}} this cruel thing?" [...] he asked, in {{a kindly}} voice. [...] "And won't <b>you</b> believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would do {{anything}} {{in my power to}} bring your pet back to life?" ...|$|R
