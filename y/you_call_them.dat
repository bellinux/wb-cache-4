2500|$|Kittie {{is often}} {{known for being}} an all-female band. Kittie's drummer Mercedes Lander said that she wants Kittie {{to be seen as}} just a metal band instead of a [...] "girl metal" [...] band saying “You don’t call Machine Head a 'boy metal band,' <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> a metal band … Why should they make an {{exception}} [...] just because of the gender? It's almost exactly the same kind of music, except we don't have penises".|$|E
2500|$|Jamaican male sexual {{identity}} {{has long been}} defined in opposition to homosexuality. According to Dr. Kingsley Ragashanti Stewart, a {{professor of anthropology at}} the University of the West Indies, [...] "A lot of Jamaican men, if <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> a homosexual, ... will immediately get violent. It's the worst insult you could give to a Jamaican man." [...] Dr. Stewart believes that homophobia influences almost every aspect of life and shapes the everyday language of ghetto youth. [...] "It's like if you say, 'Come back here,' they will say, 'No, no, no don't say 'come back'.' You have to say 'come forward,' because come back is implying that you're 'coming in the back,' which is how gay men have sex." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yu Fan {{was known}} to be very direct in his speech and there were many {{instances}} when he offended people while he was drunk. Once, when Sun Quan and Zhang Zhao were talking about immortals, Yu Fan pointed at Zhang and shouted, [...] "They are all dead people, yet <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> immortals. How can there be immortals in this world?" [...] At this point, Sun Quan could no longer tolerate Yu Fan so he exiled him to Jiao Province. While he was in exile, Yu Fan held lectures and had hundreds of students. He also annotated ancient classics such as the Daodejing, Lunyu and Guoyu. He was friendly with Ding Lan (丁覽) and Xu Ling (徐陵). Both of them started their careers as low-ranking officers serving in county offices, but their lives changed after they met Yu Fan because they rose through the ranks and became famous later on.|$|E

2500|$|During one of {{the many}} festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols. Ur's most {{prominent}} temple is the Great Ziggurat, which can be seen today. Ibrahim would ask them, [...] "What are you worshiping? Do these idols hear when <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>them?</b> Can they help you or hurt you?" [...] The people would reply, [...] "It is the way of our forefathers." [...] Ibrahim declared [...] "I am sick of your gods! Truly I am their enemy." [...] After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.|$|E

6000|$|But I shall hear {{without pain}} that I play the courtier very ill, and talk {{of that which}} I do not well understand. It is easy to see, that what is called by {{distinction}} society and fashion has good laws as well as bad, has much that is necessary, and much that is absurd. Too good for banning, and too bad for blessing, it reminds us of a tradition of the pagan mythology, in any attempt to settle its character. 'I overheard Jove, one day,' said Silenus, 'talking of destroying the earth; he said it had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, who went from bad to worse, {{as fast as the}} days succeeded each other. Minerva said she hoped not; they were only ridiculous little creatures, with this odd circumstance, that they had a blur, or indeterminate aspect, seen far or seen near; if <b>you</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> bad, they would appear so; if <b>you</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> good, they would appear so; {{and there was no one}} person or action among them, which would not puzzle her owl, much more all Olympus, to know whether it was fundamentally bad or good.' ...|$|R
