50|$|Old Friends and New {{is about}} finding a home - somewhere <b>you</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable</b> in society. Each of the short stories deals with {{a person who is}} lonely in their current environment. Whether they have no family and friends or whether they just do not feel like they fit in, {{there is at least one}} {{character}} in each story that finds the proper atmosphere for them that makes them <b>feel</b> <b>comfortable.</b> In Lady Ferry, the narrator expresses content in the way cousin Agnes has been so welcoming. She <b>feels</b> more <b>comfortable</b> at her cousin’s house after just one day than a lifetime in her own home. “I began to feel already the pleasure of being in a real home.” In some of the short stories, the characters make such small adjustments to their lives to realize that they are already happy and are surrounded by people that can quell their loneliness. In others, however, characters travel thousands of miles to learn what home truly is, and begin a new life where they are surrounded by loved ones and realize that they have just now found a home.|$|R

40|$|Here {{are some}} tips to help you stay calm during exams, {{so that you can}} reach your potential. 1. Start to prepare for your exams well in advance. Try to keep up with your uni work on a day to day basis if you can. Avoid relying on last minute cramming {{in the days leading up}} to an exam. 2. Put the exam in perspective. It is only an exam. The result is not a {{reflection}} of who you are as a person. If you invest too much of your self-worth in studying and exams it can create additional stress and anxiety. 3. Get a good night’s sleep beforehand. It’s important that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> rested on the day of the exam. Even 4 - 5 hours may be enough. It’s hard to produce your best work in the exam if you are feeling exhausted. 4. Eat sensibly before the exam. Some people overeat when they are feeling anxious, while others stop eating at all. Eating a nutritious meal can help <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> physically <b>comfortable</b> and stay alert and focused for your exam...|$|R
