500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{features}} an interpolation of Right Said Fred's song [...] "I'm Too Sexy", which was composed by Christopher Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Robert Manzoli. It samples the trademark lyric, [...] "I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts", but replaces [...] "for my shirt" [...] with [...] "in this club". According to Digital Spy, {{in an interview}} with Teletext, Buchanan revealed that inspiration for the song came [...] "by accident", saying: [...] "The producers were messing around going, 'I'm too sexy for the studio'. We were like, 'That sounds cool', and [...] said, 'You remember that Right Said Fred song?' We were like, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do it?' By accident it came together." [...] Balls and Levine compared the song to [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by Black Eyed Peas.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get the {{photographs}} your father wants, Shep?" [...] asked Snap. [...] "It wouldn't {{be fair to}} take the offer up and then disappoint him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is such {{a chance}} as only a brave man would dare to take," [...] she replied. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> get her to take it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Tom Atto at once {{bowed and}} retired, {{and when they}} were done, Cap'n Bill said to the queen, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> ma'am, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> manage to escape from Zog and his castle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{we could}} catch up to the Blower party by to-night," [...] said Roger, earnestly. [...] "Mr. Dillon, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If only {{we could}} capture them ourselves!" [...] murmured Tom, his eyes glistening. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do it, with the sticks and pistols?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} of it?" [...] cried Mr. May. [...] "We've saved the situation--what? Don't you think so? Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> congratulate ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do forgive me," [...] he begged. [...] "I {{met a man}} outside {{who kept}} me gossiping about trifles. Tell me, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> persuade your mother {{to come out to}} supper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{seem to do}} most of the spending," [...] she {{reminded}} him. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> afford it," [...] she added, glancing at his empty glasses, [...] "I should like a cup of tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're a true philosopher, Rokens. Now Doctor Hopley, I must beg {{you to give}} us your opinion, as {{a medical}} man, on this knotty subject," [...] said the captain, smiling. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{continue}} to exist if our daily allowance is reduced one-fourth?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is just it," [...] she returned. [...] "Nobody {{can imagine}} the first Christians, and do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> imagine {{anything}} like them in our own day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman," [...] {{reiterated the}} traveller, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> stand {{here all day}} till you have cheated that poor servant wench out of her half-year's fee and bountith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, why don't we do it? Verona and Matilda can run {{the house}} between them, and you and I can go any time, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> afford it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ah, smart, smart!' he cried, {{in a kind}} {{of ecstasy}} of delight. 'You are the very man for us. You are not to be talked over, and quite right, too. Now, here's a note for a hundred pounds, and if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do {{business}} you may just slip it into your pocket as an advance upon your salary.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I knew I shouldn't fear," [...] she answered. [...] "Look {{at all the}} snowdrops"—they hung in dim, strange flecks {{among the}} dusky leaves—"look at them—closed up, retreating, powerless. They belong to some {{knowledge}} we have lost, that I have lost and that I need. I feel afraid. They seem like something in fate. Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> Cyril, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> lose things off the earth—like mastodons, and those old monstrosities—but things that matter—wisdom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Short," [...] {{said the}} first of these great men {{addressing}} James as though he had known him intimately for years, though, as a matter of fact, he had only that moment ascertained his name from Mr. Fiddlestick, who was himself obliged to refer to Bean before he could be sure of it--"look here, Short: don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> settle this business? You've got a strongish case; but there are some ugly things against you, as no doubt you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gwendolen desires {{above all}} things to have a horse to ride--a pretty, light, lady's horse," [...] said Mrs. Davilow, looking at Mr. Gascoigne. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> manage it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl looked}} up from her seat on the leathern couch, looked at her {{companion}} long and critically. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> hold our own against a man like Stirling Deane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{go ahead}} {{on this road}} now?" [...] asked Dick, {{after a few more}} words had passed between the Rovers and the man who had the {{blasting}} in charge.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, Captain Joyce, we are quits!" [...] {{said the}} general, {{holding out his}} hand. [...] "You gave me a bad ten minutes with that infernal red-hot {{horseshoe}} of yours. I've done as much for <b>you.</b> I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> spare <b>you</b> for the Royal Mallows just yet awhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> sir, that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{allow the}} {{servants}} to go away? <b>We</b> <b>can</b> then better {{go into the}} matter." [...] I nodded approval; the servants took the hint and withdrew, though unwillingly, the last one {{closing the door behind}} him. Then the Detective went on: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be easy, now. One {{thing at}} a time. Your back's taking no harm at all for the present, since I've covered it up. I'm wanting to know what's {{happened}} to <b>you.</b> D' ye <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do without a navigator that ye go and provoke that beast Bishop until he all but kills you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A well." [...] Tasso relaxed. [...] "Then we'll find a well." [...] She {{looked at}} her watch. [...] "We have about an hour, Major. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> find it in an hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is best we see Captain Baker {{as soon as}} may be, and if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{find our}} way through the woods, I'll say nothing against a short cut, for time presses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is this. Let us get up a {{newspaper}} of our own--write it all ourselves, and have {{all we do}} in it. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{get a lot of}} fun out of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so there}} is, for certain," [...] said his simple companion. [...] "But yet I think I heard people {{speaking}} of {{going down to}} Scotland by sea, as well as coming up. Are you well avised of the way?--Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it possible <b>we</b> <b>can</b> go by land, my sweet lord?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{see if we}} couldn't come to some fair settlement," [...] said Stacey. [...] "I've no {{objection}} to going outside with <b>you,</b> but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> discuss this matter here just as well." [...] His fine feathers had not made him a coward, although his heart had beaten a little faster at this sudden recollection of the dangerous reputation of his host.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "I don't {{feel that}} I am growing any older, and I don't {{see that you}} are, and so I totally forget that proclivity in other people. But what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> now? <b>Can</b> <b>we</b> take this young woman with us to camp? Will she not be a dreadful drag?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said Capes, [...] "what {{on earth}} do you want? What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do? Don't {{you know what}} men are, and what life is?--to {{come to me and}} talk to me like this!" ...|$|E
60|$|Judge Twisdon. Whereat Judge Twisdon {{answered}} very angrily, saying, 'What! <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{do what we}} list; {{your husband}} is a breaker of the peace, and is convicted by the law,' &c. Whereupon Judge Hale called for the Statute Book.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had forgotten, Ruth," [...] he said slowly, [...] "but does it matter? You {{have no one}} in {{the world}} but Isaac, and I have {{no one in the}} world at all. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> afford to do what seems sensible?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how are we}} to return," [...] said de Lescure, [...] "and to whom? <b>think</b> <b>you</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> collect another army in La Vendée, {{when one}} has deserted us on the road? will the peasants again trust in us, after they have once left us? Never If the army dissolves itself in despair, you {{will never be able to}} {{establish}} it again." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “Sometimes [Marco Polo observes] I {{only need}} a glimpse {{to open up}} {{right in the middle}} of an incongruous landscape, lights to crop up in the fog, the {{dialogue}} of two passers-by who meet in the to and fro, to think that on the basis of this I will put together bit by bit the perfect city, made of fragments mixed with the rest, of instants separated by intervals, of signals one sends and does not know who gathers them up. If I tell you that the city towards which my journey tends is discontinuous in time and space, sometimes sparser, sometimes denser, <b>you</b> should not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> stop looking for it.” (Kuon) [...]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{disagreement}} between Antonescu and the Iron Guard about the robbery of the Jews {{was not about}} the robbery itself but about the method, and the final destination of the stolen property. Antonescu held that the robbery should be done by way of expropriation, gradually, through an orderly process of passing anti-semitic laws. ... the Legionnaires wanted everything, and they wanted it immediately; Antonescu, while sharing the same goal, intended to achieve it gradually, using different methods. The leader stated this clearly in an address to Legion-appointed ministers: [...] "Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> replace all Yids immediately? Government challenges are addressed one by one, like {{in a game of}} chess." [...] The Legionnaires, on the other hand, wanted to rob as much as possible, as quickly as possible, utilizing methods based not in law but in terror, murder and torture. The Legionnaires had an additional quarrel with the German minority in Romania.|$|R
