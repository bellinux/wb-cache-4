500|$|Other {{major themes}} of the series include choice and free will. Meyer says that the books are {{centered}} around Bella's choice to choose her life on her own, and the Cullens' choices to abstain from killing rather than follow their temptations: [...] "I really think that's the underlying metaphor of my vampires. It doesn't matter where you're stuck in life or what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to do; you can always choose something else. There's always a different path." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those who do it will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

Giving the film {{three out of four}} stars, the review also said that [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Goldberg figured, he springs fresh surprises."

2500|$|A {{number of}} illustrative metaphors {{have been used}} to {{describe}} Petrosian's style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that [...] "playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip." [...] He {{has been described as a}} centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play as such: [...] "Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. Just when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> caught him, he puts out his quills." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 196, the warlord Cao Cao {{received}} and fetched Emperor Xian to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) and established the new capital there.

Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{spent too much time}} observing changes in the Shu region?" [...] Xun You was then appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Runan Commandery (汝南郡; around present-day Gushi County, Henan) and later summoned to the capital to serve as a Master of Writing (尚書). Cao Cao had long heard of Xun You and was overjoyed when they finally met. He told Xun Yu and Zhong Yao, [...] "Gongda is no ordinary person. Now that I have him to advise me, why should I worry {{about not being able to}} pacify the Empire?" [...] He also appointed Xun You as a Military Adviser (軍師).|$|E

Also, when Burke was asked if she had a tape while being interviewed on [...] on 31 May 2011 by Caitriona Perry, Perry asserted that [...] "despite originally believing that she had a recording of the interview, Helen Lucy Burke is now not so sure". Burke explained, [...] "I don't think so, I thought I had a taped cassette, {{but it turns out that}} it was in the one, I wasn't able to open it because it was a different length from the one in my existing cassette box". When Caitriona Perry asked [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a tape anywhere else", Burke replied [...] "it could be under the mountains of stuff that came down when my ceiling came in". In the last days of the campaign the tape was released and according to the Irish Independent, Ms. Burke [...] "said yesterday she found the tape recently but only released it in the last days of the campaign for “impact.” She said “it would give people something to think about when they went to the polls.|$|E
