One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as quick as you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under <b>your</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

500|$|Following the Philadelphia Constitutional Convention of 1787, a {{fatigued}} Washington {{returned to}} his estate, Mount Vernon. He seemed intent on resuming his retirement and letting others govern the nation with its new frame of government. The American public at large, however, wanted no one but Washington to be the nation's first president. The first U.S. presidential campaign was in essence what today would be called a grassroots effort to convince Washington to accept the office. Letters poured into Mount Vernon informing him of public sentiment and imploring him to accept; [...] from former comrades in arms, and from across the Atlantic. Gouverneur Morris urged Washington to accept, writing [...] " [...] thirteen horses now about to be coupled together, {{there are some of}} every race and character. They will listen to your voice and submit to <b>your</b> <b>control.</b> You therefore must, I say must mount this seat." [...] Alexander Hamilton {{was one of the most}} dedicated in his efforts to get Washington to accept the presidency, as he foresaw himself receiving a powerful position in the administration. The comte de Rochambeau urged Washington to accept, as did the Marquis de Lafayette, who exhorted Washington to [...] "not to deny your acceptance of the office of President for the first years." [...] Washington replied [...] "Let those follow the pursuits of ambition and fame, who have a keener relish for them, or who may have more years, in store, for the enjoyment." [...] In an August 1788 letter, Washington further expounded on his feelings regarding the election, stating, ...|$|E

[...] Juju explained the title of the song as relating to the point in a relationship where [...] "you don't want a happy ending, and there is no future, where you want to stop spending time together, immediately." [...] During recording and performances of the song, Juju felt it easy to imagine the feelings of the song's protagonist. Her favorite section of the song is the bridge (the section beginning with the lyrics amai kako no kioku nante).|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out <b>your</b> <b>control,</b> 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
