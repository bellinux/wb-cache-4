500|$|There are {{frequent}} references to Star Wars in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode in 2006 where Tracy is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. There is also reference to Star Wars when Tracy takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. In [...] "The Head and the Hair", Liz tells Jenna that [...] "The Head" [...] asked her out and says [...] "I had to say yes. I mean he looked at me with those handsome guys eyes. It was like the Death Star tractor beam when the Falcon was...", until Jenna interrupts her and says [...] "No Liz, do not talk about that stuff on <b>your</b> <b>date.</b> Guys like that do not like Star Trek", to which Liz corrects [...] "Wars!". Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to executive producer and writer Robert Carlock, whom she described as [...] "the resident expert".|$|E

6000|$|What comedian but Moliére has {{combined}} with such depths--with the indignation of Alceste, the self-deception of Tartufe, the blasphemy of Don Juan--such wildness of irresponsible mirth, such humour, such wit! Even now, {{when more than}} two hundred years have sped by, when so much water has flowed under the bridges and has borne away so many trifles of contemporary mirth (cetera fluminis ritu feruntur), even now we never laugh so well as when Mascarille and Vadius and M. Jourdain tread the boards in the Maison de Moliére. Since those mobile dark brows of yours ceased to make men laugh, since your voice denounced the 'demoniac' manner of contemporary tragedians, I take leave to think that no player has been more worthy to wear the canons of Mascarille or the gown of Vadius than M. Coquelin of the Comédie Francaise. In him you have a successor to your Mascarille so perfect, that the ghosts of play-goers of <b>your</b> <b>date</b> might cry, could they see him, that Moliére had come again. But, with all respect to the efforts of the fair, I doubt if Mdlle. Barthet, or Mdme. Croizette herself, would reconcile the town to the loss of the fair De Brie, and Madeleine, and the first, the true Céliméne, Armande. Yet had you ever so merry a soubrette as Mdme.

Second condition! You wait here, in company with me, to see my agent, who is coming at seven o'clock in the morning to regulate my affairs. You give my agent a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his possession of it. You wait here till my agent places that letter unopened in my hands, and you then allow me one clear half-hour to leave the house--after which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please. Third condition! You give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion into my private affairs, and for the language you have allowed yourself to use to me at this conference. The time and place, abroad, to be fixed in a letter from my hand when I am safe on the Continent, and that letter to contain a strip of paper measuring accurately the length of my sword. Those are my terms. Inform me if you accept them--Yes or No." ...|$|E

Website PCGamesN.com was critical of 'ShagAGamer.com', writing [...] "...there is absolutely {{nothing wrong with the}} core concept behind Shag a Gamer, but there is something wrong when <b>your</b> <b>dating</b> website appears to be populated by fake or illegitimate users who repeatedly send out the same messages verbatim.

50|$|SURS {{serves a}} diverse group of members with occupations ranging from professors and {{teachers}} to clerical, building service workers, and groundskeepers. Unlike many other public pension systems, SURS is the sole source of retirement income for its participants. The state/employer does not contribute to Social Security on the employee’s behalf and there is no coordinated benefit for SURS-covered employment from Social Security upon retirement. Receipt of a SURS annuity may reduce, or eliminate entirely, his or her Social Security benefit at retirement under the Windfall Elimination Provision or the Government Pension OffsetParticipation in the State Universities Retirement System (SURS) is mandatory for all eligible University employees. The employee contribution to the system is 8% of the gross salary. University employees do not contribute to Social Security. SURS contributions are deducted from your pay on a pre-tax basis, and income taxes will be due when you make withdrawals at retirement. Eligible employees must select one of the three SURS plan options (Traditional, Portable, or Self-Managed) within 6 months of <b>your</b> <b>date</b> of hire. This is a lifetime, irrevocable decision.|$|E

5000|$|Very large {{quantities}} of data can now be explored using computers with fuzzy logic programming and open-source architectures such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and MongoDB. One author claimed in 2016 {{that it is now}} possible to obtain, link and analyze [...] "400 data points" [...] for each voter in a population, using Oracle systems (a [...] "data point" [...] is a number which represents a characteristic). However, NBC News reported that the Anglo-American firm Cambridge Analytica which profiled voters for Donald Trump (Steve Bannon has been a board member) has not 400, but 4,000 data points for each of 230 million US adults. Cambridge Analytica's own website claims that [...] "up to 5,000 data points" [...] are collected for each of 220 million Americans, a data set of more than 1 trillion bits of formatted data. Harvard University Professor Latanya Sweeney calculated, that if a company knows just <b>your</b> <b>date</b> of birth, your ZIP code and sex, the company has an 87% chance to identify you by name - simply by using linked data sets from various sources. With 4,000-5,000 data points instead of three, a very comprehensive personal profile becomes possible for almost every voter, and many behavioural patterns can be inferred by linking together different data sets. It also becomes possible to identify and measure gradations in personal characteristics which, in aggregate, have very large effects.|$|E
