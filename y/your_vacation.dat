He {{was a guest}} panelist on the original To Tell the Truth starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time The Johnny Carson Show failed, he moved to New York City to host Who Do You Trust? (1957–1962), formerly known as Do You Trust Your Wife?. In 1958, he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled [...] "Do You Trust Your Wife" [...] on NBC's short-lived variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. On Who Do You Trust?, Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although he believed moving to daytime would hurt his career, Who Do You Trust? was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became [...] "the hottest item on daytime television" [...] during his five years at ABC.|$|E

6000|$|While {{he was at}} home, the {{schoolmaster}} of the place, who {{saw that}} the lad had abilities, was never tired of urging {{him to go to}} school, and do himself justice by getting himself a first-rate education, or at least as good a one as could be obtained in America. James was ready enough to take this advice, if the means were forthcoming; but how was he to do so? [...] "Oh, that's easy enough," [...] said young Bates, the master. [...] "You'll only have to work out of hours as a carpenter, take odd jobs in <b>your</b> <b>vacations,</b> live plainly, and there you are." [...] In England there are few schools where such a plan would be practicable; but in rough-and-ready America, where self-help is no disgrace, there are many, and they are all well attended. In the neighbouring town of Chester, a petty Baptist sect had started a young school which they named Geauga Seminary (there are no plain schools in America--they are all [...] "academies" [...] or [...] "institutes"); and to this simple place young Garfield went, to learn and work as best he might for his own advancement. A very strange figure he must then have cut, indeed; for a person who saw him at the time described him as wearing a pair of trousers he had long outworn, rough cow-hide boots, a waistcoat much too short for him, and a thread-bare coat, with sleeves that only reached a little below the elbows. Of such stuff as that, with a stout heart and an eager brain, the budding presidents of the United States are sometimes made.|$|R

The principles and theories of business may be taught in college but the practical experience is obtained out in the business world. The summer vacation {{is the only time}} the college student has to make an adjustment to conditions of the business world.
