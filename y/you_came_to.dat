It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organizers at the last minute. The executive producer of the 2007 VMAs Jesse Ignjatovic contacted Spears since she wanted to start the show in [...] "a very big and dramatic way", and was confident that Spears would deliver and set the tone for the rest of the night. She also said Spears was excited after she was approached by MTV to perform. On September 7, 2007, Spears started rehearsing at the Pearl Theater. An exclusive video from the rehearsal was posted on MTV.com the following day. The performance began with a close-up of the back of Spears's head, and continued with Spears turning to the camera and lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble": [...] "If you're lookin' for trouble, <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the right place / If you're lookin' for trouble, look right in my face." [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The backdrop videos featured images of chandeliers floating and silhouettes of women, which were compared by Gil Kaufman of MTV to the gun barrel and title sequence of the James Bond series. At the end of the performance, Spears smiled and thanked the audience before leaving the stage.|$|E
