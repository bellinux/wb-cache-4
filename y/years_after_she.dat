5|$|HMS Valiant {{was laid}} down 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town. This company went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames Ironworks, which delayed the ship's launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after Valiant had been towed to Portsmouth for fitting out, {{the ship was}} inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy. Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles was slow and ships already in commission had priority so Valiant was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> was launched.|$|E

She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood 12 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> left.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> first met him, James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that her strong character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E

5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. She may never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. She may have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E
5|$|Hamidiye was {{a unique}} ironclad warship built for the Ottoman Navy in the 1870s, the last vessel of the type {{completed}} for the Ottomans. She was a central battery ship, mounting most of her armament in a central casemate. The ship, built by the Ottoman Imperial Arsenal took nearly twenty years to complete; she was laid down in December 1874, launched in 1885, and completed in 1894. Due to her lengthy construction period, she was already obsolete {{by the time she}} was launched. Her poor handling and low quality armor contributed to a short career, spent almost entirely as a stationary training ship. She was briefly activated in 1897 during the Greco-Turkish War, but she was already in bad condition just three <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> entered service, as was the rest of the ancient Ottoman fleet. The Ottomans embarked on a reconstruction program after the incident humiliated the government, but Hamidiye was in too poor a state by 1903 to warrant rebuilding, and she was accordingly decommissioned that year, placed for sale in 1909, and sold to ship breakers in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Van der Sloot (then age 17), {{along with}} the Kalpoe brothers, Deepak (then age 21) and Satish (then age 18), was arrested on 9 June 2005, as {{a suspect in the}} 30 May 2005 {{disappearance}} of an 18-year-old American woman, Natalee Holloway, who was declared legally dead six <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>she</b> disappeared. The Kalpoes were released from custody on 4 July, but were re-arrested on 26 August on suspicion of rape and murder, while Van der Sloot remained in custody. Van der Sloot and the Kalpoes were released on 3 September {{because of a lack of}} evidence. After his release, Van Der Sloot was required to stay within Dutch territory pending the results of the investigation. On 5 September 2005, he returned to the Netherlands to study international business management at the HAN University of Applied Sciences. On 14 September, a higher court removed the travel restrictions. Gerold G. Dompig, former deputy commissioner of the Aruba Police Force, stated that the initial arrests were made prematurely under pressure from Holloway's family. Dompig charged that the family sidetracked the investigation by making it difficult for the police to collect evidence to solve the case.|$|E
