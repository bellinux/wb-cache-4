500|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessor, who was actively involved in most elements of his government, Getty preferred to set the government's broad direction and leave lower-level details to his ministers. [...] Ralph Klein, while serving as Environment Minister under Getty, commented that [...] "If you are a minister, you run that portfolio yourself" [...] and expressed {{an appreciation for the}} freedom that the Premier gave his cabinet. [...] Al Adair, who served in two different portfolios under Getty, described this approach in his memoirs as [...] "you make the decisions, you run <b>your</b> <b>department,</b> but make mistakes and you're gone". [...] Lisac credits him for knowing when to intervene and when not to, but Adair felt that his approach led to ministers working too much in isolation.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{was invited}} to play a four-week date at the London Palladium in July 1951. While flying to the engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, were on a plane from Rome with {{passengers}} from an assortment of countries that included 11 children. The plane lost the use of two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest, meaning that the plane would crash over Mont Blanc. The priest readied himself to administer last rites. As he did so, he told Skelton, [...] "You take care of <b>your</b> <b>department,</b> Red, and I'll take care of mine." [...] Skelton diverted {{the attention of the}} passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed. They ultimately landed at a small airstrip in Lyon, France. He received both an enthusiastic reception and an invitation to return for the Palladium's Christmas show of that year.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, {{the county}} {{prosecutor}} {{released a report}} that [...] "revealed {{an extraordinary amount of}} sexual conduct that was committed both on-duty and off-duty" [...] with a single woman. As a result of the report, an assistant chief of the department retired while five officers were placed on various forms of modified duty. [...] "Had these members of <b>your</b> <b>department</b> been more focused on the important responsibilities of law enforcement, rather than pursuing sexual encounters with a civilian analyst, LPD might not be in the condition it is today", the report concluded. Sergeants Rusty Longaberger and David Woolverton were fired for conduct unbecoming, failure to report misconduct, and neglect of duty.|$|E
