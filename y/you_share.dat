They talked about the challenges of parenting at the White House, {{the strength of their}} relationship, and their concern for the country's future. President Obama also thanked Winfrey for her contributions to the country. [...] "You've got a big heart, and <b>you</b> <b>share</b> it with people. Nobody knows how to connect better than you do," [...] he said. [...] "We are just blessed and grateful to have you in our lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hippies {{embraced the}} old slogan of free {{love of the}} radical social reformers of other eras; it was {{accordingly}} observed that [...] "Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more <b>you</b> <b>share,</b> the more you get! So why reserve your love for a select few? This profound truth {{was one of the}} great hippie revelations." [...] Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors. Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.|$|E
2500|$|After {{announcement}} of the planned rally, Brannon Howse, a professional organizer of Christian conferences, expressed wariness, stating [...] "The Apostle Paul warns Christians against uniting with unbelievers in spiritual endeavors. While I applaud and agree with many of Glenn Beck's conservative and constitutional views, that does not give me or any other Bible-believing Christian justification to compromise Biblical truth by spiritually joining Beck." [...] Breakpoint's Diane Singer said, [...] "If you're like me and believe [...] have been deceived into following another Jesus, then perhaps <b>you</b> <b>share</b> my concerns. I want real revival to come to America, which means it {{must be based on}} Truth, not deception." [...] In response to the rally, Warren Cole Smith, associate publisher of the Christian-themed World magazine, said: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1974 a new tent {{was added}} to the Festival. Instead of {{displaying}} or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: [...] "Family Folklore – Will <b>You</b> <b>Share</b> Yours With Us?" [...] Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, but he should also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Designedly, Heaven knows I would not,' he replied, {{shaking his}} head mournfully; 'but his {{reputation}} was too precious to be perilled by such association. Whether <b>you</b> <b>share</b> that knowledge, or do not, my dear--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick," [...] {{said the}} Doctor, [...] "it might be ill-advised {{of you to}} be seen with me just now. Our friend here will let <b>you</b> <b>share</b> his chamber. Quick, Israel, and show the Captain thither." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peters smiled. [...] "You {{were very}} dull for some time, but I think {{you begin to}} see. Well, I suppose you can comfort {{yourself}} with the reflection that when <b>you</b> <b>shared</b> the profit <b>you</b> didn't know how it was earned." ...|$|R
