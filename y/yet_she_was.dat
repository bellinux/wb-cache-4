She hated {{school and}} {{preferred}} to play alone. <b>Yet</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> an imaginative child and a natural leader who {{became interested in}} theatre at an early age. She directed her friends in make-believe games and performances and dreamed of becoming an actress. Later, she would participate in amateur theatre with her friends and frequent the Mosebacke Theatre. At the age of 13, Garbo graduated from school, and, typical of a Swedish working class girl at that time, she did not attend high school. She would later confess she had an inferiority complex about this.|$|E

Later she was criticised for being particularly aggressive towards Rebecca, Thomas and Jamie. Killeen was also criticised for hypocrisy having aggressively questioned why Jamie did not intervene when Michelle argued with Aleisha, and <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> receptive towards Michelle herself on her eviction, and even rationalised Michelle's behaviour during the argument. Michelle was also named the most unpopular housemate ever to inhabit the Australian Big Brother House.|$|E

25|$|Following her civil trial, Hutchinson needed also {{to face a}} {{trial by}} the clergy, and this could not take place until the {{following}} March. In the interim, she {{was not allowed to}} return home, but instead was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend Thomas Weld, which was located in Roxbury, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> rarely able to see her children because of the winter weather, which was particularly harsh that year. She was frequently visited by the various ministers; modern writer Eve LaPlante claims that they came with the intention of reforming her thinking and also to collect evidence to use against her in the forthcoming church trial. LaPlante also claims that Winthrop was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1870, Marrash started {{contributing}} articles and poems to journals—especially al-Jinan and Lisan al-hal, both of Beirut. In her articles, she criticized {{the condition of}} Arab women, urging the latter—regardless of their religious affiliations—to seek education and express themselves on matters of concern to them. Her collection of poetry Bint fikr (A Daughter of Thought) was published in Beirut in 1893. Marrash was granted permission by the Ottoman government to print her book after composing a poem exalting Sultan Abdul Hamid II. In some of the several other panegyrics included in the collection, she also praised Ottoman governors of Aleppo. Her poetry was much more traditional in style than her brother Francis', as exemplified by the elegy she composed to lament his death; <b>yet,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{at home with the}} poetry of French romantics, especially that of Alphonse de Lamartine and Alfred de Musset.

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E

The songs she wrote during the months she took off for travel and life experience appeared on her next album, Blue, released in June 1971.

2500|$|She had {{two films}} {{released}} in 1970: the Telugu film Amma Kosam and the Hindi film Sawan Bhadon, which was considered her acting debut in Bollywood. She {{had to learn}} Hindi, as that was not her naturally spoken language. Sawan Bhadon became a hit, and Rekha – a star overnight. Despite {{the success of the}} film, she was often scorned for her looks. She subsequently got several offers but nothing of substance, as her roles were mostly just of a glamour girl. She appeared in several commercially successful films at the time, including Raampur Ka Lakshman (1972), Kahani Kismat Ki (1973), and Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye (1974), <b>yet</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not regarded for her acting abilities and—according to Tejaswini Ganti—"the industry was surprised by her success as her dark complexion, plump figure, and garish clothing contradicted the norms of beauty prevalent in the film industry and in society." [...] Rekha recalls that the way she was perceived at that time motivated her to change her appearance and improve her choice of roles: [...] "I was called the ‘Ugly Duckling’ of Hindi films because of my dark complexion and South Indian features. I used to feel deeply hurt when people compared me with the leading heroines of the time and said I was no match for them. I was determined to make it big on sheer merit." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My Life Would Suck Without You" [...] {{was written}} by Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, Max Martin and Claude Kelly, with {{additional}} uncredited songwriting by Kelly Clarkson. Record executive Clive Davis hired Gottwald and Martin, who produced [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] for Clarkson in 2004, to produce a new song for Clarkson in 2008 after Clarkson's My December suffered poor commercial performance after refusing to hire them in 2006. She was completely against it through the entire process due to previous bad experiences working with Dr. Luke, stating he's difficult to work with, demeaning and a liar, thus [...] "making the artist look bad". Clarkson eventually gave in claiming the label wouldn't put out her record otherwise. <b>Yet,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unsatisfied with the original version of the song, which she says differed greatly from the final version and included lyrical references to marijuana, so the writers assisted her in making the song more personal to her and [...] "better than it was," [...] according to Clarkson. After the song was finalized and significant changes to the lyrics had been made, Clarkson said RCA approached her about taking a proper writing credit for the track, which she refused {{in order to make}} a point to the label as they failed to meet her one request which was not to have her work with Luke again.|$|E
