5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel that because you are black <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm {{not going to let}} him change my life.|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt {{grew up in}} an {{atmosphere}} of privilege. His father, had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather. James was a prominent Bourbon Democrat; when he took along five-year-old Franklin to see President Grover Cleveland, the busy president told Franklin, [...] "I have one wish for you, little man, that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> President of the United States." [...] Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's early years; she once declared, [...] "My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all." [...] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time. Frequent trips to Europe—he made his first excursion at the age of two and went with his parents every year from the ages of seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French.|$|E

[...] When Pu Tong Seal found out about La King's attitude, he secretly collected all the wealth under his province such as silver, beads, bells, (zaam) a traditional musical instrument made of copper, other house utensils, and stored them in a large house to impress La King. One evening, Pu Tong Seal revealed his treasury to La King, and said, [...] "If you do not want to meet my demand it is fine with me, I do not need your wealth, because I am already a very wealthy man- but in that case, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> released to see your kingdom and your family." [...] His determination to keep the Burman king alive but never to release him was very obvious in his stern voice. This sent a chill down La King's spine. La King then immediately sent another message to his Kingdom; this time, the King ordered them to fetch him at once with all the demanded ransom. The King also added in the message, [...] "Tong Seal isn't poor at all, as I first thought, he is actually a very wealthy man".|$|E
