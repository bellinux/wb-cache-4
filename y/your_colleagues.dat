500|$|Paige {{has named}} reality {{television}} series such as Any Dream Will Do, which aim {{to find an}} unknown actor to play the lead role in a musical, as {{the greatest threat to}} theatre today, believing that [...] "actors already striving in the theatre wouldn't dream of putting themselves on these shows". In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for this type of show: [...] "you wouldn't put yourself up for one of those shows in case you got bumped off the first week and all <b>your</b> <b>colleagues</b> saw it". She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.|$|E

2500|$|Hayden kept a {{considerably}} lower national profile than conventional wisdom would suggest {{for someone who}} spent {{more than half a}} century in Washington, including 42 years in the Senate. This came in part due to a conversation he had with Maryland Congressman Fred Talbott soon after he arrived in Washington in 1912. Talbott told him, [...] "Son, there are two kinds of Congressmen—show horses and work horses. If you want to get your name in the papers, be a show horse. But if you want to gain the respect of <b>your</b> <b>colleagues,</b> don't do it. Be a work horse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Saddam {{continued}} {{involvement in}} politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including {{a meeting with}} the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: [...] "During your last visit here along with <b>your</b> <b>colleagues</b> we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening to what I was saying since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour." [...] He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them so that <b>your</b> <b>colleagues</b> know what you’re talking about...You’re {{going to have more}} influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably we rely on each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign talking about these issues, so let's {{get it out of the}} way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and <b>your</b> <b>colleagues</b> some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. What I said was that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Have {{you ever}} been in a rush to go to a meeting and {{realized}} halfway there that you forgot to print out the mail message with all the location information? For times like these, remote access to your computer can be tremendously helpful. Consider a few other scenarios:. You're at a meeting and want to find a time when you and <b>your</b> <b>colleague</b> can schedule a follow-up meeting. Call and check your on-line calendar as well as <b>your</b> <b>colleague's</b> for possible meeting times.. You're away for the weekend and want to call someone whose number is on line. Call and have the computer look up the number and put the call through for you.. You're in your car and can't remember how to get to the dentist's office. Call your personal database and check the directions. One option is to always carry a portable computer. But even with their impressively small size, there are disadvantages to this approach.

5000|$|In October 1993, {{during the}} {{penultimate}} match in the Netherlands, referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher did not send off Ronald Koeman for fouling Platt.
