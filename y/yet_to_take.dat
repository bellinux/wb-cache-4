5|$|When he proves {{unable to}} defeat Data-Sora himself, Pete infects Data-Riku's code with bugs and forces him to fight, putting the datascape {{in danger of}} being totally corrupted. Seeing no alternative, Data-Sora chooses to debug Data-Riku from inside, an act which will cause the datascape to reset if he succeeds, wiping his memories. The {{debugging}} process also activates the bug responsible for the data's corruption, which takes the form of Sora's Heartless. Data-Sora destroys the bug while Mickey and the others are returned to their world by Data-Riku before the reset occurs.

5|$|To {{ensure that}} the {{operation}} was a success, Montgomery insisted that an airborne component be inserted into {{the plans for the}} operation, to support the amphibious assaults that would take place; this was code-named Operation Varsity. Three airborne divisions were initially chosen to participate in the operation, these being the British 6th Airborne Division, the U.S. 13th Airborne Division and the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, all of which were assigned to U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, commanded by Major General Matthew B. Ridgway. One of these airborne formations, the British 6th Airborne Division, commanded by Major-General Eric Bols, was a veteran division; it had taken part in Operation Overlord, the assault on Normandy in June the previous year. However, the U.S. 17th Airborne Division, under Major General William Miley, had been activated only in April 1943 and had arrived in Britain in August 1944, too late to participate in Operation Overlord. The division did not participate in Operation Market Garden. It did, however, participate in the Ardennes campaign but had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in a combat drop. The U.S. 13th Airborne Division, under Major General Eldridge Chapman, had been activated in August 1943 and was transferred to France in 1945; the formation itself had never seen action, although one of its regiments, the 517th Parachute Infantry, had fought briefly in Italy, and later in Southern France and the Ardennes campaign.|$|E

25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to work off, which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E

500|$|The {{rarity of}} a penalty {{shoot-out}} in rugby meant that no standard format existed and tournament organisers {{were left to}} devise their own rules on the format a shoot-out would take in the event it was required, such as the positions the kicks would be taken from, the type of kick used and the number and order of players who would participate. In {{the case of the}} Heineken Cup, the rules set by organisers European Rugby Cup (ERC) prescribed a format closely resembling that used in soccer matches. Each team would alternately take five place kicks, each from the same position on the 22-metre line, {{directly in front of the}} posts. Each kick had to be taken by a different player from the 15 players that were present on the pitch at the end of extra time. In the event the scores were level after the five kicks, [...] "sudden death" [...] would take place, with each team alternately taking a kick until a round occurred where one team was successful with their kick and the other team missed. Again, each kick was required to be taken by a different player, starting with players that had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a kick in the first part of the shoot-out. If no winner had been decided after all 15 players had attempted a kick, the process would continue with each player eligible to take a kick again until all 15 players had made another attempt.|$|E

500|$|At 09:00 a German {{messenger}} {{crossed the}} Willemsbrug {{to bring an}} ultimatum from Schmidt to Colonel Pieter Scharroo, the Dutch commander of Rotterdam, demanding a capitulation of the city; if a positive answer had not been received within two hours the [...] "severest means of annihilation" [...] would be employed. However, Scharroo did not receive the message until 10:30. Not feeling inclined to surrender regardless, he asked Winkelman for orders; the latter, hearing that the document had not been signed nor contained {{the name of the}} sender, instructed him to send a Dutch envoy to clarify matters and gain time. At 12:15 a Dutch captain handed this request to von Choltitz. On the return of the German envoy at 12:00, Schmidt had already sent a radio message that the bombardment had to be postponed because negotiations had started. Just after the Dutch envoy had received a second ultimatum, now signed by Schmidt and with a new expiry time of 16:20, around 13:20 two formations of Heinkels arrived, not having received any recall orders. This was later explained by the Germans {{as a result of their}} having already pulled in their tow aerials. Schmidt ordered red flares to be fired to signal that the bombardment was to be broken off, but only the squadron making the bomb run from the southwest abandoned its attack, after their first three planes had dropped their bombs. The other 54 Heinkels, having approached from the east, continued to drop their share of the grand total of 1308 bombs, destroying the inner city and killing 814 civilians. The ensuing fires destroyed about 24,000 houses, making almost 80,000 inhabitants homeless. At 15:50 Scharroo capitulated to Schmidt in person. Meanwhile, Göring had ordered a second bombardment of the city—a group of Heinkels had already left—to be carried out unless a message was received that the whole of Rotterdam was occupied. When Schmidt heard of the order, he hastily sent an uncoded message at 17:15 claiming the city was taken, although this had <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place. The bombers were recalled just in time.|$|E
