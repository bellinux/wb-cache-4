40|$|The study {{describes}} the aquatic habitats {{and distribution of}} Triturus alpestris veluchiensis Wolterstorff 1935, T. carnifex macedonicus (Karaman, 1922), T. vulgaris graecus (Wolterstorff, 1905) and Bombina variegata scabra (Küster, 1843) in the district (“nomos”) of Ioannina, Northern Greece. Bombina variegata {{was found to be}} the most common species, followed by T. alpestris and T. carnifex while T. vulgaris seemed to be rare. The four taxa differed in habitat use and geographic distribution. Records of T. alpestris were limited to the highest sites in the north and east of the district. This species inhabited alpine lakes, but also smaller habitats such as drinking troughs and ponds. Four populations contained paedomorphic individuals. Triturus vulgaris appeared to be restricted to low altitude sites in the centre of the district where it lived in reservoirs, watering basins and drinking troughs. Triturus carnifex and B. variegata had a wider distribution and occupied a broader spectrum of habitats. Bombina variegata was the only species studied which lived in running waters (small brooks). Neither newts nor <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> were found in large rivers and lakes. In the district of Ioannina both habitat variety and distribution range of newts and <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>Toads</b> turned out to be greater than previously known. Alpine lakes containing very large populations of paedomorphic individuals should be protected given the rarity of the phenomenon. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the trophical spectrum of three Bombina variegata populations, from forest ecosystems situate in Luncani, Valea Budului and Runc within Bacău County. The most abundant prey taxon {{in the food}} of Bombina variegata populations {{is represented by the}} species from Coleoptera order, followed by those of Diptera among insects, and by araneids among spider. The considerable number of small and gregarious species (Formicidae – Hymenoptera) emphasizes the opportunistic behavior of preying in this species, using the sit and wait foraging behavior. The terrestrial prey taxons prevail in comparison with aquatic organisms. Like the other amphibian species, Bombina variegata is a zoophagous – polyphagous species. <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> eat all moving objects in their sight range that they can ingest...|$|R
5|$|Vikos-Aoös also {{contains}} a variety of suitable habitats that support dense populations of amphibians and reptiles. Vipera ursinii lives in the subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the Tymfi region, mostly in Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area. Numerous fish, such as brown trout, roach, and barbel {{are to be found}} in the park's rivers. Regarding invertebrate species, due to the structural complexity of the forests and the co-existence of various small biotopes, i.e. streams, ponds, forest openings, rocky sites, dead trees, old pollards, and coppices, a very diverse fauna exists. This occurs especially at the various ecotones, including often very specialized species.|$|R
25|$|Tymfi {{holds the}} largest {{recorded}} population of Balkan chamois deer (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica) in Greece, {{with a population}} between 120-130 individuals out of an estimated national population between 477-750. Although chamois is registered as least concern in IUCN's red list, the subspecies balcanica numbers some thousands of individuals and its populations {{are believed to be}} declining. According to the Hellenic Ornithological Society mount Tymfi along with the neighbouring mountain Smolikas are important regions for breeding birds of prey, alpine and forest dwelling bird species. The Egyptian vulture, short-toed snake eagle, rufous-tailed rock-thrush breed in the region, whereas species such as the golden eagle, red-billed chough, rock partridge, alpine chough, wallcreeper, white-winged snowfinch and the alpine accentor are sedentary. Alpine reptilian and amphibian species are also present. Vipera ursinii lives in the mountain's subalpine meadows and is considered a threatened taxon. The amphibian alpine newts (Triturus Alpestris), living in the alpine lakes of the mountain, mostly in and around Drakolimni, are associated with local folktales of dragons and dragon battles. <b>Yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> (Bombina variegata) are also common in that same area.|$|R

40|$|Global change causes {{community}} composition {{to change}} considerably through time, with ever-new combinations of interacting species. To study {{the consequences of}} newly established species interactions, one available source of data could be observational surveys from biodiversity monitoring. However, approaches using observational data would need to account for niche differences between species and for imperfect detection of individuals. To estimate population sizes of interacting species, we extended N-mixture models that were developed to estimate true population sizes in single species. Simulations revealed that our model is able to disentangle direct effects of dominant on subordinate species from indirect effects of dominant species on detection probability of subordinate species. For illustration, we applied our model to data from a Swiss amphibian monitoring program and showed that sizes of expanding water frog populations were negatively related to population sizes of endangered <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> and common midwife toads and partly of natterjack toads. Unlike other studies that analyzed presence and absence of species, our model suggests that the spread of water frogs in Central Europe {{is one of the}} reasons for the decline of endangered toad species. Thus, studying population impacts of dominant species on population sizes of endangered species using data from biodiversity monitoring programs should help to inform conservation policy and to decide whether competing species should be subject to population management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIteroparity is an {{adaptive}} response to uncer- tainty in reproductive success. However, spreading repro- ductive success over multiple reproduction events during a lifetime is constrained by adult mortality and the stochas- ticity associated with interactions between external factors and physiological states. The {{acquisition of information}} about environmental conditions during the growth of prog- eny and sufficient resources during the non-reproductive period are key factors for breeding success. Consequently, we hypothesized that long-lived animals may skip a breed- ing opportunity when information about unfavourable environmental conditions is available. In addition, nutri- tional constraints could prevent an animal from replenish- ing its reserves sufficiently {{to invest in the}} current breeding period. We investigated these questions using capture– recapture data from a 5 -year study on a large population of <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>toads</b> in a forest in north-eastern France. We took advantage of various advances in multi-state cap- ture–recapture models (e. g. unobservable states and mix- ture models) to test our hypotheses. Our results show that the combined effects of rainfall deficit and the breeding/ non-breeding state of individuals during the past breeding season affect breeding probability during the following breeding opportunity. We also found that females breed less frequently than males, suggesting that the overall energy cost of reproduction differs between genders. Finally, the results indicate that toad survival appears to be negatively influenced by rainfall deficits. We discuss the yellow-bel- lied toad’s reproductive behaviour in term of bet-hedging strategy and life history trait evolution...|$|R
