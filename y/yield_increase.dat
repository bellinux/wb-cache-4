25|$|When {{productivity}} {{declined in}} the low-clay soils of northern Thailand, farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding bentonite, one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the International Water Management Institute in cooperation with Khon Kaen University and local farmers, this {{had the effect of}} helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average <b>yield</b> <b>increase</b> of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.|$|E

2500|$|The Green Revolution {{increased}} {{crop yields}} {{by a factor}} of 3 for soybeans and between 4 and 5 for corn (maize), wheat, rice and some other crops. [...] Using data for corn (maize) in the U.S., yields increased about 1.7 bushels per acre from the early 1940s until {{the first decade of the}} 21st century when concern was being expressed about reaching limits of photosynthesis. [...] Because of the constant nature of the <b>yield</b> <b>increase,</b> the annual percentage increase has declined from over 5% in the 1940s to 1% today, so while yields for a while outpaced population growth, yield growth now lags population growth.|$|E
2500|$|Increased CO2 is {{expected}} to have positive physiological effects by increasing the rate of photosynthesis. This is known as 'carbon dioxide fertilisation'. [...] Currently, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 410 parts per million. In comparison, the amount of oxygen is 210,000 ppm. This means that often plants may be starved of carbon dioxide as the enzyme that fixes , RuBisCo, also fixes oxygen in the process of photorespiration. The effects of an increase in carbon dioxide would be higher on C3 crops (such as wheat) than on C4 crops (such as maize), because the former is more susceptible to carbon dioxide shortage. Studies have shown that increased CO2 leads to fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage. Under optimum conditions of temperature and humidity, the <b>yield</b> <b>increase</b> could reach 36%, if the levels of carbon dioxide are doubled. A study in 2014 posited that CO2 fertilisation is underestimated due to not explicitly representing CO2 diffusion inside leaves.|$|E

Asymmetric logistic equations (ALEs) were used to fit total and viable cell density, and nutrient and metabolite/product concentrations.

Asymmetric logistic equations described satisfactorily uncontrolled batch cultures, including death phase. Specific growth rate showed a Monod-type dependence on initial glucose and glutamine concentrations.
