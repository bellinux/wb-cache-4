500|$|The rock critic Robert Christgau {{considers}} Berry [...] "the {{greatest of}} the rock and rollers", while John Lennon said, [...] "if you tried to give rock and roll another name, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> it 'Chuck Berry'." [...] Ted Nugent said, [...] "If you don't know every Chuck Berry lick, you can't play rock guitar." [...] Bob Dylan called Berry [...] "the Shakespeare of rock 'n' roll". Springsteen tweeted, [...] "Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|The BBC {{tracked down}} several {{officials}} {{involved in the}} accident's aftermath. One was William H. Chambers, a former nuclear weapons designer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Chambers headed a team dealing with nuclear accidents, including the Thule crash. He explained the logic behind the decision to abandon the search: [...] "There was disappointment in what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a failure to return all of the components... {{it would be very}} difficult for anyone else to recover classified pieces if we couldn't find them." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{positive}} review for Rolling Stone, Greil Marcus wrote in 1969 that Morrison's lyrics were thoughtful and deeply intellectual, [...] "in {{terms of the}} myths and metaphors that exist within the world of rock and roll". He believed both the music and lyrics captured the spirit of Bob Dylan's 1967 album John Wesley Harding, while calling Astral Weeks a [...] "unique and timeless" [...] record. Rolling Stone later named it the album of the year. Melody Maker also called {{it one of the}} year's best records, featuring Morrison's [...] "small harsh voice" [...] backed by an attractive musical combo that [...] "verges on genius" [...] during [...] "Madame George". When his third album Moondance was released in 1970, Warner Bros. ran full-page advertisements remarking on the unavailability of Astral Weeks in record stores, calling it a [...] "damn shame" [...] that it [...] "ended up as what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a critically acclaimed but obscure album ... If you want it and can't find it, yell at the store's record buyer. Loud, because you're the customer and you're always right. Undo the veils of potential obscurity." ...|$|E

500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] "With 'Telephone', Gaga {{has entered}} the rarest of pop stratospheres, {{up there with the}} Madonnas and the Michael Jacksons." [...] Matt Donnelly from Los Angeles Times wrote that the [...] "Telephone" [...] music video is a [...] "visual feast, packed with fantastic fashion, girl fights, {{poisoned}} diner food, an army of headpieces and lots of Gaga goodness." [...] Amy Odell from New York magazine felt that [...] "This is Gaga's video, but Beyoncé is the best part: she actually shows the angry, crazy side that we just knew lurked beneath her too-perfect facade." [...] Monica Herrera from Billboard wrote: [...] " [...] more than measures up to the hype.... 'Telephone' clip is chock full of intrigue, prison fights, makeout scenes, mass poisoning and plenty of skin-baring versions of what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'outfits'." [...] Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly commented: [...] "Is it as good as her epic 'Bad Romance' video? Sadly, I don't think so. But it's better than anything else out there." [...] Jennifer Cady of the website E! Online praised Beyoncé's [...] "always fierce" [...] look during the video. A writer of The Huffington Post wrote, [...] "As usual there is murder, masturbation, product placement, Tarantino referencing and lots of impractical headwear." [...] In January 2015, Billboard named the video as the best music video {{of the first half of}} the 2010s (decade).|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Life" [...] was raved {{by music}} critics. John Calvert of The Quietus {{described}} the song as [...] "really big. Like R. Kelly's [...] "I Believe I Can Fly" [...] big. Like Superman eating a super hotdog while fighting King Kong while...ok {{you get the}} picture. If you were looking around for a high concept pitch-style descriptor, with its synth brass and Philly soul strings <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> it 'Stevie Wonder meets N.E.R.D in space'. But then {{that would be too}} simplistic a definition for the multifaceted, resolutely accomplished 'Sweet Thing'." [...] Pitchforks Larry Fitzmaurice labeled it a [...] "Best New Track" [...] and noted that [...] "this was a week where Frank Ocean bravely invited us to learn more about his personal story; 'Sweet Life' is another reminder of how well he can structure a narrative in the musical realm." [...] The Telegraphs Neil McCormick noted that Ocean took the R genre and pushed it out into strange new places, with tracks like the [...] "blissful, jazzy jigsaw of 'Sweet Life', which seems to assemble itself from disconnected elements as it goes along." [...] AllMusic's Andy Kellman mused that the track served as one of the album's lighter moments, and wrote that [...] "the bright 'Sweet Life' and the relatively exuberant 'Monks,' both of which would be standouts on any N.E.R.D. album, offer more than bright coating, dealing in surrealism and sharp observations that are equally penetrating." ...|$|E
2500|$|In parliament, Archer was on {{the left}} of the Conservative Party, rebelling against some of his party's policies. He {{advocated}} free TV licences for elderly people and was against museum entrance charges. Archer voted against restoring capital punishment, saying it was barbaric and obscene. In 1971, he employed David Mellor, then needing money for his bar finals, to deal with his correspondence. He tipped Mellor to reach the cabinet. In an interview Archer said, [...] "I hope we don't return to extremes. I'm what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> centre-right but I've always disliked the right wing as much as I've disliked the left wing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Paul Arendt of the BBC {{finds that}} [...] "No Country... can be enjoyed as a {{straightforward}} genre thriller" [...] with [...] "suspense sequences... that rival {{the best of}} Hitchcock", in other respects the film {{can be described as}} a western, and the question remains unsettled. For Richard Gillmore, it [...] "is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel-drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Phillip Evans said in 2014 that [...] "Henderson's central {{idea was}} what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> the Napoleonic idea of concentrating mass against weakness, of {{overwhelming}} the enemy. What Henderson recognized was that, {{in the business}} world, there are many phenomena which are characterized by what economists would call increasing returns—scale, experience. The more you do of something, disproportionately the better you get. And therefore he found a logic for investing in such kinds of overwhelming mass {{in order to achieve}} competitive advantage. And that was the first introduction of essentially a military concept of strategy into the business world. ... It was on those two ideas, Henderson's idea of increasing returns to scale and experience, and Porter's idea of the value chain, encompassing heterogenous elements, that the whole edifice of business strategy was subsequently erected." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warbucks {{became much}} more {{ruthless}} in later years. After catching yet another gang of Annie kidnappers {{he announced that he}} [...] "wouldn't think of troubling the police with you boys", implying that while he and Annie celebrated their reunion, the Asp and his men took the kidnappers away to be lynched. In another Sunday strip, published during World War II, a war-profiteer expresses the hope that the conflict would last another 20 years. An outraged member of the public physically assaults the man for his opinion, claiming revenge for his two sons who have already been killed in the fighting. When a passing policeman is about to intervene, Annie talks him out of it, suggesting, [...] "It's better some times to let folks settle some questions by what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> democratic processes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Limoges {{is north}} of Exit 79 on Trans-Canada Highway 417. The village is {{situated}} between {{the towns of}} Casselman and Embrun and close to Larose Forest.

He had sent to the Franks a message of distress, that the Danes were on him in full force, and to pray them to come to his aid." ...|$|R
2500|$|Since commencing {{his writing}} process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites {{in the evenings}} after the day's work." [...] He would write four {{different}} screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching {{for just the right}} ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> a good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.|$|E
2500|$|Point Lookout {{has had a}} {{generally}} positive reception, averaging a 79 for the PC and an 83 for the Xbox 360. Eurogamer stated [...] "Like a compacted version of its parent game, {{this is the first}} DLC that has felt like a genuine expansion, as opposed to a just a few inconsequential missions thrown together." [...] IGN noted that [...] "he stories and characters here are filled with that trademark Fallout dark humor, elevating these quests to a level that rivals the main game" [...] and that [...] "he major draw to Point Lookout... is its emphasis on exploration." [...] Edge calls it [...] "the best expansion so far and the game at its worst," [...] stating [...] "if you want a microcosm of Fallout 3, equal parts adventuring, grinding, questing and scavenging, you might just think it the best expansion so far." [...] Edge goes on to criticize Point Lookout for using [...] "a lot of what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>call</b> 'economy content' in Point Lookout: recycled enemies, text journals, variant weapons, and bogus forks in the storyline." ...|$|E
