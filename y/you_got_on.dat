Avila, with {{production}} handled by Jimmy Jam, Lewis, and Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent. During the song's bridge, Stefani refers to Japanese culture as [...] "A ping-pong match between Eastern and Western", while simultaneously name-dropping fashion icons: [...] "What's that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>on?</b> / Is it Comme des Gar√ßons? / Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong / Mixed up with second hand clothes". The former lyrics were scrutinized by several publications, with a critic from Time calling the singer [...] "racist". When asked if she regretted her use of the Harajuku Girls, Stefani responded: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} much less {{politically}} focused than it later became under Jon Stewart, having what Stephen Colbert described as a local news feel and involving more character-driven humor as opposed to news-driven humor. Winstead recalls that when the show was first launched there was constant debate regarding what the show's focus should be. While she wanted a more news-driven focus, the network was concerned that this would not appeal to viewers and pushed for [...] "a little more of a hybrid of entertainment and politics". The show was slammed by some reviewers as being too mean-spirited, particularly towards the interview subjects of field pieces; a criticism acknowledged {{by some of the}} show's cast. Describing his time as a correspondent under Kilborn, Colbert says, [...] "You wanted to take your soul off, put it on a wire hanger, and leave it in the closet before <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the plane to do one of these pieces." [...] One reviewer from The New York Times criticized the show for being too cruel and for lacking a central editorial vision or ideology, describing it as [...] "bereft of an ideological or artistic center... precocious but empty." ...|$|E

2500|$|Modeliste {{grew up in}} the 13th Ward of New Orleans. The {{eldest of}} six siblings, he was raised in part by his grandmother, Lula Blouin. His first drum set was a three-piece paid for by Blouin. He was nicknamed Zigaboo at age ten by a {{neighborhood}} kid, and by junior high school the name had stuck. His drumming style was influenced by Smokey Johnson, Bob French and other New Orleans drum greats as he learned by watching them perform at gigs. He said listening to other musicians was {{the most important part of}} his learning process. He particularly tried to emulate Smokey Johnson's style. He started playing gigs at an early age including a stint with The Hawketts, a band led by Art Neville at the time. Over time the band evolved into The Neville Sounds and by late 1960s into The Meters. In a 2013 interview with Modern Drummer, Modeliste said: [...] "Your biggest teachers were those two things <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>on</b> the side of your head. (...) It's got nothing to do with rudiments, nothing to do with time signatures, but it's got a lot to do with what you hear." ...|$|E
