500|$|Ray Kennedy {{was born}} on 28 July 1951 in Seaton Delaval, a former pit village in Northumberland, to Martin and Veronica Kennedy, a coal miner and {{housewife}} respectively. He was the eldest of four children: Trevor, Michael, and Janet. He was spotted playing schoolboy football by a scout at Port Vale, and began training at Vale Park after manager Stanley Matthews came to the Kennedy home {{to persuade him to}} sign schoolboy forms at the club. However at the age of sixteen Matthews felt Kennedy was [...] "too slow to be a footballer". Kennedy was considered to be too big and clumsy to be a professional, and groundskeeper Dennis Dawson claimed that he was the only man at the club to see any potential in the youngster. Dawson also told how Kennedy was released by the club after he was told: [...] "You will never make a pro as long as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> hole in your arse!". Kennedy returned to his native north-east in March 1967 and started working in a sweet factory whilst playing as an amateur for New Hartley Juniors, where he built a successful attacking partnership with former England schoolboy international Ian Watts. The pair scored 142 goals between them, and helped the club to win the East Northumberland Junior League, the Northumberland FA Junior Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Cup, the North East Youth Challenge Cup, the East Northumberland Junior League Charlton Trophy, the Tynemouth Junior League Challenge Cup and the Magpie Trophy.|$|E

6000|$|... "A {{squirrel}} fly!--The devil, Master Pathfinder! Do {{you suppose}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> boy {{on his first}} v'y'ge up here among you?" ...|$|E
60|$|MISS BEECH. [Sidling to him.] You're a good young man, and <b>you</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good heart.|$|R
60|$|Bel. One of the devils, I warrant <b>you,</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> cold, {{with being}} so long {{out of the}} fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know now," [...] said Wyndham, with forced quietness. [...] "It {{looks as}} if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> nasty knock. I'd hoped you would not find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|Because we thus {{must state}} the case, That <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> hanging face, Th' {{untimely}} end's a damn'd disgrace [...] of noose, sir.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Marston. [...] "The sea's restless, breezy, and sparkling, and I'm not. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> rather dull fellow for a lover." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose, miss," [...] he said, after pausing {{for some}} moments, [...] "that {{the meaning of}} this is that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> young lover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Tuppy, you are {{not showing}} your usual good sense in this Angela-chap-at-Cannes matter. If you will forgive me saying so, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idée fixe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you tell}} 'em <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> letter calling <b>you</b> home, as I told you?" [...] he vociferated, {{as soon as}} they were clear of the shop.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{was glad}} to hear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> move up once or twice, but {{it looks as if}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone farther than I thought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{mean you}} must have the money. Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> good deal of mine already. What becomes of it if the thing falls through?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't catch {{us without}} {{one for the}} next two months; will he, mamma? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> letter, uncle. Is it for us to see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In me, as your advisor hints, [...] Of Abstinence <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> type-- [...] Of Mr. Tweedle's pretty prints [...] I am {{the happy}} prototype.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> admirable theory. I have {{no doubt}} that my own ideas were quite wild, but you must admit that they have ended in {{discovering}} the silver." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because one of <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> {{stone of}} mine--a stone with strange signs upon it--which {{dropped into the}} water. If you will promise {{to get it back}} for me, why, perhaps I will leave your river alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> {{order of}} the court to prevent the well from flowing, have you?" [...] asked Bob, angrily, making what seemed such {{unnecessary}} movements with his hands, that the lawyer stepped several paces backward very quickly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bed to let,' he said, 'and if that {{gentleman who}} has just gone out won't pay your price for it, I will.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He said {{he thinks}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bad temper," [...] {{continued}} his wife. [...] "He thinks, perhaps, it's indigestion, caused by eating cheese for supper always." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{breath is}} in your hands I will presume, [...] But I advise you to defer his doom, [...] Till <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> better in his room; ...|$|E
6000|$|St. John smiled. [...] "Did I not say you {{neglected}} essential {{points to}} pursue trifles?" [...] he asked. [...] "You were serious when I told <b>you</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> fortune; and now, for {{a matter of}} no moment, you are excited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're tying my hands," [...] complained Tommy. [...] "It's a very {{delicate}} affair, and the other fellow will muff it up as likely as not, and then where shall I be? I don't believe one of <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> ounce of tact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It was {{necessary}} {{to get rid of}} them,” Will said, “because if they were found in the morning it would show that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> change, and instead of looking for someone in a well-worn uniform they would direct their attention to other people.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her bonnet with a shaking hand, and {{speaking}} in a breathless sort of way. 'What do you think? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> Pa!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bed to let," [...] he said, [...] "and if that {{gentleman who}} has just gone out won't pay your price for it, I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My poor dear, I {{begin to}} think you will pick up, now the good weather has come and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> little friend to play with. God bless her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had thought}} that I got on very well with Mrs. Parker. If you can eat your dinner with them, I'm sure that I can. You {{do not seem to}} like him altogether, and I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> partner more to your taste." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if it 's not him, it 's {{some one}} else. <b>You</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> secret, Polly, and I should {{think you might}} tell it, as you know mine," [...] said Fanny, unable to rest till {{everything}} was told, for Polly's manner troubled her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a {{very good}} sort," [...] Kit agreed. [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> office like this; the dark stuffy hole at Liverpool wasn't fit for you. I haven't asked if you're getting better, because I can see. Somehow you are another girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then,' {{said his}} lordship, 'I dare say <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> lapdog or a broken fan; I don't think I could soar above them. I {{think that is}} about my tether.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Carpenter, see if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> light spar {{that will}} do, instead of it. If not, get two small ones, and lash them {{so as to}} make a splice of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Gom. Well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> famous victory; {{all true}} {{subjects}} are overjoyed at it: There are bonfires decreed; an the times {{had not been}} hard, my billet should have burnt too.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, then, miss," [...] the {{old girl}} proceeded, untying {{the strings of}} her bonnet for more air, [...] "you could as soon move Dover Castle as move George on this point unless <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> new power to move him with. And I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] she said. [...] "Your father {{thinks that}} I am corrupting you about religion, as though anybody could corrupt <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>an</b> idea into your stupid head; at least, on those subjects. Oh! I hate him, worse even than I do my own, worse {{than you do}} yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{must say}} I {{never have had}} such a {{collection}} of bad material!" [...] Henrietta declared, looking from Isabel to Lord Warburton and from this nobleman to his sister and to Ralph. [...] "There's something {{the matter with you}} all; you're as dismal as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bad cable." ...|$|R
