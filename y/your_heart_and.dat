500|$|Brie Larson's {{performance}} as Grace was {{singled out for}} praise by critics. Katie Walsh of Indiewire wrote, [...] " [...] manages to convey her character as someone fierce and strong and steely, and also utterly fragile, delicate, scared and broken ... It's an incredible emotional and physical performance, and she's a whirlwind." [...] Similarly, Empire critic Ian Freer felt that Larson gave [...] "a whirling dervish of a performance ...

500|$|Jesus calls {{people to}} repent their sins and to devote {{themselves}} completely to God. Jesus tells {{his followers to}} adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: [...] "You shall love the Lord your God with all <b>your</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> with all your soul, and with all your mind... And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself" [...] (...) [...] Other ethical teachings of Jesus include , refraining from hatred and lust, turning the other cheek, and forgiving people who have sinned against you (Matthew 5–7).|$|E

500|$|According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, {{the song}} is {{influenced}} by the Sly and the Family Stone track [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971). It starts as the sound of slap bass plays along with sequenced synth bass, as Madonna sings the opening lines, [...] "Keep, keep it together, keep people together forever and ever". As the first verse starts, a guitar comes into play with Madonna's voice being backed by percussion and banjo. After the second chorus comes near the end, Madonna utters the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They hold the key, To <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> your soul, Don't forget that your family is gold", the percussion sound is thinned out and a mixture of the sound from a live drummer and conga comes into the picture. The song ends with the main groove sound gradually fading out.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E
500|$|Ryan White {{was seen}} by some as an [...] "innocent victim" [...] of the AIDS epidemic. Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm {{just like everyone else}} with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything.

500|$|Writing for {{the portal}} Vistina, Maja Bećković {{credited}} the singer for conveying [...] "so much warmth, so many emotions" [...] in an album; she called [...] "every word - a new pearl, every verse - gold, every vocal - a shining diamond". She continued describing the songs as [...] "so authentic, so old, so archaic and yet, so modern and rich, both production and author-wise". The journalist {{observed that the}} lyrics were carefully selected with every track eligible for [...] "a compilation containing the best lyric songs from this region, which contains so many centuries of elegy and sadness, interwoven with rare moments of joy, which make life worth living". She credited the singer for adding even [...] more value to what already was valuable material arranged for the album and concluded, [...] "All in all, Macedonian girl will touch <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> spirit even for the second time".|$|E
500|$|... "Blaze a 50" [...] {{features}} a violin-based instrumental and a complex narrative that follows {{a tale of}} murder, sex, and betrayal. Nas narrates the tale in conventional fashion until the ending, at which the track rewinds to an earlier point and he revises his original ending. [...] "Everybody's Crazy" [...] features complex rhymes and braggadocio rap by Nas: [...] "Gangsta see, gangsta do / A Langston Hughes predecessor / Gun in my dresser, slang I use." [...] In [...] "Purple"s narrative, Nas lights up a blunt and expresses his thoughts, including criticism of hoodlums and their effect on their neighborhoods: [...] "The 'hood love you, but behind your back they pray for the day / A bullet hit <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> ambulance take you away / That ain't love it's hate / Think of all the mothers at wakes / Whose sons you've killed and you ain't got a cut on your face?"

500|$|In October 1868 Cosima {{asked her}} husband for a divorce, to which he would not {{initially}} agree. To sceptical enquirers he explained her absence from the von Bülow family home by a supposed visit to her half-sister in Versailles. In June 1869, immediately {{after the birth of}} her and Wagner's third and final child, Siegfried, Cosima wrote to von Bülow in what she called a [...] "final attempt at an understanding". His reply was conciliatory; he wrote: [...] "You have preferred to consecrate the treasures of <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> mind to a higher being: far from censuring you for this step, I approve of it". Legal processes extended the marriage until 18 July 1870, when the divorce was finally sanctioned by a Berlin court. After the divorce von Bülow distanced himself from both Wagner and Cosima; he never again spoke to Wagner, and 11 years passed before his next meeting with Cosima.|$|E

500|$|The {{romantic and}} emotionally charged {{aspects of the}} film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of Urban Cinefile said, [...] "You will walk out of Titanic not talking about budget or running time, but of its {{enormous}} emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into <b>your</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> as lasting as the love story that propels it." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly described the film as, [...] "A lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking." [...] Janet Maslin of The New York Times commented that [...] "Cameron's magnificent Titanic is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to Gone With the Wind." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine, on the other hand, wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Henstridge {{described}} the episode as [...] "a coming-of-age story. I think we see Simmons at the start, and she’s {{never really been}} combat ready ... we see her have to survive, and just to see her go on this journey from complete despair". Henstridge also noted thriller elements in the episode. On the moment in [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] where Simmons loses hope, Henstridge explained, [...] "I never thought we'd see her get to that place ... It justifies her relationship with Will, too, because {{she was ready to}} end it all and {{he was the one who}} pulled her back from the brink." [...] Concerning that relationship with new character Will Daniels, the executive producers worked with Titley to try to make it feel earned in the episode, given the fan following of 'FitzSimmons' (the potential relationship between Simmons and Leo Fitz). Executive producer Jed Whedon also noted on this that the episode [...] "wasn’t a story about the two of them on this planet, but a story about Fitz hearing this and how he will respond. He breaks your heart, at the end, she breaks <b>your</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> hopefully, you’re feeling for all three involved." ...|$|E
500|$|Montana told MTV News {{about working}} with Cyrus, [...] "I was in L.A. and she {{happened}} {{to be doing the}} 'Ain't Worried About Nothin'' remix for me. She came by the studio and let me hear her album, which was crazy, and we just went through a couple tracks to see which one I fit on." [...] He continued, [...] "Then she played 'FU' and I fell in love with it. We just went in there and did it together." [...] Regarding the theme of the song, he explained, [...] "It's two letters 'F' and 'U.' You've just got two letters for somebody when you get to that point, when somebody breaks <b>your</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> you're in a relationship which has gone sour. So now you've only got two letters for them, 'F' and 'U'." [...] Its lyrics dismiss a cheating ex, as mentioned in the lines [...] "I don't really have much to say/ I was over it the second that I saw her name/ I got two letters for you/ One of them is F/ And the other one is U/ 'Cause what you gotta do/ is go get yourself a clue." ...|$|E
