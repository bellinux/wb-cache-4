However, when one of the principal stresses becomes smaller (or larger) than the others the material is subject to shearing.

40|$|Allografts {{are used}} to {{compensate}} for bone defects resulting from revision surgery, tumor surgery, and reconstructive bone surgery. Although {{it is well known}} that the reduction of fat content of allografts increases mechanical properties, the content of liquids with a known grain size distribution has not been assessed so far. The aim of the study was to compare the mechanical properties of dried allografts (DA) with allografts mixed with a saline solution (ASS) and with allografts mixed with blood (AB) having a similar grain size distribution. Fresh-frozen morselized bone chips were cleaned chemically, sieved, and reassembled in specific portions with a known grain size distribution. A uniaxial compression was used to assess the <b>yield</b> <b>limit,</b> initial density, density at <b>yield</b> <b>limit,</b> and flowability of the three groups before and after compaction with a fall hammer apparatus. No statistically significant difference could be found for the <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> between DA and ASS (p = 0. 339) and between ASS and AB (p = 0. 554). DA showed a statistically significant higher <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> than AB (p = 0. 022). Excluding the effect of the grain size distribution on the mechanical properties, it was shown that allografts have a lower <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> when lipids are present. The liquid content of allografts seems to play an inferior role as no statistically significant difference could be found between DA and ASS.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of load and {{resistance}} factor design (LRFD) calibration for pullout and <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> states for steel grid reinforced soil walls owing to soil self-weight loading plus permanent uniform surcharge. The calibration method uses bias statistics to account for prediction accuracy of the underlying deterministic models for reinforcement load, pullout capacity and yield strength of the steel grids, and random variability in input parameters. A new revised pullout design model is proposed to improve pullout resistance prediction accuracy and to remove hidden dependency with calculated pullout resistance values. Load and resistance factors are proposed that give a uniform probability of failure of 1 % for both pullout and <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> states.

The results of this equation are presented in graphical form {{for a wide range}} of the process variables. A simple experimental procedure is sug-gested for the determination of the coefficient of friction. The process variables are: The roll radius Ro, initial ti and final t f strip thickness, material <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> uo at uniaxial tensile test with <b>yield</b> <b>limit</b> u,i at initial thickness and uof at h a 1 exit thickness, front pull stress u d and back pull stress arb, the coefficient of friction p, and the rolling speed U. The power balance is set for the rolling operation. The powers computed are: (1) the useful power consumed as internal work of deformation of the strip, called (2) power consumed by the back pull on the strip; (3) power supplied by the front pull on the strip; (4) power consumed by the friction between the rolls and the strip; and (5) power supplied by the rolls. sometimes ‘The homogeneous power’; From the equation: sum of the powers = 0, a dependence of the process variables one on each other is established. From this dependence the coefficient of friction can be com-puted at maximum reduction, and this gives a simple procedure for the experimental determination of the average coefficient of friction.
