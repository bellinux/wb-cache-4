50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> (Milvus aegyptius) is the Afrotropic {{counterpart}} {{of the black}} kite (Milvus migrans), {{of which it is}} most often considered a subspecies. However, recent DNA studies suggest that the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> differs significantly from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered as a separate, allopatric species.|$|E
50|$|As {{suggested}} by its name, the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> is easily recognized by its entirely yellow bill, {{unlike that of}} the black kite (which is present in Africa as a visitor during the North Hemisphere winter). However, immature yellow-billed kites resemble the black kites of the corresponding age.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} diurnal raptors, {{including}} Frances's sparrowhawk, <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> and Madagascar harrier-hawk hunt Malagasy paradise flycatchers. [...] In addition, {{there is at}} least one record of a common brown lemur eating a nestling Malagasy paradise flycatcher, one of the few records of a wild lemur eating anything other than plant material.|$|E
40|$|The Cape Verde kite (Milvus milvus fasciicauda) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} rarest birds of prey in the world and at significant risk of extinction. For this reason there is great interest in both the taxonomic and the population status of this group. To help resolve its taxonomic status, we provide phylogenetic analyses based on three mitochondrial genes for a sampling of kites in the genus Milvus, including a broad geographical sampling of black kites (Milvus migrans), red kites (Milvus milvus), Cape Verde kite museum specimens collected between 1897 and 1924, and five kites trapped on the Cape Verde Islands during August 2002. We found that the historical Cape Verde kites, including the type specimen, were non-monophyletic and scattered within a larger red kite clade. The recently trapped kites from the Cape Verde Islands were all phylogenetically diagnosed as black kites. Our findings suggest that the traditional Cape Verde kite is not a distinctive evolutionary unit, and the case for species status, as recently suggested by others, is not supported. We do find support for recognition of at least one clade of <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kites,</b> traditionally considered as a black kite subspecies, as a distinctive phylogenetic species...|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> is {{apparently}} a separate species, {{as indicated by}} mtDNA phylogeny showing two supported clades, biogeography, and morphology. The black-eared kite is somewhat distinct morphologically, but is better considered a well-marked parapatric subspecies. The status of the Cape Verde kite is in doubt; while not a completely monophyletic lineage according to mtDNA data, it is still best regarded as a distinct species. Whatever its status, this population is extinct.|$|E
50|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that the yellow-billed African races parasitus and aegyptius differ {{significantly}} from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered a separate allopatric species: <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite,</b> M. aegyptius. They occur throughout Africa except for the Congo basin and the Sahara Desert. There have been some suggestions that the black-eared kite (M. m. lineatus) should be elevated to full species status as M. lineatus, but this is not well supported.|$|E
50|$|The diet {{consists}} of insects including Coleoptera which {{were found in}} 100% of stomach contents sampled, as were Orthoptera while Isoptera, Diplopoda, Hymenoptera and spiders were also recorded. Some vegetation was also recorded but this is assumed to have been swallowed accidentally when capturing animal prey. The aggregation of breeding frogs attracts several bird predators and these have included <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> Milvus aegyptius, marabou stork Leptoptilos crumeniferus, saddle-billed stork Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis, intermediate egret Mesophoyx intermedia, grey heron Ardea cinerea and black-headed heron Ardea melanocephala. Some edible bullfrogs were seen to lunge at water birds that got too close, possibly these were males aggressively defending their territories. After spawning the males guard the tadpoles and may dig channels for them if their natal pool is drying out too quickly.|$|E
50|$|Black kites can be {{distinguished}} from red kites by the slightly smaller size, less forked tail (visible in flight), and generally dark plumage without any rufous. The sexes are alike. The upper plumage is brown but {{the head and neck}} tend to be paler. The patch behind the eye appears darker. The outer flight feathers are black and the feathers have dark cross bars and are mottled at the base. The lower parts of the body are pale brown, becoming lighter towards the chin. The body feathers have dark shafts giving it a streaked appearance. The cere and gape are yellow, but the bill is black (unlike in the <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite).</b> The legs are yellow and the claws are black. They have a distinctive shrill whistle followed by a rapid whinnying call. Males and females have the same plumage but females are longer than males. Their wingspan is around 150 cm.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} lizard buzzards is {{extremely}} large {{and does not}} approach the threshold for vulnerable under range distribution.The population trend appears to be stable and does not approach thresholds for vulnerable.The population size is extremely large and for these reasons is evaluated as least concern.However, in Africa particularly West and Southern Africa there have been recorded dramatic declines in some raptors. The reasons for raptor decline in Africa are rapid human population growth driving overexploitation of the land causing biodiveristy loss and a decreased species richness. The raptor population declines in West Africa {{have been linked to}} loss of woodland and nest sites,increased pesticide use,intensive cultivation especially cotton and disturbance of nests. In Southern Africa raptor decline has been linked to use of poisons,powerline electrocutions, habitat destruction and raptor drowning in farm reservoirs. Despite high human population and activity in Africa, not all raptor species have declined sharply.Some raptors, especially opportunistic generalists and migrants have increased. In West Africa the grasshopper buzzard, black kite and hooded vulture have increased in number and range. Similarly in the Western Cape of South Africa, the steppe buzzard, lesser kestrel and <b>yellow-billed</b> <b>kite</b> have increased range and number. Currently there is insufficient data on the Lizard Buzzard to determine its adaptation to human land usage.It is unclear how it has adapted to loss of Woodland its preferred habitat and nesting site.Its preferred prey insects, lizards and rodents remain common in most human altered landscapes which could account for its current survival.|$|E
30|$|Avifauna on the {{mountain}} was sparse, with only twelve species recorded during the survey. Apart from raptors and two southern African endemics, these were mostly inconspicuous birds. Three of the raptors – Buteo vulpinus (Steppe Buzzard), Falco amurensis (Amur Falcon) and Milvus migrans (<b>Yellow-billed</b> <b>Kite)</b> – are non-breeding migrants and not confined to mountain regions (Hockey et al. 2005). No evidence (visual or audio) of Chaetops aurantius (Drakensberg Rockjumper) was noted, although the habitat is favourable. As the bird was recorded visually on the higher Koudeveldberge massif (20 km to north) in December 2011 by VRC, {{there is a chance}} that it may occur sporadically on these lower Kamdebooberg mountains. The greatest number of bird species were noted from the surrounding Karoo plains (not included in the Additional file 2 : Appendix 2), most spectacularly an influx of Neotis ludwigii (Lüdwig’s Bustard) feeding on the emergent insects during and after the heavy rains.|$|E
