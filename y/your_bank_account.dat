People care about their money and want it to be handled with care. Currently this means some tests, including making a payment using a Maestro debit card, need to be performed manually. In order to further testing, this project aims to automate these Maestro payments. This has been achieved by constructing a robotic device to perform the physical actions associated with creating a payment request, and create a piece of software to verify if the payment was accepted. The main software is based around the public API bunq B. V. offers. Using the API it is possible to retrieve information related to <b>your</b> <b>bank</b> <b>accounts,</b> including payments made. The robotic device is consists of a combination of solenoids and servos to operate the keypad and to present a bunq Maestro debit card.

As a result there should no longer be a need to physically take a terminal home and complete payments. Even though the delivered system does not have functionality to work with a phone's NFC, the system should be easily upgraded to support this functionality. Computer Scienc...|$|R

5000|$|... a false {{representation}} - {{there must be}} a description or portrayal of something that is false.

For example, representing to a seller that you have funds available in <b>your</b> <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> to pay for the goods when in fact your account has a zero balance is not false pretenses if at the time the transaction takes place adequate funds are present in the account.

Carter then gives the following example: [...] "You're sitting in your office, when suddenly you remember that you forgot to pay your Visa bill. You take a moment to log on to <b>your</b> <b>bank</b> <b>account,</b> and you pay the bill. Then you go back to work. If your employer has a policy prohibiting personal use of office computers, then you have exceeded your authorized access; since you went to your bank website, you have obtained financial information. Believe it or not, you're now a felon. The likelihood of prosecution might be small, but you've still committed a crime." [...] Carter further writes that the problem with the statute was well-known, and that [...] "some federal courts have given the statute's language a narrow construction, but others have read it broadly, and the Obama administration has opposed efforts in Congress to narrow its scope. Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, warned in an opinion last spring 2012 the government’s position 'would make criminals of large groups of people who would have little reason to suspect they are committing a federal crime.|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) During {{the last}} ten years {{technology}} evolved {{to such an extent that}} it was inevitable that banks would have to adapt their traditional understanding and methods of banking. This led to banks introducing various products and services such as internet banking, mobile banking and emoney. The advantages of these products are being able to access <b>your</b> <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> on the go, within minutes, without having to go into the bank and having face-to-face interaction. These products are automated and computerised. This decreases the bank’s need for human capital and therefore the banks offer these services at lower charges than normal banking as we are accustomed to. Prima facie these new products seem like the ultimate banking experience, being able to effect payment to a creditor outside of banking hours from the comfort of your home with the push of a button and even at lower rates. This ease of use without face-to-face interaction, however, inevitably led to fraudsters entering the arena with easier methods at their disposal to defraud unsuspecting victims through various trojan horses and man-in-the-mirror techniques which do not require the fraudsters to alter the victim’s identity document in order to present it to the bank’s teller to withdraw the victim’s money. These attacks are highly advanced and the victim will normally not even know that an attack has been launched on his account. With these new methods of committing fraud, the legislature had to implement certain standards the banks have to adhere to in order to protect sufficiently the bank’s customer against these attacks and to avoid the customer suffering losses...|$|E
40|$|Imagine that a {{close friend}} comes to you and confides {{that he is in}} {{financial}} trouble because of some misfortune beyond his control; for example, his wallet had been stolen. What would you do should he ask you to lend him some money? If you had sufficient funds in <b>your</b> <b>bank</b> <b>account,</b> you would probably grant his request. How would you react, however, if he should come to you a few days later and asks you to drive him to the police station to report the theft? And {{what would you do if}} he should ask you for an additional loan three weeks thereafter, as it was still impossible to access his bank account? You would probably be torn between two considerations or perspectives. On the one hand, your friend’s requests for favors might cause you to become irritated and indignant, since he has not repaid his debts. On the other hand, you care for your friend and want to help him. I refer to the first perspective as “scorekeeping,” as it considers primarily the balance between benefits provided and benefits received. I refer to the second perspective as “bonding,” as it focuses on the needs of the other person. In this case, should the scorekeeping perspective prevail, you would probably refuse to grant your friend’s latest request. In contrast, should the bonding perspective prevail, you will probably help him again. This dissertation focuses on these two perspectives. I will use evolutionary psychological arguments to provide a theoretical background for the scorekeeping and bonding perspectives, and derive hypotheses about their occurrence. Evolutionary psychology considers these perspectives to be rules or heuristics that have evolved to cope with recurrent situations that our ancestors encountered. Such rules or heuristics are called proximate mechanisms, as they describe how people behave in particular domains of social life. However, when applying an evolutionary framework, proximate mechanisms cannot be studied in isolation from the question of why they evolved among our ancestors. In other words, what were the benefits of these proximate mechanisms to the survival and reproduction of individuals (i. e., an individual’s fitness) ? The answer to this question provides the ultimate cause of these mechanisms. According to evolutionary psychology, the fitness benefit, or ultimate cause of helping or doing favors for another unrelated individual boils down to reciprocal altruism: helping another individual can be beneficial if that individual reciprocates in the future. Most evolutionary psychologists consider scorekeeping to be the primary mechanism of reciprocal altruism. The reason is that individuals who accept help but never return anything are better off in terms of fitness than are individuals who provide unconditional help. Therefore, a mechanism has evolved that leads us to keep track of benefits provided and benefits received and to avoid help individuals who do not repay their debts. Recently, however, several scholars have come to realize that scorekeeping mechanisms cannot explain all instances of reciprocal altruism and that another mechanism, such as bonding, might be at work. Moreover, taking the conditions of our evolutionary past into account, scorekeeping mechanisms may have even been detrimental to fitness. Yet, the concept of a bonding mechanism has not received much attention in evolutionary psychology. The primary goal of this dissertation is therefore to demonstrate that the scorekeeping mechanism is not so ubiquitous as is generally believed and to show that there is considerable evidence for the operation of an additional mechanism. At some points I will go a step further, arguing that bonding is the primary mechanism of reciprocal altruism, whereas scorekeeping is a relatively recent cultural adaptation. Since emotions are considered to play an important role in the evolutionary psychological concept of proximate mechanisms, a third goal is to examine the effect of emotions on typical bonding and scorekeeping behavior. ...|$|E
