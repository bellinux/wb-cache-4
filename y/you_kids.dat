6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>kids</b> {{have gone}} and done it now," [...] was Mary's greeting, as she joined {{them in the}} Valley. Miss Cornelia was up at Ingleside, holding agonized {{conclave}} with Anne and Susan, and Mary hoped that the session might be a long one, for it was all of two weeks since she {{had been allowed to}} revel with her chums in the dear valley of rainbows.|$|E

[...] "I've come to know how thin-skinned you are on that point, and ain't counting on giving either of you {{the value of a}} pin.

But there's excuses, and you can just gamble I'm the old boy who knows. <b>You</b> <b>kids</b> were scared to death. What hurts me, Peg, is the throw-down we got from my old team and from the students. We're not to blame for rules made by fat-head directors. I was surprised at Dale. He was mean, and so were Hollis and Hickle--all of 'em. They didn't need to disgrace us like that." ...|$|E

It's mighty little I get out of these fictional jobs, anyhow. I lose all the loot, and I have to reform every time; and all the swag I'm allowed is the blamed little fol-de-rols and luck-pieces that <b>you</b> <b>kids</b> hand over. Why, in one story, all I got was a kiss from a little girl who came in on me when I was opening a safe. And it tasted of molasses candy, too. I've a good notion to tie this table cover over your head and keep on into the silver-closet." ...|$|E

I {{had to sign}} {{articles}} with Natchez--had to {{let them}} have their umpire. So we're up against it. But we'll hit this pitcher Muckle Harris. He ain't got any steam. An' he ain't got much nerve. Now every feller who goes up to bat {{wants to talk to}} Muck. Call him a big swelled stiff. Tell him he can't break a pane of glass--tell him he can't put one over the pan--tell him it he does you'll slam it down in the sand bank. Bluff the whole team. Keep scrappy all the time. See! That's my game today. This Natchez bunch needs to be gone after. Holler at the umpire. Act like you want to fight." ...|$|E

The man who couldn't say a good word now never ought to set in anywhere, because there's a deal more than {{something}} to eat, if you boys will only look at it in the right light. In the first place you've spread yourself because Ninety-four's kid has the same as got into the Department, and perhaps some of you think he's lucky. I tell <b>you,</b> <b>kids,</b> luck hadn't anything to do with it. Seth is being made a fireman because whatever he struck he stuck at, and never let a living chance go by him. When he first came up to Ninety-four's house we gave him the cold shoulder, but he kept plugging away till we grew to like his pluck; yet nobody held out a hand to him till he'd hung to his idea so long that we jest couldn't help ourselves. He worked in where he wanted to go, and so can every one of you. I ain't holding that all of us are born to be firemen, but whatever we count on being we've got to work for, and work hard. Do that, and you'll pull through in pretty nigh everything you tackle." ...|$|E
