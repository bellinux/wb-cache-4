5|$|Far Rockaway is {{notably the}} oldest station {{currently}} in {{operation in the}} New York City Subway, having originally opened over 145 years ago, on July 29, 1869, as a Long Island Rail Road station. However, Gates Avenue on the BMT Jamaica Line in Brooklyn is the oldest station in the subway system to have been built as a rapid transit station, {{and has been in}} continuous operation for over 130 years. The Far Rockaway station was converted from Long Island Rail Road trackage to subway loading gauge and has only operated for 57 <b>years</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> capacity. Therefore, Far Rockaway is actually the fifteenth newest station in the subway system (behind Grand Street; Harlem–148th Street; 57th Street; the three Archer Avenue Line stations; the three IND 63rd Street Line stations; the new South Ferry station; 34th Street–Hudson Yards; and the three Second Avenue Subway stations).|$|E
