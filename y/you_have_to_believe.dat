While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew [...] "fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well {{to make it as}} practical as possible." [...] Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, [...] "I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw." [...] Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in Northanger Abbey.|$|E
500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003. Two goals {{in the space of}} three minutes, scored by Svensson and Tessem was enough to take the team into the quarter-finals. Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam was pleased with the win and said {{following}} the match: [...] "When you get to this stage in the competition <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> you can win it." [...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to go inside the goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E
500|$|Nikita and Maggie Q's {{portrayal}} of the character was met with generally positive reactions from television critics. Nikita was included in TV Guides lists of [...] "TV's Sexiest Crime Fighters" [...] and [...] "TV's Toughest Ladies". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times felt that Q was suited for the role, stating [...] "she has a solemn, exotic beauty and hauteur that echo the heroine's self-possession and cool relentlessness," [...] adding [...] "Nikita is noticeably more hard-boiled and less girlish than the undercover agent played by Jennifer Garner on Alias, or the C.I.A. rookie that Piper Perabo plays on Covert Affairs." [...] Troy Patterson of Slate felt that [...] "Ms. Q's Nikita is only half so crush-worthy as Bionic Woman's Jaime Sommers or Dollhouse's what's-her-name, but her predicament is no less tasty." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today believed Q's performance was [...] "a fairly sizable incentive" [...] to watch the show, adding she [...] "combines stunt-fighting chops and lithe beauty with an unusual-for-the-genre air of somber intelligence. Her Nikita is not above cracking a joke, but it's clear from Q's eyes and bearing that she has suffered {{at the hands of}} evil men, and she's {{not going to take it}} anymore." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix believed that Q [...] "carries herself in a way that makes it believable she could be a hard-core killer, and she has the requisite dramatic chops and charisma for the part." [...] Maureen Ryan of AOL TV said [...] "Maggie Q, has real charisma and presence; she invests Nikita's drive to bring down the secretive Division with potent energy. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Nikita would devote her life to wreaking vengeance on the people she views as her former captors, and you also have to buy her as a butt-kicking, gun-toting action heroine who also looks great in a cocktail gown. Maggie Q makes all those things look easy." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yes, my friends. These {{are very}} terrible {{thoughts}}--very wrong thoughts some of them, very foolish thoughts some of them, though pardonable enough; for God pardons them, {{as we shall}} see. But they are real thoughts. They are what really come into people's minds every day; and I am here {{to talk to you}} about what is really going on in your soul, and mine; not to repeat to you doctrines at second-hand out of a book, and say, There, that is what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> and do; and, if you do not, you will go to hell: but to speak to you as men of like passions with myself; as sinning, sorrowing, doubting, struggling human beings; and to talk to you of what is in my own heart, and will be in your hearts too, some day, if it has not been already. This is the experience of all REAL men, all honest men, who ever struggled to know and to do what is right. David felt it all. You find it all through those glorious Psalms of his. He was no comfortable, book-read, second-hand Christian, who had an answer ready for every trouble, because he had never had any real trouble at all. David was not one of them. He had to go through a very rough training--very terrible and fiery trials, year after year; and had to say, again and again, 'I am weary of crying; my heart is dry; my heart faileth me for waiting so long upon my God. All thy billows and storms are gone over me. Thou hast laid me in a place of darkness, and in the lowest deep.' - ...|$|E

Forty-five percent of Americans think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in God to be moral. Secular voices are considered immoral. They are not listened to on that basis.
