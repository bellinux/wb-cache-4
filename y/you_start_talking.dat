In the Oakland, California premiere, two sold-out screenings were a testament {{to the success of the}} campaign. Effie Tesfahun, one of the organizers, explained, “When Lucas said Hollywood does not want to touch black films, it really hit me … I thought we should get together and all go and support film.
