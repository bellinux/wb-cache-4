Frequently Asked Questions What’s the difference between using a database and searching Google? Information in databases has been reviewed and edited by experts and comes from reliable, authoritative sources.

40|$|These Guidelines <b>are</b> {{designed}} <b>to</b> {{ensure that}} you carefully consider the overall impacts of herbicide use on your conservation targets, other native species, and the ecological system. Base all decisions whether to control weeds, and whether <b>to</b> <b>use</b> herbicides instead of other methods, on the conservation targets and management goals for the site. In addition, {{the health and safety}} of applicators and others in the vicinity must be considered BEFORE pesticides are applied. Simply put, one should be confident that the proposed herbicide will do more conservation good than harm and not endanger the health of the applicators or others in the area. TO SPRAY OR NOT TO SPRAY? Determining the right course of action in weed management can be difficult. For many land managers, whether <b>to</b> apply herbicides <b>is</b> an ethical decision that is not taken lightly. Herbicides are often used as a last resort, when other attempts have failed, and action is imperative. The following checklist summarizes the steps that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken <b>to</b> ensure that proper consideration has <b>been</b> given <b>to</b> current weed problems, and that the use of herbicides is warranted for each individual case. 1. Determine whether invasive plants threaten conservation targets or management goals on the site. Use herbicides (versus other control methods) only if confidant they can be used safely and will do more conservation good than harm.
