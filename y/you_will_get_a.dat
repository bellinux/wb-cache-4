500|$|Bowie drew {{criticism}} {{during the}} tour for his alleged pro-fascist views. In a 1974 interview he had declared, [...] "Adolf Hitler {{was one of}} the first rock stars... quite as good as Jagger... He staged a country", but managed to avoid condemnation. On the Station to Station tour, however, a series of incidents attracted publicity, starting in April 1976 with his detention by customs in Eastern Europe for possession of Nazi memorabilia. The same month he was quoted in Stockholm as saying that [...] "Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader". Bowie would blame his addictions and the persona of the Thin White Duke for his lapses in judgment. The controversy culminated on 2 May 1976, shortly before the tour completed, in the so-called 'Victoria Station incident' in London, when Bowie arrived in an open-top Mercedes convertible and apparently gave a Nazi salute to the crowd that was captured on film and published in NME. Bowie claimed that the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave, a contention backed by a young Gary Numan who was among the crowd that day: [...] "Think about it. If a photographer takes a whole motor-driven film of someone doing a wave, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> Nazi salute at the end of each arm-sweep. All you need is some dickhead at a music paper or whatever to make an issue out it..." [...] The stigma remained, however, to the extent that the lines [...] "To be insulted by these fascists/It's so degrading" [...] from Scary Monsters opening track [...] "It's No Game", four years later, were interpreted as an attempt to bury the incident once and for all.|$|E

But {{director}} Bala doesn't really capitalize on its strengths, and never pulls you into the story except in parts which is disappointing, as he is among today's trend-setters in Tamil cinema." [...] Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu claimed that [...] "the intermission leaves you wondering at the frivolousness and facileness of the story that's very much unlike Bala. Nothing much happens in the first hour or so. Thankfully, he makes amends with a riveting climax." [...] A critic from Oneindia.in cited: [...] "Watch the film for the expression of ‘Nava Rasas’ just after the interval bang and the climax scene and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> feel that it is a 100 per cent paisa vasool." [...] Chennai Onlines reviewer stated that Bala had [...] "attempted to provide us with a film that has comical elements as its major strength. He has gone overboard and failed to present it with coherent script. As a result the movie {{turns out to be a}} disappointing experience despite having stunning performances", while Indiaglitz commented: [...] "All said, Avan Ivan is not a typical Bala film, and it has its own dull moments, courtesy cliched scenes and dragging second half. But it also has many ingredients to entertain the masses." [...] CNN-IBN wrote: [...] "Overall Avan Ivan suffers from a sloppy script despite having some fine performances. The lack of balance between Bala's emphatic portrayal of different kind of life and his effort to provide fun is the major problem of the movie. The fun becomes farce and the seriousness turns out to be ineffective." ...|$|E
