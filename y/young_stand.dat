40|$|The {{majority}} of managed forests in Fennoscandia are younger than 70 years old but yet {{little is known}} about their potential to host rare and threatened species. In this study, we examined red-listed bryophytes and lichens in 19 <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> originating from clear-cutting (30 – 70 years old) in the boreal region, finding 19 red-listed species (six bryophytes and 13 lichens). We used adjoining old stands, which most likely never had been clear-cut, as reference. The old stands contained significantly more species, but when taking the amount of biological legacies (i. e., remaining deciduous trees and dead wood) from the previous forest generation into account, bryophyte species number did not differ between old and <b>young</b> <b>stands,</b> and lichen number was even higher in <b>young</b> <b>stands.</b> No dispersal effect could be detected from the old to the <b>young</b> <b>stands.</b> The amount of wetlands in the surroundings was important for bryophytes, as was the area of old forest for both lichens and bryophytes. A cardinal position of <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> to the north of old stands was beneficial to red-listed bryophytes as well as lichens. We conclude that young forest plantations may function as habitat for red-listed species, but that this depends on presence of structures from the previous forest generation, and also on qualities in the surrounding landscape. Nevertheless, at repeated clear-cuttings, a successive decrease in species populations in <b>young</b> production <b>stands</b> is likely, due to increased fragmentation and reduced substrate amounts. Retention of dead wood and deciduous trees might be efficient conservation measures. Although priority needs to be given to preservation of remnant old-growt...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} ages and {{diameter}} {{growth rates of}} trees in former Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) old-growth stands on 10 sites and compared them with young-growth stands (50 - 70 years old, regenerated after timber harvest) in the Coast Range of western Oregon. The diameters and diameter growth rates for the first 100 years of trees in the old-growth stands were significantly greater {{than those in the}} young-growth stands. Growth rates in the old stands were comparable with those from long-term studies of <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> in which density is about 100 - 120 trees/ha; often young-growth stand density is well over 500 trees/ha. Ages of large trees in the old stands ranged from 100 to 420 years; ages in <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> varied by only about 5 to 10 years. Apparently, regeneration of old-growth stands on these sites occurred over a prolonged period, and trees grew at low density with little self-thinning; in contrast, after timber harvest, <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> may develop with high density of trees with similar ages and considerable self-thinning. The results suggest that thinning may be needed in dense <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> where the management objective is to speed development of old-growth characteristics...|$|R

30|$|Although {{the scatter}} plots of Fig.  5 do not reveal any narrow stand stage which is optimal for fertilization, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that very <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> or dense mature stands should not be fertilized.

30|$|It is also {{important}} to bear in mind that 5 % or 10 % thresholds have different ranges for each plot characterized by different values of variables. Obviously, for higher values of variables, such range is greater. This fact has also its reflection on the stand structure. Namely, if we consider the height of the stands (in the study case expressed as 95 th of the height of ALS point cloud), <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> usually have lower height variations and height ranges of particular trees within these stands. Accordingly, height related ALS variables extracted at locations of <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> have smaller values as well, thus the tolerance threshold for aggregation of adjacent and similarly <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> is narrower. A similar situation exists in case of older stands, where heights of particular trees differ to the greater extent than it was for <b>young</b> <b>stands.</b> Therefore there should be an adequate response of ALS variables, resulting in wider tolerance interval for those stands. Such dependency seems to be reasonable for outlining stands with similar variations of given parameter or their combinations. Another situation will be when we set a specified threshold e.g. 1  m, not relative one as in our study. Then similar criteria will be set for whole and thus relatively smaller variance for old stands may be observed. This obviously will change the size of HPs for different age classes.|$|R

40|$|Different {{age groups}} were {{recognised}} in a mangrove forest that progressed over a delta forming after {{the construction of}} a harbour in the Umhlatuze Estuary, South Africa in 1976. The rate of progress was high during the first period, varying from 20 to 55 ha year− 1 until 1982. Thereafter there was a small decrease in the total area, whereas the rate has been 5. 4 ha year− 1 over the last 13 years. Diameter at breast height (dbh) and densities of trees and seedlings were investigated in the field in the different age groups recognised from the aerial photo record covering the area. The <b>youngest</b> <b>stands</b> (1 - 6 years old trees) had a significantly lower mean dbh compared to the older stands (> 6 years).

The problem will not be solved only by the private forest owners, professional help is needed. Skogsägarna Mellanskog is one of four forest unions in Sweden who wants to play a role and take responsibility for forestry in the middle of Sweden. This academic essay is based on a market survey sent to 350 forest owners in the Örebro district. 186 of them answered the questions, giving a response frequence of 53 percentage. The purpose of the essay is to find the determining factors which will make a forest owner to find a collaborator when planning and carrying out the silviculture measures in <b>young</b> <b>stands.</b> The result of the survey shows that the forest owners are anxious about the price and the costs. The costs have a severe effect if the silviculture measures in <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> will be carried out or not. Another important factor is the personal connection with a forest advicer. This person often has an extended knowledge about forestry and if the owner put a trust in such a person, measures will be taken. The forest advicer who is listening to the forest owner, giving advices and finding solutions, will make the quality most important and the costs less important. Forest owners who does not live on the property, is often inquiring a total solution for the silviculture measures in <b>young</b> <b>stands.</b> Through mutual efforts it is possible to change the negative prevailing trend in the silviculture measures in <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> showing bad pre commercial thinning result, returning to the thinning levels reached in times when pre-commercial thinning obligations still existed.

40|$|In {{order to}} speed up the {{production}} of small-sized thinning wood chips in <b>young</b> <b>stands,</b> the Finnish State provides financial incentives for the production of small-diameter wood chips. Financial support is provided according to the Sustainable Silviculture Foundation Law (Kemera). Currently (Summer 2008), the Kemera support provides subsidies for small-sized wood chips in early thinnings 7 – 10 €/MWh maximum in typical harvesting conditions (whole-tree chip removal 40 – 70 m 3 /ha, and average stem size of removal 10 – 40 dm 3). Metsäteho Oy undertook a study on the total production costs of small-sized thinning wood chips with and without the Kemera supports. The results gave a clear indication that small-sized wood chips cannot currently be produced without the Kemera supports from <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> with typical harvesting conditions. If operating without the Kemera supports, the average stem size of whole trees harvested must be greater than 80 dm 3, at the current price level of small-diameter wood chips in order for the harvesting of small-diameter energy wood from <b>young</b> <b>stands</b> to be economically profitable in Finland...|$|R
50|$|One {{to three}} olive or tan coloured, glossy eggs (two eggs being the average) are laid by the female in May or June. The nests, which are shallow scrapes {{made by the}} female on dry, soft slopes and plains, are usually {{situated}} close to the prior lek location. Nests are situated in sparse clusters, with a study in Inner Mongolia finding nests at a minimal 9 m apart from each other. In the same study, nests were placed at mid-elevation on a hill, at about 190 to 230 m. Nesting sites are typically in dense grassy vegetation about 15 to 35 cm, likely for protection against predation, with extensive exposure to sunlight. Eggs weigh about 150 g and are on average 79.4 mm tall by 56.8 mm wide. The female incubates the eggs alone for 21 to 28 days. The chicks almost immediately leave the nest after they hatch, although they do not move very far from their mother until they are at least 1 year old. Young great bustards begin developing their adult plumage at about 2 months, and begin to develop flying skills at the same time. They practice by stretching, running, flapping, and making small hops and jumps to get airborne. By three months {{they are able to}} fly reasonable distances. If threatened, the <b>young</b> <b>stand</b> still, using their downy plumage, mainly sepia in colour with paler buffy streaks, as camouflage.

40|$|I used {{litterfall}} sampling {{to estimate}} the biomass, diversity, and community structure of epiphytic lichens in three dry forest cover types in the eastern Washington Cascade range. Cover types represented a temperature/moisture and stand structural complexity gradient. Lichen litterfall biomass increased with increasing stand complexity and moisture. Lichen litterfall biomass was 3. 42 kg/ha in open pine stands, 7. 51 kg/ha in <b>young</b> mixed-species <b>stands,</b> 8. 55 kg/ha in mature mixed-species stands. Six species accounted for 63 % {{of the total sample}} biomass: Bryoria capillaris (20. 2 %), Hypogymnia mshaugii (15. 8 %), Letharia vulpina (14. 5 %), B. fremontii (7. 2 %), Nodobryoria bbreviata (2. 8 %), and Alectoria sarmentosa (2. 6 %). Bryoria tortuosa, considered rare in most of its range, was relatively common in young forest. Epiphytic lichen species richness and dominance did not differ among the three forest cover types. Lichen associations differed, however, among cover types. The dominant lichen in open pine stands was L. vulpina, followed by Bryoria spp., H. imshaugii, and L. columbiana. Vulpicida canadensis and L. columbiana were weak indicator species. <b>Young</b> <b>stands</b> were dominated by H. imshaugii, a strong indicator species of <b>young</b> <b>stands,</b> followed by B. capillaris and L. vulpina.
