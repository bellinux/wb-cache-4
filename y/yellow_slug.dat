50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>slug</b> {{is common}} in Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland {{as well as most}} of {{southern}} and western Europe. It has been accidentally introduced in many other parts of the world.|$|E
50|$|Like all slugs, the <b>yellow</b> <b>slug</b> moves {{relatively}} slowly, gliding along using {{a series}} of muscular contractions {{on the underside of}} its foot, which is lubricated with mucus, such that it leaves a slime trail behind it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>slugs,</b> {{like the}} {{majority}} of other land slugs, use two pairs of tentacles on their heads to sense their environment. The upper pair, called optical tentacles, is used to sense light. The lower pair, oral tentacles, provide the slug's sense of smell. Both pairs can retract and extend themselves to avoid hazards, and, if lost to an accident or predation, can be regrown.|$|R
50|$|Okenia elegans, the <b>yellow</b> skirt <b>slug,</b> is {{a species}} of a sea slug, {{specifically}} a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Goniodorididae. It is the type species of its genus.|$|R
50|$|Limax flavus (syn. Limacus flavus), known {{commonly}} as {{the cellar}} slug, the <b>yellow</b> <b>slug,</b> or the tawny garden slug, is a medium to large species of air-breathing land slug, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk {{in the family}} Limacidae.|$|E

They expanded over the years throughout New York State. During the 1960s, a <b>yellow</b> <b>slug</b> character served as Carrols' first mascot, replaced in 1974 by a young blonde boy wearing a tweed suit and a Fedora hat.|$|E
50|$|This nudibranch {{is usually}} less than 2 inches in length. It has a yellow {{body with a}} pale mantle margin that has two semi-permanent mantle folds about mid-body. The rhinophores and branchia (gills) are also yellow. However, {{identifying}} individual <b>yellow</b> sea <b>slugs</b> within the genus Diversidoris can be challenging because yellow forms exist in many related species.|$|R
40|$|Slugs {{belong to}} {{a large group of}} animals called Mollusks that {{includes}} clams, oysters, squid, octopus, and snails- slugs closest relative. Snails cause similar damage as slugs, but usually are not as serious a pest in the Pacific Northwest. Outside the garden, slugs and snails actually do good things. They recycle organic matter, which helps to build soils, and {{are an important part of}} the foodchain. Inside the garden and landscape, however, slugs and snails can do considerable damage and often must be controlled. The most common slug species are the Gray garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum, and the European slug, Arion ater. The native <b>Yellow</b> green banana <b>slug,</b> Ariolimax columbianus, is most often found in wooded areas. Slugs vary in length, depending on species and age, from 1 / 4 inch to as much as 10 inches. They move or glide on a “foot”, which produces the slime that helps them move. Their eyes are at the end of stalks, which can be drawn back into their head at the sign of danger. Slugs are active largely at night. They feed during the night and on cool, cloudy days. If the weather is hot and dry, slugs hide beneath stones, flower boxes, boards, and dense plant cover such as ivy. Slugs avoid dry, dusty areas. Slugs have both male and female reproductive systems. Slugs can live from 1 to 2 years, and can begin to lay eggs when they are a...|$|R
