25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Fritz Klein developed the Klein sexual orientation grid (KSOG), a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation. Introduced in Klein's book The Bisexual Option (1978), the KSOG uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would you choose if it were completely <b>your</b> <b>choice).</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the single campaign is {{a number of different}} battle scenarios, in which your pre-selected force will combat a number of enemy forces. Winning the scenario will award the player gold. Between battles the game switches to a map of the area, with the location of their army denoted by a figure of their champion. The player is then able to select his or her army and move to another location. This will bring up a force selection screen, and the player will then have to select a limited number of troops and heroes to play the next scenario with. Although the campaign is for the most part linear, there are also optional side quests, which although mostly unrelated to the main story will usually result in the heroes acquiring additional gold, troops or equipment {{that can be used in}} the campaign. As well as traditional large scale battles there are also Duel scenarios in which a hero character of <b>your</b> <b>choice</b> will enter straight into a duel with an enemy champion, with victory of either champion immediately ending the scenario.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's {{workload}} throughout 1974, {{particularly his}} dedication to setting up Dark Horse Records as the Beatles' Apple record label was being wound down, left him rushing {{to prepare for}} the tour by October while also completing Dark Horse. Another issue that compromised Harrison's enthusiasm for the concerts was the attention afforded them as the first US tour by a former Beatle, resulting in a clash between the artist's self-image and the expectations of many critics and concertgoers. Among the criticism levelled at him during the tour, Harrison's declarations of his Hindu-aligned religious beliefs came across as harangues rather than uplifting messages to his fans, and were symbolic of what NME critic Bob Woffinden later described as a [...] "didactic, sermonising mood" [...] on the singer's part. For the shows' encore, Harrison turned his biggest solo hit, [...] "My Sweet Lord", into an [...] "exhortation to chant God's name", author Alan Clayson writes, be it Krishna, Buddha, Christ or Allah. At times during Shankar's set, he chastised the audience for their lack of respect for Indian music and a God-conscious path. Early in the tour, Harrison also used religiosity to defend his decision to feature few Beatles-era songs in the setlist, telling Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone magazine: [...] "Gandhi says create and preserve the image of <b>your</b> <b>choice.</b> The image of my choice is not Beatle George ... My life belongs to the Lord Krishna ... I'm the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of Krishna." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Beckerlegge, {{there was}} a view held by many of those {{involved}} in the keenly fought struggle between Williams and Müller that more depended on the result than simply one man's career– missionary success or failure in India, [...] "and even the future stability of British rule in this region" [...] (in the light of events in India a few years previously) might depend on the abilities of the Boden professor. Victory would depend on each side's ability to persuade non-resident members of Convocation to return to Oxford to cast their votes. Each candidate had their supporters: Müller was backed by scholars of international merit, whereas Williams was able to call upon Oxford-based academics and those who had served in India as administrators or missionaries. Both candidates claimed support from Wilson– [...] "as if the principle of apostolic succession was involved in the appointment", says Chaudhuri. The Times reported on 23 May that friends of Williams placed considerable weight upon a private letter to him from Wilson, [...] "indicating Mr. Williams as his probable successor." [...] In return, Wilson was revealed to have said [...] "two months before his death" [...] that [...] "Mr. Max Müller was the first Sanskrit scholar in Europe". The source of this information was W. S. W. Vaux, of the British Museum, who described his conversation with Wilson in a letter to Müller in May 1860. In reply to Vaux's comment that he and others wanted Wilson's successor to be [...] "the finest man we could procure", Vaux quoted Wilson as saying that [...] "You will be quite right if <b>your</b> <b>choice</b> should fall on Max Müller." ...|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is <b>your</b> <b>choice</b> to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of your bedroom mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if you are looking for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but seem to work with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E
