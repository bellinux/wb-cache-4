2500|$|In June 2008, Kiribati {{officials}} asked Australia and New Zealand {{to accept}} Kiribati citizens as permanent refugees. Kiribati {{is expected to}} be the first country to lose all its land territory to global warming. In June 2008, the Kiribati President Anote Tong said that the country has reached [...] "the point of no return." [...] He added, [...] "To plan for the day when <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have a country is indeed painful but I think we have to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, while Song {{carried the}} long-abandoned and now-reinstituted titles of Left Prime Minister (左丞相, Zuo Chengxiang) and Da Shitu (大師徒, a more {{magnified}} {{form of the}} title of Situ, one of the Three Excellencies) in the new Southern Tang administration, he was not given real responsibilities. [...] He became so displeased that when an imperial edict was read out loud, honoring him referred to him as [...] "Our friend from when we wore civilian clothing," [...] he loudly replied, [...] "When your subject was wearing civilian clothing, Your Imperial Majesty was a prefect; now that Your Imperial Majesty is the Son of Heaven, <b>you</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> need this old subject." [...] After making the comment, he went home and expected punishment. [...] Emperor Liezu issued another edict thanking him but not giving him additional responsibilities. [...] Unsure {{what to do to}} regain the emperor's trust, he submitted petitions requesting that Yang Pu (whom Emperor Liezu continued to honor as a retired emperor and allowed to live at the palace in Guangling, while Southern Tang's capital was set at Jinling (i.e., Sheng Prefecture)) be moved out of Guangling and be given a lesser title, so that people would not be tempted to rebel to restore Wu, and that the marriage between Emperor Liezu's daughter Princess Yongxing and Yang Pu's son Yang Lian the Duke of Hongnong (the former crown prince) be severed. [...] Emperor Liezu did not accept either proposal. [...] When Song again objected in 938 that, as Left Prime Minister, he should be allowed to participate in the governance, Emperor Liezu gave the excuse that the office building had not been built yet. [...] Meanwhile, apparently accepting one of Song's ideas after all (and with Yang Pu himself being uncomfortable remaining at Guangling as a former emperor), Emperor Liezu moved Yang Pu and the former Wu imperial family from Guangling to Run Prefecture and put them under secure guard. [...] Still, when Song subsequently again complained about being separated from the emperor by wicked people, Emperor Liezu became publicly angry, causing Song to again return to his home to wait for punishment. [...] When others spoke on his behalf, Emperor Liezu commented, [...] "Song Qiqiu is talented but does not know what is appropriate." [...] He sent Xu Jingtong (whose name would soon thereafter be changed to Li Jing by this point and who had, as the emperor's oldest son, been created the Prince of Wu, as Emperor Liezu had himself restored his birth name of Li in order to claim legitimate succession from Tang Dynasty, apparently under a suggestion initially made by Song) to Song's mansion to recall him to the government, and Song subsequently returned. [...] Subsequently, Emperor Liezu accepted another suggestion of Song's — that when a Khitan emissary arrived, the emissary was treated with great honors, {{but as soon as the}} emissary headed north, back across the Huai River (i.e., now in Later Jin territory), assassins were sent to kill him, so that the killing could be blamed on Later Jin. [...] It was said that this incident did bring frictions between Later Jin and Khitan (whose aid was critical in Later Jin's establishment). [...] Meanwhile, it was also at Song's proposal (although apparently a proposal driven by Emperor Liezu himself) that when Emperor Liezu established the seven imperial ancestral temples, while most of the temples were dedicated to Emperor Liezu's biological Li ancestors, Emperor Liezu's adoptive father Xu Wen was given one of the three most honored temple positions (and given the temple name of Yizu), along with Tang's first two emperors Emperor Gaozu and Emperor Taizong.|$|E
