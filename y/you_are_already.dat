25|$|<b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> {{familiar}} with the general subject of the earlier financial transactions of this company. The record is a disgraceful one. Even before the acquisition of stock by the Northern Pacific, the enterprise {{appears to have been}} robbed by its promoters.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of the Staircase, Curreri's 2004 release saw {{the return}} of Jeff Romano, who {{produced}} and performed on 2002's From Long Gones to Hawkmoth. The title of the record comes from a French expression l'esprit d'escalier, the things you think to say after <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> out the door. His first live album, Are You Going to Paul Curreri was recorded at Charlottesville's (now-defunct) Gravity Lounge, and released in 2006. Musical backing was provided by Charlottesvillians Randall Pharr (bass) and Spencer Lathrop (drums).|$|E
25|$|You stand {{convicted of}} the truly evil {{abduction}} and murder of a vulnerable young girl in 1991 and thereafter of attempting to defeat the ends of justice in various ways over an extended period... Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done... I fix the minimum period which you must spend in custody at 30 years. Had it been open to me I would have made that period run consecutive to the 21 year custodial period that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> serving.|$|E

500|$|The {{failure to}} prosecute the trio with federal charges caused some {{speculation}} about a government cover-up, particularly revolving around Troy Eid, who was appointed U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush, and {{has been accused of}} showing political biases. Some questioned why Eid did not pursue federal charges against Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson, but filed similar charges against Marc Harold Ramsey, who allegedly sent a threatening letter to 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain from behind bars in the Arapahoe County Jail. Ramsey, who faced five years in federal prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted, sent McCain a package with a harmless white powdery substance and a letter that read, [...] "Senator McCain, If you are reading this then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> DEAD! Unless of course you can't or don't breathe." [...] Eid said the Ramsey case was [...] "absolutely distinguishable" [...] from that of Gartrell, Adolf and Johnson because {{there was no evidence of}} actual planning on the part of the trio.|$|E
2500|$|... ”You who are already, by {{the will}} of God and the {{commands}} of your father, lawfully married to noble wives of your own nation, whom you are bound to cherish. And certainly it is not lawful for you to put away the wives you have and marry others, or ally yourselves in marriage with a foreign people, a thing never done by any of your ancestors.... It is wicked of you even to entertain the thought of marrying again when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> married. You ought not to act thus, who profess to follow the law of God, and punish others to prevent men acting in this unlawful manner. Such things do the heathen. But they {{ought not to be}} done by you who are Christians, a holy people and a kingly priesthood.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "On this head <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already</b> assured. Your own {{previous}} knowledge, and John Effingham's distinct declarations, {{make your}} mother blameless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Queen of {{my heart}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>already,</b> and though the throne be humble it is sure. The life you saved is yours, and no other's." ...|$|E

3000|$|It {{helped with}} the {{revising}} what we’d <b>already</b> <b>been</b> taught more so than actually learning the stuff because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> asking questions about things you’d already taught us [and] I guess that does help {{in the long run}} of actually understanding (Student 7) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|Though {{the words}} {{themselves}} were assuring, {{there was something}} in the tone of his voice which repressed her. [...] "To <b>you</b> I <b>am</b> true and faithful in all things; as faithful as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> my husband.

5000|$|One of the {{earliest}} references in Christian literature {{to the concept of}} the common good is found in the Epistle of Barnabas: [...] "Do not live entirely isolated, having retreated into yourselves, as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> fully justified, but gather instead to seek together the common good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true, poor Miles; very true," [...] Mr. Hardinge added, in an apologetic manner; [...] "I see the {{weakness}} of my comparison, though I was beginning to hope <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>already</b> regarding Lucy, once more, with {{the eyes of a}} brother.

6000|$|... "I {{should never}} have spoken about your affairs," [...] said the other, not noticing the young man's haughty tone, [...] "but that you {{yourself}} confided them to me.
