40|$|Lane {{departure}} warning (LDW) is {{a driver}} warning system designed {{to reduce the number}} of unintended lane departures. We addressed warning effectiveness and customer acceptance when the unintended lane departures are the result of drowsy driving. Thirty-two adults who were sleep deprived for 23 hours participated in the study and drove Ford's VIRTTEX driving simulator. Four Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for LDW were evaluated: Steering Wheel Torque, Rumble Strip Sound, Steering Wheel Vibration and Head Up Display. A <b>yaw</b> <b>deviation</b> technique was used to produce controlled lane departures in the first two hours of the drive while for the last 20 minutes driver-initiated lane departures were analyzed. The Steering Wheel Vibration HMI, accompanied by Steering Wheel Torque, was found to be the most effective HMI for LDW in a group of drowsy drivers, with faster reaction times and smaller lane excursions. The Vibration HMI was also perceived by the drowsy drivers to be acceptable and helpful...|$|E
40|$|A high {{precision}} stabilized platform {{has been developed}} at the University of Applied Sciences, Bochum. The platform is designed to carry different types of remote sensing devices- {{with the exception of}} large format mapping cameras. The system is able to provide precisely stabilized imagery even for low flying light aircrafts under turbulent air conditions. Residual image inclinations and <b>yaw</b> <b>deviations</b> will be recorded. Together with the data of the (D) GPS augmented inertial navigation system (INS) the complete exterior orientation data are delivered. The GPS receivers used are the single frequency receivers LEICA MX 9400 providing an accuracy of about 0. 3 m. GPS positioning is based on very precise code phase measurement with the advantage that the ambiguity resolution problem does not exist and thus operation is possible up to several hundred kilometers far from the GPS ground reference station. The inertial navigation system is the low cost strapdown INS LCR 88 from LITEF, Germany. In the GPS augmented mode the inertial navigation system (INS) delivers the phi and omega angles with an accuracy of 0. 02 ° and the kappa angle with an accuracy of 0. 1 °...|$|R
40|$|A high {{precision}} stabilized platform {{has been developed}} at the University of Applied Sciences Bochum- in cooperation with others. The platform is designed to carry different types of remote sensing devices. It is the goal {{that the system is}} able to provide precisely stabilized imagery even for low flying light aircrafts under turbulent air conditions. Residual image inclinations and <b>yaw</b> <b>deviations</b> are recorded. Together with the data of the (D) GPS augmented inertial navigation system (INS) the complete exterior orientation data are delivered. At the University of Kassel (Control Engineering and System Theory Group) detailed model equations in DE-form (differential equations) of the spatial motions of the stabi-lized platform have been developed. These model equations serve as basis for a computer simulation of the mechanism, for nonlinear and linear controller design and model parameter identification using test flight data. The computer sim-ulation is used to investigate the influence of various control algorithms, filter algorithms, actuators and other components under various external and internal disturbances in order to find optimal solutions for a fast and precise stabilization of a remote sensing device (camera, scanner, video, etc.). A research airplane is available to measure in-flight data under different air conditions. By a comparison of actual in-flight data and simulation data, a detailed analysis of the system is carried out. The results of this research work are considered to be of basic importance for imaging systems to be operated under turbulent air conditions (e. g. light aircraft flying low). To produce optimal coverage with a scanning system or wit...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{intensity}} modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients, {{an effective}} immobilisation system {{is important to}} minimise set up deviation. This study evaluated the effectiveness of three immobilisation systems by assessing their set up deviations. Methods: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the three immobilisation systems: (1) supine on head rest and base plate (HB) MergeCell (2) supine with alpha cradle supporting the head and shoulder (AC) MergeCell (3) supine with vacuum bag supporting the head and shoulder (VB). CBCT was conducted weekly for each patient on the linear accelerator. Image registration was conducted at the nasopharynx (NP) and cervical regions. The translational displacements (latero-medial, antero-posterior and cranio-caudal), rotational displacements (pitch, yaw and roll) and 3 D vectors obtained at the NP and cervical regions were recorded and compared among the three systems. Results: The mean translational and rotational deviations were within 3 mm and 2 °, respectively, and the range of 3 D vector was 1. 53 – 3. 47 mm. At the NP region, the AC system demonstrated the smallest translational and rotational deviations and 3 D vector. The differences were significant except for the latero-medial, yaw and roll directions. Similarly, at the cervical region, the AC system showed smaller translational and rotational deviations and 3 D vector, with only the cranio-caudal and <b>yaw</b> <b>deviations</b> that did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Set up deviation was greater in the neck than the NP region. The set up accuracy of the AC system was better than the other two systems, and it is recommended for IMRT of NPC patients in our institution.

A simple and easy-to-build elastic system driven by a stepping motor is used to avoid expensive and sophisticated bearings normally required for highly precise translation. After initial and permanent corrections for repetitive angular <b>deviation</b> (<b>yaw),</b> the angular stability was 10 µrad for a 30 mm translation during a 16 h run.

40|$|Flow {{injection}} {{is being}} used in steam turbines for some combined or geothermal plants {{in order to increase}} its total thermal efficiency. It can be easily imagined, however, that such flow injection is accompanied by additional aerodynamic loss due to the flow mixing or the change in local flow angle. The present study is devoted to finding the optimum flow injection angle and blade lean angle for minimum energy loss and minimum outlet <b>yaw</b> angle <b>deviation.</b> A multi-objective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm coupled with a commercial CFD code is developed. The system is run in a fully automated fashion requiring no user interaction during the whole optimization process. The results revealed that low flow injection angles to the suction side of the nozzle combined with high positive lean angle are more suitable for minimizing the energy loss. Lower yaw angle values were obtained for no lean or small lean angle configurations, regardless of the flow injection angle...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the capabilities of current engineering tools based on Blade Element Momentum (BEM) and free vortex wake codes for the prediction of key aerodynamic parameters of wind turbines in yawed flow. Axial induction factor and aerodynamic loads of three wind turbines (NREL VI, AVATAR and INNWIND. EU) were investigated using wind tunnel measurements and numerical simulations for 0 and 30 degrees of yaw. Results indicated that for axial conditions {{there is a good}} agreement between all codes in terms of mean values of aerodynamic parameters, however in <b>yawed</b> flow significant <b>deviations</b> were observed. This was due to unsteady phenomena such as advancing & retreating and skewed wake effect. These deviations were more visible in aerodynamic parameters in comparison to the rotor azimuthal angle for the sections at the root and tip where the skewed wake effect plays a major role...|$|R
40|$|Collision Avoidance System solves many {{problems}} caused by traffic congestion worldwide and a synergy of new information technologies for simulation, real-time control and communications networks. The above system is characterized as an intelligent vehicle system. Traffic congestion has been increasing world-wide {{as a result of}} increased motorization, urbanization, population growth and changes in population density. Congestion reduces utilization of the transportation infrastructure and increases travel time, air pollution, fuel consumption and most importantly traffic accidents. The main objective of this work is to develop a machine vision system for lane departure detection and warning to measure the lane related parameters such as heading angle, lateral <b>deviation,</b> <b>yaw</b> rate and sideslip angle from the road scene image using standard image processing technique {{that can be used for}} automation of steering a motor vehicle. The exact position of the steering wheel can be monitored using a steering wheel sensor. This core part of this work is based on Hough transformation based edge detection technique for the detection of lane departure parameters. The prototype designed for this work has been tested in a running vehicle for the monitoring of real-time lane related parameters...|$|R
40|$|Body, head, and eye {{movements}} were measured in five subjects during straight walking and while turning corners. The {{purpose was to}} determine how well the head and eyes followed the linear trajectory {{of the body in}} space and whether head orientation followed changes in the gravito-inertial acceleration vector (GIA). Head and body {{movements were}} measured with a video-based motion analysis system and horizontal, vertical, and torsional eye movements with video-oculography. During straight walking, there was lateral body motion at the stride frequency, which was at half the frequency of stepping. The GIA oscillated about the direction of heading, according to the acceleration and deceleration associated with heel strike and toe flexion, and the body yawed in concert with stepping. Despite the linear and rotatory motions of the head and body, the head pointed along the forward motion of the body during straight walking. The head pitch/roll component appeared to compensate for vertical and horizontal acceleration of the head rather than orienting to the tilt of the GIA or anticipating it. When turning corners, subjects walked on a 50 -cm radius over two steps or on a 200 -cm radius in five to seven steps. Maximum centripetal accelerations in sharp turns were ca. 0. 4 g, which tilted the GIA ca. 21 degrees with regard to the heading. This was anticipated by a roll tilt of the head of up to 8 degrees. The eyes rolled 1 - 1. 5 degrees and moved down into the direction of linear acceleration during the tilts of the GIA. <b>Yaw</b> head <b>deviations</b> moved smoothly through the turn, anticipating the shift in lateral body trajectory by as much as 25 degrees. The trunk did not anticipate the change in trajectory. Thus, in contrast to straight walking, the tilt axes of the head and the GIA tended to align during turns. Gaze was stable in space during the slow phases and jumped forward in saccades along the trajectory, leading it by larger angles when the angular velocity of turning was greater. The anticipatory roll head movements during turning are likely to be utilized to overcome inertial forces that would destabilize balance during turning. The data show that compensatory eye, head, and body movements stabilize gaze during straight walking, while orienting mechanisms direct the eyes, head, and body to tilts of the GIA in space during turning...|$|R
40|$|A {{dynamic model}} for a tension-leg {{platform}} (TLP) floating offshore wind turbine is pro-posed. The model includes three-dimensional wind and wave loads and the associated structural response. The total system is formulated using 17 degrees of freedom (DOF), 6 for the platform motions and 11 for the wind turbine. Three-dimensional hydrodynamic loads have been formulated using a frequency- and direction-dependent spectrum. While wave loads are computed from the wave kinematics using Morison’s equation, the aero-dynamic loads are modeled by means of unsteady blade-element-momentum (BEM) theory, including Glauert correction for high values of the axial induction factor, dynamic stall, dynamic wake, and dynamic yaw. The aerodynamic model {{takes into account the}} wind shear and turbulence effects. For a representative geographical loca-tion, platform responses are obtained for a set of wind and wave climatic conditions. The platform responses show an influence from the aerodynamic loads, most clearly through quasi-steady mean surge and pitch responses associated with the mean wind. Further, the aerodynamic loads show an influence from the platform motion through a fluctuating rotor load contribution, which is a consequence of the wave-induced rotor dynamics. Loads and coupled responses are predicted for a set of load cases with different wave headings. Further, an advanced aero-elastic code, Flex 5, is extended for the TLP wind turbine configuration and the response comparison with the simpler model shows a gen-erally good agreement, except for the <b>yaw</b> motion. This <b>deviation</b> is found to be a result of the missing lateral tower flexibility in the simpler model. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4025599]...|$|R
