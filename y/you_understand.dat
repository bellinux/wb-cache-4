5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E

25|$|I used {{to write}} things praising 'The Captain' and now I write {{pretty much the same}} thing, but praising Ceaușescu. I'm not a Marxist, <b>you</b> <b>understand,</b> but I have to admit that I like what he's doing.|$|E
25|$|The mere {{pocketing}} of a ball isn't that hard; in fact, it's relatively simple. What drives many, {{many players}} to distraction is {{the unpredictability of}} the cueball's path of travel...the game of billiards requires you to drive a ball someplace; pool, in any form, mostly asks you to stop a ball someplace. In either case, you'll fare much better when <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> the how and why of a ball's getting {{from one place to}} another.|$|E
25|$|The Census, {{taken on}} 27 March 2011, asked {{a number of}} {{questions}} relating to nationality and national identity, including What is your country of birth? ('Wales' was one of the options), How would you describe your national identity? (for the first time 'Welsh' and 'English' were included as options), What is your ethnic group? ('White Welsh/English/Scottish/Northern Irish/British' was an option) and Can <b>you</b> <b>understand,</b> speak, read or write Welsh?. In December 2012 census results revealed that 66% of residents considered themselves to have a singular Welsh national identity, with another 10% stating they had a Welsh and British identity.|$|E

25|$|Radio 816 / Lisbon 14-Dec.1961: <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> the {{bitterness}} with which I send you this message. It is horrible {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... I know that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E

500|$|Alluding to the {{normally}} [...] "no-nonsense" [...] personality {{of his character}} Phillip Broyles, actor Lance Reddick noted that for once [...] "you get to see [...] smile and have fun. Not for very long, but you see it. You get to meet his ex-wife (Karen Holness) and find out why his marriage ended. <b>You</b> <b>understand</b> more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division–how he feels about it and why he does what he does." ...|$|E
500|$|Williams was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was [...] "as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be." [...] He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he [...] "understands what you're going to say better than <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence." ...|$|E
500|$|Clinton {{expressed}} {{support for}} Common Core. She said, [...] "The really unfortunate argument that's been going on around Common Core, it's very painful because the Common Core started off as a bipartisan effort. It was actually nonpartisan. It wasn't politicized.... Iowa has had a testing system based on a core curriculum for a really long time. And [...] you see the value of it, <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> why that helps you organize your whole education system. And a lot of states unfortunately haven't had that and so don't {{understand the value of}} a core, in this sense a Common Core." ...|$|E

500|$|Although many of {{his works}} are orchestral in nature, Soule has denied that it is his [...] "style", as he feels that the term boxes him into only {{creating}} one type of music. He prefers to call himself a [...] "music practitioner", or someone who creates music in general rather than just one type of music as {{he is capable of}} many styles, such as Japanese pop, which he has written along with Jeff Miyahara. Soule considers music to be like a language, which can be arranged in many different ways if <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> the structure. He does not have a favorite genre of game to compose for, preferring instead to compose for [...] "ambitious" [...] games by people with [...] "new ideas".|$|E
500|$|Brazil's navy {{fell into}} {{disrepair}} and obsolescence after an 1889 coup d'État, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, two naval revolts (1891 and 1893–94), the Federalist Revolution (1893–95), and the War of Canudos (1896–97). The navy had just forty-five {{percent of its}} authorized personnel in 1896, and amid quickly improving naval technology, the only modern armored ships were two small coast-defense vessels launched in 1898. With such dilapidated defenses, José Paranhos Jr., the Baron of Rio Branco and Foreign Minister of Brazil, stated [...] "In such conditions, <b>you</b> ... <b>understand</b> how upset I am and all the worries I have. All that still protects [...] is the moral force and old prestige still left from [...] when there was still foresight in this land..." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferguson {{was proud}} of his team's performance, but {{admitted}} their failure throughout the season to convert chances into goals, had cost them once more. Of the game, he continued: [...] "In cup football, you need a break and we didn't get one. We've had luck in the past, so <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> it can happen. It's not a nice experience but it's one you have to accept." [...] Ferguson criticised the referee for failing to send Vieira off during extra-time as he fouled Rooney, and labelled Arsenal as [...] "boring" [...] for deploying negative tactics. Keane, like his manager, rued the missed opportunities and said it was a small consolation: [...] "We dominated but I'm sure the Arsenal players won't be too bothered about that – they've got the winners' medals and the cup and we haven't." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{was born}} in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his {{childhood}} except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, [...] "I think that's how {{you need to be}} raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a man, <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> why." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> what the Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E
500|$|Gwen's {{father and}} a New York City Police Department captain who hunts both Spider-Man out of {{distrust}} and the Lizard for his rampage. Leary explained {{that he did not}} know much about Spider-Man in the comics and was [...] "more of a Batman guy. Not the '60s [...] but the really dark Batman. But my wife was a Spider-Man nut, which was why I went to Tobey Maguire ones." [...] He added that long before he was cast as George Stacy his friend Jeff Garlin, a Spider-Man fan, [...] "said to me, 'The first time I met you, I thought you were George Stacy!' This was like 30 years ago. I was like, 'What?!'" [...] Director Webb said of his casting, [...] "e all trust Denis Leary. He's got this attitude, but you love him. In this movie, he puts pressure on Peter Parker. He's on Spider-Man's case, but <b>you</b> <b>understand</b> him. I've said this before, but good drama comes from competing ideas of what's good." ...|$|E
