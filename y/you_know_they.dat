It's a sort of chess {{that has nothing to}} do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E

500|$|Prior to his audition, Rockwell [...] "immersed" [...] {{himself in}} the role by {{watching}} episodes of The Gong Show {{in an attempt to}} impress the filmmakers. [...] "I went to LA [...] did an old-fashioned screen test, like a real Scarlett O'Hara-type screen test, which <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> don't really do anymore," [...] the actor remembered. For research, Rockwell spent {{two and a half months}} with Barris. [...] "We went to coffee shops and dinner and movies, took walks, went to the zoo; I even filmed him," [...] Rockwell explained. [...] "I had him tape my lines in a tape recorder, and I listened to that to get his voice down." ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch has {{mentioned}} {{that he tried to}} avoid thinking about the morality of the narrative, or how it would be received by censors or critics, feeling that if he allowed that worry to affect him it would ultimately drive him to create something that made him uncomfortable, preferring instead to simply produce the episode he wanted to and be prepared to defend it if necessary. He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E
500|$|Stewart served {{not only}} as host {{but also as a}} writer and {{executive}} producer of the series. [...] He recalls that he initially struggled with the Kilborn holdover writers to gain control of the show and put his own imprint on the show's voice, a struggle that led to the departure of a number of the holdover writers. Instrumental in shaping the voice of the show under Stewart was former editor of The Onion Ben Karlin who, along with fellow Onion contributor David Javerbaum, joined the staff in 1999 as head writer and was later promoted to executive producer. Their experience in writing for the satirical newspaper, which uses fake stories to mock real print journalism and current events, would influence the comedic direction of the show; Stewart recalls the hiring of Karlin as the point at which things [...] " [...] to take shape". Describing his approach to the show, Karlin said, [...] "The main thing, for me, is seeing hypocrisy. People who know better saying things that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> don't believe." ...|$|E

2500|$|The work {{contains}} two biographical references of note. When Beckett returned to Ussy (where {{he wrote the}} first draft) he “was anxious {{to see how the}} young trees he had planted {{over the past three years}} were standing up to the cold weather.” This gets grafted into the play. “One of the two players enquires of the other: ‘How are the trees doing?’ The second replies: ‘It is difficult to say. We are in winter <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>They</b> are all black and bare, the evergreens included. One would have to cut into them with a knife…” This gets truncated to: “How are the trees doing? / Hard to say. It’s winter you know.” ...|$|E

I don't have a lot of sympathy for that." [...] New York novelist Jay McInerney observed, [...] "The mayor seems to have {{forgotten}} about the presumption of innocence, but his statement probably reflects the attitude of his constituents pretty accurately. New York's a tough place. Deal with it." [...] Seven weeks later, when doubts about the accuser's credibility made it unlikely the case would be tried, Bloomberg reversed position, stating: [...] "I've always thought perp walks were outrageous...e vilify them for the benefit of theater, for the circus. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> did it in Roman times, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{comments}} made by Cain regarding Muslims have caused controversy.

[...] He later explained: [...] "based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them". He has also spoken of his distrust of another Doctor when his name [...] "sounded too foreign", telling the audience at a Biblically themed amusement park [...] "My mind immediately started thinking, wait a minute, maybe his religious persuasion is different than mine! She [...] could see the look on my face and she said, 'Don't worry, Mr. Cain, he's a Christian from Lebanon'. Hallelujah! Thank God!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Vivian Mercier {{described}} Waiting for Godot as a play which [...] "has {{achieved a}} theoretical impossibility—a play in which nothing happens, that yet keeps audiences glued to their seats. What's more, {{since the second}} act is a subtly different reprise of the first, he has written a play in which nothing happens, twice.". Mercier once questioned Beckett on the language used by the pair: [...] "It seemed to me...he made Didi and Gogo sound {{as if they had}} earned PhDs. 'How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> hadn't?' was his reply." [...] They clearly have known better times, a visit to the Eiffel Tower and grape-harvesting by the Rhône; it is about all either has to say about their pasts, save for Estragon's claim to have been a poet, an explanation Estragon provides to Vladimir for his destitution. In the first stage production, which Beckett oversaw, both are [...] "more shabby-genteel than ragged...Vladimir at least is capable of being scandalised...on a matter of etiquette when Estragon begs for chicken bones or money." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s nothing you can do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Let It Happen" [...] {{opens the}} album, {{and is about}} [...] "finding {{yourself}} always {{in this world of}} chaos and all this stuff going on around you and always shutting it out because you don't {{want to be part of}} it. But at some point, you realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E
2500|$|The Memphis Tour {{was held}} during February and March 2008. The tour began on 26 February with two concerts at The Bridge Hotel, Sydney, {{followed}} by sixteen further concerts in mainly theatre venues around Australia. After the first concert {{of the tour}} Sebastian spoke to Stuart Bocking from radio station 2UE about {{what it felt like}} to be on stage with the MGs, [...] "There were so many moments when I just had to take a step back and think 'This is unbelievable'. Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> start playing Dock Of The Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them." [...] During the interview Sebastian said he had just received a message from Dunn saying, [...] "Thank you for inviting me on this tour. I'm having the time of my life and it's an honour to play with you." ...|$|E

2500|$|The MGs came to Australia in February 2008 to be Sebastian's {{backing band}} for his {{national}} tour.

[...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic, [...] "hearing him singing our music, which was born and raised and produced and recorded in Memphis, Tennessee. [...] It just filled our hearts." [...] One of the Melbourne concerts was filmed for a live DVD/CD titled The Memphis Tour. Sebastian was nominated for a Helpmann Award for Best Performance in an Australian Contemporary Concert for The Memphis Tour, and was awarded two Australian Club Entertainment Awards, best Original Music Performer and Outstanding Club Performer of the Year. The Memphis Album received a nomination for Highest Selling Album at the 2008 ARIA Awards, his third album to be nominated in this ARIA Awards category. He travelled to the US several times after The Memphis Tour to write for his fifth album, spending time with Cropper in Nashville on these trips.|$|E
2500|$|Philip Lombard, {{a soldier}} of fortune. Literally {{down to his}} last square meal, {{he comes to the}} island with a loaded revolver, as {{suggested}} by his invitation letter. Lombard is accused of causing the deaths of a number of East African tribesmen, after stealing their food and abandoning them to their deaths. He, along with Marston, are the only guests to openly and immediately confirm that the accusations against them are true; neither feels any remorse. ("Story's quite true! I left 'em! Matter of self-preservation. We were lost in the bush. I {{and a couple of other}} fellows took what food there was and cleared out ... Not quite the act of a pukka sahib, I'm afraid. But self-preservation's a man's first duty. And natives don't mind dying, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>They</b> don't feel about it as Europeans do.") Lombard fulfilled the ninth referenced verse of the rhyme, shot to death on the beach by Vera, ("One got frizzled up ...") who believed him to be the murderer. Of all the [...] "guests" [...] he is the only one to theorize that [...] "U.N. Owen" [...] might be Wargrave, but the others reject this and it does him no good. He, along with Vera, is the only guest not killed by Justice Wargrave. Technically he is the 8th person to die out of the ten guests.|$|E
