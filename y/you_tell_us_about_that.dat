6000|$|... “Then I don’t see why {{you should}} have {{expected}} me to resemble him,” said Tony plaintively. “As everybody knows I should never have done such a thing! Will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> the engagement?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's not {{a living}} noise. That's an all-the-same noise. Different to Roy, who barks and makes {{different}} noises all the time. Fancy the roses all barkin' at you. Daddy, will <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> animals?" ...|$|R

60|$|LADY CAROLINE. If what <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> {{the middle}} classes is true, Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit. It is much to be regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so {{persistently}} frivolous, under the impression apparently {{that it is the}} proper thing to be. It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we all know of in society.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us try and {{get away}} from the subject. We have talked of nothing else for the past three days, and I defy anyone to say {{anything}} new about it; it is not a pleasant subject either.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leger. [...] "Only a {{trace of}} colour, but I don't want to talk of that to-night. <b>You</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> your journey when you have had supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is this, then, {{that has}} changed you; it was this that made you {{thoughtful}} and not as you were before. I see it now. Why did <b>you</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind us, Dorothy," [...] said Billina. [...] "Go {{inside and}} see what the place is like. <b>You</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> it afterward, and Toto and I will rest comfortably here until you return." ...|$|R

6000|$|A general dissatisfaction {{diffused}} itself, and Hewson felt it; but he disdained to {{do anything}} to appease it.

6000|$|The {{first thing}} she heard was a general chorus of 'There goes Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--'Catch him, you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another {{confusion}} of voices--'Hold up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?

6000|$|... "That is the {{principle}} you go on, nowadays, isn't it?" [...] she remarked. [...] "I {{am not sure that}} you are wise. When one is told nothing, one fears the worst, and when time after time the news of these small disasters reaches <b>us</b> piecemeal, <b>about</b> three weeks late, we never get rid of our forebodings, even when <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> victories.... Ah! Here he comes at last," [...] she added, holding out both her hands to the young man who was making his somewhat difficult way towards them.

40|$|A {{friend told}} me his friend's {{experience}} studying in Chengdu, which typifies higher education for many young Tibetan men studying in such cities as Xining, Lanzhou, and Chengdu who, for the first time, are away from the close supervision of relatives and teachers. BEGINNINGS The morning of the day Dpal 'bum first started for Chengdu City, his mother, Mtsho mo, got up earlier than usual and prepared food. His stepfather, whom he called Uncle Bzang kho, had also risen and stepped {{to the back of}} the room where he burned the leaves of an aromatic plant to beseech the deities for blessings, particularly hoping that Dpal 'bum would successfully graduate in two years. Bzang kho awakened Dpal 'bum and told him to have breakfast, which included beef, bread, and milk tea – a common Tibetan meal. Bzang kho said, "Dpal 'bum, I found a school for you to study at, where you can realize the dream <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> everyday. Pack up after you finish eating. " [...] .
