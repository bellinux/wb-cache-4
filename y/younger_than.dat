40|$|Jejunal calcium {{absorption}} {{was measured}} from test solutions containing 1. 0, 2. 5, 5, and 10 mM calcium (as calcium gluconate). Absorption rates increased progressively as luminal calcium concentration was increased, {{although there was}} a tendency toward saturation of the absorptive process at the higher concentrations. Calcium absorption was higher in normal <b>young</b> adults <b>than</b> in normal subjects over age 60. In both groups a 300 mg calcium diet for 4 - 8 wk enhanced calcium absorption relative to absorption rates after 4 - 8 wk on a 2, 000 mg calcium diet. This adaptation was more definite and dramatic in the <b>young</b> <b>than</b> in the old subjects. Indirect estimates suggest that adaptation to a low calcium diet and the higher absorption in <b>young</b> <b>than</b> old normal subjects are mediated by an increased Vmax rather than a decreased Km...|$|R

50|$|In {{restored}} forests, western bluebirds have {{a higher}} probability of successfully fledging <b>young</b> <b>than</b> in untreated forests, but they are at greater risk of parasitic infestations. The effects on post-fledging survival are unknown. They have been found to enjoy more success with nest boxes than in natural cavities. They started egg-laying earlier, had higher nesting success and lower predation rates, and fledged more <b>young</b> in boxes <b>than</b> in cavities, but they did not have larger clutches of eggs.|$|R
50|$|The numbers also vary between countries. For example, China {{has many}} more <b>young</b> men <b>than</b> <b>young</b> women, and this {{disparity}} {{is expected to}} increase. In regions with recent conflict such as Chechnya, women greatly outnumber men.|$|R

This is comparable to the population of the prefecture and of Japan as a whole. In the prefecture, 22.1% of the population is over 65 and 14.4% of the population is less than 15 years old. Throughout Japan, only 21% are over the age of 65 and 13.6% are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> 15. The average age of city residents is 43.37.|$|E

5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
