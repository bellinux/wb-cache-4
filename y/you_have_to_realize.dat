2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{was created for}} the song, filmed on a country ranch, and was made by Think Pictures, dated October 1, 1995. It was {{directed}} by Martin Kahan, produced by Venetia Mayhew and edited by Scott Long. The video keeps the storyline of the song's lyrical message {{of a woman who}} finds a new man only to have her old lover return, wanting her back. The video mainly highlights footage of Martin performing the song, along with varying shots of her and the two men in her life on the ranch. In the end she seemingly stays with her new love. The opening scene features the ex-lover on an answer phone message stating [...] "Hey, it's me. Look you've been seeing this guy just to prove a little point, right? Well, you've proved it, so how about being a good girl, and we'll forget about it, and we'll be like before okay? I'll see ya." [...] Another voice message before the second verse states [...] "Hey, it's me, look, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that he can't love you that much." [...] Both messages were exclusive to the video and not included on the actual music track. In the Billboard magazine issue of 28 January 1995, the video was listed under the 'Billboard Video Monitor' section which revealed the most-played clips as monitored by broadcast data systems.

5000|$|Larissa Schuster's {{murder trial}} began on October 15, 2007, {{more than four}} years after she was charged. Her trial had to be moved from Clovis, California to Los Angeles due to the pre-trial publicity. She had been dubbed the [...] "Acid Lady" [...] by various media outlets in Fresno. Prosecutors had alleged to the jury that Larissa Schuster had {{attempted}} to solicit Tim's murder before, believing that she could get away with it. They also played graphic and berating phone messages from Larissa that Tim had saved on his answering machine. Prosecutors also stated how Larissa had access to all the chemicals used in the murder, being that she was a biochemist in a research lab. Although her accomplice James Fagone did not testify in Larissa's trial, Larissa decided to take the witness stand in her own defense. Her attorney admitted that she had made a series of bad decisions, but that she was not guilty of the crime alleged against her. On the stand, Larissa testified how she had no foreknowledge of the murder and that James Fagone was actually Tim Schuster's killer. She stated that James had told her: [...] "I heard him say something like 'there had been an accident and Tim is dead.' I thought he was joking." [...] She did however, admit to moving Tim's body. When confronted over the phone messages on Tim's answering machine, Larissa replied with: [...] "It is something I'm really ashamed about. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that is something... a result of many accumulative things." [...] She also maintained that the reason for the large amounts of chemicals at her laboratory were not to be used for the murder of Timothy Schuster, but for a wholesale cleaning of the items at the lab. Her testimony proved to have not swayed the jury; she was found guilty of first-degree murder with the special circumstance of financial gain. On May 16, 2008 Larissa Schuster was {{sentenced to life in prison}} without parole.|$|E

Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. <b>You</b> just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|R

[...] Nobody believes you, but if this does you good, you should do it. You don't attempt to catch your hat as it were on the wing. You walk after it, smiling, as if you liked the joke the more you think of it, and confident that the hat will come to rest presently. You are {{not the sort of}} man to make a fuss over a hat. You won't give the hat the satisfaction of thinking that it can annoy you. Strange though it may seem, there are idiots who will join you in pursuit of the hat. One will hook it with a stick, and almost get it, only not quite. Another will manage to hit it hard with an umbrella. A third will get his foot into it or on it. This does not improve the hat, but it shows that there is {{a good deal of the}} milk of human kindness flowing in the street as well as water, and is perhaps pleasant to think of afterwards. Several times <b>you</b> almost <b>have</b> the hat in your possession. It lies motionless, just where it has dropped after coming in contact with a hansom. Were you to make a sudden rush at it <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> it, but we <b>have</b> agreed that <b>you</b> are not that sort of man. You walk forward, stoop, and----.

I have never seen an explorer running after his hat (though I should like to), but your experience is similar to his with the buffalo. As your hand approaches the hat, the latter turns over like a giant refreshed, and waddles out of your reach. Once more your hand is within an inch of it, when it makes off again. There are ringing cheers from the audience on the pavement, some of them meant for the hat, and the others as an encouragement to you.

It’s all cloudy and looks as though it were going to rain any second. Hope it doesn’t. <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> go shopping- {{strictly}} window shopping- in New Rochelle and Mt. Vernon. Having more trouble trying to find a negligee that isn’t marquisette (any way the kind that you can’t see through. They’re all like celephane [sic].) Maybe today I’ll find one. Shooting skeet must be hard. That sounds good- 19 out of 25. I’d be amazed to come close to one out of 25. That’s something else you’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> teach me- how to shoot. Then when I catch you running ‘round with other women I can be real dramatic about it. Goley [sic], honey, I wish you’d finish that night flying. It must be awful to fly so late + then get up at the same ungodly hour in the morning. Anytime you’re too tired or don’t feel like writing don’t. Not that you would but don’t feel that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to.</b> I <b>realize</b> how hard it is for you to write so often. I hope it doesn’t rain on March 11 th. Oh, that reminds me. I had the craziest dream last night. We got married + then you disappeared suddenly right after the ceremony and the next thing I remember you were flying around. It was so vivid. You were buzzing all the houses and I was trying to get your attention. I can remember I had my wedding dress on + it looked very nice but you wouldn’t come down. Then this fellow from the Navy Air Corps came + we were talking (this must have been a hangover from “Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo”.) He looked like Bob- the one Van Johnson was going to buy a ranch with. He was complaining about how fresh the Marines were. I was telling him what had happened + he wanted to know what else I could expect from a Marine. After about five minutes I’d convinced him that you weren’t a marine + were the the [sic] best pilot in the Army Air Corps. Then you finally drove up in a car- Gee, it was a funny dream. It was much more complicated than that but it wouldn’t make sense to you. You looked so cute, though. Woody and I are going to see “National Velvet” tonight. It’s supposed to be good. As long as it’s about a horse I’m sure to like it. That reminds me, honey, we should go riding sometime. Maybe when we’re old and gray someday we’ll go. Oh, honey, don’t you want to send any announcements to Steve or any of the fellows in the Air Corps. We’ll have loads of them so don’t worry about that. Golly, you only get married once on March 11 th. We’re having a couple hundred made so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use them up. What a wedding this is going <b>to</b> be! Nothing <b>has</b> gone the way we planned! You’ve changed your bestman + I’ve changed my attendants and the place has been changed. That’s what I like- everything goes exactly the opposite from the way we plan. Wonder if that will happen all our lives. Hope so- I love things to happen. Are you {{going to be able to}} get the rings this weekend, honey? Or aren’t they giving you open Post? This week went real fast for me- The weekends always do anyway. Oh honey, are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> our rings engraved there? Let me know about your ring so I can send you the money, hon. You most certainly didn’t answer my questions about Scotch! (Not until this letter). You didn’t tell me how much to get. I’ll get more than one bottle, honey. One bottle will never last you until we get out of the south. Someone is playing “I’m Beginning To See The Light”. Hope I can remember to buy some ink, honey, this stuff is getting lighter and lighter. Gee, honey, only 16 more days. You’ll probably be getting your rings about now. Hope it’s a nice day but I probably wouldn’t know the difference. Gee, honey, it won’t be much longer now. You’re just too wonderful, honey! You’re just too, too wonderful. I wish I could be with you now. I miss you more + more every day. The sun just came out. Happy Day! It still looks like a storm. I love you so- Well, honey, just got back from “National Velvet”. It was wonderful. What a picture. I love horses- Woody + I went and I’ve almost got her talked into going riding. Gee, I love you honey. Someday maybe we’ll go riding together. Tomorrow I may go if it’s nice out and not too cold- Woody’s never been and I’m trying to get her to go. Gee, darling, I miss you so. I wish we were going to be married now instead of in sixteen more days. Well, honey it’s pretty late. Guess I better get to bed. I’ll write tomorrow, my darling, I miss you more and more. And they’ll never be words enough to tell you how very much I love you. Do you know Carol’s sister? She had a baby boy the other day. Her husband was killed in France the first day he went into action- the only thing that kept her going was the baby. She was praying so that it would be a boy. Carol is real busy now being an Aunt. Well, honey, as I said before I’d better be getting. I love you and will love you Always, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|R
