Jerry and George try to persuade Kramer to forget the idea, but Kramer is determined {{to go on with}} it. Kramer's pizza parlor idea reappears in later episodes such as [...] "The Puffy Shirt" [...] in season 5, and [...] "The Couch" [...] in season 6.|$|E
500|$|In it, Jerry Seinfeld {{tries to}} avoid meeting an old {{childhood}} friend, Joel Horneck (Kevin Dunn). Jerry's neighbor, Kramer, conceptualizes [...] "a pizza place where <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own pie". The episode {{was written by}} Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, {{and was the first}} filmed episode directed by Tom Cherones. This was the first episode produced with Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as a character. It also was the first episode to use Jonathan Wolff's title music. This is the only Seinfeld episode whose title does not begin with the definite article [...] "The".|$|E
500|$|The series win was the Red Sox's first {{title in}} 86years. They {{were also the}} fourth team to win a World Series without {{trailing}} {{in any of the}} games in the series, and the seventh to win it having previously been three outs away from elimination. With the win, pitcher Lowe became the first pitcher to ever win three series-clinching games in a single postseason having also won Game 3 of the ALDS against the Angels and Game 7 of the ALCS against the Yankees. Although the series was won in St. Louis, 3,000Red Sox fans were present at the game, and many stayed after the final out to celebrate with the team, including going on the field when the team came back out of their dugout with the World Series trophy. Ramírez, who was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the series, said afterwards [...] "I don't believe in curses, I believe <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own destination. [...] " [...] Kevin Millar said {{that it was important to}} finish off the Cardinals in four and not let it go to a fifth game given the team's history.|$|E

500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> speech at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'... We understand your difficult situation, but don't worry at all, for we are on the right road." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what tomorrow will hold. When <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
500|$|New York Magazine put [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as {{third of}} its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes", {{claiming}} that [...] "because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel like {{something that needs to}} be thrown at Hurley" [...] and David could have been written as a positive character [...] "just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show". IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles at this point in Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. <b>You</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own fate up until the moment when you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, you get the sense that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
2500|$|Fourteen {{years later}} after its publication, Alcott {{reflected}} on avoiding Roberts Brothers, who later published Little Women (1868): [...] "Shortsighted Louisa! Little did you dream that this same Roberts Brothers were to help <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> fortune {{a few years}} later." [...] After that novel's success, Niles offered to republish Hospital Sketches under the Roberts Brothers imprint, and Alcott slightly expanded it.|$|E

2500|$|A {{more subtle}} {{undercurrent}} in Seascape {{is the idea}} of alienation. In terms of this play, to be alienated means to feel withdrawn or exist in an unfriendly environment. Alienation {{was one of the reasons}} that Leslie and Sarah left the sea. In act II, Sarah tells the humans, [...] "It wasn't ... comfortable anymore. I mean after all, <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>your</b> nest, and accept a whole ... array ... of things ... and ... we didn' t feel we belonged there anymore." [...] It could be argued that this alienation was a step in their evolution. Nancy and, to some degree, Charlie also feel alienated in their lives. In act I, Nancy describes several ways in which she feels alienated, mostly in her relationship with Charlie. She does not share his views on what their life was, is, and could be; she wants to do more than retire. Though not as vocal, Charlie, in turn, feels alienated from her because of her curiosity and her desires. The strains caused by alienation affect the direction of the characters and the action of the play.|$|E
