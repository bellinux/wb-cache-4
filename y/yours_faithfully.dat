500|$|Following a 10-year hiatus in her musical career, Jackson {{returned}} with the 1998 album <b>Yours</b> <b>Faithfully.</b> The production of the album, her last to date, was a collaboration with artists and producers such as Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams, Keith Thomas, and Eliot Kennedy. It also featured contributions from her children. In 2011, Rebbie embarked on the [...] "Pick Up the Phone Tour," [...] which is dedicated to teens who have committed suicide all over the U.S.|$|E
500|$|Following a 10-year {{break from}} music, Jackson signed {{with her brother}} Michael's record label, MJJ Music, in 1997. From the label, <b>Yours</b> <b>Faithfully</b> was {{released}} on March 31, 1998. The album featured a remixed version of Jackson's successful [...] "Centipede". Initially, the singer had not wanted to feature the track, believing that {{it was part of}} the past. After thinking about it for a while, Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix which features a rap by son Austin would be a good way to return to the music scene. In addition, her two other children, Stacee and Yashi, contributed backing vocals for the album. Other tracks from the album included [...] "Fly Away", which was written and produced by brother Michael, who also served as co-executive producer for <b>Yours</b> <b>Faithfully.</b> Fellow producers included Keith Thomas and Eliot Kennedy. The album also featured a duet with Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams on The Spinners' [...] "I Don't Want to Lose You", which Jet described as being a [...] "sizzling" [...] rendition. Yours Faithfullys title track was released as a single and peaked at number 76 on the R chart. Vibe magazine's Quohnos Mitchell expressed disappointment in the album, labelling its content a [...] "mix of dated R grooves dressed up with a few cleverly placed samples".|$|E

2500|$|Titles, such as Mr., Mrs., Miss, Dr., Rev., etc., {{are often}} avoided by many Friends. [...] Instead Friends tend to address {{each other by}} first and last name with no title. [...] In many Quaker {{communities}} children address adults by either their first names, or first and last names but with no title, and in many Quaker schools teachers are called {{by their first names}} as well. [...] It is conventional for Friends who do not know each other well, who in non-Quaker circles would address each other with a title, to use first name and last name together, rather than to adopt the more familiar first name only. [...] Friends also tend not to use the appellation sir or madam to refer to someone of whom they do not know the name, instead using the term Friend. [...] In letter-writing, where others might use the phrase Dear Sir or Madam, many Quakers would instead write Dear Friend, and in such letters, rather than finishing <b>yours</b> <b>faithfully</b> would finish either yours in truth or yours in friendship.|$|E
