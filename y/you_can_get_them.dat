500|$|The {{production}} {{continued at}} the Westside Theatre with an open-ended commercial {{run with the}} casting strategy of rotating 4-week casts because it enabled the production to pursue higher caliber actors. Nora Ephron stated at one question and answer session: [...] "We keep re-casting it {{so we can get}} really great actresses to come for four weeks. It is really hard to get really good people to work Off-Broadway for six months because it does not pay much, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> for four weeks." [...] Other well-known actresses who have performed in the Off-Broadway production include the following: Carol Kane, Debra Monk, Janeane Garofalo, Fran Drescher, Melissa Joan Hart, Brooke Shields, Victoria Clark, Tovah Feldshuh, Loretta Swit, Mary Testa, Nikki Blonsky, Donna McKecknie, B. Smith and Marla Maples. , it was the second-longest running show in the history of Westside Theatre.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't say 'Down {{with the}} Juntas!'" [...] Terence replied; [...] "but I do say take arms if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> Are there any {{magazines}} near here?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Ketch Secor, whose group Old Crow Medicine Show {{started with}} busking and remains {{committed}} to it, has said: [...] "People … have short attention spans. … So if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> to stop … if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> to listen with a song, then you've got yourself a keeper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There you go--nothing like it! Why don't you fling {{some more}} in? <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> at Hudson's for five guineas a pound." [...] bursts out the {{youthful}} peer.|$|R
6000|$|... "And say, I tell you, while you're at it, {{get some}} of the old queen, Victorina, if <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> <b>Get</b> <b>'em</b> in mourning, with a harp and one of them lions and a three-pointed prong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The colonel {{believes}} that he knows their family, Skinner; but of course, that will not make any difference in regard to them. Still he would be pleased, I know, if they could sound the calls well enough {{to go with the}} regiment. They are most anxious to learn. Now I shall be glad if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> up to the mark. It will, of course, entail a lot of extra trouble upon you, but if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> fit in time, I will pay you a couple of guineas for your extra time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall want {{a bottle}} {{or two of}} wine if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them,</b> and a jug of fresh water, and {{anything}} {{you can get in}} the way of eatables, and I should say a cooking pot. Those are the principal things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think, boys, if you {{are allowed}} to carry pistols instead of muskets, no great {{objection}} will be made as to the exact size of the knapsacks. Yes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> made, and I will speak to the colonel about it." ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{a matter}} of principle. Men are always funny about principles. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> never <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to {{understand}} that circumstances alter cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, yes. I {{think that}} will be the best plan. You've some kind of {{hereditary}} influence with the little chaps, and they may listen to you when a glimpse of our uniforms would drive them wild. You've never been {{in that part of the}} world before, have you? Take care they don't send you to your family vault in your youth and innocence. I believe you'll be all right if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> to listen to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{they are}} going to surrender, I tell you," [...] Nat insisted. [...] "I don't see as how it can be your duty to hand over your company to the French, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> clear away, so as to fight for the king again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Bosinney sarcastically. [...] "Your wife? She doesn't {{like the}} cold? I'll see to that; she shan't be cold. Look here!" [...] he pointed, to four marks at regular {{intervals}} {{on the walls of}} the court.

5000|$|Toubin {{attributes}} {{the success of}} his parties {{to the fact that they}} offer a unique musical experience to a broad audience of sub-cultures. Rock and rollers, while familiar with the music, may not be familiar with dance parties. Likewise, club kids and downtown art scenesters, who may be more interested in the dance aspect of the Soul Clap and Dance Off, are introduced to a subjectively new experience. Toubin consciously looks to build a bridge between music scenes through events like Soul Clap, remarking [...] "...art girls and Brooklyn rock boys make a great mix if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>'em</b> on the same dance floor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{under the}} circumstances, Tim, I agree with you; but don't do more damage {{than you can}} help, and only make enough fire to make the water hot for coffee, and so on. You will be warm enough, here, with the four horses. You must go and see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> some forage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess that}} will do," [...] said Cheyne. [...] "In {{one or two}} of my {{stations}} we had to be our own field hospital; but I don't know enough of surgery to take the responsibility of stirring up his circulation any further. Still, when <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> ready, we will have hot bottles at his feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm jolly certain I don't mean it to be," [...] she {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "I ask no questions, and I hate scenes. A week ago I should have {{scoffed at the}} idea of David Thain as a prospective suitor for Letitia. Now, my advice to you is, the sooner <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> married, the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, father,” said Rollo, “I thought I {{should like}} to have James come and help me, if <b>you</b> are willing;--we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> done so much quicker if there are two.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Seddon {{compared}} the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote racialist politics in New Zealand. In 1879, {{in his first}} political speech, Seddon said that New Zealand did not wish her shores [...] "deluged with Asiatic Tartars. I would sooner address white men than these Chinese. You can't talk to them, you can't reason with <b>them.</b> All <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> from <b>them</b> is 'No savvy'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm willing," [...] {{answered}} the cowboy. [...] "But I don't know if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> any of <b>'em</b> to-night. It {{will be a}} hard climb to where they are. I don't know as we can {{go all the way}} on hosses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it will {{be quick}} work, sir. However, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> to put a good strong gang of {{carpenters}} on board they might get the deck finished off by Wednesday evening. Anyhow, we might have the painters on board on Thursday morning, {{and if they are}} sharp they should finish by the time they knock off on Saturday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then don't {{spare the}} dogs; cut {{them out of}} the traces as fast as they drop; buy them, and think they're cheap at ten dollars a pound. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> at Five Fingers, Little Salmon, and Hootalinqua. And watch out for wet feet,' was his parting advice. 'Keep a-traveling up to twenty-five, but if it gets below that, build a fire and change your socks.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will burn}} {{down a bit}} presently," [...] Jerry said. [...] "I should not try to get those horses up here now, Harry. It was a bad place to come up in daylight, and like enough they would break their legs if they tried it now. They will do just as well there as they would on this side, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> over {{as soon as the}} day breaks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wish I {{understood}} {{more about}} naval affairs," [...] Granet sighed. [...] "I'm a perfect ass at any one's job but my own. I can't see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> deal with submarines at all.

5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, the populist prime {{minister}} Richard Seddon compared the Chinese people to monkeys, and so used the Yellow Peril to promote racialist politics in New Zealand.

6000|$|... "They {{are sure}} to do so, at first; but you will soon get over that. Now, Ramdass will take you {{out for a walk}} for two or three hours, so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{accustomed}} to <b>them.</b> I should not like you to look awkward, when you go with me to Mrs. Sankey's, tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What gods or men are {{protecting}} you?' she asked, with a frown. 'This earth, {{dried up}} by a constant rain of sulphur and fire, produces nothing, yet I hear that YOUR bed {{is made of}} sweet smelling herbs. However, {{as you can get}} flowers for yourself, of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> for me, and in an hour's time I must have in my room a nosegay of the rarest flowers. If not--! Now you can go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you are not}} far wrong," [...] {{the doctor}} agreed; [...] "but the native wines here are good enough for me, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> at sixpence a quart. I was telling them, at mess yesterday, that we must not write home and tell them about it; or faith, there would be such an {{emigration}} that the Rock wouldn't hold the people--not {{if you were to}} build houses all over it. Sixpence a quart, and good sound tipple! ...|$|E
60|$|You are {{authorized}} {{to purchase the}} 400 horses, or take them wherever or however <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>them.</b> The exposed condition of General Banks makes his immediate relief a point of paramount importance. You are therefore directed by the President to move against Jackson at Harrisonburg and operate against the enemy in such way as to relieve Banks. This movement must be made immediately. You will acknowledge the receipt of this order, and specify the hour it is received by you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Stop a moment,' {{cried the}} old woman again, {{just as he was}} {{mounting}} his horse, 'take this napkin and this cake, and put them in your bag where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> hold of <b>them</b> easily.' Peter took them and put them into his bag, and waving his thanks for her kindness, he was off like the wind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> {{down with}} <b>them,</b> momma?" [...] the girl asked, and somehow her mother's heart was {{lightened}} by her evasion, {{not to call}} it uncandor. It was at least not morbid, {{it was at least}} like other girls, and Mrs. Kenton imparted what comfort there was in it to the judge, when he asked where she had left Ellen.|$|R
5000|$|As Minister of Native Affairs, Seddon took a {{generally}} [...] "sympathetic" [...] but [...] "paternalistic" [...] approach. As Minister of Immigration, {{he was well}} known for his hostility to Chinese immigration - the so-called [...] "Yellow Peril" [...] was {{an important part of}} his populist rhetoric, and he compared Chinese people to monkeys.
