2500|$|One {{challenge}} facing Irrational was identified from BioShock, in which players, once equipped with specific plasmids and weapons, could complete the game {{without having to}} alter their weapons; Levine quotes the saying [...] "When all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hammer, everything looks like a nail" [...] to describe how they found players were able to complete most of BioShock using the 'Electro Bolt' plasmid and a shotgun. Irrational wanted instead to create situations through Infinites weapons and powers that allowed the player to progress to some point with certain combinations but then {{would be forced to}} learn new possibilities that Irrational had designed within the game. The vertical and open-air spaces of Columbia provide more opportunity to include various types of combat compared to the close-ranged limits of Rapture within the first BioShock. The team developed a variety of enemies that would have certain strengths and weakness that would force the player to experiment and work with all their available tools given to them. This was further enhanced by the inclusion of Elizabeth, who has powers {{that can be used in}} conjunction with Booker's to achieve more impressive results but that strain her powers and giving choice to the player as to how and when to use her abilities. Another aspect that Irrational had considered from BioShock was the way players opted in choosing whether to save or harvest the Little Sisters; according to writer Drew Holmes, because this choice simply affected the reward that players would receive, they would not consider the moral consequences of their actions, particularly with subsequent playthroughs of the game. While Infinite will offer such choices to the player, these will be less obvious and with initially ambiguous results, an example being the choice of throwing a baseball at an interracial couple or the barker at the start of the game.|$|E

Attitude and knowledge <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> tested for any connection to age, gender, what kind of <b>a</b> teacher you <b>are</b> {{and for how long}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> teacher. The collected data <b>has</b> <b>been</b> analyzed in <b>a</b> descriptive part, one part with correlations and in one part with t-tests. The terms samsyn (consensus) and attitude <b>has</b> <b>been</b> reviewed in its connection to the results. The study shows a significant correlation (0. 222 *) between knowledge and attitude. How long <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> teacher also shows a significant negative correlation (- 0. 181 *) to attitude.
