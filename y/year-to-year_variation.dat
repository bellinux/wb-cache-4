The magnitude of this amplification is very similar in models and observations.

40|$|Radon {{concentration}} in air {{is subject to}} significant variations at different time scales, owing to several factors. In general, the shorter the time period considered, the larger the variations in radon concentration, e. g., day-to-day variations are usually higher than month-to-month variations. An average over 12 consecutive months is generally considered the best estimate of the long-term average radon concentration. Due to practical reasons, however, very few data are available on <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations.</b> <b>Year-to-year</b> <b>variations</b> can have quite a relevant impact on radon policies and on the assessment of health risks from exposures to radon. Therefore, a project was started in 1996 aimed to evaluate year-to year variations {{in a sample of}} dwellings. Systematic radon measurements have been made with LR 115 based radon detectors (closed type) {{in the living room and}} one bedroom of a sample of dwellings in Rome (Italy). The analysis of the results of the first five consecutive years of measurements, regarding the 76 dwellings included in the final analysis, showed relatively low <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations,</b> with a median coefficient of variation of 14 % (range 3 %– 42 %), smaller than that observed in studies from other European countries. Therefore, in the analyzed sample, 12 -month measurements can be considered a good estimate of the average radon concentration, at least within a 5 -year period. This is quite important for radon regulations and policies, e. g. annual measurements could be recommended and repetition of radon measurements could not be necessary within periods of 5 years. Moreover, the impact of the observed <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations</b> on the lung cancer risk estimated in the Italian epidemiological study is expected to be not high, if variations on periods up to about 30 years can be assumed similar to those observed in this study...|$|R

Caesium-134, {{and to a lesser extent}} caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry.

50|$|Almost all {{the local}} {{agriculture}} depends on river water for irrigation. The annual flood of the Niger River {{is a result of}} the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and the northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in the headwater areas peaks in August but the flood water takes time to pass down the river system, through the Inner Niger Delta region and arrive at Gao. At Koulikoro the flood peaks in September, while in Gao the flood lasts longer and reaches a maximum in December. There is a large <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in the extent of the flooding. The existing and proposed dams upstream of Gao reduce the overall flow of the river and could potentially have a large effect on the local agriculture. When in flood the river is 4 km wide at Gao but during the dry season a number of islands appear in the river. There is very little flow, only 5% of the maximum, in June and July.|$|E
50|$|The {{source of}} the Bakoy is at an {{elevation}} of 760 m in the granite Monts Ménien to the northwest of Siguiri in Guinea. The river flows north and forms part of the international border between Guinea and Mali. It then meanders across the Manding Plateau and joins its principal affluent, the Baloué, which rises {{to the west of}} Bamako. The Bakoy is 560 km in length and drains a basin of around 85,600 km2. The river is seasonal with a maximum flow in September after the start of the West African Monsoon and almost no flow between January and June. The large <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in the intensity of the West African Monsoon gives rise to large changes in the discharge of the Bakoy River. For the exceptionally dry year of 1972, the average flow at the Oualia gauging station, 54 km upstream of Bafoulabé, was only 30 m3/s while in 1958 the value was 260 m3/s. The average flow over the period 1951-1978 was 156 m3/s corresponding to an annual discharge of 4.9 km3. At Bafoulabé the average discharge of the Bakoy is between a third and a half of that of the Bafing.|$|E
5000|$|In Djenné {{the annual}} flood {{produced}} by Bani and Niger rivers begins in July and {{reaches a maximum}} in October. During this period the town of Djenné becomes an island and the Souman-Bani channel that passes just {{to the east of}} the town fills and connects the Bani and Niger rivers. The <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in the height of the flood leads to a large variation in the area of land that is flooded. This has important consequences for the local agriculture. The drought that began in the early 1970s resulted in a big reduction in the volume of water flowing in the Niger and Bani rivers. The effect on the Bani was particularly severe as the reduction in flow was much greater than the reduction in rainfall. The annual discharge of the river has not returned to the volumes experienced in the 1950s and 1960s. It is only during the flood season (mid-July till December) that the Bani river between Djenné and Mopti is easily navigable. At other times of the year, sandbars lie close to the water surface. The French explorer René Caillié made the journey to Mopti in a small boat in March 1828 and was [...] "obliged several times to unload the vessel in order to pass over sandbanks." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} results from an 8 -year tropospheric {{chemistry}} reanalysis for the period 2005 – 2012 obtained by assimilating multiple data sets from the OMI, MLS, TES, and MOPITT satellite instruments. The reanalysis calculation was conducted using a global chemical transport model and an ensemble Kalman filter technique that simultaneously optimises the chemical concentrations of various species and emissions of several precursors. The optimisation of both the concentration and the emission fields is an efficient method to correct the entire tropospheric profile and its <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations,</b> and to adjust various tracers chemically linked to the species assimilated. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite, and ozonesonde observations demonstrate {{the quality of the}} analysed O 3, NO 2, and CO concentrations on regional and global scales and for both seasonal and <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations</b> from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. The data assimilation statistics imply persistent reduction of model error and improved representation of emission variability, but they also show that discontinuities in the availability of the measurements lead to a degradation of the reanalysis. The {{decrease in the number of}} assimilated measurements increased the ozonesonde-minus-analysis difference after 2010 and caused spurious variations in the estimated emissions. The Northern/Southern Hemisphere OH ratio was modified considerably due to the multiple-species assimilation and became closer to an observational estimate, which played an important role in propagating observational information among various chemical fields and affected the emission estimates. The consistent concentration and emission products provide unique information on <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variations</b> in the atmospheric environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the possible employment effects of reforming minimum-wage policy to incorporate indexation of the nominal minimum wage. The analysis assumes {{that both the}} demand for the labor services of minimum-wage workers and {{the setting of the}} nominal minimum wage rate under existing policy depend in part on rational expectations of future average wage rates. The analysis implies that, if the indexation ratio of the nominal minimum wage to the recent-past average wage rate were large relative both to the level and trend of the expected rate of average wage inflation and to the existing relative minimum-wage target, indexation would decrease the average level over time of minimum-wage employment. The analysis also implies that, if the <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in expected wage inflation were large relative to the <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in unexpected wage inflation, indexation would increase the <b>year-to-year</b> <b>variation</b> in minimum-wage employment. ...|$|E
