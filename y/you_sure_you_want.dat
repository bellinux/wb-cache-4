2500|$|Nikkatsu {{had started}} its SM line of Roman porno films in 1974 with the hits Flower and Snake and Wife to Be Sacrificed both {{featuring}} actress Naomi Tani {{and directed by}} Masaru Konuma. After this first highly successful venture into sexual violence, the studio's output became increasingly rougher. According to director Yasuharu Hasebe, by 1976 the studio {{was looking for a}} new direction, and contacted him to develop films in a new style to be called [...] "Violent Pink". These would be comparable to the U.S. [...] "roughies" [...] film genre, violent and misogynistic, but without the whips, bondage and other traditional accoutrements of the S genre. Hasebe had worked with the studio in the 1960s during their [...] "Nikkatsu Action" [...] era, but was not comfortable with the pink film genre to which the studio had turned with the inception of the Roman porno series in 1971. Reluctant to work in the sex film genre, Hasebe later recalled warning the studio, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me?... You must be aware-- my craft is very bloody." ...|$|E

My dad's done Judge Barton's accounting for probably the past 15 years and they're very good friends. So (Judge Barton) sees me come in and he pulls me up to the bench and he's like, [...] "Don't do this. Don't take drug court. Are <b>you</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do this?" [...] He asked me three or four times. Judge Barton's trying to talk me out of taking drug court. That I would not do well. I wouldn't make it. He didn't think it was what I should do.|$|E
