[...] "Well, now, Hallam wants your ranch, {{and when}} that man wants a thing it's bad {{to keep him from}} getting it, but it wouldn't please me to see him take the ranch. I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> what his next move will be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This won't do," [...] he panted {{after a few}} moments. [...] "We'll {{have to put up}} five or six bags less, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> {{how many}} extra loads that will make before we empty the bins. Then, I hate to keep a man and team {{standing}} by here when they could be hauling another load." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're safer there, Councillor," [...] {{said the}} man whom they had known as McMurdo. [...] "And you, Baldwin, if you don't take your hand off your pistol, you'll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that made me--There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this house, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> it out for {{yourself}} what chance you have. Take their pistols, Marvin!" ...|$|E

Unless he tells you right out, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never <b>figure</b> on what he's thinking. Anyway, I'll say nothing more to him unless there's some {{particular}} reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are a {{third of}} them I daren't turn out, and two or three of the others who are down with Tom look a good deal shakier than I care about. Still, you see, I couldn't keep them in. They've had about enough of this country, and I don't blame them. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> on about half of us as {{reasonably}} effective, but what everybody wants to know is, when we are to begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is," [...] said Jordan, with evident relief. [...] "They're {{making the}} road to the pulp-mill, and I don't quite know where he raised his share of the money, {{especially}} as he has just taken over a big old-type steamer. Had to face a high figure, played out as she is. Ships are in demand. Now, there are men like Merril whose money isn't their own; that is, they can get it from other people to make a profit on, as a general thing. But these aren't ordinary times; any man with money can make good interest on it himself just now, and I've more than a fancy that Merril's handing out instead of raking in. He has been at the banks lately, and when there's a demand for money everywhere <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> what they're going to charge him. Anyway, we won't worry about him in the meanwhile. Get on your shore-clothes. As soon as you're ready you're coming up-town with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Standing," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I've {{given you}} all the rope I am going to. I am {{sick and tired of}} your stubbornness. My {{patience}} is exhausted.

Come across with the dynamite. The moment it is in my hands I'll take you out of here. You can bathe and shave and get clean clothes. I'll let you loaf for six months on hospital grub, and then I'll put you trusty in the library. You can't ask me to be fairer with you than that. Besides, you're not squealing on anybody. You are the only person in San Quentin who knows where the dynamite is. You won't hurt anybody's feelings by giving in, and you'll be all to the good from the moment you do give in.

5000|$|These k {{points are}} the [...] "pieces" [...] of the vote: If {{you know all}} of the points, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out the {{polynomial}} pn (and hence <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out how the voter voted). However, if you know {{only some of the}} points, you can't figure out the polynomial. (This is because you need k points to determine a degree-k-1 polynomial. Two points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is often}} {{important}} {{to keep track of}} what pieces are still face-down. Usually this is done by checking both the “graveyard” for dead pieces and the playing field for live pieces; by the process of elimination <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out what must still remain.|$|E
5000|$|Mimi Vang Olsen is a New York born painter {{specializing in}} pet portraits in The Village {{since the early}} 1970's. Her work has brought her {{international}} recognition and celebrity clientele. [...] It is estimated she has made close to 400 pet and family portraits over her decades-long career. “I approach {{it as if it}} were a formal portrait of a person or a piece of fruit,” Vang Olsen said. “It could be a still life.

[...] "You can weave {{academic}} arguments, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> make <b>figures</b> and statistics dance to any damned tune you please. If I tried {{to argue with}} you, you'd squash me flat. And what's it all come to? My pals must starve for the gratification of your intellectual vanity. You won't listen to Tariff Reform. Then what do you propose, to light the forges and fill the mills?

5000|$|... 4AD {{actually}} allowed Defever to {{move forward}} with the project, but has refused to release the recordings. Defever re-recorded the project sometime after leaving the label, although details are scarce. It was actually first released as disc 5 of the Cloud Box [...] 10-CD box set on Time Stereo in 2004, under the name Mystery Spot. While Defever gave detailed notes about each CD of this set, his notes on Mystery Spot only said [...] "I don't wanna talk about it, but once you listen <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> it out, if you're smart." ...|$|E
5000|$|The character's name, {{he said in}} that interview, {{came from}} Arnold: [...] "When 'Busy' Arnold called, he {{suggested}} a kind of ghost {{or some kind of}} metaphysical character. He said, 'How about a thing called the Ghost?' and I said, 'Naw, that's not any good,' and he said, 'Well, then, call it the Spirit; there's nothing like that around.' I said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean.,' and he said, 'Well, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> that out—I just like the words [...] "the Spirit."' He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think... And actually, the more I thought about it the more I realized I didn't care about the name." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Where You Lead" [...] {{is one of}} two Carole King/ Toni Stern collaborations {{featured}} on Tapestry, the other being the #1 single [...] "It's Too Late". King had written the music and the majority of the lyric for [...] "Where You Lead" [...] when she solicited the assistance of Stern, saying: [...] "I can't write the bridge to this: if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out the bridge you can get co-writing credit for the song." [...] Disliking the arguably servile stance of the song as written by King so far, Stern swiftly conceived lyrics for its bridge which she felt expressed a more empowered narrative voice. The lyrics Stern submitted to King included the lines: [...] "...if you want to live in f***king New York City/ Honey you know I will": King herself deleted [...] "f***king", then sought Tapestry producer Lou Adler's approval of the [...] "New York City" [...] reference; Adler's approval was forthcoming and the lyrics for [...] "Where You Lead" [...] were thus complete.|$|E
30|$|The image {{scene is}} similar for both ARES 2 F and ARES 3 F (<b>Figure</b> 2). As <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see in <b>Figure</b> 3, the SNR map is showing a {{reasonable}} segmentation {{for both of}} these images and the distributions are somewhat separable. Table 1 and Figure 7 show that performance is good across the board with LAIRX being superior. It is interesting {{to point out that}} the nonlinear technique is performing poorly in contrast to the other algorithms. Additionally, the data associated with these images is separable in a lower dimensional subspace, as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> see in <b>Figure</b> 3, which indicates that the RX type approach should perform well. Also, note that for ARES 2 F and ARES 3 F the SVDD statistic maps depicted in Figure 5 is showing that large natural anomalies have a similar value as the targets, which leads to a higher false positive rate.|$|R
50|$|The {{credit is}} 20% of the {{qualified}} zone wages paid or incurred during a calendar year. The amount of qualified zone wages <b>you</b> <b>can</b> use to <b>figure</b> the credit cannot {{be more than}} $15,000 for each employee for each calendar year.

5000|$|During a panel {{session at}} the 2010 TCA Press Tour, Dana Delany {{explained}} that she decided to leave Desperate Housewives and join Body of Proof because she [...] "loved how complicated and smart her character was", believing that Megan {{was similar to the}} character she portrayed in China Beach from 1988 to 1991. To prepare for the role of Megan, Delany observed four autopsies and met with two female physicians, a neurosurgeon and a medical examiner. She also revealed that learning the medical terms was the hardest part of the job. She explained [...] "It's really difficult. But a doctor told me that when you go to medical school, you learn 10,000 new words. They're all Greek- or Latin-based, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> them out. But after shooting 15 hour days, to go home and learn these lines, I just thank God for iPad, so I can Google a word and figure it out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the many}} {{contradictory}} statements regarding Springfield, {{it is impossible for}} the town to exist in a specific state. In The Simpsons Movie, Ned Flanders tells Bart that Ohio, Nevada, Maine, and Kentucky all border Springfield's state. The city's unknown and unknowable geography is a recurring joke in the series; one newspaper called it the [...] "riddle wrapped in an enigma that is Springfield's location", but Lisa Simpson states that [...] "it's a bit of a mystery, yes. But {{if you look at the}} clues, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> it out." [...] Episodes frequently make fun of the fact that Springfield's state is unidentifiable by adding further conflicting descriptions, obscuring onscreen map representations, and interrupting conversational references. The 2012 episode [...] "Beware My Cheating Bart" [...] played upon the unidentifiability of the state in its opening chalkboard gag, which stated that [...] "The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours".|$|E
5000|$|Throughout the song, {{backed by}} the video, it is unclear and thus left to the listener/viewer to decide who might be implicated in her disappearance. Marxs {{character}} is set up to be neither innocent nor guilty, {{depending on how the}} evidence is viewed. For example, the video makes it apparent that he flees the scene where he sees Mary with the unidentified person, leaving his scarf behind, which is later used as an attempt to place him at the scene. Yet the lyrics state that he left her by the river ... left her safe and sound, which contradicts the video. Additionally, how would he know that he left her there, if he had not been with her, because she went walking alone and never came home? Furthermore, the video opens up the possibility that the sheriff himself could be responsible for Marys disappearance. He is depicted photographing her with the narrator and following her in his car, but it is never established whether his motives for doing so are borne of jealousy or protectiveness, perhaps on account of the narrators reputation. But what of the lyrics [...] "..theres no escape for me this time, all of my rescues are gone.." [...] The words [...] "this time" [...] imply that this situation has occurred before. Two different versions of the video were shot and aired on VH-1, and Marx himself appeared several times, challenging viewers to watch for both versions, [...] "...and see if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>figure</b> out who killed Mary." ...|$|E

50|$|The renewal {{community}} employment credit provides {{businesses with}} {{an incentive to}} hire individuals who both {{live and work in}} a renewal community. Employers can claim the credit if they pay or incur “qualified zone wages” to a “qualified zone employee”. The credit is for wages paid or incurred after 2001. The credit is 15% of the qualified wages paid or incurred during a calendar year. The amount of qualified wages <b>you</b> <b>can</b> use to <b>figure</b> the credit cannot be more than $10,000 for each employee for each calendar year.

5000|$|These statuettes, which {{generally}} do not exceed 15cm in height, began to be sold in Santiago in the early 1990s and quickly became popular. The municipal market of Temuco sold large quantities of this figure for their identity with the Mapuche people; in this market <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find carved <b>figures</b> that exceed 1.50 meters in height.
