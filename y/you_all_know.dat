2500|$|By {{the late}} 1920s, as {{nationalism}} became a radical {{force on the}} Romanian political stage, issuing calls for ethnocracy, Perpessicius joined intellectuals who called for moderation. In a 1931 piece for Cuvântul, he reacted against nationalist arguments: [...] "The fashion of good Romanians is making a rather furious comeback. <b>You</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> the heresy: one claims that native inhabitants are separated into good and bad, into plagued and pleasant-smelling, less so for their intentions or actions, but rather for {{the point of view}} adopted by the esteemed censors of our public and national life. [...] And how much longer do they plan to confront us with this self-sufficient nonsense? Will the mystification never cease? Will common sense never descend among the concrete walls of the office where they forge nationality certificates? No good Romanians but just humans, just humans, gentlemen, and it would suffice." [...] Literary historian Z.

2500|$|Australia {{proceeded}} to the 1953 Ashes tour, travelling to England aboard the Orcades after leaving Australia in late March. They almost {{did so with}} their three main bowlers marooned in an Italian jail. During a stopover at Naples on the sea voyage to England, Miller had taken Lindwall and Johnston to watch a rehearsal of La Boheme at the Teatro di San Carlo. The trio ignored the doorkeeper's attempt to stop them attending what {{was meant to be}} a private rehearsal, and proceeded inside to the auditorium. When they attempted to return to the boat, they found that the doorkeeper had locked them inside and called the police. Lindwall broke the door's lock and the pacemen ran back to the dock just before the gangplank was being pulled away. The Australians arrived at Southampton after four weeks at sea. He was embroiled in further controversy when Bumper, a book that he had produced with his ghost-writer Dick Whitington, criticised his captain Hassett as being too cautious. The book commented that [...] "Hassett deals, or fails to deal with things as they occur". Early on the tour, the Evening News ran the headline [...] "Keith Miller Criticises his Captain". The poker-faced Hassett kept his cool at a welcome reception hosted by the Journalists' Association, introducing Miller to the guests by saying [...] "There is Keith Miller, whom <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> well. I hear he has written a book. I know nothing about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Pumpkins {{reformed}} in 2007, Corgan posted {{a message to}} the band's blog saying that they were [...] "ooking for girls from Siamese Dream album cover... As <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> they were quite young when the photo was taken. They are not conjoined anymore, as far as we know." [...] The band's intentions for the search were never made clear. In February 2011, Billy Corgan announced via Twitter that not only had one of the girls been found, she was the current bassist for the Pumpkins, Nicole Fiorentino. According to Corgan, [...] "Just found out the weirdest news: our bass player Nicole just admitted {{she is one of the}} girls on the cover of Siamese Dream." [...] However, according to the assistant photographer for Siamese Dream, the cover photo was probably shot specifically for the album. Given Fiorentino's age at the time of the album, this would make her too old to be on the cover of the album.

Pictures exist of Billy standing with Ali Laenger, the girl on the right side of the photograph, but it is unknown if the girl on the left, identified only as LySandra R, met Billy like Laenger did.|$|E
