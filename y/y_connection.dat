40|$|Design and {{analytical}} modeling considerations associated with recirculating flow in piping systems with tee and <b>Y</b> <b>connections</b> are presented. Flow recirculation, in many process piping networks, can produce nonsteady flow and associated thermal conditions. In the flow recirculation discussion, experimental data is presented for a 90 degree branch piping (tee connection) using four different branch pipe sizes {{over a wide}} velocity range [Coffield and Kolar (1990) ]. The discussion also includes recent test data for a 45 degree, Y connected, branch piping design. Designers can use this information by directly applying the limiting conditions that are presented at the design stage, or in evaluating the performance of existing systems. For example, although flow recirculation may result in complicated flow patterns, it often can have the beneficial effect of mixing low velocity branch line fluid with the primary system fluid as it approaches the intersection. In branch pipe systems where flows are at different temperatures this recirculation helps attenuate the potential for large thermal stresses. The recirculation flow patterns are strongly affected by the branch angle and thus they are presented {{as a function of}} the branch angle...|$|R

40|$|Recent spin-Seebeck {{experiments}} on thin ferromagnetic films apply a temperature difference Δ T_x {{along the length}} x and measure a (transverse) voltage difference Δ V_y along the width <b>y.</b> The <b>connection</b> between these effects is complex, involving: (1) thermal equilibration between sample and substrate; (2) spin currents along the height (or thickness) z; and (3) the measured voltage difference. The present work studies in detail {{the first of these}} steps, and outlines the other two steps. Thermal equilibration processes between the magnons and phonons in the sample, as well as between the sample and the substrate leads to two surface modes, with surface lengths λ, to provide for thermal equilibration. Increasing the coupling between the two modes increases the longer mode length and decreases the shorter mode length. The applied thermal gradient along x leads to a thermal gradient along z that varies as (x/λ), which can in turn produce fluxes of the carriers of up- and down- spins along z, and gradients of their associated magnetoelectrochemical potentials μ̅_↑,↓, which vary as (x/λ). By the inverse spin Hall effect, this spin current along z can produce a transverse (along y) voltage difference Δ V_y, which also varies as (x/λ). Comment: 14 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

In work [...] it is specified {{that it is possible to}} pass to the concept of an accidental network through creation of statistical ensemble of networks (a set of networks) in which everyone the specific network has the probability of implementation, that is each network of ensemble has own statistical weight. After creation of such ensemble it is possible to calculate average value for some size in an accidental network, by averaging of this size on all implementations, accepting in attention their statistical weight. This, to a certain extent simplified approach is realized in accidental networks which are usually represented by accidental columns (Erdos-Renyi model). At this model in which statistical ensemble counts with a quantity of nodes X and a quantity of <b>connections</b> <b>Y</b> are provided all columns (networks) have the identical statistical weight of implementation.

In this paper, having reduced the conjecture {{to the case of}} dimension three, if the ring is regular and local of dimension three, we explicitly describe a family of prime ideals of height two minimally generated by three elements. Weakening the hypothesis of regularity, we find that, to achieve the same end, we need to add extra hypotheses, such as completeness, infiniteness of the residue field and the multiplicity of the ring being at most three.

The pipe sizes and aspect are arbitrary except that for practical rea-sons we assume the pipe wall thickness to be small as com-pared to the skin depth. Handy formulas are presented for the field multipoles arising from non-round shape of the beam pipe. ELLIPTIC CONDUCTING BEAM PIPE Consider a cylindrical pipe of elliptic cross-section whose (uniform) thickness d is negligible compared with its major and minor semi-axes, a and b, {{as well as the}} skin depth δ: d a, b, δ. The pipe is put into a homo-geneous AC magnetic field perpendicular to the pipe axis directed along the coordinate z-axis, the field amplitude is taken as unity, and its oscillation frequency is ω, so that δ = c/ 2 πσω, where σ is the pipe wall conductivity. Find the eddy-current distribution over the pipe circumference and modification of the field due to eddy-currents. Elliptic Coordinates We use the elliptic cylindrical coordinates μ, θ with the focal parameter 2 f, which corresponds to the distance be-tween the foci of the elliptic and hyperbolic coordinate lines in the coordinate plane x 0 <b>y.</b> Their <b>connection</b> to the Cartesian coordinates x, y reads: cosh(μ + iθ) = (x + iy) /f, (1) x = f coshμ cos θ, y = f sinhμ sin θ, (2) μ ≥ 0, −π ≤ θ ≤ π, and the Lame ́ factors are hμ = hθ = h = f cosh 2 μ − cos 2 θ. (3) The foci position is y = 0, x = ±f, and the parameter f is found from the pipe sizes a, b: f = a 2 − b 2. The elliptic coordinates can be expressed via the Carte-sian coordinates using the distances r 1, 2 to the foci, r 1, 2 = (x ± f) 2 + y 2 = f(coshμ ± cos θ), whence coshμ = (r 1 + r 2) / 2 f, cos θ = 2 x/(r 1 + r 2).
