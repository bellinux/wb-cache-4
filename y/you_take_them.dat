These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades and you lose a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that they say I can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them?</b> At what point does it just stop being interesting?". Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's [...] "50 Sexiest Video Moments". The video was made commercially available in 2009, when it was included, albeit in a censored version, on Madonna's [...] compilation; it had previously been excluded from 1999's [...]|$|E

60|$|Cel. Nay, then, {{the case}} is clear, Florimel; if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>'em</b> all from me, 'tis because you reserve me for yourself.|$|R
6000|$|... "In a sense, I {{always was}} convinced. If I'd seen <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the wretched plans, I wouldn't have held you accountable. Because <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them,</b> it couldn't have been wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>'em</b> out, then, {{and replace}} 'em with pebbles, so that I won't feel above my station in life?" [...] asked the cat, pleadingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> occasionally, Signor Tenente; and, as I {{understand}} from this Ithuello, frequently contrary to their wishes and by force," [...] dryly observed Andrea Barrofaldi.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--where do {{you find}} them? <b>You</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> from the French mostly;--don't you?" [...] Mr. Bouncer became very red. [...] "Isn't that the way our English writers get their plots?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Only try to {{mind and}} heed, {{and you will}} learn. It will be a step if you will only put your shoes side by side when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is false. <b>You</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> {{from this}} room last night. At {{the very time}} you pretend you were after the robber at Mrs. Canby's house you were here ransacking my desk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> {{away from}} me, at any rate," [...] said Hilbert; and saying this, {{he turned away}} and walked off, {{seemingly}} very angry. He was going to complain to his father.|$|R
6000|$|... "There they were, and {{she took}} 'em," [...] said the broad-back. Oh, what a look Miss Grogram gave her! [...] "Took them! of course I <b>took</b> <b>them.</b> That is, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> as much as I did. They were things that we found lying about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So that I can clinch them," [...] replied Stuyvesant, [...] "and I {{should like}} to have <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> off the fire {{as soon as you}} see that they are red-hot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are in my}} suitcase," [...] Coulson answered, [...] "and {{according}} to {{the way things are}} going, I shan't be over sorry to get rid of them. Will <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shoot!" [...] cried Charley. [...] "You don't mean to {{say that}} you're going to waste your powder and shot by firing at the clouds! for, unless <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them,</b> I see nothing else here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{plans were}} in my pocket when I reached your house," [...] said Dick, who saw he must be frank. [...] "I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them,</b> and if <b>you</b> did, I wouldn't hold you responsible; but they were taken." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ugh!" [...] said Lewisham. [...] "But what is {{the good}} of {{argument}} and denial? <b>You</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> in, <b>you</b> had them. You may have been cunning, but you have given yourself away. And our life and all this"--he waved an inclusive hand at Madam Gadow's furniture--"is at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Anne, I noticed {{last night}} that you threw your clothes all about the floor when <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> off. That is a very untidy habit, and I can't allow it at all. As soon as <b>you</b> <b>take</b> off any article of {{clothing}} fold it neatly {{and place it on}} the chair. I haven't any use at all for little girls who aren't neat." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dick {{has been}} {{teaching}} me to take life flippantly. And I have learnt that things are only serious if <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> seriously, and that is desperately stupid. [To LUCY.] Don't you agree with me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of the circulars are to go there, {{and also}} back to Hopeville. Supposing <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> with you now, and start out distributing them from your home, instead of coming here? It will save time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seven trout," [...] {{answered}} the artist. [...] "I might have caught more, but the poor little creatures squirmed and struggled so desperately that I hadn't {{the heart to}} destroy any more of them. Won't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> home for Mr. Merrick's breakfast?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whitwell {{is their}} name. They {{live in that}} little house where <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>them.</b> Their father's got {{a piece of land}} on Zion's Head that he's clearin' off for the timber. Their mother's dead, and Cynthy keeps house. She's always makin' up names and faces," [...] added the boy. [...] "She thinks herself awful smart. That Franky's a perfect cry-baby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wimmin's a toss up," [...] said Uncle Pentstemon. [...] "Prize packets they are, and you can't tell what's in <b>'em</b> till <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>'em</b> 'ome and undone 'em. Never was a {{bachelor}} married yet that didn't buy a pig in a poke. Never. Marriage seems {{to change the}} very natures in 'em through and through. You can't tell what they won't turn into--nohow.|$|R
6000|$|His admiration was undisguised. 'Well, I do {{call you}} a woman of business, miss,' he cried. 'You see it at a glance. That's so. That's {{the right kind of}} thing to rope in the Europeans. Some {{originality}} about <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>take</b> <b>'em</b> on their own ground. You've got the draw on them, you hev. I like your system. You'll jest haul in the dollars!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the laws}} of the country protect you; all the {{advantages}} to be had from the town where you live are yours, the same as others, an' when <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> you have no right to do harm to the land which feeds you." ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS. Of course: that's why he's a good critic. Besides, if {{you take}} people seriously off the stage, why shouldn't <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> seriously on it, where they're under some sort of decent restraint? (He jumps down off piano and goes up to the window. Cuthbertson comes back.) ...|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. And, {{to deceive}} {{yourself}} the more completely, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> so very very seriously that Ecrasia here declares that {{the making of}} dolls is the holiest work of creation, and the words you put into the mouths of dolls the sacredest of scriptures and the noblest of utterances.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} you will tell them, Mistress Nellie, and trust that <b>you</b> will <b>take</b> <b>them</b> entirely into your confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are in the}} outhouse, those dreadful things," [...] {{said she}} as Lestrade entered. [...] "I wish that <b>you</b> would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> away altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I, my boy? Oh, yes. I am {{not that}} gentleman; neither are <b>you.</b> <b>Take</b> <b>'em</b> {{by the throat}} or chuck 'em under the chin is all one to me--almost," [...] affirmed Ricardo, with {{something}} obscurely ironical in his complacency. [...] "Now, as to this business. A three days' jaunt in a good boat isn't a thing to frighten people like us. You are right, so far; {{but there are other}} details." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do. Narcotics, one understands, are {{insidious}} things. If <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> regularly, {{in small}} doses, they increase their hold on {{you until you}} become wrapped up in dreams and unrealities. If, however, you get too big a dose {{of them at the}} beginning, it leads to a vigorous revulsion. It's nature's warning and remedy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is by {{no means}} certain, sir, that the ship and {{schooner}} that the drover saw are the vessels <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> to have been," [...] said Mr. Dillon, in a harsh, drawling tone of voice. [...] "I should doubt their daring to venture so openly on the coast, and in the direct track of our vessels of war." ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{reserved}} my {{acknowledgment of}} your delightful note (the youngest note I {{have had in}} all this year) until to-day, in order that I might send, most heartily and affectionately, all seasonable good wishes {{to you and to}} Mrs. Procter, and to those who are nearest and dearest to <b>you.</b> <b>Take</b> <b>them</b> from an old friend who loves you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir, and {{to those}} of mine also,' she replied. 'And <b>you</b> would <b>take</b> <b>them</b> over to the enemy from whom that prowess extorted them?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} not sworn to slay instantly. You can keep them, at least, until <b>you</b> can <b>take</b> <b>them</b> before the Khalifa, and say to him: ...|$|R
