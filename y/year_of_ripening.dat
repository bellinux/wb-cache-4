40|$|Identification and {{characterization}} of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) from Provolone del Monaco P. D. O. cheese {{has been carried}} out by the conventional microbiology followed by Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and 16 S rDNA sequencing. The aim of this research was to acquire information about the different microbial groups involved in cheese making produced from raw milk. Lactobacilli dominated largely, especially casei/paracasei group, up to the end of cheeses ripening, together by Lb. delbrueckii. The dominant cocci-shaped LAB until one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> were the S. macedonicus and S. lutetiensis/infantarius. Enterococci strains were also present and play a major role during manufacturing and aged cheese. Tyramine producing strains, belonging mostly to Enterococcus genus, were found by Decarboxylase Selective Medium (DSM). One strain of E. faecium tyramine positive was also enterocin A producing. Nevertheless, one strain of L. lactis was found to be Nisin A producing. Acidification capability test on selected isolates have shown Lb. delbrueckii, S. macedonicus, S. thermophilus, L. lactis and S. lutetiensis as fast acid producers. This study provided evidence that natural environments are rich in biodiversity and can be considered as proper sources of new strains and species within the LAB group. Provolone del Monaco cheeses were also analysed for their amount of biogenic amines and volatile flavor compounds using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (TD-GC/MS), respectively. All these cheeses belonged to the same batch production of the others subjected to microbiological analysis. Biogenic amines concentration was highest in sample which showed the defect of medium-sized eyes. While the other cheeses, with same typical sensorial characteristics of Provolone del Monaco P. D. O. cheese, had the lowest and similar biogenic amines levels. Ketones, esters, acids were volatile compounds associated to the analysed cheese samples. New information regarding the flavor profile of Provolone del Monaco P. D. O. cheese are provided. Moreover, sample with medium-sized eye was associated to a very high number of esters and was found to have a different profile of volatile flavor compounds than the other cheeses, which were associated mainly to ketones and acids...|$|E
40|$|International audienceHigh-performance {{concretes}} {{reinforced with}} metal fibres (SFRHPC) have multiple advantages {{when they are}} used in the marine environment. These materials provide high strengths at the young age that permit faster formwork stripping, resistance to hydrostatic thrusts due to the tides, structural elements sections’ reduction, as well as weight reduction of the structure, and the increase of the abrasion resistance to sand or gravel. The maritime works are exposed to specific seawater aggressions. Seawater contains aggressive salts, which damage the concrete and the steel that it may contain. These salts are mainly chlorides and sulphates. This study investigated the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> steel fibre-reinforced high-performance concrete, with 15 % substitution of cement by blast furnace slag, in Rance (France’s seawater). This experimental study analysed the effect of 6 and 24 months <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> the sample, in aggressive water, on the characterisation of the concrete and the microstructure of the cement’s matrix and its fibres.

Ripening duration and rosemary addition appeared to influence water activity (aw) of salchichon sausages. The aw <b>of</b> SMS <b>ripened</b> for 45 days was 0. 80, whereas the other had aw values < 0. 80.

In this research {{it was assumed}} that applied milk thermal treatment, as well as curd processing, will have appropriate influence on proteins as substratum. During ripening, due to a presence of whey proteins, which influence decrease of casein content in total cheese proteins, substratum is hydrolyzed. In traditionally made cheeses, casein is the basis of protein matrix. In comparison to whey proteins, casein is substantially faster changed during ripening, while whey proteins incorporated in the curd give so called «unspecific» <b>ripening.</b> Besides, application <b>of</b> high temperatures influences decrease of plasmin activity in cheese, regardless of its significant thermal stability. During 4 months ofexperimental cheeses <b>ripening,</b> changes <b>of</b> nitrogen matter were investigated. Significant changes of milk proteins, such as increase of soluble nitrogen matter content, the primary and secondary nitrogen products of protein breakdown during cheese ripening, as well as non-protein nitrogen (12 % TCA) and phospho-tungstic-soluble nitrogen (5 % PTA) were observed.

A control sausage was produced without starter culture (sausage A), one with L. sakei CECT 5964 and S. equorum SA 25 (sausage B) and one with L. sakei CECT 5964, S. equorum SA 25 and L. acidophilus CECT 903 (sausage C). Samples from each batch of sausages were taken at 0 (mix before stuffing), and after 2, 4, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Counts <b>of</b> total aerobic mesophilic flora, lactic acid bacteria, salt tolerant flora, and Enterobacteriaceae and some physical-chemical parameters (moisture, NaCl, pH and aw values) were determined. High microbial counts (log CFU) were observed with values at the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> period: for lactic acid bacteria 9. 77 (A), 11. 47 (B) and 11. 19 (C); for total aerobic mesophilic flora 9. 89 (A), 11. 38 (B) and 11. 30 (C); for salt tolerant flora 4. 45 (A), 5. 31 (B) and 5. 27 (C). The starter cultures had a significant inhibitory effect on Enterobacteriaceae counts (log CFU), values at the end <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> period being 1. 32 (A), 0. 33 (B) and not detected (C). A significant decrease in the pH values is observed until the seventh day <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> showing a slight, but progressive increase after the 14 th day <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Results show that the production and ripening process in a pilot scale chamber under controlled conditions contributes in obtaining safe and homogeneous products...|$|R
40|$|Grape {{and wine}} {{production}} and quality is extremely {{dependent on the}} fruit ripening process. Sensory and nutritional characteristics are important aspects for consumers and their development during fruit ripening involves complex hormonal control. In this review, we explored data already published on grape ripening and compared it with the hormonal regulation <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> other climacteric and non-climacteric fruits. The roles of abscisic acid, ethylene, and brassinosteroids as promoters <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> are discussed, {{as well as the}} role of auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, jasmonates, and polyamines as inhibitors <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> In particular, the recently described role of polyamine catabolism in grape ripening is discussed, together with its putative interaction with other hormones. Furthermore, other recent examples of cross-talk among the different hormones are presented, revealing a complex interplay of signals during grape development and ripening...|$|R

30|$|The {{improvement}} of rice yield {{is a crucial}} global issue, but evaluating yield requires substantial efforts. Rice yield comprises the following indices: panicle number (PN), grain number per panicle (GN), 1000 -grain weight, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>ripened</b> grain. To simplify measurements, we analyzed one panicle weight (OPW) as a simplified yield index that integrates GN, grain weight, and percentage <b>of</b> <b>ripened</b> grain, and verified its suitability {{as a proxy for}} GN and grain weight in particular.|$|R

As microstructures often reveal rough or irregular aspect, fractal tools appear to be particularly adapted to their study. In this paper, fractal techniques quantifying {{the texture of the}} image are applied to separate type, plant and day <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> different butters. The images are taken from butters produced in industrial conditions. The influence of the crystallization on the fractal parameters has been observed. Fractal quantifiers have demonstrated promising correlations with the day <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> the butter. Moreover, they have also shown to be efficient in separating different kinds of butters...|$|R
