5000|$|UAW Gm Quality 500 at Charlotte; Ken Squier for TBS before TBS {{signed off}} {{for the last time}} {{covering}} NASCAR action: [...] " [...] For years, we who have been fans and followers have wanted one thing from this sport: Respect. And over the past few years, we've obtained a lot more of just that - the sense of being included in the real part of the American sport spectrum. And for years, we've wanted these drivers to get the financial respect that we believe they deserve for their commitment to this very dangerous and very difficult game. 2001 will be a pivotal year in Winston Cup racing and its history. New tracks will bring the speed, the spectacle, and the heroes to new facilities and major population areas. And this new TV contract will provide the Winston Cup drivers with the dollars they deserve, and the television promise is to bring new technology and new excitement. You know, I love 1969 and '70 when the pioneer effort was with the Motor Racing Network in bringing radio broadcasting to a new level. It was exciting then. It was thrilling in the year 1979 with that first live flag-to-flag broadcast of the Daytona 500 which many say changed the way America perceived this sport and its heroes. And I think it's gonna be just as exciting next year to see what's on the horizon for the Great American Game - Stock car racing.
