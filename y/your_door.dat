500|$|In the {{original}} poem, the verse says [...] "Without {{going out of}} my door, I can know the ways of heaven." [...] And so to prevent any misinterpretations – and also to make the song a bit longer – I did repeat that as a second verse but made it: [...] "Without going out of <b>your</b> <b>door</b> / You can know all things on earth / Without looking out of your window / You can know the ways of heaven" [...] – so that it included everybody.|$|E
500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down <b>your</b> <b>door</b> and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

500|$|The single [...] "Undone - The Sweater Song" [...] was {{described}} by Cuomo as [...] "the feeling you get when the train stops and the little guy comes knockin' on <b>your</b> <b>door.</b> It {{was supposed to be}} a sad song, but everyone thinks it's hilarious." [...] The video marks one of the early directorial efforts of Spike Jonze, whose pitch was simply [...] "A blue stage, a steadicam, a pack of wild dogs." [...] The video became an instant hit on MTV. [...] The final single, [...] "Say it Ain't So", was again inspired by Cuomo believing his parents split up when he was four because he thought his dad was an alcoholic. The music video, which was directed by Sophie Muller, was less successful than the previous Spike Jonze-directed video. It featured the band performing in the garage of their former house, and the bandmates playing hacky sack in the backyard.|$|E
500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven's meditations on illness, {{conscience}} and mortality in the Late String Quartets {{led to his}} dedicating the third movement of String Quartet in A Minor (1825) Op. 132 (see String Quartet No. 15) as a [...] "Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of a convalescent". John Lennon's work [...] "Imagine" [...] owes much of its popular appeal to its evocation of conscience against the atrocities created by war, religious fundamentalism and politics. The Beatles George Harrison-written track [...] "The Inner Light" [...] sets to Indian raga music a verse from the Tao Te Ching that [...] "without going out of <b>your</b> <b>door</b> you can know the ways of heaven'. In the 1986 movie The Mission the guilty {{conscience and}} penance of the slave trader Mendoza is made more poignant by the haunting oboe music of Ennio Morricone ("On Earth {{as it is in}} Heaven") The song Sweet Lullaby by Deep Forest is based on a traditional Baegu lullaby from the Solomon Islands called [...] "Rorogwela" [...] in which a young orphan is comforted as an act of conscience by his older brother. The Dream Academy song 'Forest Fire' provided an early warning of the moral dangers of our 'black cloud' 'bringing down a different kind of weather... letting the sunshine in, that's how the end begins." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in April, 2010. He thought that the Ferengi were a [...] "one note" [...] opponent for the crew, but that in this episode they weren't as bad as they were in [...] "". He thought that the plot made the crew look a little silly, saying [...] "Put it this way: if somebody showed up at <b>your</b> <b>door</b> and said, [...] "Hey, we want to give you this weapon you used to murder a bunch of guys we knew years ago," [...] wouldn't you be a little suspicious?" [...] He gave the episode an overall mark of C+. James Hunt reviewed the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in November 2012, and said that it was the best episode of the series up until that point. He thought that little touches such as the Stargazer using the movie-era effect for warp drive was a cute touch as it was meant to be an older ship than the Enterprise but also pointed out that [...] "it also means that the Picard Manoeuvre is completely invalidated, because you literally see the ship move from point A to B before the original disappears". He felt that the conflict between Picard and Bok was well realised, and that the characterisation was good.|$|E

500|$|Yet another {{interpretation}} is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself, particularly his acoustic performer self. The opening line [...] "You must leave now" [...] {{can be a}} command, similar to the line [...] "Go away from my window" [...] that opens [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe". But {{it can also be}} an imperative, meaning just that it is necessary that you leave. And the song is as much about new beginnings as it is about endings. The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave, but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward, in lines such as [...] "Strike another match, go start anew". If Dylan is singing the song to himself, then he himself would be the [...] "vagabond who's rapping at <b>your</b> <b>door</b> / standing in the clothes that you once wore". That is, the new, electric, surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond, not yet having removed the [...] "clothes" [...] of the old protest singer. Alternatively, the vagabond and [...] "stepping stones" [...] referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind. He would also be telling himself to [...] "Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you." [...] Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known, the political left or to the illusions of his youth.|$|E
2500|$|In Texas in 2007, {{a couple}} {{living in the}} Madison Park area of Houston was {{instructed}} to [...] "remove the item attached to <b>your</b> <b>door</b> frame" [...] to avoid violating association rules. A legal battle ensued, during which a U.S. District Court judge ruled in 2008 {{on behalf of the}} condo association. Subsequently the couple turned to Texas House of Representatives member Garnet F. Coleman. His bill to protect such religious displays, as introduced in 2009, was not adopted, but in June 2011 a slightly revised version (HB1278) was signed into law by Texas Governor Rick Perry.|$|E
2500|$|Their debut single, [...] "Trojans", was {{released}} on 4 May 2011. It was co-written by all four members. They entered the track on national radio station Triple J's talent contest Unearthed's website. In the United States in June, [...] "Trojans" [...] received its first favorable review from Neon Gold's Andrew Hwang, who proclaimed that, [...] " [...] knocks on <b>your</b> <b>door</b> and creeps into your peripheries in stealth mode" [...] and that the single [...] "approaches Phoenix-esque levels of infectiousness". By September that year, it was placed on high rotation by satellite radio station Sirius XM's Alt Nation channel.|$|E

2500|$|Far Q is {{the debut}} studio album by British rock band Lower Than Atlantis. Following {{multiple}} line-up changes, the band gained drummer Eddy Thrower before starting work on Far Q. The album was recorded above a printing factory in Hertfordshire between September and November 2009 with producer Daniel Lancaster. [...] "Taping Songs Off the Radio" [...] was released {{as a single}} in early March 2010 with Far Q following later that month. It was released through A Wolf at <b>Your</b> <b>Door.</b> A vinyl edition was released by German label Redfield. The album was critically lauded upon release. [...] "Far Q" [...] was released as a single in mid-July. In September and October, the band toured the UK on the Rock Sound Presents...

2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it {{to the best of your}} ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, you have to realize that there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 February 2010 [...] "I'm Not Bulimic (I Just Wanted to See How Far I Could Stick My Fingers Down My Throat)" [...] {{was made}} {{available}} for streaming via the band's Myspace profile. The music video for [...] "Taping Songs Off the Radio" [...] was released on 17 February, and the song released as a single on 1 March with [...] "I'm Not Bulimic (I Just Wanted to See How Far I Could Stick My Fingers Down My Throat)" [...] as the B-side. Far Q was released on 29 March 2010 by A Wolf at <b>Your</b> <b>Door.</b> German label Redfield released a mediabook edition of the CD and a vinyl version of the album; the mediabook was limited to 1,000 copies while the vinyl was limited to 500 copies. The album's artwork was created by Alex Gregory and Jon Bamby. The pair also contributed the design, while Gregory provided photography and Bamby did the layout.|$|E

All three rappers verses in the song, Papoose's, Jim Jones' and Jadakiss', detail what was going on the day and night before the event, with each verse ending when the cops are knocking. [...] "Law Library 8" [...] {{is the latest in a}} series of songs by Papoose, that break down the ins and outs, of different aspects of the law. In each of the [...] "Law Library" [...] songs he breaks down a different part of a case, this ranges from the arrest warrant to the trail proceedings. This version features a case on firearms. He called the second single, his collaboration with his wife rapper Remy Ma [...] "a fun record" [...] that features the husband and wife trading bars back and forth about love.|$|E
2500|$|He did not pardon former Marshal Antonescu, who {{was sentenced}} to death [...] "for {{betrayal}} of the Romanian people for the benefit of Nazi Germany, for the economic and political subjugation of Romania to Germany, for cooperation with the Iron Guard, for murdering his political opponents, for the mass murder of civilians and crimes against peace". Nor did King Michael manage to save such leaders of the opposition as Iuliu Maniu and the Bratianus, victims of communist political trials, as the Constitution prevented him from doing so without the counter-signature of communist Justice Minister Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu (who himself was later eliminated by Gheorghiu-Dej's opposing communist faction). The memoirs of King Michael's aunt Princess Ileana quoted Emil Bodnăraș — her alleged lover, Romania's communist minister of defence, and a Soviet spy—as saying: [...] "Well, if the King decides not to sign the death warrant, I promise that we will uphold his point of view." [...] Princess Ileana was sceptical: [...] "You know quite well (...) that the King will never of his free will sign such an unconstitutional document. If he does, it will be laid at <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> and before the whole nation your government will bear the blame. Surely you do not wish this additional handicap at this moment!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The spot {{advertising}} for the fictional United Trek Federation was {{a spot on}} Darker Projects, premiering on the sixth third-season episode of Star Trek: The Section 31 Files called Invasion, Part III - Warday. In this spot, an announcer says [...] "How many times does this happen to you?", followed by the two geeks downloading a possible new Star Trek episode ( [...] or Section 31) available. Instead, they stumbled upon Doctor Who, and attempts to free the computer unsuccessful as it detonated, marking [...] "another tragic act of computer terrorism {{at the hands of}} the Who World Order." [...] The announcer then asks: [...] "Do you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering today's the day the forces of the Who World Order will come knocking on <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> to drag you off to their Who Relocation Camps?" [...] It is then the United Trek Federation is introduced. What happens next is that a young woman (voiced by Kara Dennison) shouting her Trek DVDs have been stolen by some Dinomonster. This particular agent is being intercepted by the UTF agent who's there for her, and the stolen DVDs are recovered back. It concludes with the line: [...] "With the United Trek Federation, you can sleep easily. Knowing the monsters of the Who World Order have at last met their match. United Trek Federation.

2500|$|Trinity's mascot, the bantam, was {{conceived}} by Joseph Buffington, Class of 1875, {{who was a}} federal judge and trustee of the College. He was a noted speaker, and gave an address during an 1899 dinner with alumni of other prestigious colleges. Giving his view on what a Trinity student is, and supporting his view that Trinity students {{are different from the}} [...] "collegiate barnyard" [...] consisting of Harvard and Yale (amongst others such as Amherst), Buffington said: [...] "But I tell you, my fellow chanticleers, that the Trinity bantam has been brought up in the Trinity barnyard on different principles, and the most marked outcome of his collegiate training is the fostering of a habit which leads him to size things from his own standpoint, and not have somebody else size them for him." [...] He continued, saying: [...] "You will therefore understand, gentlemen, the spirit in which the Trinity bantam, game from comb to spur, crows at <b>your</b> <b>door,</b> hops in, shakes his tail feathers, and with a sociable nod to the venerable John, and a good natured [...] "How d'ydo" [...] to the ponderous old Elihu steps into the collegiate cock pit, makes his best bow to the tiger, says he is glad to be here, is not a whit abashed at your hugeness, [...] is satisfied with himself and his own particular coop." ...|$|E
