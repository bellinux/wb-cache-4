500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>more</b> than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E
