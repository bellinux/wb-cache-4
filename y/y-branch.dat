The splitters {{consist of a}} <b>Y-branch,</b> two 90 degrees submicrometer-radius bends (SRBs), and two straight-MISIM waveguides connecting the <b>Y-branch</b> and the two SRBs. The <b>Y-branch</b> is an overlap of two oppositely directed SRBs. All the SRBs of the splitter have the same radius of curvature. The splitter has a feature that {{the length of the}} in-between MISIM waveguides is adjusted to make its input waveguide split over a short distance into its widely separated output waveguides. Simulation of the splitters indicates that the radius of curvature of the SRB needs to be >= 0. 8 mu m to make small the excess losses of the splitters. When the radius of curvature is 0. 8 mu m, the splitter which can connect its input waveguide just over 1. 6 mu m to its output waveguides spaced 6. 4 mu m apart has an excess loss of 1. 4 dB. The splitters are realized by using the standard CMOS technology. The measured excess losses of the fabricated splitters are larger than the calculated excess losses.
