60|$|MRS. CLANDON. The first officer! Are you serious, Gloria? What did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> (correcting herself) Excuse me: I have {{no right}} to ask that.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> I {{longed to}} hear, for {{you seemed to}} enjoy yourselves very much, but I didn't {{like to be a}} marplot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Farnaby's ideas, sir, {{have crossed}} the water and landed in New York," [...] Rufus remarked. [...] "Well, and what did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> on your side?" ...|$|E
25|$|Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say {{nothing of}} another <b>you</b> wouldn’t <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{in the same}} {{language}} and tone of voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "What the deuce did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> for, Beetle?" [...] said McTurk angrily, as they strolled {{towards the}} big, open sea-baths.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Miss May?' said Leonard, {{turning on}} her a flushed face, {{as if he}} could almost have been angered with her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But what, then, can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> or to them,' says he, 'when {{they find}} you {{positive}} against a match {{which would be}} apparently so much to your advantage?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to trouble}} your father too much, Adolay," [...] whispered Cheenbuk; [...] "would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that we wish {{very much to}} see him use the spouter?" ...|$|E
60|$|MISS D. Yes, perfectly. Be {{quick and}} hand {{him over to}} your Mother, {{and then we can}} talk. I shall listen at the door to hear what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Suppose {{a brother}} or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of <b>you</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed", but does nothing about his {{physical}} needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, {{if it is not}} accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, [...] "You have faith; I have deeds." [...] Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> been <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> I won't {{have you}} walk with Ontario Moggs. I {{and your mother}} 'll have to fall out if {{this kind of thing}} goes on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you {{did meet}} Mr. Fitzallen, {{did you tell}} him nothing else except that you were engaged <b>to</b> me? Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as <b>to</b> your {{feelings}} towards himself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what did}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> William? I am sure I should never {{stop to think}} whether he was {{breaking}} in the pony, or not, if I saw him riding it about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what did}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> you said something. You did not, at any rate, bid him {{remember}} {{that he was a}} poor labouring man, and that you were a lady of high rank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, how? Perhaps {{he did not}} {{understand}} you. No, he did {{not understand}} you. What did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Don Ippolito? Tell me!" [...] She leaned towards him, in anxious emotion, as she spoke.|$|E
6000|$|When Pogson {{has done}} {{sneezing}} with the snuff, <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Take a fauteuil. I have {{the honor of}} addressing Sir Benjamin Pogson, I believe?" [...] And then you will explain <b>to</b> <b>him</b> your system.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{seemed so}} to me. But if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>him</b> about it, and just buy a few gowns now and again, he will perhaps be so wrapt {{up in the}} higher affairs of his art as not to take any notice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my {{wish that}} the news of my death be broken to my mother by Mr. Ogilvy, the schoolmaster, and by no other. <b>You</b> will <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that this is my solemn request, and that I bid him {{discharge}} it without faltering and be of good cheer.|$|R
6000|$|If you try to, {{this is what}} happens. You summon {{a waiter}} to you and <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> very slowly, {{syllable}} by syllable, so as to give him every chance in case he's not an educated man: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you would}} {{speak with the}} King at all," [...] said the thrall, [...] "the less <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> the better, for he is {{in no mood to}} be troubled just now. He sets out for the Springs to-morrow morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{he spoke}} of such things as these, did he?" [...] {{returned}} Paul. [...] "Well, yes, he's bin up to a deal of mischief in his day. And what did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> lass? Did you try to quiet him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear,' said James, doubtfully; 'supposing, what I hardly dare to imagine, that {{he should}} consent, what should <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> my {{bringing}} <b>him</b> here? ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sends you}} his warm regards, and I {{send you a}} kiss of baby's, who is {{finishing}} his Babylonish education, unfortunate child, by learning a complement of French. I assure you he understands everything <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> in English as well as Italian, so that he won't be utterly denationalised.|$|R
6000|$|... "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{the same}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> child? He meant it {{as little as}} you did. Don't let your foolish pride keep you miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, but, my dear,' says he, 'what can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> You know, as {{you said}} when we talked of it before, he well ask you many {{questions}} about it, and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should be.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The cafe," [...] she answered, [...] "is {{called the}} Hotel de Flandres. You enter the {{restaurant}} and you walk to the desk. There you find always Monsieur Antoine. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> simply--'The Double-Four!' He will answer that he understands, and he will conduct you at once to Lemaitre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it; we {{tell our}} sorrows to such as Geoffrey, our sins to such as Adam. But, Faith, when you spoke of me, did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> {{what you have}} been saying to me about my unfitness to be his wife because of inequality, and my unhappy inheritance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I had the {{favour of}} yours of the 17th. July in Course. I found an {{opportunity}} lately to acquaint Glengarie {{of what you}} wrot me on his account some time ago in answer to his from Arras; he desires me {{to thank you for}} what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> obliging <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and begs youll accept of his best compliments.' ...|$|R
60|$|SIR:--Your having {{shown me}} Mr. Davis's letter to {{you of the}} twelfth instant, <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that I have {{constantly}} been, am now, and shall continue ready to receive any agent whom he or any other influential person now resisting the national authority may informally send to me with the view of securing peace {{to the people of}} our one common country.|$|R
6000|$|After the dinner, Alberic de Montemar rose to {{take his}} leave, as he was to ride half way to his home that afternoon. Count Bernard, who all dinner time had been {{watching}} him intently from under his shaggy eye-brows, at this moment turned to Richard, whom he hardly ever addressed, and said <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> [...] "Hark ye, my Lord, what should <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> have <b>him</b> yonder for a comrade?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Irwine, rather hesitatingly, [...] "there {{would be}} some real {{advantages}} in that...and I honour you for your friendship towards him, Bartle. But...you must be careful what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> you know. I'm afraid you have too little fellow-feeling in what you consider his weakness about Hetty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My darling child! I won't move, dearest. Well; {{and what}} did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> God bless him, at any rate. May God bless him, because he has seen with a true eye, and felt with a noble instinct. It is something, Grace, to have been wooed by such a man at such a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was a good}} worker. He's done a heap of {{work for}} me. He never loafed on me, an' he was a joe-dandy at hammerin' a raw team into shape. He's got a head on him. He can do {{everything}} but talk. He knows what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Look at 'm now. He knows we're talkin' about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can take}} that with you," [...] she said, with {{a desperate attempt to}} imitate the other's {{previous}} indifference. [...] "I shouldn't like to deprive you and YOUR FRIEND of the opportunity of making use of it again. As for MY husband, I shall <b>say</b> nothing of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as long as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of me--which I suppose is what you mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{can you go}} on so, Elsie?" [...] said Mrs. Kirkby, with languid protest. [...] "Only I trust <b>you</b> didn't <b>say</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> of the syndicate. And, thank Heaven! {{the property}} isn't here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next {{time you}} happen to be alone with Lawrence Cavendish, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> 'I have a message for you, from Poirot. He says: [...] "Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace!"' Nothing more. Nothing less." ...|$|R
