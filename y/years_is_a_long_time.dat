500|$|Radcliffe {{admitted}} {{that some people}} {{would never be able}} to separate him from the character, but also said he is [...] "proud to be associated with this film series forever." [...] Despite positive feelings about the movies, he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films. After Rowling hinted about writing an eighth book, Radcliffe was asked if he would do another film to which he replied: [...] " [...] very doubtful. I think 10 <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> to spend with one character." [...] Despite devoting so much time to the series, Radcliffe has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors: [...] "Iâ€™ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter." ...|$|E
500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and {{was surprised by the}} extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E

The existence of usurpers during the Crisis of the Third Century was very common, and the high number of usurpers fought by Gallienus is due to his <b>long</b> rule; 15 <b>years</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> reign {{by the standards of the}} 3rd century Roman Empire.|$|R

In support of the album release, Secor states:"Fifty <b>years</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> for a place like Nashville, Tennessee. Time rolls on slowly around here like flotsam and jetsam in the muddy Cumberland River. But certain things have accelerated the pace of our city.

Jeremy Botter of Heavy.com wrote: [...] "Ken Shamrock {{used to be the}} baddest man on the planet. In the early days of mixed martial arts, it was tough to find anybody who inspired more fear than Shamrock.

50|$|As of December 2009, Lytle retired {{performing}} and touring with the Comets, stating 20 <b>years</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> enough reunion for him, and {{he wished to}} try some new things including concentrating on a solo project. In 2006 the group took up a long-term residence at the Dick Clark American Bandstand Theater in Branson, Missouri, performing more than 150 shows at the venue, with more in 2007. The group also toured Europe in early 2007. Following the death of Johnny Grande and the retirement from touring of Franny Beecher, both in 2006, Lytle {{was one of three}} remaining original band members still with the group. In 2009, Lytle released his memoir, entitled Still Rockin' Around The Clock. At that time, he underwent surgery to remove part of his leg. Despite that setback, Lytle continued to perform, albeit with other musicians and without the other Comets.|$|R

500|$|Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as {{his primary}} filming {{location}} for Metropolis, while start dates for filming <b>were</b> pushed back. <b>A</b> minor {{piece of the}} Krypton set was constructed but then destroyed, and Cage had even attended a costume fitting. The studio was also considering changing the title Superman Lives back to Superman Reborn. Deeming Wesley Strick's script too expensive, Warner Bros. {{enlisted the help of}} Dan Gilroy to rewrite it into something more economically feasible. Gilroy lowered the $190million budget set by Strick's draft to $100million. However, the studio was still less willing to fast track production, due to financial reasons with other film properties, having Gilroy turn in two drafts. Ultimately, Warner Bros. chose to put the film on hold in April 1998, and Burton left to direct Sleepy Hollow. At this point in production, Warner Bros had spent $30million on developing the film. Burton, citing various differences with Peters and the studio, said, [...] "I basically wasted <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to <b>be</b> working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with." ...|$|R
