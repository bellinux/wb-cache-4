Meanwhile let me {{disclose}} to you the pure and disinterested source of Sir John's rancour. You shall see what an upright and honest gentleman is Sir John, who was your father's friend and has been your guardian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you had {{scarcely}} {{passed through}} the first danger of being discovered than you {{began to think of}} us. <b>You</b> <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> many Arabs had been killed when we poured out of the city, and that others had been taken prisoners. Wounded yourself, you lose no moment in finding my two followers. All night you search among the dead for me, and carry me off to a place of safety. Then, without rest, without pause, you return to the city and begin to take measures to rescue Sidi. He was in the citadel, strongly guarded by French troops. There was but one way of succeeding. You thought of that way. You planned it all out. You invented a likely story, which was yet very close to the truth. You went into the midst of the men that you have been fighting against, and you so sustained the character that you had chosen, that none of the French officers suspected for a moment that you were aught but what you seemed, and so, listening to your pleading on his behalf, let him go free. Well did I say, the other day, that though we might be beaten, I believed that you and my son would escape, for that Allah had clearly sent you to save him from danger, and that he would therefore assuredly preserve you both." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So! We are {{becoming}} politicians, eh, Ganymede? And how shall all this concern us? Had you listened more attentively, <b>you</b> had <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> {{we go to}} Languedoc to seek a wife, and not to concern ourselves with Cardinals and Dukes. Now let me sleep ere the sun rises." ...|$|R

"'Lord Minster,' I said, 'you {{have studied}} human nature but very superficially, if <b>you</b> have not <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> {{it is better}} {{for a woman to}} be miserable with the man she loves, than [...] "admired, powerful, and {{consequently}} happy," [...] with one who has no attraction for her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A wire {{signed with}} your name? They knew enough of {{you both for}} that. They weren't sure of how much <b>you</b> had <b>learnt</b> in <b>that</b> house. Their {{kidnapping}} of Miss Tuppence is the counter-move to your escape. If necessary they could seal your lips with a threat of {{what might happen to}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have been}} to blame. It must be my fault <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have not <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> your husband is the man to come to--at such a time as this. Oh, I think I understand, Annabel. You were afraid of me, afraid that I should have been shocked, afraid of the scandal. Bah. Little woman, you have been brave enough before. Pull {{yourself}} together now. Drink this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the mills!" [...] she exclaimed, {{recurring}} {{in thought}} {{to what he}} had once said of his work in them. [...] "Surely you don't mean that!" [...] The sight, the smell, the tumult of the work she had seen that day in the mill with Lyra came upon her with all their offence. [...] "To throw away all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have <b>learnt,</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have become to others!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Understand them! yes. I {{understand}} {{that you are a}} little-minded man, and, like all little-minded men, cruel, and desirous of exacting the uttermost farthing in the way of revenge, forgetting that you owe everything to me. I do not wish to exculpate myself, mind you. Looking at the case from your point of view, and in your own petty way, I can almost sympathize with you. But as for accepting your terms--do you know me so little as to think that I could do so? Have <b>you</b> not <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> I may break, but shall never bend? And, if I chose now to face the matter out, I should beat you, even now when you hold all the cards in your hand; but I am weary of it all, especially weary of you and your little ways, and I do not choose. You will injure me enough to make the great success I planned for us both impossible, and I am tired of everything except the success which crowns a struggle. Well, I have ways of escape you know nothing of. Do your worst; I am not afraid of you;" [...] and she leaned back easily in her chair, and looked at him with wearied and indifferent eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Johnson {{said the}} college {{had taken the}} {{decision}} to close the nursery and make staff redundant on the assumption the nursery would fail to recruit more nurseries. Mr Johnson said: [...] "Had you met with the senior staff (at the nursery) <b>you</b> would have <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> the deficit of Â£40,000 a year upon which the SLT based its decision would only apply if the nursery fails to recruit more users. The staff told me how fortunate they'd been not to lose any existing users {{given the fact that}} they've been faced with well publicised plans for closure. They are not yet at capacity and further customers can eliminate what's left of the deficit. Mr Johnson closed the letter urging the Group [...] "not to lose public sympathy" [...] over the issue and asked to hold a meeting to discuss the business plan with the women [...] "as soon as possible".|$|R

"I think, Clinton, {{that were}} I in your place I {{should go to}} the {{commanding}} officer and tell him <b>you</b> have <b>learnt</b> <b>that</b> the trumpeter who was with the wounded sergeant of the Heavies found in the grove, and who left him to fetch aid from our camp, was your brother. You can say that on account of a misunderstanding he left home and enlisted under a false name, and beg that a search be instituted for his body, and also that the politicals who are in communication with the natives should make inquiries whether any white captive had been brought into Metemmeh. If you like I will say as much to our colonel, and I am sure that he will give orders that whenever detachments go out strict search will be made of all ground over which they pass. I am afraid that if we do learn from the natives that he is at Metemmeh our chance of getting him back before we take the place is small, for even if the people into whose hands he fell were willing to part with him for a ransom, the fanatical dervishes would not allow it; however, there would be no harm in trying. I know that to-day half a dozen natives came in with some cattle and grain, and no doubt some others will be in to-morrow." ...|$|R

And you mean to say that if one may be disputed, so may the other. Well, let that pass for the moment. But let me ask you a question in turn. Did not this system of yours, which you swallowed whole, contain all sorts of things that were merely local, the respect for the chief of your clan, or such things; the village ghost, the family feud, or what not? Did you not take in those things, too, along with your theology?" ...|$|R
