6000|$|... "Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the {{knowledge}} of the law which this way of writing betrays in an ignorant woman? I have been learning, my dear: the Law and the Lady have begun by understanding one another. In plain English, I have looked into Ogilvie's 'Imperial Dictionary,' and Ogilvie tells me, 'A verdict of Not Proven only indicates that, in the opinion of the jury, there is a deficiency in the evidence to convict the prisoner. A verdict of Not Guilty imports the jury's opinion that the prisoner is innocent.' Eustace, that shall be the opinion of the world in general, and of the Scotch jury in particular, in your case. To that one object I dedicate my life to come, if God spare me! ...|$|E

(Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my not writing 'Mr.' before his name? We have got so familiar, my dear, that 'Mr.' would be quite out of place.) He had left me the evening before, under very {{interesting}} circumstances. I {{had told him that}} his friend Armadale was persecuting me by means of a hired spy. He had declined to believe it, and had gone straight to Thorpe Ambrose to clear the thing up. I let him kiss my hand before he went. He promised to come back the next day (the Sunday). I felt I had secured my influence over him; and I believed he would keep his word.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} back too," [...] he said. [...] "Pray allow me the {{pleasure}} of accompanying you. Will you take my arm? <b>You</b> look <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> seeing me!" ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, come! Not <b>surprise</b> <b>you!</b> It's your pose {{never to}} be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> anything; but if <b>you</b> are not <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> this <b>you</b> are not human.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you do, {{why should}} <b>you</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> her leaving <b>you?</b> You {{want to be}} back at Limmeridge, and she has gone there to get your uncle's leave for you on his own terms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you? You take no {{interest}} in the subject, I dare say? Quite natural. I took {{no interest}} either until I was married. My dear husband--dead many years since--formed my tastes and elevated me to himself. You have heard of the late Professor Lecomte, the eminent Swiss naturalist? I am his widow. The English circle at Zurich (where I lived in my late master's service) Anglicized my name to Lecount. Your generous country people will have nothing foreign about them--not even a name, if they can help it. But I was speaking of my husband--my dear husband, who permitted me to assist him in his pursuits. I have had only one interest since his death--an interest in science. Eminent in many things, the professor was great at reptiles. He left me his Subjects and his Tank. I had no other legacy. There is the Tank. All the Subjects died but this quiet little fellow--this nice little toad. Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my liking him? There is nothing to be surprised at. The professor lived long enough to elevate me above the common prejudice against the reptile creation. Properly understood, the reptile creation is beautiful. Properly dissected, the reptile creation is instructive in the last degree." [...] She stretched out her little finger, and gently stroked the toad's back with the tip of it. [...] "So refreshing to the touch," [...] said Mrs. Lecount--"so nice and cool this summer weather!" ...|$|E

'I ought to {{apologize}} for troubling you,' she said; 'but it is perhaps natural that I should think, now and then, of what is {{to happen to me}} to-morrow morning. As a medical man, {{you will be able to}} enlighten me. Is death by hanging a painful death?' She had put it so politely that I felt bound to answer her. 'If the neck happens to be broken,' I said, 'hanging is a sudden death; fright and pain (if there is any pain) are both over in an instant. As to the other form of death which is also possible (I mean death by suffocation), I must own as an honest man that I know no more about it than you do.' After considering a little, she made a sensible remark, and followed it by an embarrassing request. 'A great deal,' she said, 'must depend on the executioner. I am not afraid of death, Doctor. Why should I be? My anxiety about my little girl is set at rest; I have nothing left to live for. But I don't like pain. Would you mind telling the executioner to be careful? Or would it be better if I spoke to him myself?' I said I thought it would come with a better grace from herself. She understood me directly; and we dropped the subject. Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> her coolness, after your experience of her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} come here good-humouredly {{determined}} {{to make the best}} of your position," [...] continued the lady. [...] "You will have to begin this morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine. My sister is in her own room, nursing that essentially feminine malady, a slight headache; and her old governess, Mrs. Vesey, is charitably attending on her with restorative tea. My uncle, Mr. Fairlie, never joins us at any of our meals: he is an invalid, and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments. There is nobody else in the house but me. Two young ladies have been staying here, but they went away yesterday, in despair; and no wonder. All through their visit (in consequence of Mr. Fairlie's invalid condition) we produced no such convenience in the house as a flirtable, danceable, small-talkable creature of the male sex; and the consequence was, we did nothing but quarrel, especially at dinner-time. How can you expect four women to dine together alone every day, and not quarrel? We are such fools, we can't entertain each other at table. You see I don't think much of my own sex, Mr. Hartright--which will you have, tea or coffee?--no woman does think much of her own sex, although few of them confess it as freely as I do. Dear me, you look puzzled. Why? Are you wondering what you will have for breakfast? or are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my careless way of talking? In the first case, I advise you, as a friend, to have nothing to do with that cold ham at your elbow, and to wait till the omelette comes in. In the second case, I will give you some tea to compose your spirits, and do all a woman can (which is very little, by-the-bye) to hold my tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{astonished}}! <b>you</b> {{cannot be}} <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> that, Miss Thorne: I am astonished at hearing so singular a confession made." ...|$|R

6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] replied Heyling. [...] "Stay! No! The next day. <b>You</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my {{wishing to}} {{postpone}} it," [...] he added, with a ghastly smile; [...] "but I had forgotten. The next day is an anniversary in his life: {{let it be}} done then." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sa'd {{once asked}} Muhammad: [...] "Tell me, {{if a man}} finds his wife with another man, should he kill him?" [...] Muhammad replied, [...] "No." [...] Sa'd asked if he should wait until he had four witnesses, and Muhammad said, [...] "Yes." [...] "By no means!" [...] exclaimed Sa'd. [...] "I swear, I would hurry to strike him with my sword before then, and not with the flat side!" [...] Muhammad told the assembly: [...] "Listen to what your chief says. Are <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> Sa'd's jealousy for his honour? I am more jealous for my honour than he is, and God is more jealous than I am. Because of his jealousy God has {{prohibited}} abomination, both open and secret. No person is more jealous than God; and no person is fonder of accepting an excuse than God, on account of which he has sent messengers; {{and no one is}} fonder of praise than God, on account of which he has promised Paradise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In MY interests? Of course--since he {{has gone}} so far. <b>You</b> {{expressed}} <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> my wanting to wait and think; but how can I not wait and not think when so much depends on the question--now so definite--of how much further he WILL go?" ...|$|R

60|$|Duen. I do not wonder, sir, that <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my affability-- I own, signor, that I was vastly prepossessed against you, and, being teased by my father, I {{did give}} some {{encouragement}} to Antonio; but then, sir, you were {{described to me}} as quite a different person.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} sorry if wisdom annoyed any one," [...] said the other; [...] "but we will lower our voices, as you say. To resume: taking the thing as I did, can <b>you</b> be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my uneasiness in reading {{passages}} so {{charged with the}} spirit of distrust?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> it," [...] said Lady Staunton composedly; [...] "for you, my dear Jeanie, {{have been}} truth itself from your cradle upwards; {{but you must}} {{remember}} that I am a liar of fifteen years' standing, and therefore must by this time be used to my character." ...|$|R
60|$|BARNABAS. If {{you only}} {{knew all the}} protests I havnt made, <b>you</b> would be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> my patience. It is you who are always {{treating}} me with the grossest want of consideration.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{have the}} same trouble here that you must have heard of in England. As you know now that the {{conditions}} are the same here, <b>you</b> won't be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. You come to me, papa. Something {{very strange}} has happened; {{something}} <b>you</b> will be <b>surprised</b> <b>at.</b> Hurry!" [...] She {{seemed to be}} joking, as he was, while she beckoned him impatiently towards her.|$|R

"I {{see that}} <b>you</b> are <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> what I {{told you about}} myself; it is too long {{a story to tell}} you now, but I will, after dinner today, repeat to you and Hardy some of my experiences; which you will see have been curious, and account for my having the rank of captain, and being {{employed}} in a responsible position, at my age.|$|R

6000|$|When I {{was fully}} {{recovered}} he began again. 'My dear,' says he, 'what made <b>you</b> so <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> what I said? I {{would have you}} consider seriously of it?

60|$|Entering it, nevertheless, <b>you</b> will be <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> {{the effect}} of height, and {{disposed}} to fancy that the circular window cannot surely be the same you saw outside, looking so low, I {{had to go out}} again, myself, {{to make sure that it}} was.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} worthy Bishop, [...] "no; That is a length to which, I trow, Colonial Bishops cannot go. <b>You</b> may express <b>surprise</b> <b>At</b> finding Bishops deal in pride - But if that trick I ever tried, I should appear undignified In Rum-ti-Foozle's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘However,’ pursued Mr. Grewgious, ‘it {{is not of}} {{her that}} I came to speak. It is of my ward. I have a {{communication}} to make that will <b>surprise</b> <b>you.</b> <b>At</b> least, it has surprised me.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Chalk started. He {{had been}} {{conscious}} of his wife’s voice, {{and that was}} all. [...] "You said <b>you</b> were not <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> her leaving," [...] he replied, slowly; [...] "the only wonder to you was that a decent girl should have stayed there so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That made no difference," [...] she inquired with {{a generous}} derision, [...] "because you could always imagine? Of course you could always imagine--which is {{precisely}} what is the matter with <b>you!</b> But I'm <b>surprised</b> <b>at</b> your coming to me with it once more as evidence of anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He will," [...] said Norman, [...] "when once he has outgrown his frights, {{and that}} he may do at Mr. Wilmot's, apart from those fellows.

6000|$|There was no {{arguing with}} such a {{determination}} as this. [...] "Thou knowest my way of thinking, Hal," [...] I said; [...] "and having <b>surprised</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> your work, I must tell my lord what I have seen." ...|$|R

"I do not wonder," [...] {{replied the}} Constable, calmly,--for the ice being now broken, he resumed the natural {{steadiness}} of his manner and character,--"that <b>you</b> express <b>surprise</b> <b>at</b> this daring proposal.
