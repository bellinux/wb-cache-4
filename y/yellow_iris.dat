Most vegetation has colonised naturally, with {{among others}} common reed, purple loosestrife, <b>yellow</b> <b>iris,</b> water-plantain, water figwort, soft rush, gypsywort, water starwort, curled pondweed, common duckweed, water forget-me-not, water mint, brooklime.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details about}} the anatomy of Lobatus gigas were not well known until Colin Little's 1965 general study. In 2005, R. L. Simone gave a {{detailed}} anatomical description. L.gigas has a long extensible snout with two eyestalks (also known as ommatophores) that originate from its base. The tip of each eyestalk contains a large, well-developed lensed eye, with a black pupil and a <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> and a small slightly posterior sensory tentacle. Amputated eyes completely regenerate. Inside {{the mouth of the}} animal is a radula (a tough ribbon covered in rows of microscopic teeth) of the taenioglossan type. Both the snout and the eyestalks show dark spotting in the exposed areas. The mantle is darkly coloured in the anterior region, fading to light gray at the posterior end, while the mantle collar is commonly orange. The siphon is also orange or yellow. When the soft parts of the animal are removed from the shell, several organs are distinguishable externally, including the kidney, the nephiridial gland, the pericardium, the genital glands, stomach, style sac and the digestive gland. In adult males, the penis is also visible.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> {{forms of}} <b>Iris</b> junonia, and <b>yellow</b> forms of <b>Iris</b> imbricata {{are similar in}} form to the <b>yellow</b> forms of <b>Iris</b> purpureobractea, also forms of Iris germanica in the Taurus {{mountains}} near Egirdir {{are very similar to}} the iris.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{itself is}} {{increasingly}} silting up. This {{is reflected in}} its vegetation. In the shore regions there are large areas where water-loving plants such as bulrushes, reeds, club rushes, water lilies, water hemlock and <b>yellow</b> <b>irises</b> are growing. There are about 15 species of fish. A fishing licence may be obtained {{in any of the}} restaurants in the municipality.|$|R
50|$|The holotypic female A. frondiculus {{specimen}} measured 23.8 mm {{in standard}} length. Its body was olive in colour, becoming white around the stomach, and also bore six brown stripes on either side. It possessed <b>yellow</b> <b>irises</b> with reddish-orange lines {{stemming from the}} pupils. While most species of Alloblennius possess short, minute supraorbital cirri, the cirrus is large and prominent on A. frondiculus.|$|R
25|$|A stylized <b>Yellow</b> <b>Iris</b> is {{the symbol}} of Brussels, since historically, the {{important}} Saint Gaugericus Island was carpeted in them. The iris symbol is now the sole feature on {{the flag of the}} Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
25|$|The Brussels-Capital Region {{was formed}} on 18 June 1989, after a {{constitutional}} reform in 1988. It has bilingual status {{and it is}} one of the three federal regions of Belgium, along with Flanders and Wallonia. The <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> is the emblem of the region (referring to the presence of these flowers on the original site of the city) and a stylized version in shown on the official flag of the Brussels region.|$|E
25|$|The fleur-de-lis, {{a stylized}} iris, first occurs in its modern use as {{the emblem of}} the House of Capet. The fleur-de-lis has been {{associated}} with France after Louis VII adopted it as a symbol in the 12th century. The yellow fleur-de-lis reflects the <b>Yellow</b> <b>Iris</b> (I. pseudacorus), common in Western Europe. Contemporary uses {{can be seen in the}} Quebec flag and the logo of the New Orleans Saints professional football team and on the flag of Saint Louis, Missouri.|$|E

500|$|The snoring rail is [...] {{long and}} weighs [...] It is flightless, with short wings, {{a very short}} tail and strong legs and feet. The back and the underparts from the forecrown to the breast are grey, apart from a white chin, and the sides and rear of the neck are deep orange-red. Most {{of the rest of}} the upperparts are brown, and the belly, flanks and undertail have white barring. The male has black legs, a <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> and a brown and greenish down-curved bill. The female is similar, but has a {{brighter}} hindneck colour, less white on the chin, a red iris, a cream and reddish bill and blue-grey legs. Immature and juvenile plumages are undescribed. Visual confusion with sympatric rails is unlikely. The blue-faced rail is similar in size, but is chestnut above and black below, and the buff-banded rail has strongly marked upperparts, breast and head. The slaty-breasted rail is smaller and has barred upperparts.|$|E
2500|$|In water purification, <b>Yellow</b> <b>Iris</b> (I. pseudacorus) {{is often}} used. The roots are usually planted in a {{substrate}} (e.g. lava-stone) in a reedbed-setup. The roots then improve water quality by consuming nutrient pollutants, such as from agricultural runoff. [...] This highly aggressive grower {{is now considered}} a noxious weed and banned in some States of the USA where it is found clogging natural waterways.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that all white cats with blue eyes are deaf. This is not true, as there are many blue-eyed cats with perfect hearing. However, white cats with blue eyes do have slightly higher incidences of genetic deafness than white cats of other eye colors. White cats having one blue and one other-colored eye are called [...] "odd-eyed" [...] and may be deaf {{on the same side}} as the blue eye. This {{is the result of the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> pigmentation rising to the surface of only one eye, as blue eyes are normal at birth before the adult pigmentation has had a chance to express itself in the eye(s).|$|E
5000|$|Duellmanohyla is a genus {{of frogs}} (mountain brook frogs) in the Hylidae family found in Oaxaca, Mexico, {{as well as}} Central America. These are small stream-breeding frogs have bright red, bronze or <b>yellow</b> <b>irises.</b> Their dorsa are uniform pale green, olive, red-brown or lichenose, with green or olive spots on a black background.

50|$|The {{cardinal}} lory is 31 cm long. All plumage is red. The beak is orange {{with black}} at its base. The bare skin at base of beak and around eyes is black, and the irises are orange-red. Its legs are grey. The {{male and female}} are identical in external appearance. The beaks of the juveniles are dull orange with more prominent black areas than the adults, pale grey eye-rings, and <b>yellow</b> <b>irises.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The black-necked stork {{is a large}} bird, [...] tall {{having a}} [...] wingspan. The average weight is around [...] The plumage {{patterns}} are conspicuous with younger birds differing from adults. Adults have a glossy bluish-black iridescent head, neck, secondary flight feathers and tail; a coppery-brown crown; a bright white back and belly; bill black with a slightly concave upper edge; and bright red legs. The sexes are identical but the adult female has a <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> while the adult male has it brown. Juveniles younger than six months have a brownish iris; a distinctly smaller and straighter beak; a fluffy appearance; brown head, neck, upper back, wings and tail; a white belly; and dark legs. Juveniles older than six months have a mottled appearance especially {{on the head and}} neck where the iridescence is partly developed; dark-brown outer primaries; white inner primaries that forms a shoulder patch when the wings are closed; a heavy beak identical in size to adults but still straighter; and dark to pale-pink legs. Like most storks, the black-necked stork flies with the neck outstretched, not retracted like a heron. In flight it appears spindly and a black bar running through the white wings (the somewhat similar looking migratory black stork has an all black wing) with black neck and tail make it distinctive.|$|E

6000|$|As to salmon, Walton {{scarcely}} speaks a true {{word about}} their habits, except by accident. Concerning pike, he quotes {{the theory that}} they are bred by pickerel weed, only as what 'some think.' In describing the use of frogs as bait, he makes the famous, or infamous, remark, 'Use him as though you loved him [...] . that he may live the longer.' A bait-fisher {{may be a good}} man, as Izaak was, but it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle. As coarse fish are usually caught only with bait, I shall not follow Izaak on to this unholy and unfamiliar ground, wherein, none the less, grow flowers of Walton's fancy, and the songs of the old poets are heard.

The yellow and green areas on a Senegal parrot's front form a V-shape resembling a yellow vest worn over green. Young Juveniles have dark grey, almost black, irises, which change to light grey.|$|R
60|$|My {{memories}} of the Park are all under blue sky and sunshine, with just a thunderstorm or so; on wet days and cold days I was kept to closer limits; {{and it seems to}} me now rather an intellectual conviction than a positive memory that save for a few pine-clad patches in the extreme south-east, its soil was all thick clay. That meant for me only beautiful green marshes, a number of vividly interesting meres upon the course of its stream, and a wealth of gigantic oaks. The meres lay at various levels, and the hand of Lady Ladislaw had assisted nature in their enrichment with lilies and water plants. There were places of sedge and scented rush, amidst which were sapphire mists of forget-me-not for long stretches, skirmishing commandoes of <b>yellow</b> <b>iris</b> and wide wastes of floating water-lilies. The gardens passed insensibly into the Park, and beyond the house were broad stretches of grass, sun-lit, barred with the deep-green shadows of great trees, and animated with groups and lines of fallow deer. Near the house was an Italianate garden, with balustradings and statuary, and a great wealth of roses and flowering shrubs.|$|E
