It contains covers of old hardcore punk and heavy metal bands, including Cryptic Slaughter, Massacre, Kreator, Sepultura, Siege and Discharge. Due to personal problems, Jesse Pintado did not play on either Order of the Leech or Leaders Not Followers: Part 2, and left the band in early 2004. Nevertheless, Pintado stated that he left because he grew tired of Napalm Death and wanted to start something new. The two guitars that <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> Mitch over-dubbing.|$|E
25|$|Females show a {{stronger}} McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender {{is the issue}} of male faces and voices as stimuli in comparison to female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, there is no difference in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.|$|E

Then the track carries, but the second time the hook comes, it's me, and me singing it. And I open up with [...] "Schizoid Man." [...] It's a great shocker, but it's a statement too.

500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Fiona Chua of MTV Asia said [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{demonstrated}} that with Swift, [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> what you get", and selected {{it as one}} best cuts on Fearless. Deborah Evans Price of Billboard stated that [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] showcased the same qualities as [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] (2006) – solid gifts of songwriting and time-halting earnest and pure voice. Price declared that the song made obvious that Swift would have much success {{for years to come}} at the time. She believed the track was ultimately relatable and Swift was capable of making the song palpable. Chuck Taylor, also of Billboard, reviewed the pop version release of [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar", and stated it was a [...] "beautiful mainstream intro to an artist whose rise is ably exemplified by her last name." [...] An uncredited review from Rolling Stone attributed the track {{to be one of the}} reasons why Taylor Swift was so commercially successful. Jon Bream of Star Tribune believed the song was in attempt to empower high school- and college-age females by confronting males.|$|E
500|$|... "Give It Away" [...] is {{performed}} in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively [...] "dry" [...] guitar tone that is similar in style {{to the rest of}} the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album Mother's Milk. This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For [...] "Give It Away", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on [...] "big" [...] sounds: [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. A lot of people want the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter." [...] The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.|$|E

500|$|In 1969, the Revue's {{profile in}} their home country was raised after opening for the Rolling Stones on their US tour. In 1970, they {{performed}} on The Ed Sullivan Show. The tour's success resulted in the Revue signing with Liberty Records, where they released two albums, Come Together and Workin' Together, released in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Come Together produced the duo's first top 40 single with their cover of Sly and the Family Stone's [...] "I Want to Take You Higher." [...] Come Together marked {{a turning point in}} their careers in which they switched from their usual R repertoire to incorporate more rock tunes. In early 1971, their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's [...] "Proud Mary" [...] became their biggest hit, reaching number 4 on the Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, winning them a Grammy for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group. Later in 1971, their live album, What <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>Is</b> What You Get, taken from a performance at Carnegie Hall, was their first to be certified gold. In 1972, Ike Turner created the studio, Bolic Sounds, near their home in Inglewood. After Liberty was bought by United Artists Records, the duo was assigned to that label, releasing ten albums in a three-year period. The duo's final major hit single, [...] "Nutbush City Limits", was released in 1973, reaching number 22 on the Hot 100, and peaking at number 4 in the UK. In 1974, Tina released her first solo album, Tina Turns the Country On!, winning a Grammy nomination.|$|E
2500|$|The band flew to New York {{to record}} their debut eponymous album, Baby Animals, at Bearsville Studios, Woodstock and Second City Studio, Long Island with ex-pat Australian Mike Chapman producing. DeMarchi said of the {{production}} process: [...] "It was great. Basically, Mike left us alone to {{make the kind of}} music we know how to make; and whenever he did have a suggestion, it was always something that made the sound better. So what <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> pure recording, the band as it really is." ...|$|E

In an interview on national television, Harper would not confirm he was hidden in a closet during the shootings, but said his first concern was to extricate himself from the location. [...] "All <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> a whole lot of shooting coming towards you, and you don't know if that's a firefight or whether it's just a bunch of guys with automatic weapons wiping everybody out in their path." [...] After the incident, Harper's first call was to his mother to reassure her.|$|E

Ike Turner later bought his own studio, naming it Bolic Sound, in 1972, where they would record {{the rest of their}} material. In 1973, the duo released the hit [...] "Nutbush City Limits", which reached #25 in the U.S. and #4 in the UK. The duo's work on their 1974 album, The Gospel According to Ike & Tina, led to the duo receiving several Grammy nominations. One of the Turners' final R hits together was a funk oriented single titled [...] "Sexy Ida (Pt. 1)".|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{the area}} {{surrounding}} the San Fernando Building had {{become part of}} skid row. In 1998, Gilmore Associates announced plans to convert the San Fernando Building and two other early 20th Century buildings located nearby (the Hellman and Continental Buildings) into 230 lofts. Gilmore's plan to convert a block of skid row into upscale lofts was initially met with skepticism; one expert described the location as desolate, and opined {{that the lack of}} such amenities as a grocery store nearby could make the project [...] "a tough sell." [...] However, the Los Angeles Times saw the project as having the potential to change the downtown area: [...] "That distant sound of hammers <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> coming from the corner of Spring and 4th, where developer Tom Gilmore has initiated an amazing project...Gilmore has assembled an entire block of buildings extending along 4th Street, from Spring to Main. It includes the 12-story Continental Building, generally regarded as the city's first skyscraper; the Farmers and Merchants Bank complex, and the San Fernando Building, built by potentate developer James B. Lankershim." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{and roll}} music {{first came to}} Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley & His Comets {{appeared}} in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their historic {{first trip to the}} United States. Promoter Sid Bernstein convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue [...] "would further international understanding" [...] between the United States and Great Britain. [...] "Led Zeppelin became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the Rolling Stones tore the place up some five years ago." [...] Two concerts were performed October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Jethro Tull released the tapes recorded on its presentation in a 1970 Benefit concert, in the 2010 re-release of the Stand Up album. Ike & Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album What <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>is</b> What You Get. The Beach Boys played concerts in 1971 and 1972, and two songs from the show appeared on their Endless Harmony Soundtrack. Chicago recorded its 4-LP box set Chicago at Carnegie Hall in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|In 1993, Trevor Nunn's Glyndebourne Festival stage {{production}} of Porgy and Bess, {{not to be}} confused with his later production, was greatly expanded scenically and videotaped in a television studio without an audience. This first Nunn production was also called The Gershwins' 'Porgy and Bess' [...] when shown on television. It was telecast by the BBC in England and by PBS in the United States. It featured a cast of operatic American singers, with the exception of Willard White, who is Jamaican but sounded American, as Porgy. Cynthia Haymon sang the role of Bess. Nunn's [...] "opening up" [...] of the stage production was considered highly imaginative; his cast received much critical praise, and the three-hour production retained nearly all of Gershwin's music, heard in the original 1935 orchestrations. This included the opera's sung recitatives, which have occasionally been turned into spoken dialogue in other productions. No extra dialogue was written for this production, as had been done in the 1959 film. All performers lip-synched rather than singing live on set, leading The New York Times to write: [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> basically Mr. Nunn's acclaimed Glyndebourne Festival production, the original cast intact. What you see was filmed later in a London studio. The performers, some new to the production, are lip-synching. It's as if an elaborate visual aid had been concocted for the EMI recording." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was more}} parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not {{recorded}} in the transcript of the proceedings. [...] Hutchinson next asked the court for leave to [...] "give you the ground of what I know to be true." [...] She then addressed the court with her own judgment, becoming both didactic and prophetic and claiming her source of knowledge to be direct, personal revelation from God. [...] She ended her statement by prophesying, [...] "if you go on in this course [...] you begin, you will bring a curse upon you and your posterity, and {{the mouth of the}} Lord hath spoken it." [...] "The judges were aghast," [...] historian Emery Battis writes. [...] "She had defied the Court and threatened the commonwealth with God's curse." [...] Cotton attempted to defend her but was challenged by the magistrates, until Winthrop ended the questioning. A vote was taken on a sentence of banishment, only the only dissenters were the two remaining deputies from Boston, Colburn and Coddington. [...] Winthrop then read the order: [...] "Mrs. Hutchinson, the sentence of the court <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>is</b> that you are banished from out of our jurisdiction as being a woman not fit for our society, and are to be imprisoned till the court shall send you away." ...|$|E
