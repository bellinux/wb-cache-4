[...] I shall {{have all kinds}} of trouble over it, but I do feel what you say is true: [...] that is, that it is the best coin that has been struck for two {{thousand}} years, and that no matter what is its temporary fate, it will {{serve as a model for}} future coin makers, and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Phoenix New Times, Nicki Escudero {{compared}} {{the book to}} an entry on Wikipedia. She wrote, [...] "It's {{sort of like a}} really expanded Wikipedia entry, if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> type of thing, though Herbert's voice shows that she's definitely a fan, and the book isn't completely unbiasedit's a very revering [...] tale of Gaga's 24-year-old life." [...] Sharon Galligar Chance reviewed the book for the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and wrote, [...] "Using references from many, many different sources, Herbert has put together a fairly solid biography of the new pop icon". She concluded her review saying, [...] "Although sometimes redundant, Herbert...does give the reader a full-bodied accounting of the persona behind Lady Gaga".|$|E
500|$|In {{the eleven}} years {{up to and}} {{including}} Traviata, Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to Aida), he wrote only six new works for the stage. [...] Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a [...] "total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm not doing anything. I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by I vespri siciliani. Cursed operas!" [...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is exaggerated. [...] He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles were {{performing}} at Liverpool's Cavern Club in November 1961 {{when they were}} introduced to Brian Epstein after a midday concert. Epstein was a homosexual, and according to biographer Philip Norman, one of Brian's reasons for wanting to manage the group {{was that he was}} physically attracted to Lennon. Almost as soon as Julian was born, Lennon went on holiday to Spain with Epstein, leading to speculation about their relationship. When he was later questioned about it, Lennon said, [...] "Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But it was a pretty intense relationship. It was my first experience with a homosexual that I was conscious was homosexual. We used to sit in a café in Torremolinos looking at all the boys and I'd say, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> one? Do you like this one?' I was rather enjoying the experience, thinking like a writer all the time: I am experiencing this." [...] Soon after their return from Spain—at McCartney's twenty-first birthday party in June 1963—Lennon physically attacked Cavern Club Master of ceremonies Bob Wooler for saying [...] "How was your honeymoon, John?" [...] The MC, known for his wordplay and affectionate but cutting remarks, was making a joke, but ten months had passed since Lennon's marriage, and the deferred honeymoon was still two months in the future. To Lennon, who was drunk at the time, the matter was simple: [...] "He called me a queer so I battered his bloody ribs in".|$|E
500|$|After one-hitting Boston on May 2, 1904, Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to {{face him}} {{so that he could}} repeat his {{performance}} against Boston's ace. Three days later, Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics. It was the first perfect game in American League history. Waddell was the 27th and last batter, and when he flied out, Young shouted, [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> you hayseed?" [...] Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak. Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 25.1 innings, or 76 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached a then-record 45 shutout innings. Before Young, only two pitchers had thrown perfect games. This occurred in 1880, when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other, although under somewhat different rules: the front edge of the pitcher's box was only [...] from home base (the modern release point is about [...] farther away); walks required eight balls; and pitchers were obliged to throw side-armed. Young's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893. One year later, on July 4, 1905, Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans, 42, in a 20-inning matchup. Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning. Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted: [...] "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in." [...] In 1907, Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13-inning tie.|$|E
2500|$|The Texians {{demanded to}} know where the other captives were. The Penateka spokesman, Chief Muguara, responded that the other prisoners were held by various other bands of Comanche. He assured the Texians that he felt the other captives would be able to be ransomed, but that it would be in {{exchange}} for a great deal of supplies, including ammunition and blankets. He then finished his speech with the comment [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> answer?" [...] The Texian militia entered the courtroom and positioned themselves at intervals along the walls. When the Comanches would not, or could not, promise to return all captives immediately, the Texas officials said that the chiefs would be held hostage until the white captives were released.|$|E

2500|$|Agnes knelt and, crying, begged President Juárez {{to forgive}} the Emperor. The President's answer has become famous in Mexican history textbooks: [...] "It causes me great pain, Madame, to see <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on your knees; {{but even if}} every king and queen were in your place, I couldn't spare his life. It isn't me who takes it from him, it is {{the people and the}} law who claim his life". Juárez had already {{received}} telegraphs from most of the heads of the European states asking him to spare Maximilan. Upon Juárez's denial the brave woman answered, [...] "Oh, if blood must be spilled, then take my life, the life of a useless woman; and spare that of a man who can still do much good in other country." [...] Juarez did offer to spare the life of her husband, however, Maximilan would undergo a courts martial. [...] The scene was painted by the Mexican painter Manuel Ocaranza. vol.23 no.78 México mar./may. 2001.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, an American nurse {{committed}} suicide and the Paranoid album {{was found on}} her turntable. The album's possible influence in her decision to commit suicide was mentioned in the inquest, but ultimately {{it was decided that}} Black Sabbath were not to blame for her death. [...] "A lot of the words in the songs a lot of the moods of the songs are aggressive," [...] Iommi acknowledged. [...] "Especially in the early days Satanic, if <b>you</b> <b>like...</b> <b>That</b> was the way it felt, so that was the way we played. But it got out of hand. With Paranoid in England, for instance. There was a girl found dead a nurse she was: dead in her room with our album on the turntable going round. And it was taken to court saying that {{it was because of the}} album that she was depressed and killed herself, which was totally ridiculous, I think." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{conservative}} {{contributor to}} Ain't it Cool News said the film featured [...] "ingenious comedy that we remember from Airplane!" [...] and was [...] "funny and inventive." [...] Kathleen Parker of Washington Post Writers Group described {{the film as}} [...] " [...] The Best Movie You Ever Saw, but it’s something. It’s radical in its assault on the left wing; it’s brave given the risk of peer ridicule {{and the potential for}} career suicide. And it’s funny — if <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing. Generally, I don’t." [...] Michael Brendan Doherty of The American Conservative considered the movie to be funny [...] "in parts", but concluded that [...] "Far from lampooning the Left, “Carol” insults conservatives by presuming that they are so simple as to be won over by fat jokes and flatulence. But the audience, imagining itself to be persecuted by Hollywood, is so grateful to be flattered by Zucker and company that they chuckle obediently at every cheap laff." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the movie one star out of five, called it [...] "jaw-droppingly awful," [...] and [...] "about as not-funny as a comedy can get." [...] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote, [...] "Even if it weren't three years too late to parody Moore (ineptly played by Kevin Farley), Moore's ridiculous tribute to Cuban health care in Sicko is far funnier than anything in this desperately laughless farce from David Zucker." ...|$|E
