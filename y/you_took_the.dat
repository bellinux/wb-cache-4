5|$|Look, I'm sorry you're dead OK? I do care. But to be {{perfectly}} honest with you, I don't care a lot. You had a choice, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} part, [...] "Love Without Tragedy", Rihanna as the narrator, sings about {{a moment in}} the life which she regrets in the lines [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive/ Injured us fatally/ <b>You</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> best years of my life/ I took the best years of your life". [...] "Love Without Tragedy", blends 80s pop music and guitar with a [...] "modern and fresh" [...] reggae {{inspired}} melody. Rihanna is channeling the emotions caused by her assault from Chris Brown in which can be seen through the lines [...] "Felt love struck me with a knife/ I pray that love don't strike twice", and [...] "Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?" ...|$|E

500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E
500|$|Most {{reviews of}} [...] "Secret Truths" [...] were positive, {{particularly}} praising {{its treatment of}} social issues. Maureen Ryan wrote for the Chicago Tribune that [...] "The lack of either cutesyness or condescension shown by this program is promising." [...] She also commended that the pilot [...] "doesn't shy away" [...] from issues pertaining to race, religion and sexuality. Kate Authur of The New York Times compared the pilot positively to other series, writing, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> plot of Beverly Hills, 90210 (a good-looking Midwestern family moves to Los Angeles), combined it with the identity issues of Degrassi (race, sexuality and class clash {{in a high school}} setting) and added a splash of One Tree Hills basketball backdrop, you would get South of Nowhere... That's meant to be a compliment." [...] Alessandra Stanley, another critic for The New York Times, mentioned [...] "Secret Truths" [...] in a feature about racial issues on television. She felt that the pilot distinguished itself from other teen shows by including a subplot about race; however, she still found it to be [...] "constrained and politically correct". Varietys Brian Lowry gave the episode a lukewarm review, comparing it to other teen dramas. He wrote that [...] "the web of relationships doesn't feel particularly fresh, mirroring the recent spate of nighttime teen serials", but he felt the pilot was an [...] "edgier treatment", noting that it [...] "isn't screwing around" [...] by addressing topics including abortion, drugs, homosexuality and racism. Karman Kregloe of AfterEllen.com, a website focused on the portrayal of lesbians in the media, thought that the episode was [...] "well-written, and the storyline for each of the lead characters is compelling". She praised the show greatly for its authentic portrayal of teenagers' questioning of their sexuality and the [...] "big step" [...] taken towards promoting tolerance.|$|E
500|$|In January 2000, {{three months}} after the system's North American launch, Electronic Gaming Monthly offered praise for the game library, stating, [...] "...with triple-A stuff like Soul Calibur, NBA 2K, and soon Crazy Taxi to kick around, we figure you're happy <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> 128-bit plunge." [...] In a retrospective, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson {{referred}} to Dreamcast's [...] "killer library" [...] and emphasized Sega's creative influence and visual innovation as being at its peak during the lifetime of the system. The staff of Edge agreed with this assessment on Dreamcast's original titles, as well as Sega's arcade conversions, stating that the system [...] "delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect." [...] GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being [...] "much celebrated". Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing full well that a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that [...] "the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde... {{it is hard to imagine}} a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party. Fahs noted [...] "The Dreamcast's life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties." [...] According to author Steven L. Kent, [...] "From Sonic Adventure and Shenmue to Space Channel 5 and Seaman, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the entire}} {{principal}} cast of The Original Series {{was featured in}} the film's first script, but only three members appeared in the film: William Shatner as Captain James T. Kirk, James Doohan as Montgomery Scott, and Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley declined to appear as Spock and Leonard McCoy. Nimoy (who was offered the job of directing the film) felt that there were story problems with the script and that Spock's role was extraneous—"I said to everybody concerned [...] that if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> dozen or so lines of Spock dialog and simply changed {{the name of the}} character, nobody would notice the difference." [...] The Next Generation producer Rick Berman said that [...] "Both Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley felt they made a proper goodbye in the last movie [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E
