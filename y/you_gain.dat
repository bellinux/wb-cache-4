500|$|Each playable {{character}} in the game {{has the ability to}} equip items. Weapons in the game, unlike its predecessors, are gained in levels. Some items are only found in certain stages, but is only obtainable if completing a goal. Sometimes the goal may be very simple, but some may be not that easy {{to figure out how to}} obtain the certain item. By defeating generals and lieutenants, the player's character is awarded experience scaled by the difficulty of each officer, and the amount of them defeated. This experience is allocated at the end of the level and allows the player to increase their attributes or obtain new forms. Each playable officer has 9 levels to achieve with their standard weapon, while a 10th level is accessible through special in-game requirements, and on the [...] "Hard" [...] difficulty, which is found to be frustrating like most games, the harder the difficulty the more eager <b>you</b> <b>gain.</b> Items can have a number of effects on the player such as increasing attack power, defense, and movement speed. You can also retrieve your health level to avoid getting killed and having [...] "Game Over" [...] by obtaining [...] "Chinese Meatbuns" [...] that at first, look like onions like in any other game in the so far successful Dynasty Warriors franchise. You can also obtain item boost that increase a certain skill by 2 for limited time only. You can also get packs of wine and packs of Chinese Meatbuns in certain stages in certain locations during gameplay. As said above, special items can also be unlocked by completing objectives during gameplay. Special items can grant the player a statistics boost, a unique ability or skill, or even a ride-able mount such as an Elephant or Horse.|$|E

Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. <b>You</b> <b>gain</b> some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>gain,</b> <b>you</b> <b>gain</b> all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E

[...] According to Caecilius of Calacte (Porphyry in Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica) Menander was accused of plagiarism, as his The Superstitious Man was taken from The Augur of Antiphanes, but reworkings and variations on a theme of this sort were commonplace and so the charge is a complicated one.|$|E

But it is the false blaze of enchantment, not the steady radiance of truth and nature; and if <b>you</b> <b>gain</b> courage to look at it a second or third time, the magic has lost its power, and you only wonder what it was that dazzled you." [...] The review continued, [...] "we think there is quite enough to discover to us how great a poet Mr. Southey might be, were the single gift of judgment {{to be added to the}} qualities which he undoubtedly possesses. Till then, we fear that we shall never be able to subscribe to the belief in a Trinity of living poets, of whom Mr. S. is represented as entitled to the foremost honours." ...|$|E

[...] "You don't want {{the game to}} hinge on that play, but you never know," [...] Blackwood said. [...] "I could have taken the ball up the sideline. That's a 14-point swing." [...] However, other Dolphins were not convinced. [...] "We were dominated {{to the point where}} one play didn't make much of a difference," [...] said Dolphins coach Don Shula. [...] "Our major objective was to contain Montana, and we did a terrible, terrible job of it," [...] added defensive coach Chuck Studley. Even Reggie Roby, who averaged only 39.3 yards per punt and didn't place any of his 6 punts inside the 20, took some responsibility for the loss. [...] "I was trying to kill the ball, and I kicked it bad," [...] he said. [...] "I didn't hit one well. I was scared – scared to make a mistake. It was the worst game of my life, counting high school, college, counting everything." [...] Meanwhile, in the 49ers' locker room, Joe Montana had his own explanation for the win. [...] "As far as my own game, well, I'd have to admit it was pretty close to the best I've ever played. I didn't throw anything I didn't have confidence in. We got in sort of a groove. Once you get going like that <b>you</b> <b>gain</b> confidence, and it carries over to the defense, and then back to the offense. It's a snowball kind of thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On April 5, 1995, at UFC 5, Shamrock got his rematch with Gracie in a match called [...] "The Superfight," [...] {{which would}} {{determine}} the UFC Champion. At the time, Gracie {{had a reputation}} as being seemingly unbeatable. Gracie had obvious concerns about his relative lack of size in comparison to Shamrock, so he came into the octagon at 190 pounds – roughly fifteen pounds above what had been his normal fighting weight; Shamrock also cut his weight down to 205 pounds for the bout. Hours before the event, the UFC suddenly instituted a 30-minute time limit, mainly due to pay per view time constraints. Both Gracie and Shamrock were upset at the sudden rule change. For Shamrock, it ruined his game plan, who had been training for months to utilize his natural advantages in size and strength to wear Gracie down over the course of two hours. Shamrock and Gracie fought for the entire allotted time of 30 minutes along with 5 minutes of overtime before the match was declared a draw due to the fight not having judges. Had there been ringside judges, UFC matchmaker Art Davie believes that Shamrock would have been declared the winner. Gracie left with a melon sized welt closing his eye, a result of a standing punch due to a sudden change of the rules in which both of the fighters were restarted on their feet. Shamrock was not satisfied with his performance against Gracie, saying [...] "it's certainly not a win. <b>You</b> <b>gain</b> nothing (with a draw)". Shamrock expressed desire to fight Gracie again for a third time in 1996, saying that if it went to a draw again, he would have Gracie declared the winner and Shamrock would forfeit his UFC Superfight Championship belt to Gracie. Gracie left the UFC after his fight with Shamrock and did not return until 11 years later.|$|E
