500|$|Wanderone was {{notorious for}} his {{spontaneous}} wit. When {{he was named}} the [...] "uncrowned king" [...] of pool because he never got actively involved in tournament circles (due to being too busy hustling), his reply: [...] "You judge a king {{by the size of}} his wallet and his palace. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the crown in the toilet." ...|$|E
500|$|PopMatters {{journalist}} J.C. Maçek III wrote [...] "For {{fans who}} bought the toys, watched the cartoon and read the comics during the ‘80s and now have like-aged {{children of their own}} (all of which I did and do), might I suggest proceeding to watch this fun film with your kids, but compromise so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the commentary track on. The film will remain a treat for the eyes, but you can more easily gloss over those parts that will make you apologize to your brain." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of shortening the adaptation, approximately one-third of the story was eventually edited out; entire subplots and characters were removed. Before becoming a screenwriter Hetreed worked as an editor, and credits this experience for knowing [...] "... about structure and {{what you need to}} say and what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> out. I am a big enthusiast for leaving things out." [...] She focused the story on the relationship between Griet and Vermeer, deciding what other storylines were [...] "... distracting and had to be jettisoned. Before editing, there was great stuff there, but Peter was fantastically ruthless." [...] Changes from the novel did not bother Chevalier, who felt that as a result the film gained [...] "... a focused, driven plot and a sumptuous visual feast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope {{we shall}} see you at Barton," [...] added her ladyship, [...] "as soon as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> {{conveniently}} <b>leave</b> town; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you be preaching at me, Peter Craig," [...] {{he cried}} out. [...] "I won't stand it. I don't quarrel {{with my sister}} any oftener than she quarrels with me. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> just <b>leave</b> me alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam {{knows what}} he's about," [...] said the mill-owner cheerfully, [...] "and as he's {{regularly}} buckled {{down to the}} work here, and will go his bottom dollar on it, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>leave</b> things to him." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked by}} Dillon {{whether or not}} the {{conflict}} was a religious war, he replied: [...] "I certainly believe religion is part of the equation. I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> religion out of it".|$|E
2500|$|... {{dates back}} at least to 1991 and {{has been the focus of}} a number of {{newspaper}} reports and radio interviews. Referring to the title of a public lecture entitled [...] "Is human Evolution Over?" [...] he stated [...] "For those of you who have a train to catch, the answer is [...] "yes", so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> now".|$|E
2500|$|Simon Critchley {{says that}} {{the meaning of the}} couplet is that [...] "if you don't {{reproduce}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> no acceptable audit". He evens compares Sonnet 4 to The Merchant of Venice in which Shakespeare is trying to emphasize themes concerning [...] "increase, contract, abundance, waste, 'niggarding,' or miserliness". This {{can be seen in the}} aforementioned complexities described by Pequigney. It seems as if the Speaker is insinuating that the beauty will die with the young man. This idea is reinforced by Joyce Stuphen who says that [...] "In sonnet 4, it is nature that 'calls thee to be gone' and demands the 'acceptable audit'". Therefore, the couplet seems to sum up the complexity of the sonnet with a proclaimed consequence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have talked}} like this before, Henry," [...] she said, [...] "and {{it is all}} too absurd. You must {{tell me the truth}} now. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> have no {{business}} here. You are travelling for pleasure. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> surely <b>leave</b> a place or not at your own will?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Find the swiftest canoe in the fleet; put {{on board}} rations for twenty-four hours, getting them from this schooner, and {{run down the}} river without delay. If your own crew is not huge enough to insure quick work, call on for what men <b>you</b> need. <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> in thirty minutes?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>can</b> {{also put}} <b>leaves</b> cut {{in this way}} in {{a glass of water}} to root (change water weekly).|$|R

6000|$|... "In that case, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the gig {{in charge}} of the station-master. I'll tell the servant that he will not be wanted to drive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you know}} our stenographers are pretty well crowded. But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> the outline with me. I'll look it over," [...] said Mr. Guilfogle.|$|E
6000|$|To {{his final}} amazement Pendleton's brow cleared! [...] "An enemy? Gad! {{you may be}} right. I'll look into it; and, {{if that is the}} case, which I {{scarcely}} dare hope for, Mr. Hathaway, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> safely <b>leave</b> him to ME." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You understand, Johan, if {{you meet}} with no interruption, you will land your {{passengers}} {{at the mouth}} of the Seudre; but if you should come across any of the craft that have been hovering about the coast, and find that they are too fast for you, put them ashore wherever they may direct. If you are too hotly chased to escape, after landing them, you had best also disembark; and make your way back by land, as best <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>leaving</b> them to do what they will with the boat. As like as not they would cut your throats, did they take you; and if not, would want to know whom you had landed, and other matters.|$|R
