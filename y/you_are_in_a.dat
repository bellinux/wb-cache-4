500|$|Greg Beeman, who {{directed}} the episode, spoke about Remi Aubuchon's hiring. He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep the good stuff we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve just heard what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{previous}} episode [...] "Occupation" [...] {{focused on the}} resistance, writer Ronald D. Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted to personalize somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foxhole, who do you want next to you? You want Colonel Tigh 'cause he is gonna get your ass out of there." [...] The scene where Baltar speaks to an imprisoned Roslin about the suicide bombings was one of Moore's favourite scenes, as he wanted the audience to be unsure who to [...] "root for," [...] since Baltar is the biggest Cylon collaborator among the humans, but Roslin seemingly supports the bombings.|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship, it might not be going so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, you lift me up." ...|$|E

[...] Stephen Fry, writer for the remake, was asked to provide several alternative names for the dog, and came up with several suggestions. [...] Executive producer David Frost rejected them all, saying [...] "Guy sometimes used to call his dog Nigsy, so I think that's what we will call it. Stephen has been coming up with other names, but this is the one I want." [...] Jackson's assistant contradicted this a week later, however, saying [...] "To stay true to the story, you can't just change [...] We have not made any decisions yet. The script is still being written; and that decision will be made closer to the time." ...|$|E

Stewart Parker, the Command and Control Special Forces {{commander}} at Bagram Air Base {{during the}} battle, said of Rhyner: [...] "Rhyner {{is out of}} training {{less than a year}} and is {{in one of the most}} difficult situations ... it is an absolute testament to his character and the training these guys take. It tells me we are doing something right." [...] During a Fox News interview with Glen Beck, Beck asked Rhyner [...] "... there are only — what is it? — 192 people who have ever received the Air Force Cross ... How do you put that together in your head? I mean, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very elite group." [...] Rhyner simply replied with [...] "Any other combat controller put in the same situation would have performed in the same, exact way ... Credit that to the training we receive and the process that we go through to become a combat controller." [...] Future Air Force Cross recipient, and fellow Combat Controller, Robert Gutierrez was also present at the Battle of Shok Valley with Rhyner, albeit with a different Special Forces team, and regarding Rhyner's actions he said reportedly, [...] "If it wasn't for Zach, I wouldn't be here." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{relationship}} and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you {{and there is something}} different about the world. You can’t put your finger on it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to have all those layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicksilver was {{originally}} {{presented as a}} mutant capable of moving and thinking at superhuman speeds. Originally capable of running {{at the speed of}} sound, exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for the character to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 10 and resist the effects of friction, reduced oxygen, and kinetic impact while moving at super-speeds. Also, he has a fast metabolism and can heal more rapidly than the average human. The character's speed allows him to perform such feats as creating cyclone-strength winds and running up walls or across bodies of water. Pietro's mind can perceive information with a photographic memory short term, becoming faster than the speed of thought, because he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Also, he can cause vibrations in his body to transfer to solid material, and has superior agility and reflexes compared to other mutants. It has been revealed {{that one of the reasons}} for his abrasive and impatient personality is that it seems to him that the rest of the world is moving in slow motion and that he is constantly waiting for it to catch up. As he once explained, [...] "Have you ever had a day where you are at the ATM and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hurry because you're running late but the person in front of you doesn't know how to use the ATM and they're taking forever?

2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
