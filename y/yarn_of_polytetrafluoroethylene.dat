We present a case of a young woman who sustained a persistent perigraft seroma following a polytetrafluoroethylene graft in the proximal thigh, which was implanted as an alternative to an arteriovenous fistula. The cause was not ascertained and this was eventually treated by complete removal of the graft. This case highlights an unusual complication <b>of</b> <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> grafts that are commonly used in vascular access surgery, which can be challenging to treat...|$|R

40|$|We treated 35 {{children}} with different grades of vesicoureteral reflux with endoscopic injection <b>of</b> <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (Teflon) behind the intravesical ureter. A total of 51 refluxing ureters was treated. In all cases absence of reflux was noted on a cystogram performed {{immediately after the}} procedure. At 3 to 12 -month followup reflux was absent in 32 ureters and it recurred in 4, including 3 ureters with low grade reflux. A second injection <b>of</b> <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> in 3 ureters resulted in its absence, while in 1 case reimplantation was performed. The procedure is simple and reliable. An operation is avoided, hospital stay is reduced an no complications have occurred. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Bangladesh, jute mills are {{producing}} conventional yarns heavier than 275 tex. These {{are used as}} hessian, sacking, carpet backing cloth etc. For diversified uses of jute it is most essential to produce medium count <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 275 tex. In this regard, slip draft spinning machine has been studied. This machine is capable to produce <b>yarn</b> <b>of</b> 241 to 280 tex at flyer speed of 2900 rpm to 4850 rpm. But there is a relation between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the machine. In addition spinning efficiency of the machine also depends on the yarn breakages. Through a series of experiment, a relation has been established between flyer speed and <b>yarn</b> breakages <b>of</b> the experimental machine for production <b>of</b> jute <b>yarn...</b>|$|R
