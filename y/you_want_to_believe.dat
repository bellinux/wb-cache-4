A lot of my videos from 'Turn Up the Music' and other videos I'm doing now are in a dream state of believing what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> So that's what Fortune kinda encompasses. So it's basically dreaming and accomplishing your dreams. This video is me dreaming and being taken into this whole kind of maze.

500|$|On February 16, 2012, it was {{speculated that}} former boyfriend Chris Brown was the {{featured}} artist {{on the full}} length version. Reports surfaced after the pair were photographed leaving Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles at separate times and Brown being invited to Rihanna's birthday party. Rumors were also fueled when Rihanna and Brown spent time together at the 2012 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2012. The reports gained worldwide media controversy, because Brown and Rihanna {{were involved in a}} physical altercation on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. The full length version, eventually revealed to feature Brown, was released on Rihanna's birthday, February 20, 2012. In an interview with Billboard, The-Dream stated that he believed Rihanna and Brown's past together should not be judged and that [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] is simply a song, saying, [...] "For me, it's just music - two talented people doing a record together, doing two records together, and that's what it was. It wasn't about an incident that happened. The true thing really is to forgive, and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in people."

5000|$|I think Roger {{was fine}} as Bond, but the films {{had become too}} much techno-pop and had lost track of their sense of story. I mean, every film {{seemed to have a}} villain who had to rule or destroy the world. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the fantasy on screen, then you have to believe in the {{characters}} and use them as a stepping-stone to lead you into this fantasy world.

But none of the oldest boys had ever seen it like that, {{and you had to}} take Jim Leonard's word for it if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it. The little fellows nearly all did; but everybody said afterwards {{it was a good thing}} for Jim Leonard that it was not that kind of roof when he had his hair-breadth escape on it. He said himself that he would not have cared if it had been; but that was when it was all over, and his mother had whipped him, and everything, and he was telling the boys about it.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{writing the}} series, Nick Arnold {{was at the}} University of North London working on an {{educational}} project. He explained to The Birmingham Post: [...] "It was actually a lucky break or a well-placed letter - whichever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> - Because I wrote this really cheeky letter to the publishers Scholastic saying {{that if they were}} looking for someone to write a horrible science book I was the one. And would you believe they actually let me write a science book and put lots of horrible bits in it - and then it was hugely successful”.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said the}} film [...] "is {{cut from the}} same cloth as The Silence of the Lambs, but the piece of {{material}} it uses has the uneven shape and dangling threads of a discarded remnant.... It begins promisingly, then loses its direction as the demand for accelerated action overtakes narrative logic." [...] Holden writes of Morgan Freeman that he [...] "projects a kindness, patience and canny intelligence that cut against the movie's fast pace and pumped-up shock effects. His performance is so measured it makes <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the movie much more than its gimmicky jerry-rigged sic plot ever permits." ...|$|E

[...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian recommended the album to those looking for a [...] "more electro-based companion" [...] of Vision by Grimes, while a review in the sister paper The Observer noted the influences of Shrines to be [...] "of the highest quality (Björk, Fever Ray, Burial), which, at best, bears comparison with them all." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{felt that}} imaginative constructions should be upbuilding. Kierkegaard wrote about [...] "the nothing of despair", God as the unknown is nothing, and {{death is a}} nothing. Goethe's Der Erlkönig and The Bride of Corinth (1797) are also nothing. The single {{individual}} has a reality which fiction can never represent. People should learn the difference between imaginary constructions and reality. Many things are hard to understand but Kierkegaard says, [...] "Where understanding despairs, faith is already present {{in order to make}} the despair properly decisive." [...] God grant, that all playwrights compose nothing but tearjerking plays, full of all possible anxiety and horror that would not allow your flabbiness to rest on the cushioned theater seats and let you be perfumed with supranatural power but would horrify you until in the world of actuality you learn to believe in that which <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in only in poetry.

The video premiered online on June 11, 2012.

6000|$|There was {{something}} so bare, so spiritually poverty-stricken, in these confessions and questions, that Halleck found {{nothing to say}} to them.
