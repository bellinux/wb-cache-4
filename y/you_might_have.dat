Tom Doyle of This Is Fake DIY wrote that {{the album is}} a [...] "punch in the gut to whatever expectations <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> about letlive." [...] Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic said while the songs lack the same immediacy in comparison to those on Fake History, they have more longevity. Although Mike Diver of Clash Music liked the album overall, he said that [...] "Pheromone Cvlt" [...] was [...] "placid" [...] and [...] "Virgin Dirt" [...] was [...] "losing sting".|$|E
500|$|Alexander Gambotto-Burke {{felt the}} {{character}} was {{a presentation of}} Avellone's criticisms of the Star Wars mythos and the morality presented in most post-Garriott video games, and called her [...] "a tutorial, an incentive to explore moral avenues <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> otherwise ignored". Gambotto-Burke considered her not purely evil, and felt even {{at the end of}} the game [...] "you can't help but see her as a flawed visionary". GameSpot considered it the point to be for the player to move on from her [...] "self-defeating" [...] nihilism and realize [...] "the act of choice is what gives form and pattern to the universe".|$|E
500|$|... "Victory of the Daleks" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{received a}} positive review from Daniel Martin of The Guardian. Martin called it [...] "the best [...] Gatiss {{has written for}} the show", and praised the writer's investigation of [...] "the idea of [...] as 'man-made' war machines" [...] for not being [...] "as heavy-handed as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected". He also was positive towards the acting of McNeice and Paterson, the developing storyline between the Doctor and Amy, and positively compared the Daleks' menace to the first series. Patrick Mulkern of the Radio Times hailed the episode as [...] "a victory for all", and praised Gatiss for the character of Professor Bracewell, commenting favourably on how the writer [...] "turns him into an emotive robot like Star Treks Data, and gives Bill Paterson material worthy of his status." ...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} game's release, IGN posted {{a review of}} the game, citing {{numerous}} bugs and crashes in the PlayStation 3 release. The game also contained a bug, causing the game to freeze and the screen to blur when friends signed out of and into the PlayStation Network. The IGN review was edited shortly thereafter, removing all references to the PS3 version's bugs, causing controversy in the PlayStation communities. Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game. Even IGN retroactively cited bugs with the original release as well as the Game of the Year edition, calling it [...] "a fantastic game", but warned players to [...] "be aware that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to deal with some crashes and bugs".|$|E

I've heard about this, but the Miley Cyrus persona <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> in America I don't have." [...] Her involvement with [...] "Decisions" [...] was originally not publicly acknowledged in an attempt to [...] "make a tune together that we're super happy about and just see people's real opinion about this." [...] However, Cyrus unexpectedly tweeted [...] "Yo check out Decisions me & @borgore new track" [...] in August 2012, which Borgore commented was [...] "super cool [...] she did it the way she did it". He added that he was impressed with her vocal abilities, elaborating that [...] "I thought she was made up more to be a star, but she was pretty phenomenal behind the booth." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Tanuja Chandra, while filming Sangharsh in 1998, {{ascribed}} Zinta's screen {{appeal to}} {{her lack of}} acting pretense, commenting, [...] "She doesn't act, she's so real that you just can't look away from her". Reviewing Chori Chori Chupke Chupke for Hindustan Times, Vinayak Chakravorty noted that [...] "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who [...] "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," [...] while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of Mission Kashmir) credits her {{with the ability to}} [...] "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." [...] In a review of Salaam Namaste, Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, [...] "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne– for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> to go back to Natalie Wood." [...] American critic Derek Elley considers her to be [...] "one of Bollywood's best pure actresses." ...|$|E

500|$|Pitchfork Media {{named the}} song the sixth best song of 2010, {{with the staff}} writing [...] "it's all of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy's {{pathology}} and genius in digest form, the vicarious, timeless thrill of hearing a crazy talented person act crazy and talented." [...] Rolling Stone placed the song at position 40 amongst their 50 best tracks of the year. The song was {{on a list of}} the 20 best songs of the year by Spin, with critic Charles Aaron musing that [...] "as if he's inciting an Afro-futurist convocation, Kanye creates the theme music for his spectacularly ambivalent [...] "superhero" [...] alter ego." [...] MTV News declared the track the third best of the year, citing it as a definitive single from the album. Time also listed the song amongst the best 10 of its year. Complex magazine listed it as the sixth best of the year, commenting that with [...] "all the great music Kanye released this year, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> forgotten just how absolutely amazing 'Power' was". [...] In January 2011, The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll named [...] "Power" [...] the fifth-best song of 2010 to find the best music of that year; West's other singles [...] "Runaway" [...] and [...] "Monster" [...] were ranked at numbers four and six, respectively. Their parent album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was ranked the best album of 2010 on the same poll.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, {{the video}} {{received}} positive response from critics. James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that the}} video [...] "is undoubtedly indebted to {{the past few decades}} of pop-cultural history...yet, once again, he's managed to create something entirely new, too". He added that, [...] "thanks to Pinto's wattage, [...] "Gorilla" [...] goes to heights — and depths — Mars has never visited before". Billboards Jason Lipshutz found Mars supporting [...] "a more R-rated side" [...] in the video, calling the cameos by Freida Pinto and Luis Guzman unforgettable. Carl Williot of the website's Idolator thought that the new video maintained the [...] "sweaty nightclub vibe" [...] style from the previous video [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". Additionally, she felt there is a story centered on Isabella, the new dancer, and Mars, which obviously upset [...] "the club’s veteran strippers". The Times of India newspaper considered the video {{one of the most controversial}} of 2013 because of [...] "Freida Pinto strip act". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Bruno Mars is getting real" [...] since the video was set on a strip club and featured Freida Pinto striping, licking guitars and getting intimate with Mars. Lauren Kreisler of Official Charts Company praised the video concept and concluded that it was [...] "racy as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected". The video for [...] "Gorilla" [...] broke the 1 million views mark in just over an hour in 2013 on the exclusive Facebook program premiere, [...] "#NowPlaying".|$|E
500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My first instinct would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connecting his esoteric beliefs {{with his}} career in writing, he conceptualised a {{hypothetical}} area known as the [...] "Idea Space", describing it as [...] "...a space in which mental events {{can be said to}} occur, an idea space which is perhaps universal. Our individual consciousnesses have access to this vast universal space, just as we have individual houses, but the street outside the front door belongs to everybody. It's almost as if ideas are pre-existing forms within this space... The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas, of concepts, that instead of continents and islands <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> large belief systems, philosophies, Marxism might be one, Judeo-Christian religions might make up another."

2500|$|Kitty Empire of The Guardian {{wrote about}} [...] "Gasolina" [...] as {{a song that}} has [...] "a spendidly {{infectious}} lurch". She also stated {{that the rest of}} the album [...] "doesn't let up" [...] by [...] "updating the subgenre of Spanish-language hip-hop with a new swagger". An editor of the Indian music magazine The Record wrote a mixed review of Barrio Fino, stating that anyone who is not intimidated by the Spanish language barrier [...] "will find this to be a good album," [...] praising his [...] "strong rhyming skills". The reviewer criticizes the record because it [...] "is not nearly as catchy or accessible as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> expected it to be" [...] but says that Daddy Yankee almost [...] "lives up to the promise of the hype surrounding him".

She insists that conference attendance is the first step towards activism. [...] "What I do know is that the one-on-one contact recharges our batteries. People like Harriet A. Hall (Skepdoc), Lindsay Beyerstein (co-host of Point of Inquiry), and myself came from CSI’s Skeptic's Toolbox. We weren't primarily authors or lecturers, just people with a passion for the skeptical movement who decided it was our turn to step up.
