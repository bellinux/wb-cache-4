500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a power}} ballad, which {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of three minutes and 35 seconds. It draws influence from the music genre of R and pop, while instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The song is written in the key of A minor and is set in simple time with a metronome of 76 beats per minute. Burke's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of F5. In an interview with Peter Andre on The Paul O'Grady Show on 3 November 2009, Burke explained {{the meaning of the}} songs lyrics, saying [...] "I'm sure everyone has been in that situation where you are in a relationship, it might not be going so well and you kinda want your other half to speak out and say what is on their mind, and I've had relationships like that." [...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking? Why doesn't he let you know how he feels?," [...] and that [...] "The Silence" [...] was written as a result. The songs begins with the lyrics [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>lift</b> me up." ...|$|E
500|$|Supporting Spector's {{conclusion}} {{is a study}} published in 2005 which investigates the size of the clitoris – it suggests that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina. The main researcher of the studies, Australian urologist Helen O'Connell, asserts that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot and experience of vaginal orgasms, taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration. While using MRI technology, O'Connell noted a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the [...] "clitoral bulbs" [...] and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina. [...] "The vaginal wall is, in fact, the clitoris," [...] said O'Connell. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>lift</b> the skin off the vagina on the side walls, you get the bulbs of the clitoris – triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue." [...] O'Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of cadavers and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks. They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones, and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.|$|E
500|$|Supporting an {{anatomical}} {{relationship between}} the clitoris and vagina is {{a study published in}} 2005, which investigated the size of the clitoris; Australian urologist Helen O'Connell, described as having initiated discourse among mainstream medical professionals to refocus on and redefine the clitoris, noted a direct {{relationship between the}} legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the clitoral bulbs and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina while using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology. While some studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during vaginal intercourse, O'Connell argues that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-Spot and experience of vaginal orgasms, taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration.

2500|$|Though a prisoner, Táhirih {{still had}} {{relative}} {{freedom in the}} sense that she still taught her religion to people in the mayor's house. She openly denounced polygamy, the veil and other restraints put upon women. Her words soon made her an influential character and women flocked to see Táhirih, including one princess of the Qajar family who converted. [...] The clergy and members of the court, however, feared that she had grown too influential, and they organized seven conferences with Táhirih to convince her to recant her faith in the Báb. Instead, Táhirih presented religious [...] "proofs" [...] for the Báb's cause and—at the last of these conferences—exclaimed [...] "when will <b>you</b> <b>lift</b> your eyes toward the Sun of Truth?". Her actions horrified the delegation and were regarded as unbecoming of a woman, no less one from her social background.|$|E
