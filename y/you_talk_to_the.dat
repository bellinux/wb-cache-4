500|$|Rajab's {{lawyer said}} {{the verdict was}} {{unexpected}} because the charge of insult was normally punished by a fine. Human Rights First, Human Rights Watch and nineteen members of the United States Congress called for Rajab's release. Four Bahraini rights group issued a joint statement condemning the sentence and five political parties held a sit-in in solidarity with Rajab. Yousif al-Mahafdha of BCHR said [...] "hey arrested him {{to send a message}} to all activists that you will get arrested like him if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> media".|$|E

So I noticed <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police officer; I also noticed the patrol wagon {{standing on the}} opposite side of the street for nearly an hour--my report on that will amuse them at headquarters, won't it? And I noticed you nod <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bruiser, just as your victim came out." ...|$|R

6000|$|KEARNEY (with gravely dissembled humor). Well, I ahsked that {{question}} too. I said, Why did you obey that lady's orders {{instead of waiting}} for mine? They said they didn't see exactly how they could refuse. I ahsked whether they cawnsidered that discipline. They said, Well, sir, will <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lady yourself next time? ...|$|E
6000|$|THE YOUTH [rising indignantly] Oh, {{this is too}} much. I have {{suspected}} you for some time past. We have all suspected you. All the girls {{say that you have}} deceived us as to your age: that you are getting flat-chested: that you are bored with us; that <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ancients when you get the chance. Tell me the truth: how old are you? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some one get cheated!" [...] he exclaimed, laughing. [...] "Every {{one gets}} cheated, {{as you call}} it, if they haven't enough sense to know what their property's worth, {{and how to use}} it to the best advantage. It's a case," [...] he announced, [...] "of the {{survival}} of the fittest. Which reminds me that if I'm going to be fit to-morrow I'd better go to bed. Mr. Wing's to take me to New York on his yacht, and you've got to have your wits about you when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now this {{standing}} upon {{a bit of}} stick 100 feet aloft {{for hours}} at a time, swiftly sailing over the sea, is very much like crossing the Channel in a balloon. Manfred-like, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clouds: you have a fellow feeling for the sun. And when Jarl and I got conversing up there, smoking our dwarfish [...] "dudeens," [...] any sea-gull passing by might have taken us for Messrs. Blanchard and Jeffries, socially puffing their after-dinner Bagdads, bound to Calais, via Heaven, from Dover. Honest Jarl, I acquainted with all: my conversation with the captain, the hint implied in his last words, my firm resolve to quit the ship in one of her boats, and the facility with which I thought the thing could be done. Then I threw out many inducements, in the shape of pleasant anticipations of bearing right down before the wind upon the sunny isles under our lee.|$|E
60|$|Another {{cause of}} this neglect is, a heart set upon worldly things. Men whose minds are much enslaved to earthly affairs all the week, cannot {{disengage}} or break the chain of their thoughts so suddenly, as to apply to a discourse that is wholly foreign to what they have most at heart. Tell a usurer of charity, and mercy, and restitution, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deaf; his heart and soul, with all his senses, are got among his bags, or he is gravely asleep, and dreaming of a mortgage. Tell a man of business, that the cares of the world choke the good seed; that we must not encumber ourselves with much serving; that the salvation of his soul {{is the one thing}} necessary: You see, indeed, the shape of a man before you, but his faculties are all gone off among clients and papers, thinking how to defend a bad cause, or find flaws in a good one; or, he weareth out the time in drowsy nods.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{expansions}} of {{the name}} were attempted, and the one settled on was [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>To</b> Me?". <b>The</b> question mark is part {{of the name}}. The name Ayttm is a backronym and credit for coining this term goes to Natasha Sharma.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I got Mrs. Twemlow {{to take me}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> museum while <b>you</b> were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> butler. It was dreadful to {{feel that}} it was lying there in the open waiting for {{somebody}} to take it, {{and not be able}} to do anything." ...|$|R

5000|$|The game {{encountered}} {{great success}} in Japan, {{and was released}} in the United States the following year. The game found further success in the US and in Europe. [...] The book The Rise and Fall of Sega described the game as having been [...] "an instant hit".

50|$|I've {{never had}} to die on camera before, let alone in such a grisly way. So {{you just have to}} kind of give it everything. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two actors holding you and say, ‘Let's not pansy around here. I'm gonna {{absolutely}} try and get out of this, so don't let me.' Then, you let it rip. It can't be some sort of half-assed whimpering - you've got to really believe the pain and the fear. It's actually quite liberating.|$|E

5000|$|They {{stay for}} {{the night in a}} motel while their van is being repaired. They {{converse}} and bond in a diner where it is revealed that Toni had first gone AWOL to visit her delinquent, drug-addicted brother in a hospital. When the authorities attempted to arrest her, she resisted and made more attempts to escape, leading to her current sentence. Her brother died while she was in prison. This makes them see her in a new light and understand the motivations behind her actions. Later in the night, Eddie finds out that Howard has taken all the money as well as the new car Eddie was planning to buy. He calls Howard, who says he was tired of being used, but says if Eddie answers a riddle he will turn around [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fish?", which Eddie cannot answer. Distressed, he gets drunk. When he returns to the motel, Toni mentions [...] "Drop them a line", answering Howard's riddle, revealing she had accidentally listened in on the conversation when he was talking to Howard and that she realizes he embezzled $150,000 from the Navy. She seduces him and the two have sex.|$|E

60|$|They {{strike the}} {{stranger}} as a childlike people, {{but you are}} possessed with a haunting sense of ugly traits beneath.

5000|$|... "Mental illness" [...] is an expression, {{a metaphor}} that {{describes}} an offending, disturbing, shocking, or vexing conduct, action, or pattern of behavior, such as schizophrenia, as an [...] "illness" [...] or [...] "disease". Szasz wrote: [...] "If {{you talk to}} God, you are praying; If God talks to you, you have schizophrenia. If the dead talk to you, you are a spiritualist; If <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dead, you are a schizophrenic." [...] He maintained that, while people behave and think in disturbing ways, and those ways may resemble a disease process (pain, deterioration, response to various interventions), {{this does not mean}} they actually have a disease. To Szasz, disease can only mean something people [...] "have", while behavior is what people [...] "do". Diseases are [...] "malfunctions of the human body, of the heart, the liver, the kidney, the brain" [...] while [...] "no behavior or misbehavior is a disease or can be a disease. That's not what diseases are." [...] Szasz cited drapetomania {{as an example of a}} behavior that many in society did not approve of, being labeled and widely cited as a disease. Likewise, women who did not bend to a man's will were said to have hysteria. He thought that psychiatry actively obscures the difference between behavior and disease in its quest to help or harm parties in conflicts. He maintained that, by calling people diseased, psychiatry attempts to deny them responsibility as moral agents in order to better control them.|$|E

40|$|Corruption – I {{was facing}} with this word since I was a boy, {{born in the}} country named Yugoslavia, so I gained the {{impression}} that it is omnipresent. It {{is well known that}} corruption is a social phenomenon that undermines the basic democratic principles, such as equality of citizens in institutions, transparency of decision-making process and public responsibility. If <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> average citizens of Montenegro, they would tell you that a major hindrance for development is nothing else than corruption.
