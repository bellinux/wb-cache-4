In their review of Final Fantasy Tactics, IGN called the battle areas [...] "extremely well designed and detailed to perfection", singling out the churches as especially beautiful. GameSpot was similarly impressed with the wide varieties of [...] "beautiful" [...] terrains to be seen in Ivalice, from swamps to castles to [...] "anything else <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of". PSXExtreme praised the feel of Lea Monde in Vagrant Story, calling it [...] "excellently lit" [...] in a style that brought out the [...] "dark and moody" [...] feeling of the game.

500|$|Southerton's tour report {{refers to}} the crowds' {{reactions}} to the England team, and in particular to the [...] "barracking" [...] of Larwood. This, he says, only once reached unacceptable proportions—during the game against Victoria that took place between {{the fourth and fifth}} Tests. This disturbance was apparently sparked by Chapman's decision to put Larwood on to bowl against Victoria's weakest batsman, Bert Ironmonger. In general, Southerton felt that crowd noise was no worse than that accorded to previous touring teams and that, [...] "objectionable though it may appear to be to us in England, it has grown up with Australian cricket and is recognised by the public out there as part of their day's enjoyment". Larwood's view was that [...] "it was a bit too thick at times... I got called every name you can imagine, and every four-letter word <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of was used against me". The Surrey amateur batsman Douglas Jardine, was likewise a target of the crowds, and as a result formed a cordial dislike for Australians—which was fully reciprocated.|$|E

500|$|Following the album's release, Charles quickly {{earned an}} influx of white {{listeners}} and audiences at concert venues, without experiencing any fall-out from his predominantly black audience. Writer Daniel Cooper later said of the album's effect, [...] "It's an idea as corny as any country song <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of, and one that Charles knew to be true; music unites people. It just really does." [...] Throughout the years following its initial reception, Modern Sounds gained further acknowledgment of {{its impact on the}} music industry and society. Through conceiving and recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to receive and practice artistic control bestowed upon by a mainstream record company. In a 1998 interview, country musician Raul Malo acknowledged the album's influence, calling it [...] "one of the most important records of our time, not only because of its content, but also due to its social and political ramifications." [...] In a July 8, 2004 article for Rolling Stone magazine, music journalist Robert Christgau praised the impact and influence that the Modern Sounds recordings had on music, stating [...] "In the world it created, not only could a black person sing the American songbook Ella Fitzgerald owned by then, but a country black person could take it over. Soon Charles's down-home diction, cotton-field grit, corn-pone humor and overstated shows of emotion were standard operating procedure in American music, black and white." ...|$|E

Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you somewhat of his view about me'.

2500|$|He had {{a lifelong}} {{ambition}} {{to make a}} film about his hero the political theorist and revolutionary Thomas Paine, whom he called [...] "one of the finest men that ever lived".

Everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of that we want is in Rights of Man or The Age of Reason or Common Sense." [...] He could not secure the funding to do so.

2500|$|In a blog post, he {{expanded}} on this, {{discussing the}} film's symbolism, imagery and Trier's intentions, calling him [...] "one {{of the most}} heroic directors in the world" [...] and Antichrist [...] "a powerfully-made film that contains material many audiences will find repulsive or unbearable. The performances by Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are heroic and fearless. Trier's visual command is striking. The use of music is evocative; no score, but operatic and liturgical arias. And if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> beyond what he shows to what he implies, its depth are [...] frightening." [...] Duane Dudek of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel called Antichrist [...] "Trier's most visually lush and technically rigorous film; it captures things at a molecular level and in a slow motion that all but brings the world to a halt... But paradoxically, this is his most unwatchable film, and many will find its violence and cruelty, including scenes of genital mutilation, repellent. I cannot recommend Antichrist, but {{in a culture that}} hemorrhages death and torture nightly on shows like 24 or , I can understand it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During his 10 {{years in}} Buffalo, Zelen helped the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) — {{one of several}} {{regional}} organizations established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to test experimental cancer treatments — with its studies. In an American University alumni magazine article in 2008, Zelen said those early studies were “terrible.” He said the studies were “poorly thought out; the data was wrong; they had poor quality control, not enough patients — everything <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> of that was antiscientific.” [...] He urged biomedical researchers {{in charge of the}} studies to begin from scratch because they had learned relatively little because of study design flaws. They agreed with Zelen, and along with his longtime collaborator Paul Carbone, he established research standards and practice now used in clinical trials for many infectious diseases. [...] During that period, Zelen formed the Statistical Laboratory at the University of Buffalo, which focused on overseeing and improving statistical aspects of large, complex drug trials. [...] ECOG would later become one of the world's largest programs for testing and evaluating various cancer treatments.|$|E

At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I can {{teach you how to}} draw, I cannot teach you how to think or see. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>think</b> and you can see, you can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw something in me I didn't know was there." [...] By the end of her time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, {{as a result of her}} exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business [...] "by accident." ...|$|E
