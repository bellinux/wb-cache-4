I really want to be perfectly fair, and so you must not stop altogether from looking at things until I am able to go with you. I think good things to look at by yourself would be stables and barnyards, and the lower part of barns. Please do not go into haylofts, nor into the chicken-yard, if there is one. You might keep your eyes on the ground until you get to these places and then look up. If there are horses and cows, don't tell me anything about them when you see me. Don't tell me anything. I think I shall be well to-morrow, perhaps to-night. Miriam." ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{understand}} experiences {{of parents in}} a child burning situation during the hospitalization process. Methods: phenomenological research in view of Martin Heidegger, held with seven assisting parents at a pediatrics unit of a general hospital in Montes Claros. The information was obtained by phenomenological interview, containing the question guide: “What {{does it mean to}} <b>you</b> <b>being</b> <b>with</b> a son who is suffering with burns?”. Results: during the experience, parents revealed anguish, fear, helplessness, concerns and expectations of “being-in-the-world”. Conclusion: respect, understanding and care from the health team were fundamental for the adaptation and the confrontation demanded by the consequent suffering of the event. ...|$|E

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} theme tune, another {{signature}} of the show was the enthusiastic announcer intro: [...] "Yes! It's The Benny Hill Show!" [...] (The announcer was often cast member Henry McGee.) From 1975 onwards, Hill was also introduced {{at the start of}} each show as [...] "The Lad Himself". The show closed with Hill's salute: [...] "Thank <b>you</b> for <b>being</b> <b>with</b> us, {{and we look forward to}} seeing you all again—very, very soon. Until then, bye bye.".|$|R

Kozelek stated, [...] "When I wrote a few songs over the past year, my friend Aaron would fly down and record them. We did that off and on from April of last year until April of this year. If you record a song while it’s fresh, the odds of <b>you</b> <b>being</b> happy <b>with</b> it are stronger.

I have not the foolish notion that you can love me merely because I am your mother, when you have never seen or heard of me in all your life.

It struck me that <b>you,</b> <b>being</b> connected <b>with</b> Mr. Harmer, might know if it were really his grand-daughter, and, if so, might wish to come to her; so I thought it my duty to come and inform you at once, in spite of the strangeness of the hour." ...|$|R

And now I have heard this wonderful story about your fortune, and about everything else, too, my dear; and it seems all very beautiful, and very romantic; and everybody says that you have behaved so well; and so, {{to make a long story}} short, I have come to find you out in your hermitage, and to claim cousinship, and all that sort of thing." ...|$|R

2500|$|With {{everything}} stage-bound, {{production was}} smooth and problems were few, and small—for instance, Claude Rains, who stood three or four inches shorter than Ingrid Bergman. [...] " [...] this business of <b>you</b> <b>being</b> a midget <b>with</b> a wife, Miss Bergman, who is very tall," [...] the director kidded with Rains, a good friend. For the scenes where Rains and Bergman were to walk hand-in-hand, Hitchcock devised a system of ramps that boosted Rains's height yet were unseen by the camera. He also suggested Rains try elevator shoes: [...] "Walk in them, sleep in them, be comfortable in them." [...] Rains did, and used them thereafter. Hitchcock gave Rains the choice of playing Sebastian with a German or his English accent; Rains chose the latter.|$|R

This is something genuinely new for Berlin, and one must give Oskar Kaufmann his due, for he has understood how to bring to fruition something outstanding and appropriate to its purpose. The room, decorated in ivory colours, is completely carpeted in grey plush, against which the lilac folding seats are advantageously silhouetted. The ceiling gravitates downwards towards sumptuous, multi-coloured relief arabesques, and the light fixtures are of outstanding beauty.|$|R

40|$|To {{speak about}} the complex reality of China in {{meaningful}} terms {{is a very difficult}} task, and to reflect on business education and its mission in this context is an even bigger challenge. We are very fortunate to have Professor Henri-Claude de Bettignies sharing his experiences and thoughts with us. For a significant part of his life, Professor de Bettignies has been engaged in understanding business in East Asia and China and building bridges between the East and the West. He has showed a strong commitment to assist Chinese business people in raising their ethical awareness and to help steer them through a great deal of complex ethical situations. Thank <b>you</b> for <b>being</b> <b>with</b> us. Before discussing several more specific points, I would like to emphasize the importance of what Henri-Claude said in his introduction. In fact, China has been facing enormous challenges in her development over the last 30 years, and it is hard to overestimate the gravity of those multiple difficulties. Unfortunately, China watchers and critics from abroad too often do not grasp the complexity of China’s process of reform and opening-up and too easily slide into China bashing that deflects the attention from the real problems that exist. The Chinese are still mindful of the invasion of Western powers in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Thus, when the West thinks i...|$|R
