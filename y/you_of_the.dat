25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against it to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E

500|$|Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later Marquis of Paraná), one of Brazil's leading {{politicians}} and then serving as president (governor) {{of the province}} of Pernambuco, summarized the prevalent view among Brazil's ruling elite regarding the succession of the Empire when he addressed the Provincial Assembly: [...] "It is my painful duty to inform <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> death of the Prince Imperial D. Pedro Afonso, which occurred on 10 January of the current year. It {{is the second time}} we lose the heir presumptive of the crown." [...] Honório Hermeto continued: [...] "It must serve as a consolation to us, the certainty of [...] health of H. M. the Emperor and his august wife. Both in the prime of their years, and full of life, still promise both numerous fruits from their conjugal bed as well as a male succession to the crown, as required for both the consolidation of our still recent institutions and the restless spirit of the century." ...|$|E
500|$|Although the State Opening of Parliament {{was planned}} for February 1605, {{concern over the}} plague delayed it until 3October. A {{contemporaneous}} government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. If the story is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of [...] "killing innocents". Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby {{a letter from the}} pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, [...] "Whatever I mean to do, if the Pope knew, he would not hinder for the general good of our country." [...] Father Garnet's protestations prompted Catesby's next reply, [...] "I am not bound to take knowledge by <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pope's will." [...] Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby's confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby's wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.|$|E
500|$|In May 1796, Bonaparte {{detailed}} Sérurier {{to demonstrate}} with his division at Valenza {{while the rest}} of the army crossed the Po River near Piacenza. After the Battle of Lodi, Bonaparte divided the Army of Italy into a cavalry reserve and four divisions including one under Sérurier. During the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May, his division feinted at the upper Mincio River while other troops made the main thrust against Johann Peter Beaulieu's army at Valeggio sul Mincio. On 1 June, the 4,700-strong division took position on the north side of the fortress of Mantua. On 8 June, Sérurier, artillerist Augustin de Lespinasse and engineer Francois, marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat reconnoitered the fortress. Two days later Bonaparte put Sérurier in charge of the Siege of Mantua with about 8,000 soldiers. Soon after, Bonaparte wrote to the French Directory, [...] "I shall not speak to <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conduct of the intrepid General Sérurier, whose military reputation is established, and to whom we owe, amongst other things since the campaign began, the victory of Mondovi". Because of the approach of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser's Austrian army, the siege was raised on 31 July, the heavy cannons were buried and the division withdrew behind the Oglio River. Sérurier then became feverish with malaria, so that Fiorella and Gaspard Amédée Gardanne directed the division during the Battle of Castiglione. The general returned to France to recuperate. On 14 August 1796 Bonaparte wrote a confidential assessment of his generals to the Directory. In it he wrote, [...] "Sérurier, fights like a private, takes nothing on himself, firm; has not a good enough opinion of his troops, is ill".|$|E
