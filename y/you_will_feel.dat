500|$|Fields left no written lectures {{from her}} USC years, but a {{transcript}} exists from a 1975 seminar {{that she gave}} at the American Film Institute. In one characteristic excerpt she said that, [...] "There's a feeling of movement in telling a story {{and there is a}} flow. A cut that is off-rhythm will be disturbing and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> it, unless {{you want it to be}} like that. On Jaws, each time I wanted to cut I didn't, so that it would have an anticipatory feeling — and it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{revealed}} {{in a conference}} call interview that the episode was the [...] "culmination of {{a lot of things that}} [...] had been working on for quite a while". Though they loved all of their episodes, the two stated that [...] "Entrada" [...] was a particular favorite of theirs, with Pinker elaborating that [...] "if the only episode of Fringe you ever tune into watch is this one, sure, it’s going to take you five minutes to catch up, but <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> what’s going on, and you will understand the relationships... a great entry point". The producers considered making [...] "Entrada" [...] the mid-season finale, but instead selected [...] "Marionette", the following week's episode.|$|E
500|$|On February 23, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled Wrath {{and one day}} later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia, PA. In November 2008, Bronsnan {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, [...] "Without Mikey, we'd very well might not be a band today." [...] Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying [...] "This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> it." [...] "Wrath" [...] debuted on the Billboard 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.|$|E

"However, {{what you}} need just now is not a discourse, but a bath and court-plaster and {{witch-hazel}} and cold-water bandages," [...] Mr. Bronson said; [...] "so to bed with <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>'ll</b> need all the sleep you can get, and <b>you</b> <b>'ll</b> <b>feel</b> stiff and sore to-morrow morning, I promise you." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Beat of My Heart" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics wrote that Duff sounds {{like she is}} bored and [...] "going through the motions" [...] on the song. She further stated that Duff has [...] "lost her sauciness and ironically, her spunk" [...] in the song. Avoledo concluded her review by calling [...] "the bland electro pop" [...] song an [...] "insult to the genre. It's like spilling ramen on a Vivenne Westwood evening gown." [...] A reviewer from CBBC Newsround commented that the song is so repetitive that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> like [...] "you've listened to it 20 times after just one play". The reviewer praised the heartbeat present on the track, writing that it [...] "make it {{a bit of a}} foot-tapper", but deemed the lyrics to be [...] "meaningless". The reviewer concluded that: [...] "You'll find yourself humming it but will be hard pushed to remember what on earth she was singing about!" [...] Spence D. of IGN wrote that [...] "Beat of My Heart" [...] does not try for subtlety as it utilizes the [...] "much overused heartbeat" [...] for the [...] "foundation rhythm" [...] of the song.|$|E
500|$|Tom Hall {{announced}} that Ananchronox would feature a [...] "turbulent {{story with a}} roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: [...] "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I {{want to make the}} characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." [...] Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name Anachronox (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and [...] "psychic poison." [...] Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in Anachronox, reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the Final Fantasy franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of live-action cinematics to avoid [...] " [...] players out of the game." [...] Hall remarked, [...] "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kojima later {{stated in}} 2015 [...] "I know there's people {{concerning}} about 'Quiet' but don't worry. I created her character as an antithesis {{to the women}} characters appeared in the past fighting game who are excessively exposed. 'Quiet' who doesn't have a word will be teased in the story as well. But once you recognize the secret reason for her exposure, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed of your words & deeds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Jon Favreau and {{composer}} John Debney sought {{to recreate the}} Fantasound experience Walt had in mind. When mixing the soundtrack in Dolby Atmos, as Favreau said, [...] "we isolated instruments when we could. And in the sound mix, we created a Fantasound mix. If you see the film in Atmos, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> that there are instruments that move around the theater." [...] A mention for Fantasound appears in the film's closing credits.|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce asked Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, {{you helped}} your commandery's {{administrator}} destroy {{a letter from}} the provincial administration, saved Wenju (Kong Rong) from danger, and successfully obtained reinforcements from Xuande (Liu Bei). These are all acts of heroism. You {{are one of the most}} intelligent people in this world, yet you haven't found someone who appreciates your talent. The ancients could forget about she gou zhan qu. I am someone who appreciates you. You don't need to worry that <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> unhappy if you join me." [...] Sun Ce also said, [...] "If a dragon wishes to soar into the sky, it has to take off from a piece of wood." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} like when the mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions and is able to focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>feel</b> as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E
