500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

And human life is in no wise different, though you feel it is and think that you reason why it is. Why should I be parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them, more workers than there are factories or machines for them. Why, you {{who live on the}} land know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remain more poor people, dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which is life destroyed), than <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with.

He {{told me that when}} he were a young man he was once putting the sheep in the fold, and there was one that was giddy--a young ewe. She was always a-turning round and round and round, and {{when she got to the}} gate she wouldn't go in but kept on a-turning and turning, until at last he got angry and, lifting his crook, gave her a crack on the head, and down she went, and he thought he'd killed her. But in a little while up she jumps and trotted straight into the fold, and from that time she were well. Next day he told his master, and his master said, with a laugh, 'Well, now <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> when you gits a giddy sheep.' Some time after that Mark Dick he had another giddy one, and remembering what his master had said, he swung his stick and gave her a big crack on the skull, and down went the sheep, dead. He'd killed it this time, sure enough. When he tells of this one his master said, 'You've cured one and you've killed one; now don't you try to cure no more,' he says.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXVII. First group. With {{the roll}} {{at the base}} (b, Fig. LXIII.). The chain of its {{succession}} is represented from 1 to 6, in Plate XV.: 1 and 2 are the steps already gained, as in Fig. LXIII.; and in them the profile of cornice used is a of Plate XV., or a refined condition of b of Fig. V., p. 69, above. Now, keeping the same refined profile, substitute the condition of it, f of Fig. V. (and there accounted for), above the roll here, and you have 3, Plate XV. This superadded abacus was instantly felt to be harsh in its projecting angle; but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with an angle when it is harsh. Use your simplest chamfer on it (a or b, Fig. LIII., page 287, above), but on the visible side only, and you have fig. 4, Plate XV. (the top stone being made deeper {{that you may have}} room to chamfer it). Now this fig. 4 is the profile of Lombardic and Venetian early capitals and cornices, by tens of thousands; and it continues into the late Venetian Gothic, with this only difference, that as times advances, the vertical line {{at the top of the}} original cornice begins to slope outwards, and through a series of years rises like the hazel wand in the hand of a diviner:--but how slowly! a stone dial which marches but 45 degrees in three centuries, and through the intermediate condition 5 arrives at 6, and so stays.|$|E
