40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of on-farm and/or on-station early generation <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> was examined {{to maximize the}} genetic gains for sorghum yield under smallholder famer production conditions in West Africa. On-farm first-stage yield trials (augmented design, 150 genotypes with subsets of 50 genotypes tested per farmer) and second-stage yield trials (replicated α-lattice design, 21 test genotypes) were conducted, as well as on-station α-lattice first- and second-stage trials under contrasting phosphorous conditions. On-farm testing was effective, with yield showing significant genetic variance and acceptable heritabilities (0. 56 in first- and 0. 61 to 0. 83 in second-stage trials). Predicted genetic gains from on-station yield trials were always less than from direct testing on-farm, although on-station trials under low-phosphorus and combined over multiple environments improved selection efficiencies. Modeling alternative designs for on-farm <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> (augmented, farmer-as-incomplete-block, multiple lattice, and augmented p-rep) indicated that acceptable heritabilities (0. 57 to 0. 65) could be obtained with all designs for testing 150 progenies in 20 trials and 75 plots per farmer. Ease of implementation and risk of errors would thus be key criteria for choice of design. Integrating results from on-station and on-farm <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> appeared beneficial as progenies selected both by on-farm and on-station first-stage trials showed higher on-farm <b>yields</b> in second-stage <b>testing.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Both methods have proved of value and a combination of both may often be used advantageously. Some danger always exists of error occurring in the check plats and that correcting according to them may introduce new errors in the yields of crops compared. The method should, for this reason, be used with caution.

A survey made in 1954, showed that at least 112 companies sold closed-pedigree corn seed in Iowa. In addition, other individuals and companies produce and sell only open-pedigree hybrids.

40|$|Two {{aspects of}} a {{recurrent}} selection program that can be manipulated are the extensiveness of testing used to identify superior individuals {{and the number of}} intermating generations conducted among the superior individuals to form a population for the next cycle of selection. The objective of the research was to compare the performance of soybean Glycine max (L.) Merrill lines derived from populations developed by recurrent selection for seed yield with one or two stages of replicated <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> to identify superior individuals and one or three generations of intermating among the selected parents. The base population, AP 6, used for the alternative strategies of recurrent selection was derived from 40 high-yielding strains of Maturity Groups 0 to IV. For this study, the 40 original parents of AP 6 and the lines used as the parents for the most advanced cycle of selection for each of the strategies were evaluated in four Iowa environments. The number of cycles of selection completed for the strategies under evaluation varied from two to five. Strategies with two stages of replicated <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> to select superior individuals resulted in a larger number of high-yielding lines than when only one stage of testing was conducted. A larger number of high-yielding lines was obtained for strategies with one generation of intermating than when three generations were used.

40|$|Extensive {{breeding}} investigations with soybeans in {{this country}} have been under way for only {{a relatively short period of}} time. Breeding work was at first confined primarily to introduction and selection, but it was soon realized that the possibilities for continued improvement with these practices were definitely limited. Consequently, during the last 10 or 15 years, hybridization has rapidly supplanted these procedures as the principal means for obtaining new and improved varieties. Methods of handling segregating populations of crosses in such self-pollinated crops as wheat, oats, barley and flax now are fairly well standardized. Practices involve various modifications of the pedigree method, the bulk method or a combination of the two. An advantage of the pedigree method is that it enables the investigator to conduct inheritance studies of characteristics in which the parents differ. The principal advantages of the bulk method are cheapness in cost and opportunity to conduct replicated bulk <b>yield</b> <b>tests</b> as early as the F 2 generation. Early generation <b>yield</b> <b>testing</b> with the pedigree method, on the other hand, is limited or practically impossible in certain crops because of the scarcity of seed produced on individual plants and the high cost of testing large numbers of lines in replicated tests. Segregating populations of soybean crosses are admirably adapted for breeding by either of the two methods, as comparatively large seed yields on spaced individual plants make it possible to conduct pedigree <b>yield</b> <b>tests</b> as early as the F 3 generation. Replicated tests for evaluation of agronomic potentialities of soybean crosses in early segregating generations following hybridization, therefore, can be used with either the bulk or the pedigree method of breeding...|$|R
