[...] On September 23, Ravi and Huang discussed Clementi's death and Huang asked, [...] "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> was a viewing party once. ..." [...] Ravi answered, [...] "No that was a joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lu Ji {{appeared}} {{briefly in}} chapter 43 {{of the historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. He {{was one of the}} Wu scholars who debated with Zhuge Liang over Sun Quan's decision to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao before the Battle of Red Cliffs. Lu Ji argued, [...] "Even though Cao Cao controls the Emperor and holds sway over the lords, he is still a descendant of the chancellor Cao Shen. Liu Bei may be a descendant of Prince Jing of Zhongshan, but there is no proof for this. As far as we see, he {{is no more than a}} straw mat weaver and shoe seller. How can he compete with Cao Cao?" [...] Zhuge Liang replied, [...] "Aren't you the 'Young Man Lu' who hid oranges in his sleeve at Yuan Shu's house? Please sit down and listen to me. Since Cao Cao is a descendant of Chancellor Cao, he is therefore a subject of the Han Empire. However, he monopolises state power and bullies the Emperor. This is a disgrace to his ancestor. He is not only a villain of the Han Empire, but also a miscreant of the Cao family! Liu Bei is a member of the imperial clan. His Majesty the Emperor checked the family records and granted him a title. How can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is no proof? Emperor Gaozu started off as a minor patrol officer, but yet he became an Emperor eventually. What is disgraceful about weaving straw mats and selling shoes? Your opinions are those of a child. You're not fit to speak with learned men!" [...] Lu Ji remained silent.|$|E

I {{may have been}} too hasty in saying I was not. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are no angels in this world. Who am I to set myself up against your experience? A mere thing of a day--so far as this world goes. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are no angels--clearly I must be {{something}} else. I eat--angels do not eat. I may be a man already." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Capataz {{was heard}} {{striking}} {{the table with}} his fist. [...] "Everything? What are <b>you</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>there?</b> Everything? Know everything? It is impossible! Everything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Cavanagh {{looked him}} in the face an instant. [...] "Very well," [...] said he, [...] "I'll do as <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There's</b> no use of our both taking chances." ...|$|R
60|$|INSPECTOR. Then why did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> did? <b>There's</b> been a theft here, and {{anything}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> {{may be used}} against you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{seen you}} and I'm afraid. You're {{too much for}} me--too many. England {{bristles}} with questions. This is more, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there,</b> my form." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{was this}} girl like?" [...] she asked when he finished. [...] "Uncle Arnold's daughter. Would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> was any {{resemblance}} {{between her and}} me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> {{never were}} and never can be any, I suppose I must {{give up my}} fancy; but I'm sorry," [...] sighed the child.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} before you go. I can't now. I don't know how I shall then. But it must be told. I'd never let you leave me without knowing. For {{in spite of what}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> a chance <b>you</b> mightn't come back." ...|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. There is {{something}} in what <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> but <b>there</b> is not everything in what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> In many points you are unjust.|$|R
6000|$|... "But ye mean weel--ye mean weel," [...] said he; [...] "so gie me your hand, Nicol, and if ever I put my sons apprentice, I will gie you {{the refusal}} o' them. And, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there's</b> the {{thousand}} merks {{to be settled}} between us.-- Here, Eachin MacAnaleister, bring me my sporran." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. This is cunning indeed; but as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> must be also {{something}} done or said to blind therewith, and this I perceive Mr. Badman had.|$|E
6000|$|... "Next {{best thing}} to tell the truth," [...] muttered Captain Smollett. [...] "Load his gun, Hawkins. How many should <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> were on your side, doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> <b>There,</b> I am coming in. Be satisfied, Tom; I am {{come out}} with a {{commission}} from Mr. Dynevor, to see what can be arranged.' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{understand}} a word <b>you</b> are <b>saying.</b> <b>There's</b> {{a crowd of people}} talking to your pupils.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{relationships}} are independent <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is a join dependency as follows: *((order-number, customer-name), (order-number, pizza-name), (order-number,courier)).|$|R
6000|$|Madame Merle smiled {{straight}} at her host. [...] "It's less characteristic than your comment upon it which is perfectly insincere. I don't, however, make {{a crime of}} that," [...] she added, [...] "because if you don't believe what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> no reason why you should. I don't ruin myself for my friends; I don't deserve your praise. I care greatly for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{understand}} you, Lucy. What {{truth or}} what untruth {{can you have}} told him, if, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> has been nothing between you but ordinary conversation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The sheriff {{removed his}} hat and wiped his brow, then swore with a mutter of awe. [...] "Well, by God, this is the limit! <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> were three bodies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} much honoured," [...] Reist answered, quietly. [...] "As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> is much which we might discuss. Will you {{permit me to}} {{introduce}} you to my friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Frank, that is ill-natured, {{and almost}} unmanly,--and false also. When have I been fickle? <b>You</b> <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> was one before with <b>you.</b> I <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> {{has never really}} been one with me at all. No one knows that better than yourself. I cannot afford {{to be in love}} till I am quite sure that the man is fit to be, and will be, my husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|But another quick flash from Susy's eyes {{dispersed}} these beatific {{visions of}} the future. [...] "Hush!" [...] she said, with suppressed dramatic intensity. [...] "You know not what <b>you</b> <b>say!</b> <b>There's</b> an awful mystery hangs over him. Mary Rogers," [...] continued the young girl, approaching her small mouth to her confidante's ear in an appalling whisper. [...] "His father was--a PIRATE! Yes--lived a pirate and was killed a pirate!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are unjust, Gran'pa!" [...] {{declared}} Mary Louise indignantly. [...] "Didn't <b>you</b> yourself <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are two {{curious and}} surprising {{things about this}} man Jones?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> is {{something}} wrong between us. There have been applications for money about the Polyeuka mine. I would not trouble you about it while you were ill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how {{can this}} be prevented? If, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> are actual proofs, why have they not been acted upon before? What can keep them from being acted upon now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> {{were men}} searching here, Jane. How was it they didn't find it if it's in the library, {{and how was}} it the Miss Penfolds allowed them to search?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then there's {{hopes of}} the fellow. As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> John, <b>there</b> {{is no need}} to decide until we get to Albuquerque. When do we make the start?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Michael, airily. [...] "It is {{a parable}}. It is a parable {{of you and}} all your rationalists. You begin by {{breaking}} up the Cross; but you end by breaking up the habitable world. We leave <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that nobody ought to join the Church against his will. When we meet you again <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> {{that no one has}} any will to join it with. We leave <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>there</b> is no such place as Eden. We find <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> that <b>there</b> is no such place as Ireland. You start by hating the irrational and you come to hate everything, for everything is irrational and so----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All! for mercy's sake, <b>you</b> don't <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are {{any more}} coming!" [...] exclaim {{two or three}} in a breath; [...] "they can't come; there is not room!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ''Fat {{lot of good}} that'll do my face at tea,' Vernon grunted. 'Why couldn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> was {{something}} wrong with you instead of lamming out like a lunatic? Is my lip puffy?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that would}} be possible--yes, {{certainly}} it would be possible. But think of her position--the house full of wedding presents--guests coming from a distance. It is awful. And <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is no alternative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please do {{not become}} so excited, Professor," [...] responded Colonel Colby. [...] "We must try {{to get at the}} bottom of this matter. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is ice on the floor of your room?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... e.g., ‘Why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that?’, ‘Is <b>there</b> {{reason to}} doubt this evidence?’ ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, how can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that? <b>There</b> is no {{resemblance}} {{between the two}} things at all. But really, Gerald, {{what do you mean}} by not being suitable? ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah well, {{if you go}} in {{for pure}} nature, as <b>you</b> were <b>saying,</b> <b>there’s</b> nothing like that. Nature, over here, must be awfully grand.” And Lord Lambeth looked about him.|$|R
