2500|$|When he was {{a visible}} figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and {{developed}} working relationships in both the West and {{what was to become}} the Soviet bloc. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés. To make things worse, during the first days of McCarthyism Einstein was writing about a single world government; it was at this time that he wrote, [...] "I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> will use in the Fourth— sticks and stones." [...] In a 1949 Monthly Review article entitled [...] "Why Socialism?" [...] Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the [...] "predatory phase of human development" [...] With Albert Schweitzer and Bertrand Russell, Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the Russell-Einstein Manifesto, which led to the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Hitchhiker's Guide to Technology" [...] {{claims that}} if you make {{yourself}} {{a cup of tea}} and attempt to get an object working and the tea goes cold before you finish, you are dealing with technology. Other guides include the Hitchhiker's Guide to Blogging, the Hitchhiker's Guide to Deadlines and the Hitchhiker's Guide to How to be Cool which discusses how an individual can truly be cool, instead of by following crowds, but concludes by suggesting the listener attend a showing of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The Guide to Websites, which only appeared on the official UK movie website, described a website as [...] "a wonderful new invention that allows people you neither know nor care about to inform <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had for breakfast this morning, without all that tedious mucking about in the postal system". The Guide to Fanboys, written by Touchstone Pictures' copywriters as part of their promotion of the movie, only ever appeared as website text. Though released {{at the same time as}} the iTunes entries, it was never intended to be recorded and is otherwise unconnected with the Fry/Talbot/Browse works.|$|E
