40|$|A {{longitudinal}} {{research design}} {{was used to}} determine if parents 2 ̆ 7 personal well-being or marital relations changed after the launching of the <b>youngest</b> <b>child</b> and what variales might affect these potential changes. Eighty-nine parents whose <b>youngest</b> <b>child</b> was a senior at Logan High School or Sky View High School responded to mail-out questionnaires, assessing parents general well-being, marital relations, marital companionship, personal stress, quality of parenting experiences and degree of parent-child conflict. Approximately one year later, a second questionnaire was sent and twenty-three of the parents who responded had launched their <b>youngest</b> <b>child.</b> One of the most striking aspects of {{the results of this study}} was the general lack of statistically significant findings. For most individuals, launching of the <b>youngest</b> <b>child</b> had little positive or negative affect on parents personal well-being or marital relations. Significant relationships were found for parents who had low quality parenting experiences or whose relationships with their <b>youngest</b> <b>child</b> tended to be conflictful. These findings suggest that low quality parenting experiences or high amounts of parent-child conflict negatively impact personal well-being and marital relations and that the launching of the <b>youngest</b> <b>child</b> lessens the negative impact of these two variables.

5|$|Other, {{more recent}} {{studies suggest that}} the idea of object {{permanence}} may not be an innate function of <b>young</b> <b>children.</b> While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that <b>young</b> <b>children</b> develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these <b>young</b> <b>children?</b> Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E

40|$|Sibling {{status is}} an {{environmental}} factor {{related to the}} speech and language development of children, and {{has been found to}} affect several speech characteristics in the language of a second child (Koch, 1956). These characteristics include: slower language development of the <b>younger</b> <b>child,</b> more stuttering in the <b>younger</b> <b>child,</b> and a decrease in articulation skills in the <b>younger</b> <b>child.</b> Children with no siblings who have adults as models tend to be superior in language development (Koch, 1956). It has been shown that the presence of a triadic interaction among the older sibling, the <b>younger</b> <b>child,</b> and the mother result in changes in the language of mothers. When the third interacting member is an older sibling the mother interacts with both children at the language level of the older child only. In comparison, in the language of a dyadic encounter consisting of the mother and <b>younger</b> <b>child,</b> the mother interacts with the <b>younger</b> <b>child</b> at his/her level (Wellen, 1985). The interpretation of Wellen's study hopothesized that the presence of older siblings may be a disadvantage towards language learning of younger siblings. Although there are many studies such as Wellen's that hypothesized the presence of an older sibling as a disadvantage toward language learning of younger siblings, there is little evidence to dispute these findings. Brittain (1966) argued that older siblings help the language development of the <b>younger</b> <b>child</b> through their modeling: however Brittain provided no evidence to back up his statement.
