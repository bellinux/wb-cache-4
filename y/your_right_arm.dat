6000|$|... "I see <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> is in a sling, Mr. Glover," [...] {{the captain}} said as he handed him the report, [...] "so I suppose that you have had some fighting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{very glad}} you did take the fancy. You'll make an {{excellent}} model. If you won't mind posing again for a few minutes--I will not weary you to-day. <b>Your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> a little more forward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are too modest," [...] {{said the}} Doctor. [...] "In {{addition}} to <b>your</b> good <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> you have <b>your</b> subtle brain. I {{know nothing of}} you but what I see; but I see by your physiognomy that you are extremely intelligent." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hetty {{was evidently}} very much displeased at something, for {{she seemed to}} forget Clavering was there. [...] "If you do I'll never speak to you again," [...] she said. [...] "You might have been fond of him, Flo. There wasn't the least {{necessity}} to put <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>right</b> around his neck." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{reminds me}} of the 'grand finale' of our old country tableau-exhibitions, in which finale (illuminated by red fire) we would try to {{introduce}} every character that had been used in the preceding 'pictures'—from 'Mother Goose' to the 'Angel of the Resurrection,' and from 'Columbus' to 'Uncle Tom and Eva'—adding, of course, 'Uncle Sam' and 'Columbia' with the Flag, and as many other characters as we were able to costume and could crowd on the stage.""I feel an impulse to seize this 'super' by his dangling foot and slide him gently off into oblivion—or else say to him, as sternly as I can: 'Awake, awake, put on thy strength ... shake thyself from the dust; arise.' You deserve a place at Liberty's side, not at her feet. Assist her soberly to uphold the Flag, while others rejoice; for, but for <b>your</b> strong <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> the Flag would even now perhaps be trailing in the dust!" [...] Freeman Henry Morris Murray ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, very well. Tell Bridget to say I'll {{go up and}} see Miss Anne presently. You can use <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> {{quite well}} now, Arthur," [...] Mr. Irwine continued, observing that Captain Donnithorne had taken his arm out of the sling.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not as anything," [...] ses Silas; [...] "not {{even over}} Christmas pudding. Raise <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> above your 'ead and swear by {{the ghost of}} pore Silas Winch, as is laying {{at the bottom of}} the Pacific Ocean, that you won't touch another drop." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "While I was {{recovering}} {{you from your}} faint, that man over there informed me that you were his Colonel; that you 'fit like a tiger,' and when <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> was disabled, you took your sword in the left and cheered them on as if you 'were bound to beat the whole rebel army.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|... 2) Lift <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand {{high over}} head, Elbows {{slightly}} bent, palms facing forward towards your partner. Lift the right knee forward and bent, about hip height {{and as you}} bring the <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> down alongside it with the chest also coming forward. The movement should be vigorous and strongly accented like the 2nd count of the Jerk.|$|R
5000|$|In 624, {{when there}} was an ongoing rivalry between Li Shimin and his eldest brother, Li Jiancheng (the Crown Prince), over the {{succession}} to their father's throne, Li Jiancheng became very suspicious and distrustful of Cheng Yaojin. Emperor Gaozu appointed Cheng Yaojin as the Prefect of Kang Prefecture (康州; around present-day Zhaoqing, Guangdong), effectively sending him {{far away from the}} capital, Chang'an (present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi). Cheng Yaojin told Li Shimin, [...] "Great Prince, if you lose <b>your</b> left and <b>right</b> <b>arms,</b> you will not survive long. I will not leave you, even if it means I will die." [...] On 2 July 626, Cheng Yaojin joined Li Shimin in assassinating Li Jiancheng and his fourth brother, Li Yuanji (the Prince of Qi), at the Xuanwu Gate Incident, after which Li Shimin became the new Crown Prince. He was appointed as a [...] "Right Guard Commander to the Crown Prince" [...] (太子右衛率) and subsequently promoted to [...] "Right Martial Guard Senior General" [...] (右武衛大將軍) and awarded 700 taxable households in his dukedom.|$|R

6000|$|Some {{news that}} Mataafa is gone to Savaii {{by way of}} Manono; this may mean {{a great deal more}} warfaring, and no great issue. (When Sosimo came in this morning with my breakfast he had to lift me up. It is no joke to play lawn tennis after {{carrying}} <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> in a sling so many years.) [...] What a hard, unjust business this is! On the 28th, if Mataafa had moved, he could have still swept Mulinuu. He waited, and I fear he is now only the stick of a rocket.|$|E
6000|$|But Leo chanced to be, in a sense, doubly armed. During {{one of his}} holiday rambles in England he {{had visited}} Cornwall, and there had learned that celebrated [...] "throw" [...] which {{consists}} in making your haunch a fulcrum, <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> a lever, and your adversary a shuttlecock. He suddenly grasped his foe round the waist with one arm. Next moment the Grabantaks saw what the most imaginative among them had never till then conceived of--Koyatuk's soles turned to the sky, and his head pointing to the ground! The moment following, he lay {{flat on his back}} looking upwards blankly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do call {{things by}} their proper names," [...] {{interrupted}} Bickley. [...] "I told you yesterday {{that what you}} are suffering from is neuritis in <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm,</b> which will become chronic if you neglect it much longer. I have the same thing myself, so I ought to know, and unless I can stop operating for a while I believe my fingers will become useless. Also something is affecting my sight, overstrain, I suppose, so that I am obliged to wear stronger and stronger glasses. I think I shall have to leave Ogden" [...] (his partner) [...] "in charge for a while, and get away into the sun. There is none here before June." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a rapid {{piece of}} exposition, we learn Gladys {{has been in}} New York City for two years, coming from {{a job at a}} shoe factory in Binghamton, New York. She has just lost her job as a model of girdles, because her hip size is 3/4" [...] larger than it should be, and still has the $1000, which she [...] "saved up." [...] Gladys is {{discouraged}} at having gotten nowhere in two years and she wants {{to make a name for}} herself. It is clear Pete is taken by Gladys. He gets her address by offering to drop her a postcard when the documentary is finished so she can see herself in it. [...] "Really?" [...] she says, [...] "I'd give my <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> to see myself in the movies." [...] "You don't need to give me <b>your</b> <b>right</b> arm," [...] says Pete, [...] "just give me <b>your</b> <b>right</b> address." [...] Pete encourages Gladys to follow her dreams: [...] "Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a way there is a will." [...] The two then part ways.|$|R

6000|$|... 'How can {{you think}} of such trifles as churchgoing at such a time as this, when your own native country is on the point of invasion?' said the {{sergeant}} sternly. 'And, as you know, the drill ends three minutes afore church begins, and that's the law, and it wants {{a quarter of an hour}} yet. Now, at the word Prime, shake the powder (supposing you've got it) into the priming-pan, three last fingers behind the rammer; then shut your pans, drawing <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> nimble-like towards your body. I ought to have told ye before this, that at Hand your katridge, seize it and bring it with a quick motion to your mouth, bite the top well off, and don't swaller so much of the powder as to make ye hawk and spet instead of attending to your drill.

6000|$|But I {{am writing}} {{you in the}} key of mere lamentation--which I didn't mean to do. Strange as it may seem, {{there are times when}} I am much uplifted--when what may come out of it all seems almost worth it. And then the black {{nightmare}} holds the field again--and in fact one proceeds almost wholly by those restless alternations. They consume one's vital substance, but one will perhaps wear them out first. It touches me deeply that you should speak tenderly of dear old London, for which my own affection in these months s'est accrue a thousandfold--just as the same has taken place in my attachment for all these so very preponderantly decent and solid people. The race is worth fighting for, immensely--in fact I don't know any other for whom it can so much be said.... Well, go on working and feeling and believing for me, dear Lily, and God uphold <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> and carry far your voice. Think of me too as your poor old aching and yet not altogether collapsing, your in fact quite clinging, ...|$|E

5000|$|Australia, Denmark: Extend <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> vertically, with palm facing forward, or {{extend your}} right upper arm {{out to the}} right {{horizontally}} and make your forearm vertical with your palm facing forward (as depicted in the US right turn signal above).|$|E

5000|$|Where RM is the righting moment, GZ is the <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> and [...] is the {{displacement}}. Because {{the vessel}} displacement is constant, common practice {{is to simply}} graph the <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> vs the angle of heel. The <b>righting</b> <b>arm</b> (known also as GZ — see diagram): the horizontal distance between the lines of buoyancy and gravity.|$|R
50|$|Use Your Attacker's Force {{against him}} Take {{advantage}} of the force your opponent gives you. If an opponent pulls you toward him, use that energy {{as part of your}} attack. Or if an opponent pushes the left side of your body, you can act as a revolving door and use that force in an attack with <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E
50|$|When {{you do a}} Herkie, the arm {{positions}} {{depend on}} how your legs are. If you were to do a left Herkie, then your left arm would be straight up in a High V motion, and <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> would be on your hip. If your were doing a right Herkie, {{it would be the}} opposite.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, on hip throws, some systems grab {{around the}} waist (or in ignorance, the belt), and some systems prefer to wrap tori’s right arm under the uke's left. One should never grip the opponent’s belt; modern attire may not include a belt. In fact, {{grabbing}} the belt is not necessary. Simply grabbing {{around the waist}} (so long as the grip is {{all the way around}} the waist) works better anyway. One should note that it feels easier to grab your opponent’s waist with <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> than it does wrapping <b>your</b> <b>right</b> <b>arm</b> around their left arm. Biomechanically, grabbing the opponent higher up the back (such as at the shoulder) can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult. The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is: block, parry or deflect the opponent's punch if necessary, effect kuzushi, bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip.|$|E
50|$|<b>Your</b> <b>right</b> hand, + Lord, is made glorious in might; <b>your</b> <b>right</b> hand, Lord, has {{crushed the}} enemies; {{and in the}} {{fullness}} of your glory, You have routed the adversary.|$|R
