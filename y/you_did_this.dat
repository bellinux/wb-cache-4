But Davros learns too late that Dalek Caan, {{who came to the}} realisation of his race's atrocities as a consequence of saving his creator, used his prophecies and influence to ensure the Daleks' destruction while manipulating events to bring the Tenth Doctor and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) together for the role the latter would play. Though the Doctor attempts to save him, having earlier taunted the Doctor for turning his companions into killers and being the cause of the deaths of countless people during his travels, Davros furiously refuses the Doctor's help and accuses him of being responsible for the destruction while screaming: [...] "Never forget, Doctor, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>this!</b> I name you forever: You are the Destroyer of Worlds!" [...] Thus the Doctor is forced to leave Davros to his fate as the Crucible self-destructs.|$|E
