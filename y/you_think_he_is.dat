500|$|Hopps, who had {{previously}} written for animated series such as Buzz Lightyear of Star Command, Justice League, and Darkwing Duck, researched for the episode by re-reading every available comic book that featured Green Goblin. Hopps notes that [...] "you might consider him [...] crazed, but he's truly brilliant and has thought things out far in advance. He's always several steps ahead of where <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is.</b> So while I'm writing Goblin, I'm always trying {{to keep in mind}} where he's going next." [...] While penning the fight sequence between Goblin and Spider-Man, Hopps paid close attention to brawls detailed in [...] "Catalysts" [...] in order to better grasp [...] "how we could make it different and really up the stakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|No, Cinderella, {{you were}} human, that is all. The artist, {{shivering}} in his conventional attic, dreaming of Fame!-do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not hoping she {{will come to}} his loving arms in the form Jove came to Danae? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not reckoning also upon the good dinners and the big cigars, the fur coat and the diamond studs, that her visits will enable him to purchase? ...|$|E
6000|$|Morris {{shook his}} head, though {{it must be}} confessed {{he was a little}} struck with this idea. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> so sentimental?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{satisfied}} with the grounds we gave for stopping? I mean, do you imagine he believes we merely want to trade?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Alf: So, try {{to avoid}} {{interpreting}} what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying [Alf laughs] try and stay with [1] so, {{what did you hear}} him say? [...]...|$|R
60|$|But it's very important. I {{know that}} you are a {{perfectly}} honest and upright man. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> guilty, there is nothing more to be said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Maggie! As if any {{one could}} tremble at me! <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> conceited, I see that. But you don't dislike him, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! true; who the deuce {{can this}} Colonel be then, for young Jarvis {{is only a}} captain, I know; who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> Jane?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! And {{where do}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is?</b> At Darminster--editing a paper there. It {{is called the}} Darminster Politician. He said he sent a copy here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing it, so much, for me. To what extent," [...] she {{suddenly}} asked of her friend, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{aware that she}} knew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you haven't told {{us about}} the brave things you did," [...] cooed Mrs. Arty. She appealed to Nelly Croubel: [...] "I'll bet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a cool one. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> Nelly?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Owen," [...] {{answered}} his wife, with beautiful candor, [...] "it was." [...] Seeing that he remained unaffected by her display of this virtue, she added, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very handsome?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How many of {{his bones}} are there not broken, I wonder?" [...] said the father. [...] "It is useless to talk, of course. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not in danger?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, he {{certainly}} is great in that feature, one is obliged to admit it; but--now mind, I'm not really criticising--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> just a trifle overstrong in technique?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Chloe," [...] I said, as we {{proceeded}} together, [...] "how do {{you find}} Neb? Does he improve by this running about on the ocean--especially do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> tanned?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I know." [...] Then {{he would}} remain lost in thought, softly {{whistling}} to himself. On {{one of these}} occasions he asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> really very much troubled by his false position?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I know. But {{for a man}} who {{had lived}} in doubt so many years, he {{certainly}} slipped back into the bosom of mother church pretty suddenly. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a person of rather light feelings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ran, did he? H'm! Well, it's {{considerably}} {{later than}} his usual {{time to go}} home to his Alfuro wife; but to be seen running is a sort of degradation for Wang, who has mastered the art of vanishing. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> startled out of his perfection by something?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't for {{a moment}} think, dearest, that what he said, made me uneasy as {{regarded}} you: but whom {{do you think he}} selected for you--of whom do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> jealous?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad Herbert has {{got away}} from {{business}} for a few days," [...] she began. [...] "He works too hard, and it's telling on him. How do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> looking?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Whose child do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> then?" [...] said John, {{who had a}} cup {{of water}} in his hand, for the chase after Martin had made him hot, and he wanted cooling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see he's {{giving you}} a long rope," [...] said the Captain. [...] "But that can't change a man's convictions. I know the Author respects me; I feel it in my bones: when you and I had that talk at the {{blockhouse}} door, who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> for, my man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|After this {{dismissal}} had dispersed the on-lookers, Lawson {{turned to}} Curtis. [...] "The old man's {{work as a}} speaker is done. Rather tragic business, don't <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> assailing <b>you</b> with the utmost bitterness. His big, right fist {{was in the air}} like a hammer when he fell; but it was his last effort." ...|$|R
5000|$|Penses-tu quil soit sympa? (subjunctive) [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> nice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be true--whoever you are--but if Lawson's the man <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> he'll begin thet secret {{underground}} bizness. Why, Lawson won't {{sleep of}} nights now. He an' Longstreth {{have always been}} after me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr Crich can't see you. He can't {{see you at}} this hour. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> your property, {{that you}} can come {{whenever}} you like? You must go away, there is nothing for you here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would see}} through {{that in an}} instant. And if he is still the false {{creature}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> we owe him the truth, {{more than any other}} kind of man. You must understand that, Basil!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she doesn't. Mamma isn't {{afraid of}} anything. That's why she lets me play out here alone when I want. Why, {{we had a}} robber once. Mamma got right up and found him. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and {{afterward}} she got him work to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the pullin' of that punk graft {{that got}} my goat," [...] replied The General. [...] "I {{never seen a}} punk yet that didn't try to make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a wise guy an' dis stiff don't belong enough even to pull a spiel that would fool a old ladies' sewin' circle. I don't see wot The Sky Pilot's cozyin' up to him fer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good fellow, Strong--ain't he, Miss Bell?" [...] Sir Francis {{would say}} to her. [...] "Plays at ecarte with Lady Clavering--plays anything, pitch-and-toss, pianoforty, cwibbage if you like. How long do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> staying with me? He came for a week with a carpet-bag, and Gad, <b>he's</b> <b>been</b> staying here thwee years. Good fellow, ain't he? Don't know how he gets a shillin' though, begad I don't, Miss Lauwa." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> very pleasant?" [...] Kate Theory asked, {{turning away}} her face from her sister. It was {{important}} that Mildred should not see how little the expression of that charming countenance corresponded with the inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hopeful? Do you think he expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{up to my}} weight?" [...] Jos said. He {{was already}} on his back, in imagination, without ever {{so much as a}} thought for poor Amelia. What person who loved a horse-speculation could resist such a temptation? ...|$|E
60|$|One jump! Would <b>he</b> <b>be</b> able {{to reach}} it? Two jumps! There was a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened squeak, Danny dived into the opening just in time. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown's boy had once used to carry bait in when he went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He had dropped it there on his way home.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} broken his heart for ever," [...] said Sydney, [...] "if {{he had not}} tried to do his utmost for Jock. He says Jock {{has been more than}} a brother to him, and that he owes all that <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> and all that he has, to him and Mother Carey, and that even-—if-—if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> too late, <b>he</b> should save her from coming home alone. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right, mamma?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Half an {{hour after}} midnight. Till {{then we have to}} depend on you, Mr. Razumov. <b>You</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> likely to change his purpose?" ...|$|R
