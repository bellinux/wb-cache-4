30|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to predict the physical, {{mechanical}} and comfort properties of woven, non-woven and knitted fabrics using various prediction tools. Most of the work is focused on modelling the fibre-yarn relationship, yarn tenacity, fault detection, compression, elastic properties and hand values of woven, nonwoven and knitted fabrics. Although some studies have discussed prediction of thermal properties i.e. thermal resistance, thermal conductivity of woven and knitted fabrics, none of the studies give a detailed review of the modelling of comfort properties particularly thermal absorptivity and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated knitted fabrics. Moreover, very few studies are devoted to the prediction of thermo-physiological properties: thermal properties, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate collectively. An attempt is therefore made to model the thermo-physiological properties of plated knitted fabrics from constructional parameters like back <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density,</b> filament fineness, loop length and total <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> using statistical and artificial neural network approach and comparison of the developed models in terms of their prediction performance and robustness.|$|E

30|$|The {{predicted}} thermo-physiological {{properties of}} plated fabrics by ANN were {{in close agreement with}} target outputs (experimental values) which proves the robustness and generalization {{ability of the}} network. However, the mean absolute percentage error in the prediction of air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate of plated fabrics were on slightly higher side. The input parameters selected for the network construction namely back layer <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density,</b> filament fineness, loop length and total <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> influence the fabrics bulk properties like thickness, fabric weight which are the determinants of thermal properties. The selected input parameters were found to be sufficient for prediction of thermal properties. However, air permeability depends on the openness of the fabric structure or the free inter yarn spaces in the fabric and hence fabric porosity. The exclusion of porosity as one of the input parameters might be the reason for high mean absolute percentage error in prediction of air permeability. Moisture vapour transmission rate through fabrics depend on free air spaces in the fabric for moisture diffusion and moisture diffusivity of the fibres. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic nature of the fibre can affect the moisture diffusion through textiles significantly. The inclusion of constituent fibres as one of the input parameter to neural network may result in lowering the error percentage in prediction of moisture vapour transmission rate.|$|E

UV-C radiation get absorbed by atmosphere, but diminishing of the ozone layer results with the reaching of UV-B and UV-A rays on the Earths surface. Even though the UV-A rays are necessary for vitamin D synthesis, longer exposure to UV-A and UV-B rays can cause acute and chronic reactions and damages such as erythema (sunburn), sun tanning, photocarcinogenesis and photoaging, as well as known skin aging and recently the formation of skin malignant neoplasm. Garment provides some UV protection, but in most cases there are not enough its sun screening properties.

A number of prediction tools like mechanistic, statistical and stochastic (artificial neural network) models are finding application in textiles for reasonable prediction of various aspects of textiles before the actual commencement of fabric production and testing. In this study, thermo-physiological {{properties of}} polyester–cotton plated fabrics were predicted by two approaches: artificial neural network and response surface equations. A multilayered back propagation artificial neural network was developed with four input nodes corresponding to four selected input parameters: back layer <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density,</b> filament fineness, total <b>yarn</b> <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> and loop length and one output node corresponding to the predicted thermo-physiological property. Four individual networks working in tandem with common set of input parameters and each giving an individual output were developed such that the outputs of four networks were thermal resistance, thermal absorptivity, air permeability and moisture vapour transmission rate respectively. Network architecture gave good prediction performance with low values of mean absolute percentage error and high coefficient of determination. Response surface equations were developed to predict the thermo-physiological properties and good agreement between experimental and predicted values for all the properties was found with coefficient of determination over 0.9. Artificial neural network predicted the thermal resistance and air permeability of plated fabrics with good accuracy.

40|$|During yarn {{formation}} by ring spinning, fibres {{are bent}} into approximately helical shapes and torque or twist-liveliness is created. The yarn torque causes yarn instability, manifested as snarling or entanglements, and this instability must be controlled during manufacturing processes. Generally, the torque depends on yarn geometric {{factors such as}} the <b>yarn</b> twist, <b>linear</b> <b>density</b> and the fibre properties. A practical {{solution to the problem of}} twist-liveliness is the formation of a two-fold yarn. This twisting or plying process produces a yarn structure where the energy of the system is determined by purely geometrical constraints of the plied structure and consequently when an energy minimum is reached the plied yarn obtained from the process is torsionally balanced and torque-free. In the present paper, the stability of plied textile yarns will be evaluated using the Topological Conservation law (Fuller, F. B., 1971, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 68, 815 – 819.) developed to study the post-buckling behaviour of twisted rods by Van der Heijden et al. (Int. J. Mech. Sci., 45, 161 – 196, 2003).

40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} {{over the years that}} yarn tension during high speed over-end unwinding from a helically wound stationary package is highly non <b>linear</b> (1). Each <b>yarn</b> element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the <b>yarn</b> tension are <b>linear</b> <b>yarn</b> <b>density,</b> unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn unwinding tension. On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model. This will invariably affect the uniform unwinding tension, which also improves the quality of subsequent processes such as warping, sizing, pirn winding and processes associated with package dyeing...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of through-the-thickness stitching on impact damage resistance, impact damage tolerance, and mode I and mode II fracture toughness of textile graphite/epoxy laminates. Uniweave resin-transfer-molded 48 ply graphite/epoxy (AS 4 / 3501 - 6) laminates were stitched with Kevlar and glass <b>yarns</b> of different <b>linear</b> <b>densities</b> and stitch spacings. Delaminations were implanted during processing to simulate impact damage. Sublaminate buckling tests were performed {{to determine the effects}} of stitching on the compressive strength. The results showed outstanding improvements of up to 400 percent in the compression strength over the unstitched laminates. In impact and static indentation tests the onset of damage occurred at the same level, but the extent of damage was less in stitched laminates. Mode I fracture toughness of 24 ply Uniweave unidirectional (AS 4 / 3501 - 6) stitched laminates was measured by conducting double-cantilever-beam tests. The critical strain energy release rate (G(sub Ic)) was found to be up to 30 times higher than the unstitched laminates. Mode II fracture toughness of the Uniweave laminates was measured by performing end-notched-flexure tests. Two new methods to compute the apparent G(sub IIc) are presented. The apparent G(sub IIc) was found to be at least 5 - 15 times higher for the stitched laminates...|$|R
