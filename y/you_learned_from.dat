The short version of the ETLQ is a self-completion instrument that consists of 49 items divided into five sections: 1. Approaches to learning and studying, which contains 15 items measuring the use of a deep approach, a surface approach, monitoring studying, and organized studying; 2. Experiences of teaching and learning, which contains 15 items measuring six aspects of the experience of a particular course unit; 3. Demands made by the course unit (10 items); 4. What <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> this course unit (8 items); and 5. How well you have done in the course unit (1 item). In the first two sections, response options are presented on a 5 -point scale from “agree” to “disagree. ” In the third section, response options are presented on a 5 -point scale from “very easy” to “very difficult. ” In the fourth section, response options are presented on a 5 -point scale from “a lot” to “very little”. The final item uses a 9 -point scale from “very well” to “rather badly. ” Mean scale scores can be calculated. The short version demonstrates satisfactory internal consistency and satisfactory construct validity according to exploratory factor analyses of the first two sections of the questionnaire. Evidence has also been obtained of an association between students’ perceptions and their approaches to studying. The short version of the ETLQ can be recommended for use in health sciences education, provided that it is revalidated for use in each new context. An adaptation of the ETLQ can be recommended for evaluating entire programs of study...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Development Studies, 2007. Cataloged from PDF version of dissertation. Includes bibliographical references (page 62 - 66). Since the 1970 s, evidence that local knowledge and practices can help implementing organisations to improve disaster preparedness activities has grown; notwithstanding this evidence, the marginalisation of local knowledge and practices by mainstream literature and institutions involved with disaster management continues. A local knowledge system is composed of different knowledge types, practices and beliefs, values, and worldviews. Such systems change constantly {{under the influence of}} power relations and cross-scale linkages both within and outside the community. As such, local knowledge and practices need to be understood as adaptive responses to internal and external changes which result (or not) in disaster preparedness at local level. In order to identify local knowledge on disaster preparedness, one should locus on tour key aspects: people's ability to observe their local surroundings, people's anticipation of environmental indicators, people's adaptation strategies. and people's ability to communicate about natural disasters within the community and between generations. Overall, the ability a community has to prepare itself for disaster preparedness needs to be understood within the broader context of livelihood security and sustainability and building up community resilience in the long term. I went to Kurigrarn to gather knowledge on the topic of my dissertation. After deciding my dissertation topic as 'Indigenous knowledge & disaster preparedness in char area of Bangladesh' I have already gone though few references, books, journals and periodicals. To understand more I have also gone through internet sites also. With the help of my respected supervisor and few other colleagues I have also talked with some knowledgeable persons who have been working in this field of indigenous knowledge & disaster preparedness. I have also talked with few people who have work experiences in char land, environment and climate change projects. There has been a big difference of understanding between the theories <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> books and works you do in the field in reality. If a researcher wants to dig through his/her research question to get the most accurate and true result, {{there is no other way}} to get it better than going to the field of reality. That is why my supervisor told me to go to the field as soon as possible to have field research.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2005. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 47). iii, 47 leaves, bound 29 cmThe University of Hawai'i at Manoa Dance Program {{is producing}} dancers {{that are making}} a difference in the professional world of dance on O'ahu and the mainland. I selected five alumni/ae pursuing careers in dance who had completed their MFA degrees at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa (hereafter UHM). I interviewed each of them over the telephone and via e-mail using a list of questions I created to question how their degrees relate to the positions they now hold. Each dancer graduated with an MFA degree in the past twenty years and continued to either dance professionally, teach at an educational institute, or both. I also interviewed four current MFA students in the Dance Program and asked them to share their personal aspirations and their hopes for the UHM Dance Program. Additionally, I selected three local modern dance companies that have ties to UHM through their dancers. I asked each Artistic Director how the University of Hawai'i Dance Program affects their company. My goal was to find how UHM is affecting graduate alumni/ae, present MFA candidates, and Artistic Directors of local companies. In what way did each dancer take what they learned at UHM and apply it to their everyday professional and personal lives? I am pursuing my MA degree at the University of Hawai'i. I started studying modern dance during my undergraduate time at UHM from 2000 - 2001, and obtained a minor in dance. I fell in love with modern dance, and decided to pursue a graduate degree. This research is relevant and interesting to me as it shows how a UHM dance degree affects other's in their lives, both personal and professional. I wanted to find how these alumni/ae were able to incorporate their passion for dance into a career, and how the university helped to contribute to the vitality of dance in the O'ahu community and on the mainland. In interviews I posed the same questions for each alumni/ae and current dancer at UHM. These questions were: Where did you study dance before attending UHM? Did you perform professionally? Which dance styles do you associate the most with? Why did you chose UHM for your MFA? When did you attend UHM? Do you feel UHM made a positive influence on you? Who were your greatest influences at UHM? Did UHM push you further than expected or hoped on a physical or mental level? Where do you teach dance? Where have you taught since graduating from UHM? Do you teach your students what <b>you</b> <b>learned</b> <b>from</b> UHM? How does UHM compare to the school you are employed by? Do you reflect back on your degree and time spent at UHM and how? Looking back, would you go to UHM and do it allover again? Would you recommend UHM to others? What do you think are UHM's strengths and weaknesses? Do you think local modern dance can survive on O'ahu without UHM? And I asked each subject to list anything they would like to add that I might have missed. My purpose was to find out if these dancers applied what they learned while obtaining their UHM degree in their current career. I wondered what the current degree candidates were hoping to achieve by completing their MFA degree from UHM. At the beginning of my interview process with the alumni/ae, I did not know if they used their UHM schooling or not. Were these former UHM dancers applying specific lessons gained during their degree pursuits? To what extent do they credit UHM for where they are with dance today? While wanting to discover if the UHM Dance Program is contributing to the vitality of local dance, I wanted to find if it contributes to the evolution of this artistic discipline locally. I believe my role in the process of interviewing the heads of current O'ahu dance companies is to be a facilitator of dialogue about dance and find insights for current and future students about the long term contributions of the UHM Dance Program for its graduates' careers in the local community and beyond as a performer and choreographer. A larger inferred question that my research analyzes is: Can local modern dance survive without the university...|$|E
