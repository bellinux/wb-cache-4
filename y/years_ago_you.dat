500|$|In {{addition}} to {{stepping out of}} the Jackson family shadow, Control established Jackson as one of the preeminent female artists of popular music, rivaling fellow pop star Madonna, as critics began to acknowledge their influence on the record industry and younger artists. Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8: Genres: North America (2012) documents that both women redefined house music, repackaging it [...] "as part of a global metropolitan pop aesthetic." [...] With regard to marketing singles, Paul Grein of Billboard reported: [...] "10 or 20 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>you</b> would have had two singles from an album at the most. Now we're in an era where Madonna is on her fifth single from the album True Blue and Janet Jackson is on her sixth from the LP Control." [...] Jackson subsequently became the first female artist to produce six top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 from a single album. Los Angeles Times writer Paul Grein wrote a segment titled [...] "The influence of Madonna and Janet Jackson", reporting Debbie Gibson's manager Doug Breitbart claimed [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music", while Teen Beat editor Maggie Murphy remarked [...] "Janet Jackson may have started this more than anyone else." [...] Anthony DeCurtis, author of Present Tense: Rock & Roll and Culture (1992) wrote that [...] "Madonna and Janet Jackson have produced videos that explore the female gaze," [...] and described Jackson's music video for [...] "Nasty" [...] as feminist theory on film that deconstructs the objectification of women. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) documented that within two years of the release of Control, [...] "a new crop of female singers (such as Paula Abdul and Karyn White) were charged with imitating Janet." [...] Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Control—with its quintuple-platinum sales and string of hit singles—established" [...] a then-twenty-year-old Jackson [...] "as {{one of the most popular}} recording artists in the world." [...] The Guardian described the album's release as one of the 50 key events in the history of R and hip hop.|$|E

[...] Boxing hall-of-famer Sugar Ray Leonard was an adviser for these scenes and gave Jackman boxing lessons so his moves would be more natural.|$|E
