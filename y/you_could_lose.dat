500|$|Leading Marine officers, however, {{were not}} all of the same opinion. Cushman, the new III MAF commander, {{supported}} Westmoreland (perhaps wanting to mend Army/Marine relations after the departure of Walt). Other concerns raised included the assertion that the real danger to I Corps was from a direct threat to Quang Tri City and other urban areas; that a defense would be pointless as a threat to infiltration, since NVA troops could easily bypass Khe Sanh; that the base was too isolated and that the Marines [...] "had neither the helicopter resources, the troops, nor the logistical bases for such operations". Additionally, Shore argues that the [...] "weather was another critical factor because the poor visibility and low overcasts attendant to the monsoon season made such operations hazardous." [...] Brigadier General Lowell English (assistant commander 3rd Marine Division) complained that the defense of the isolated outpost was ludicrous. [...] "When you're at Khe Sanh, you're not really anywhere. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>lose</b> it and you really haven't lost a damn thing." ...|$|E

50|$|Various {{repeaters}} (hubs) may use {{slightly different}} implementations and operate differently. Each repeater would lose {{more or less}} bits while locking on, some <b>could</b> <b>lose</b> as many as 5 or 6 bits. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> create a network with more repeaters if you made sure {{the total number of}} lost preamble bits wouldn't exceed the requirements of the receiving hardware and collisions would not pose a problem.

Jasek's father travelled a lot and the secret police coerced him into becoming a spy for the communist regime.

50|$|Economists and {{advertising}} analysts note that should a company {{need to increase}} {{the price of a}} product beyond the threshold price-point, it should only be done in small amounts. If a candy bar originally cost $1.99, then there is apparently little difference in making the new price $2.05 or even $2.25. The logic behind the move is that while some potential buyers will be lost by the increase in price beyond the threshold, those that stay will not notice the difference in prices between thresholds. Buyers do not make judgement calls on a per-cent basis, so will not differentiate between $2.05 and $2.06. However, they do differentiate at thresholds. So while you wouldn't necessarily lose a buyer jumping from $2.05 and $2.06, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>lose</b> one going from $1.99 to $2.00. Therefore companies can actually increase overall profit despite losing customers by increasing the revenue per buyer significantly.|$|E
5000|$|Before, he {{had fought}} against the money code, and yet he had clung to his wretched remnant of decency. But now it was {{precisely}} from decency {{that he wanted to}} escape. He wanted to go down, deep down, into some world where decency no longer mattered; to cut the strings of his self-respect, to submerge himself—to sink, as Rosemary had said. It was all bound up in his mind with the thought of being under ground. He liked to think of the lost people, the under-ground people: tramps, beggars, criminals, prostitutes... He liked to think that beneath the world of money there is that great sluttish underworld where failure and success have no meaning; a sort of kingdom of ghosts where all are equal ... It comforted him somehow to think of the smoke-dim slums of South London sprawling on and on, a huge graceless wilderness where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>lose</b> yourself forever.|$|E
