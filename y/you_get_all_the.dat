Linehan also said that, being a special event, the musical would {{need to focus on}} a [...] "world-shaking" [...] story, possibly with Ted becoming Pope due to [...] "some weird succession thing". In June, Linehan said that he hoped The Divine Comedy frontman Neil Hannon, who wrote the show's music, would return to compose the songs.|$|E

That's the way to live in New York--to move every three or four years. Then you always get the last thing. It's because the city's growing so quick--you've got to keep up with it. It's going {{straight}} up town--that's where New York's going. If I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there--right up to the top--and wait for it. Only have to wait ten years--they'd all come up after you. But Marian says she wants some neighbours--she doesn't want to be a pioneer. She says that if she's got to be the first settler she had better go out to Minnesota. I guess we'll move up little by little; when we get tired of one street we'll go higher.

60|$|Not so. Everything in {{the field}} of sight is equally puzzling, and can only be drawn rightly on the same {{difficult}} conditions. Try it fairly. Take the commonest, closest, most familiar thing, and strive to draw it verily as you see it. Be sure of this last fact, for otherwise you will find yourself continually drawing, not what you see, but what you know. The best practice to begin with is, sitting about three yards, from a bookcase (not your own, so that you may know none of the titles of the books), to try to draw the books accurately, with the titles on the backs, and patterns on the bindings, as you see them. You are not to stir from your place to look what they are, but to draw them simply as they appear, giving the perfect look of neat lettering; which, nevertheless, must be (as you find it on most of the books) absolutely illegible. Next try to draw a piece of patterned muslin or lace (of which you do not know the pattern), a little way off, and rather in the shade; and be sure <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> grace and look of the pattern without going a step nearer to see what it is. Then try to draw a bank of grass, with all its blades; or a bush, with all its leaves; and you will soon begin to understand under what a universal law of obscurity we live, and perceive that all distinct drawing must be bad drawing, and that nothing can be right, till it is unintelligible.|$|E
