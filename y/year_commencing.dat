25|$|This updated and {{improved}} version was the Model B200, which entered production in 1981. It was fitted with PT6A-42 engines, still rated at , but with improvements {{that resulted in}} greater aircraft performance. Other changes included increased maximum pressurization (to 6.5 psi differential) and changes to the cockpit layout. The Model 200C {{gave way to the}} Model B200C the same year, with the first Model B200T and Model B200CT being modified from a B200 and B200C respectively, the following <b>year.</b> <b>Commencing</b> in 1984 the B200, B200C and their derivatives were fitted with a revised landing gear retraction mechanism, actuated by hydraulic rams powered by an electric pump installed in the LH wing. This replaced the earlier electro-mechanical retraction system of gearboxes, driveshafts and chains and sprockets that was a throwback to the Twin Bonanza. At the same time the propellers fitted were changed from 3-bladed Hartzells to 3-bladed McCauleys. Forty-seven B200Cs built that year were delivered to the U.S. military, with dozens more of a similar standard ordered in subsequent years, but not given official civil model designations.|$|E

60|$|In Pennsylvania the General Assembly, as {{the joint}} {{legislature}} is called, sits every <b>year,</b> <b>commencing</b> their work early in January, and continuing till it be finished. The usual period of sitting {{seems to be}} about ten weeks. In the majority of States, the legislature only sits every other year. In this State it sits every year, and the Representatives are elected annually. The Senators are elected for three years, {{a third of the}} body being chosen each year. The two chambers were ugly, convenient rooms, arranged very much after the fashion of the halls of Congress at Washington. Each member had his own desk and his own chair. They were placed {{in the shape of a}} horseshoe, facing the chairman, before whom sat three clerks. In neither house did I hear any set speech. The voices of the Speaker and of the Clerks of the Houses were heard more frequently than those of the members; and the business seemed to be done in a dull, serviceable, methodical manner, likely to be useful to the country, and very uninteresting to the gentlemen engaged. Indeed at Washington also, in Congress, it seemed to me that there was much less of set speeches than in our House of Commons. With us there are certain men whom it seems impossible to put down, and by whom the time of Parliament is occupied from night to night, with advantage to no one and with satisfaction to none but themselves. I do not think that the evil prevails to the same extent in America, either in Congress or in the State legislatures. As regards Washington, this good result may be assisted by a salutary practice which, as I was assured, prevails there. A member gets his speech printed at the government cost, and sends it down free by post to his constituents, without troubling either the House with hearing it or himself with speaking it. I cannot but think that the practice might be copied with success on our side of the water.|$|E
