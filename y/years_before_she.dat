5|$|HMS Dreadnought was an ironclad turret ship {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1870s.

The ship returned to Norway in mid-1943 where she escorted German capital ships as they moved between Norway and Germany and participated in the German attack (Operation Zitronella) on the Norwegian island of Spitzbergen, well north of the Arctic Circle. Steinbrinck was ordered home in November to begin a lengthy refit, during which she was badly damaged by Allied bombs, and was unserviceable {{for the rest of}} the war.

She was thereafter interned at Malta until 1944, when the Allies permitted her return to Italian waters. She survived the war, and continued to serve in the post-war Italian navy, primarily as a training ship. Caio Duilio was placed in reserve for a final time in 1953; she remained in the Italian navy's inventory for another three <b>years</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> was stricken from the naval register in late 1956 and sold for scrapping the following year.|$|E
