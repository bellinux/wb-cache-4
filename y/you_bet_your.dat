5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, Which Way to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life debuted on TV on October 5, 1950, Groucho had grown a real {{mustache}} (which {{he had already}} sported earlier in the films Copacabana and Love Happy).|$|E
25|$|He made 13 {{feature films}} with his {{siblings}} the Marx Brothers (Harpo Marx and Chico Marx), {{of whom he}} was the third-born. He also had a successful solo career, most notably as {{the host of the}} radio and television game show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life.|$|E
25|$|From the 1940s onward Chico and Harpo {{appeared}} {{separately and}} together in nightclubs and casinos. Chico fronted a big band, the Chico Marx Orchestra (with 17-year-old Mel Tormé as a vocalist). Groucho made several radio appearances during the 1940s {{and starred in}} <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life, which ran from 1947 to 1961 on NBC radio and television. He authored several books, including Groucho and Me (1959), Memoirs of a Mangy Lover (1964) and The Groucho Letters (1967).|$|E

25|$|Marx {{was asked}} to apply the greasepaint {{mustache}} once more for <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life {{when it came to}} television, but he refused, opting instead to grow a real one, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life. By this time, his eyesight had weakened enough for him actually to need corrective lenses; before then, his eyeglasses had merely been a stage prop. He debuted this new, and now much-older, appearance in Love Happy, the Marx Brothers's last film as a comedy team.|$|E
500|$|Although the Mattachine Society {{had existed}} since the 1950s, {{many of their}} methods now seemed too mild for people who had {{witnessed}} or been inspired by the riots. Mattachine recognized the shift in attitudes in a story from their newsletter entitled, [...] "The Hairpin Drop Heard Around the World." [...] When a Mattachine officer suggested an [...] "amicable and sweet" [...] candlelight vigil demonstration, {{a man in the}} audience fumed and shouted, [...] "Sweet! Bullshit! That's the role society has been forcing these queens to play." [...] With a flyer announcing: [...] "Do You Think Homosexuals Are Revolting? <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Sweet Ass We Are!", the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) was soon formed, the first gay organization to use [...] "gay" [...] in its name. Previous organizations such as the Mattachine Society, the Daughters of Bilitis, and various homophile groups had masked their purpose by deliberately choosing obscure names.|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, [...] Groucho {{starred in}} a weekly show for British TV titled Groucho, [...] {{broadcast}} on ITV. The program was along similar lines to <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life, with Keith Fordyce {{taking on the}} Fenneman role. However, it was poorly received and lasted only 11 weeks.|$|E

2500|$|<b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life {{debuted in}} October 1947 on ABC radio (which aired it from 1947 to 1949), {{sponsored}} by costume jewelry manufacturer Allen Gellman; {{and then on}} CBS (1949–50), and finally NBC, continuing until May 1961—on radio only, 1947–1950; on both radio and television, 1950–1960; and on television only, 1960–1961. The show proved a huge hit, {{being one of the}} most popular on television by the mid-1950s. With George Fenneman as his announcer and straight man, Groucho entertained his audiences with improvised conversation with his guests. Since <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life was mostly ad-libbed and unscripted—although writers did pre-interview the guests and feed Groucho ready-made lines in advance—the producers insisted that the network prerecord it (instead of it being broadcast live). There were two reasons for this: prerecording provided Groucho with time to fish around for funny exchanges and any intervening dead spots to be edited out; and secondly to protect the network, since Groucho was a notorious loose cannon and known to say almost anything. The television show ran for 11 successful seasons until it was canceled in 1961. Automobile marque DeSoto was a longtime major sponsor. For the DeSoto ads Marx would sometimes say: [...] "Tell 'em Groucho sent you", or [...] "Try a DeSoto before you decide".|$|E
2500|$|The Marx Brothers {{became the}} biggest comedic {{stars of the}} Palace Theatre in New York City, which billed itself as the [...] "Valhalla of Vaudeville". Brother Chico's deal-making skills {{resulted}} in three hit plays on Broadway. No comedy routine had ever so infected the Broadway circuit. [...] All of this stage work predated their Hollywood career. By the time the Marxes made their first movie, they were already major stars with sharply honed skills; {{and by the time}} Groucho was relaunched to stardom on <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life, he had been performing successfully for half a century.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947 Marx {{was asked}} to host a radio quiz program <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life. It was {{broadcast}} by ABC and then CBS before moving to NBC. It moved from radio to television on October 5, 1950 and ran for eleven years. Filmed before a live audience, the show consisted of Marx bantering with the contestants and ad-libbing jokes before briefly quizzing them. The show was responsible for popularizing the phrases [...] "Say the secret word and the duck will come down and give you fifty dollars," [...] "Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?" [...] and [...] "What color is the White House?" [...] (asked to reward a losing contestant a consolation prize).|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{care what}} you say, that's an honest letter," [...] said Miss Rosey, with a certain {{decision}} of character new {{to the experience of}} her friends, [...] "as honest and simple as ever was written. <b>You</b> can <b>bet</b> <b>your</b> pile on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Per-empted or pre-emp-ted, as you like," [...] {{continued}} the girl scornfully,--"ez he's got a holt on this yer woods, ye might ez well see him down thar ez here. For here he's {{like to come}} any minit. <b>You</b> can <b>bet</b> <b>your</b> life on that." ...|$|R
2500|$|Earlier that year, she {{appeared}} as a celebrity guest on Bill Cosby's <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life. She was partnered with a parapsychologist to answer three questions about science and surprised the host and audience by correctly answering the first question, [...] "What is sucrose?", and continued on to win $1,000 and a free trip to Philadelphia where the show was taped. The episode aired on television that October. Later that month, she also received $100 prize and an honorable mention as the winner of a halloween costume contest held by the National Inquirer. The contestants were required to create costumes using only thread, glue, paste and pages from the tabloid. Blackstone's costume, which she called the [...] "Enquira", was parody of late night movie host Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.|$|E
2500|$|The grouch bag: This {{explanation}} {{appears in}} Harpo's biography; it was voiced by Chico in a TV appearance included on The Unknown Marx Brothers; {{and it was}} offered by George Fenneman, Groucho's sidekick on his TV game show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life. A grouch bag was a small drawstring bag worn around the neck in which a traveler could keep money and other valuables {{so that it would}} be very difficult for anyone to steal them. Most of Groucho's friends and associates stated that Groucho was extremely stingy, especially after losing all his money in the 1929 stock market crash, so naming him for the grouch bag may have been a comment on this trait. Groucho insisted that this was not the case in chapter six of his first autobiography: ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{parents were}} Jewish emigrants from Czechoslovakia and Hungary: {{his father was}} born in Ópályi, near Mátészalka, {{and his mother was}} a native of Nagymihály (now Michalovce, Slovakia); she later said she arrived in the US from Válykó (now Vaľkovo, Slovakia). He did not learn English until he was five or six, delaying his schooling. His father was a tailor and the family lived {{in the back of the}} shop—his parents in one corner and Curtis and his {{brothers}} Julius and Robert in another. His mother once made an appearance as a participant on the television show <b>You</b> <b>Bet</b> <b>Your</b> Life, hosted by Groucho Marx. Curtis said, [...] "When I was a child, Mom beat me up and was very aggressive and antagonistic." [...] His mother was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. His brother Robert was institutionalized with the same mental illness.|$|E
