5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than <b>you</b> <b>appear</b> to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{identified}} himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave {{to work on the}} poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, [...] "As <b>You</b> <b>appear</b> no less sensible than Your Readers of the defects of your Poetical Article, You will not be displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to You the sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's [...] "low Jests" [...] and [...] "awkward Buffoonery" [...] and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and [...] "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" [...] written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.|$|E
