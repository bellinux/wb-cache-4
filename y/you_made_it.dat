Stack called their dance {{down the aisle}} [...] "utterly joyous and sweet, a showcase for how music can transform everyday events." [...] He added that their [...] "individual vows [...] really lovely, {{even though they did}} seem to be more about their kids than their significant others". TV Guide listed it amongst [...] "The Most Memorable TV Weddings", and commented [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> through the vows without shedding a tear you have no soul." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club praised the [...] "genuinely sweet chemistry" [...] between O'Malley and Rosemont, and found the processional dance [...] "nicely moving" [...] though unoriginal. He too commented on the focus on Kurt and Finn in their vows, but conceded, [...] "if you'd been a single parent that long, you'd probably talk about your kids a lot too." [...] He expanded: ...|$|E

You are a role model. Football {{is one of the}} great ways to make peace among people. When a player like you arrives in our country the eyes of the children light up—Jewish, Arab or Muslim." ...|$|E

In 1903, writing to Brema of her original performance, Elgar wrote 'I have, of course, in memory your fine and intellectual creation of the part; and though I never thought the 'tessitura' suited you well, as the magnificent artist you are, <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> go very finely.' ...|$|E

[...] Said Nixon: [...] "I told Bill (motioning on the {{platform}} to Milliken) I really didn't think we should schedule a meeting in Chester on a Saturday morning. But I see some of <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> out here." [...] Almost as if to predict the upcoming Vietnam War, he stated: [...] "Our most important duty {{is to keep the}} peace for the U.S., as Dwight Eisenhower had done.

2500|$|Blache was {{introduced}} to the idea of painting Leah Chase by his art representative at the time Eugene C. Daymude in the summer of 2009. The 20 small oil paintings that comprised the series detailed the day-to-day activities 92-year-old Chef Leah Chase encounters from early morning prep work to greeting guests in the dining room. [...] Blache was heralded for his depiction of the culinary icon for his accuracy and delicate handling of paint, color, and texture. [...] “Asked whether she thought the rendering was accurate, Chase, 89, said the young artist had gotten it right. [...] “I told him, ‘You could have made me look like Halle Berry or Lena Horne, but <b>you</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> look like me,’” she said. [...] The painting Cutting Squash was acquired for its permanent collection by the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in 2011. [...] “We are always looking for portraits of nationally prominent figures,” National Portrait Gallery chief curator Brandon Fortune said. [...] “It is a very interesting image of a woman at work, doing a very simple task, cutting squash,” [...] [...] [...] “But in some ways it transcends the everyday and becomes something of national significance.” [...] This series reinforces Blache's commitment to documenting everyday labor and showcasing these intimate processes to the public. [...] Another one of the Smithsonian Institution Museums, National Museum of African History and Culture, came calling for another painting of Chase from the Blache series in 2013 and acquired Leah Red Coat Stirring (Sketch) in 2013, making it the third painting from Blache {{to be included in the}} permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
