For example, the New York metropolitan area and the ChiPitts area have the highest concentration in the United States of people whose dominant personality trait is neuroticism. The book ends with a ten step guide to choosing a location best suited to the reader's personality and life situation.|$|E
500|$|... {{was about}} how when my grandma was {{standing}} over my grandfather {{while he was}} dying. There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of {{looked at her and}} reckoned that he had won in life. Like, 'I'm a champion. We won. Our love made us a winner.' They were married 60 years. I thought about that idea, that the glorious moment of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> when you decide that it's okay to go, you don’t have any more words to say, more business, more mountains to climb.

The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time in my whole life".|$|E

O'Ryan and Trevor Muzzy {{were in charge}} of vocal editing. All instruments in the song were played and programmed by RedOne, who also produced the song. The song was later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. In an interview with Ryan Seacrest, Lopez revealed that she loved being able to collaborate with RedOne and Pitbull again. She stated: [...] "We had a great chemistry the last time, and it was like 'We're {{going to have to do}} something again.' And this was the perfect song. I love the message of the song.

[...] John Evan Seery, author of Political theory for mortals: shades of justice, images of death, commented that the song portrayed Madonna's [...] "discipline of gaze". Brian Hadden from Time found the song depressing. Tiju Francis from Vibe wrote: [...] "For a such a commonly titled song, Madonna’s take does at least offer something a little different. [...] 'The Look of Love' actually sounds like part of the score– Madonna could well be singing over what was previously just the moody character development background synth music apparently present in every film in the ’80s. [...] But its slow-burn feel means the song is four minutes of not-particularly-intense brooding that never peaks– unlike a ballad." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1966, the Beatles {{had grown}} weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could [...] "send out four waxworks... {{and that would}} satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are {{nothing to do with}} music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites." [...] In June that year, two days after {{finishing}} the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: [...] "Do not go to Tokyo. <b>Your</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> in danger". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.|$|E
500|$|Goal Auzeen Saedi, {{reviewing}} Keeping Up {{with the}} Kardashians for Psychology Today, emphasized the show's influence saying that: [...] "The Kardashians become more relatable the more famous they become."

[...] Vinnie Mancuso, writing for New York Observer, criticized the show and felt: [...] "roughly one iota of shadenfreudic pleasure from this endeavor, {{but for the most part}} this show is the 100% drizzling poops." [...] David Hinckley of the New York Daily News, reviewing the tenth season, said that [...] "even when you think something about the Kardashians could be interesting, it's not," [...] adding that the [...] "entertainment value [...] is like having spent 10 years in Rapid City, S.D., watching the traffic lights change." [...] Amy Amatangelo of The Hollywood Reporter said that [...] "in true Kardashian fashion, they managed to make everything about them," [...] after Caitlyn Jenner came out as a trans woman to her family in the [...] "About Bruce" [...] special aired as part of the tenth season. Amatangelo felt that the conversations [...] "seemed a little too staged, too controlled", and noted that [...] "there was no attempt to educate the viewers about transgender issues." ...|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

500|$|Pinkner and Wyman {{brought back}} the [...] "Cortexiphan kids", {{introduced}} {{in the first two}} seasons, because they felt that part of the storyline was really interesting. They wanted {{the end of the season}} to be a [...] "beautiful culmination of everything" [...] while traveling to the Other Side. The show had been developing a parallel universe storyline since its conception, but [...] "Over There" [...] marked the longest time spent in that world thus far. Pinker explained the idea of two worlds: [...] "One of the big themes of the show is how small choices that you make define you as a person and can change your life in large ways down the line." [...] Wyman said that the parallel universe [...] "is a reminder to our viewers that <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> what your choices are." [...] The two began discussing details about the Other Side early on, especially what the differences between the two universes would be. Pinkner commented in an interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "a lot of them are ideas that we jokingly threw out. Some of them, like the notion of zeppelins or the Statue of Liberty if we didn't let it oxidize or the Grand Central Hotel, we're not making up. Had the Hindenburg not blown up, zeppelins would be passenger air ships docking at the Empire State Building. That was the plan. We opened ourselves to the standard that it had to be possible." [...] Pinkner later elaborated, [...] "We're interested in world building and all that stuff is the texture that actually makes it a world. The richness of detail is what makes it feel real." [...] They used comic books as one way to subtly differentiate the two worlds. Goldsman, Wyman, and actor Joshua Jackson are longstanding comic book fans and decided to make the character of Peter a fan as well. Goldsman called on his friend Geoff Johns, Chief Creative Officer at DC Comics. He arranged for DC to specially design ten alternate covers for some of their most iconic editions, which were displayed in Peter's apartment on the Other Side. Visual effects company Eden FX created Peter's apartment and the alternate New York skyline visible outside his window. When fans reacted positively to these detailed characteristics written into the parallel universe, the producers stated their intention to show a lot more similar details in the third season.|$|E
