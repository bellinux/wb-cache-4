5|$|Upon being {{declared}} a tropical depression, meteorologists in Mexico began advising residents {{about the possibility}} of heavy rainfall across the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on September 29.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} Tropical Weather Outlook (TWO) over the Gulf of Mexico and {{northern}} <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on June1. The TWO indicated {{the probability of}} the development of a low pressure area, which would have a 20% chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next five days. By June3, a concentrated area of showers and thunderstorms developed in the western Caribbean Sea, resulting in an increasing probability of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. Despite land interaction with the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and unfavorably strong wind shear, the system reached an 80% chance of developing in the next 48hours by early on June5. It then moved inland over the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> but continued to organize. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the system developed a well-defined circulation, according to surface data and satellite imagery. Thus, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three at 15:00UTC on June5, while located about 20mi (30km) north of Río Lagartos, Yucatán. The northward-moving depression was lopsided, with the circulation being well to the west of an elongated band of deep convection.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Dean in Mexico were {{more severe than}} {{anywhere}} else in the storm's path. Hurricane Dean, the most intense storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The Cape Verde-type hurricane sped through the Caribbean Sea, rapidly intensifying before making landfall on Mexico's <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Accurate forecasts of the storm's location and intensity enabled thorough preparations; nevertheless when the massive storm made landfall on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> as a catastrophic Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale it damaged thousands of homes.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> {{there were}} 17 deaths were {{attributed}} to Hurricane Isidore, two of which were indirectly related to the storm. Damage in the country totaled $950million (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|About 50hours before landfall, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Belize and the eastern <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> and about 12hours later it was upgraded to a hurricane watch. When the lack of significant intensification became apparent, {{a tropical}} storm warning was added {{for much of the}} <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and later for a portion of the Mexican coast along the Bay of Campeche. As the storm approached, nearly 2,500people in vulnerable areas of eastern Mexico evacuated to safer areas. About 8,000people evacuated in Belize, primarily on offshore islands. The government of Belize opened its emergency operation center and evacuated several hospitals. About 250airline flights were canceled, and some cruise ship paths were diverted to safer locations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} Mitch maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{destruction}} {{was due to}} Isidore, {{which caused}} about $970million (2002USD, $ USD) in damage and killed seven people in the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and later the United States, and Hurricane Lili, which caused $860million (2002USD) in damage and 15 deaths when it made landfall in Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|On September29, {{shortly after}} Keith formed, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>peninsula</b> from Chetumal to Cabo Catoche in Quintana Roo. The next day as Keith was nearing hurricane intensity, the watch was upgraded to a warning, and {{a tropical storm}} warning and hurricane watch was issued for the Belize coastline from Belize City to the Mexican border. At that time, the trajectory was expected to go more to the northwest, and when the storm turned to a slow westward drift, hurricane warnings were issued for the Belize coast with only about 24hours of lead time for the offshore islands. The warnings for the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>peninsula</b> were dropped as Keith weakened.|$|E
5|$|Stela 14 {{dates to}} about AD 870 and {{stands at the}} {{junction}} of two causeways and is in a good state of preservation. It has stylistic similarities with sculptures at distant Chichen Itza in the extreme north of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors {{were armed}} with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Crossbows were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|The primary rainband {{extending}} southward {{from the}} circulation of Florence dropped moderate rainfall across the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> and through southern Mexico. Rainfall amounts peaked at 10.79inches (274mm) in San Baltazar Loxicha, Guerrero, with 10.67inches (271mm) reported in southeastern Chiapas and 9.74inches (247mm) near Merida. Damage, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The storm briefly posed {{a threat}} to Mexico, and a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Chetumal Bay to Cabo Catoche along the eastern <b>Yucatán</b> <b>peninsula.</b> A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for the Cayman Islands.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} a wind gust of 71mph (115km/h) in Caye Caulker, although stronger winds were {{possible in a}} convective band to the north. On the <b>Yucatan</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> heavy rainfall led to mudslides across Quintana Roo, leaving some areas isolated.|$|E
5|$|This {{storm is}} known {{from a single}} ship report. On July25, the bark Daniel bound for New York from Matamoros, Tamaulipas {{encountered}} a tropical storm off the Alacran reef, north of the <b>Yucatan</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> The vessel spent several hours in the cyclone and was also struck by lightning.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, {{the fact that it}} had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard. As a result, residents of Veracruz and Campeche were much less prepared for the storm than those on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Late on November 8, the {{hurricane}} curved westward and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. Six hours later, it peaked with maximum sustained winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Early on November 9, the storm struck Caye Caulker and northern Belize District. Rapidly weakening, the system fell to tropical storm status within 12 hours of landfall. By early on November 10, it emerged into the Bay of Campeche. The storm meandered erratically until striking the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on November 11 and dissipating hours later. Strong winds {{were observed in}} Belize and Mexico's <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Severe damage {{was reported in the}} former. About 90% of structures in San Pedro Town were destroyed, while Newtown was completely obliterated, causing its residents to relocate and establish the village of Hopkins. Trees and crops such as coconuts also suffered heavy losses. Overall, nine deaths and approximately $4million in damage were reported.|$|E

5|$|Mayapan was {{abandoned}} around 1448, {{after a period}} of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511. Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces. During the Late Postclassic, the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization. On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. The K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Yucatán was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Maya states and polities in the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> a vast limestone plain covering south-eastern Mexico, northern Guatemala, and all of Belize. The Spanish conquest of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> was hindered by its politically fragmented state. The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns. Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements {{took the form of}} the flight into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish. Among the Maya, ambush was a favoured tactic. Spanish weaponry included broadswords, rapiers, lances, pikes, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Maya warriors fought with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones, and wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish introduced a number of Old World diseases previously unknown in the Americas, initiating devastating plagues that swept through the native populations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> is {{bordered by}} the Caribbean Sea {{to the east}} and by the Gulf of Mexico to the north and west. It {{incorporates}} the modern Mexican states of Yucatán, Quintana Roo and Campeche, the eastern portion of the state of Tabasco, most of the Guatemalan department of Petén, and all of Belize. Most of the peninsula is formed by a vast plain with few hills or mountains and a generally low coastline. The northwestern and northern portions of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> experience lower rainfall {{than the rest of the}} peninsula; these regions feature highly porous limestone bedrock resulting in less surface water. In contrast, the northeastern portion of the peninsula is characterised by forested swamplands. The northern portion of the peninsula lacks rivers, except for the Champotón River – all other rivers are located in the south.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} {{storm had}} an unusual origin by forming from an interaction {{of two different}} systems near the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> This occurrence is unusual, but not unique, as Subtropical Storm One in the 1974 season formed in similar pattern. A reconnaissance flight on June 17 reported that {{there appeared to be}} multiple transient circulations at the surface, but no well-defined center. The first disturbance {{can be traced back to}} June 15 in the northwest Caribbean Sea. The disturbance moved north, along with a low-pressure area that formed over the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> A trough merged with the low-pressure area creating an even stronger trough over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Conditions in the Gulf of Mexico were favorable for tropical storm formation. Some severe weather had been occurring over the Florida Peninsula as early as June 16, as the fringes of disturbance moved across the Florida Straits and over the Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|While the {{hurricane}} {{was off the}} north coast of the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>peninsula,</b> Inez produced sustained winds of , with gusts to , in Mérida. The winds cut power and knocked down trees in Progreso, as well as nearby cities. High waves destroyed a dock in Telchac Puerto. Heavy rainfall flooded streets in Mérida, although damage was not severe.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Twenty on October 1. Off {{the coast of the}} <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> it strengthened into Tropical Storm Stan on October 2. Stan made landfall on the Yucatán and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging into the Bay of Campeche it quickly strengthened into a hurricane on October 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the African coast on July 19. The system headed westward through the Atlantic Ocean {{for the next}} week with no change in development. After entering the Caribbean Sea on July 26, convection began to come together two days later due to the influence of anticyclonic flow. The disturbance passed the <b>Yucatan</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on July 29 and entered the Gulf of Mexico. No circulation was found in the developing system, however.|$|E
5|$|At {{its first}} landfall, {{the bulk of}} Hurricane Dean's damage was to agriculture. 12,000producers {{suffered}} losses, mostly in the states of Quintana Roo and Yucatán. 30,000ha (74,000acre) of habanero peppers were destroyed, along with 150,000ha (370,000acre) of corn and 60,000ha (150,000acre) of citrus. Extensive damage to fields planted with bananas, avocados, cucumbers, squash, jalapeño peppers, and other crops were also reported on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|At peak intensity, Mitch {{maintained}} maximum sustained {{winds of}} 180mph (285km/h) while off the northern coast of Honduras. Hurricane Hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of , {{which at the}} time was the lowest in the month of October and tied for the fourth lowest for any Atlantic hurricane. Initially, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north, threatening the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Instead, Mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active. Land interaction imparted weakening, and the hurricane made landfall on Honduras on October29 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Turning westward, Mitch slowly weakened over land and maintained deep convection over adjacent waters. After moving across mountainous terrain in Central America, the surface circulation of Mitch dissipated on November1. The next day, the remnants reached the Gulf of Mexico and reorganized into a tropical storm on November3. Mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front, moving across the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> before striking southwestern Florida on November5. Shortly thereafter, the storm became an extratropical cyclone, which was tracked by the NHC until November9.|$|E
5|$|Brenda {{made two}} landfalls in Mexico: {{first in the}} Yucatan and later in Campeche. Little damage {{resulted}} from the storm throughout the <b>Yucatan</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> However, severe damage took place in areas near Brenda's second landfall. A total of 10 people {{were killed by the}} hurricane and over 2,000 more were left homeless. Flooding caused by Brenda was considered to be the worst in over 25 years in some places.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{countries}} {{felt the}} effects of Hurricane Dean as its path through the Caribbean Sea claimed 42lives. The hurricane first brushed the Lesser Antilles on August 17, 2007, and as it passed through {{the interior of the}} Caribbean its outer rain bands swept over the Greater Antilles. It passed Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane, and strengthened to a Category5 storm as it made landfall on Mexico's <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> on August 21. A second landfall on August 22 was less devastating.|$|E
5|$|From 1527 onwards the Spanish were {{increasingly}} {{active in the}} <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> establishing several colonies and towns by 1544, including Campeche and Valladolid {{in what is now}} Mexico. The Spanish impact on the northern Maya, encompassing invasion, epidemic diseases and the export of up to 50,000 Maya slaves, caused many Maya to flee southwards to join the Itza around Lake Petén Itzá, within the modern borders of Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm formed on June25, a {{tropical}} storm warning was issued for the entire east coast of Quintana Roo on Mexico's <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b> Shortly thereafter, the tropical storm warning was extended to include {{the east coast of}} Belize. Late on June25, the Government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for the islands of Roatan, Guanaja and Utila. A tropical storm watch was also issued from Limón to the border with Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|In 751 Ruler Z {{erected a}} stela {{that was never}} finished, paired with another with the {{portrait}} of a queen. A hieroglyphic stairway mentions someone called B'olon K'awiil at about the same time. B'olon K'awiil was king by 771 when he raised two stelae and he was mentioned at Toniná in 789. Sites to the north of Calakmul showed a reduction in its influence at this time, with new architectural styles influenced by sites further north in the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Itza Maya from Motul de San José began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula</b> {{at the end of the}} Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the King of the Itzá, demonstrating that the Itza were already in the Petén region at this time. The nearby village of San José, on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, is one of the last Itzá communities in Petén.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} {{that in the early}} 1660s Morgan was active with a group of privateers led by Sir Christopher Myngs attacking Spanish cities and settlements in the Caribbean and Central America. In 1663 it is likely that Morgan captained one of the ships in Myngs' fleet, and took part in the attack on Santiago de Cuba and the Sack of Campeche on the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula.</b>|$|E
5|$|Major {{construction}} at Tikal was already {{taking place in}} the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400–300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire <b>Yucatan</b> <b>Peninsula</b> including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.|$|E
5|$|Over {{a stretch}} of four days, sixteen {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, the <b>Yucatán</b> <b>Peninsula,</b> Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. The threat from Iris prompted the Jamaica National Emergency Operations Center to be activated. Shelters were opened in the country but were ultimately unused.|$|E
