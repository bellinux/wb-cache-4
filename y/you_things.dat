2500|$|After {{signing with}} Columbia in 1970, Anderson {{released}} the Joe South song, [...] "(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden", {{which became a}} major crossover pop hit in 1970 and early 1971. The song was produced by her then [...] husband Glenn Sutton. [...] Anderson actually had to do some arm-twisting to get her producer-husband {{to allow her to}} record the song. [...] Sutton was concerned that [...] "Rose Garden" [...] was a song to be sung by a man, with the line [...] "I could promise <b>you</b> <b>things</b> like big diamond rings". [...] It was Columbia executive Clive Davis who determined the song would be Anderson's next single released. [...] The single peaked at No.1 on the Billboard country chart and No.3 on the Billboard pop chart, becoming an international success. [...] In the United Kingdom, the single reached No.3 and in Germany it peaked at No.1 and stayed there for four weeks. [...] The album Rose Garden was released in 1971 and was also hugely successful, receiving platinum certification by the RIAA. [...] Anderson won the Academy of Country Music's [...] "Top Female Vocalist" [...] Award and the Country Music Association's [...] "Female Vocalist of the Year" [...] Award in 1970 and 1971, respectively. In addition, she won a Grammy Award.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling <b>you</b> <b>things</b> like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{talks about the}} end of Adele's first [...] "real relationship" [...] with her long-time friend and lover and it shows her confronting his marriage. At the {{beginning}} of the song, she sings the lines [...] "I heard that you're settled down/That you found a girl and you're married now. I heard that your dreams came true/Guess she gave <b>you</b> <b>things</b> I [...] couldn't give to you" [...] with a softly voice and accompanied just by a simple piano melody. The lyrics of [...] "Someone like You" [...] are talking about what once was and what could have been as stated by a writer of Daily Herald. Finding the strength to bounce back from hardship and heartache, Adele sings the lines, [...] "Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you, too/Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said/Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead." [...] Talking about the meaning and the composition of the song, Jer Fairall of PopMatters said: [...] "The song's subject—Adele mentally addressing an old lover who has since found happiness elsewhere—is familiar, but the detail she colors it with are vibrantly tactile and resonant, from the sense-memory setting of 'we were born and raised in a summer haze' to her recollection of his cruel kiss-off line 'I remember you said, 'sometimes it lasts in love and sometimes it hurts instead' and how she comes to take solace in the statement as an empowering mantra." ...|$|E
