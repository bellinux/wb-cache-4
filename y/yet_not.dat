5|$|A week later, {{plans for}} an as yet unnamed second {{documentary}} about compulsive male masturbators were announced, to be produced by the independent company Spun Gold. The film was to be an hour long and focus on men trying to cut down excessive masturbatory habits of up to twenty times a day, using methods developed in the United States. In September 2006, the final film in the series was announced. Entitled Masturbation For Girls, it was also to be produced by Spun Gold, and focus on female masturbation. It was to feature the sex educationalist Dr Betty Dodson, although the format had <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> been finalised. It was reported after the postponement of their airing that {{the second and third}} films were to be entitled I Can't Stop Wanking and Masturbation for Women respectively.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. <b>Yet</b> <b>not</b> all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out of the roughly a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. <b>Yet</b> <b>not</b> one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E

5|$|Myxogastria are {{distributed}} worldwide; species were found by early researchers on all continents. However, as {{many parts of}} the world were <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> discovered or explored, the exact distribution is not fully known. Europe and North America are often considered the basic habitat of the Myxogastria species. According to recent research, the majority of species are not widely distributed. The Myxogastria are most commonly found in temperate latitudes, and rarely in the polar regions, the subtropics or tropics. The physical features of the substrate and climatic conditions are the major aspects of the species' presence. Endemism is rare.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{quantum field}} theories, which {{form the basis}} of modern {{elementary}} particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth. In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime. These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime. Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time. As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.|$|E

The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government.

In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents of violence in the marketplaces.|$|E

5|$|According to Jain texts, Bahubali {{was born}} to Rishabhanatha and Sunanda during the Ikshvaku dynasty in Ayodhya. He {{is said to have}} excelled in {{studying}} medicine, archery, floriculture, and the knowledge of precious gems. Bahubali had a son named Somakirti (also known as Mahabala). When Rishabhanatha decided to become a monk, he distributed his kingdom among his 100 sons. Bharata was gifted the kingdom of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the kingdom of Asmaka from South India, having Podanapur as its capital. After winning six divisions of earth in all directions (digvijaya), Bharata proceeded to his capital Ayodhyapuri with a huge army and divine chakra-ratna—spinning, disk-like super weapon with serrated edges. But the chakra-ratna stopped on its own at the entrance of Ayodhyapuri, signalling to the emperor that his 99 brothers have <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> submitted to his authority. Bharata's 98 brothers became Jain monks' and submitted their kingdoms to him. Bahubali was endowed with the final and superior body of extraordinary sturdiness and strength (vajra-ṛṣabhanārācasaṃhanana) like Bharata. He hurled open defiance at the chakravartin and challenged him to a fight.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{became a}} {{powerful}} patron of Stephen's; Henry probably chose {{to support him}} because Stephen {{was part of his}} extended family and a regional ally, <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently wealthy or powerful in his own right to represent a threat to either the King or his heir, William Adelin. As a third surviving son, even of an influential regional family, Stephen still needed the support of a powerful patron such as the King to progress in life. With Henry's support, Stephen rapidly began to accumulate lands and possessions. Following the battle of Tinchebray in 1106, Henry confiscated the County of Mortain from William of Mortain, and the Honour of Eye, a large lordship previously owned by Robert Malet. In 1113, Stephen was granted both the title and the honour, although without the lands previously held by William in England. The gift of the Honour of Lancaster also followed after it was confiscated by Henry from Roger the Poitevin. Stephen was also given lands in Alençon in southern Normandy by Henry, but the local Normans rebelled, seeking assistance from Fulk, the Count of Anjou. Stephen and his older brother Theobald were comprehensively beaten in the subsequent campaign, which culminated in the battle of Alençon, and the territories were not recovered.|$|E
5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to the details of her life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Slaves (nuli 奴隸) {{comprised}} roughly 1% of the population, {{a proportion}} {{far less than}} the contemporary Greco-Roman world which relied on the labor of a large slave population. Slaves were classified into two categories: those who were privately owned, and those who were owned by the state. Privately owned slaves were often former peasants who fell into debt and sold themselves into slavery, while others were former government slaves bestowed to nobles and high officials as rewards for their services. State-owned slaves were sometimes prisoners of war (<b>yet</b> <b>not</b> all were made slaves). However, most slaves were tributary gifts given to the court by foreign states, families of criminals who committed treason against the state, and former private slaves who were either donated to authorities (since this would exempt the former slaveholder from labor obligations) or confiscated by the state if their master had broken a law. In both Western and Eastern Han, arrested criminals became convicts and it was only during the reign of Wang Mang that counterfeiting criminals were made into slaves.|$|E
5|$|The Western Han capital at Chang'an {{was divided}} into one hundred and sixty walled {{residential}} wards. Affairs of each ward were overseen by a low-ranking official. Influential families within the wards usually maintained social order. Historians are still unsure as to how many government-controlled marketplaces existed in Chang'an. Although there are claims of nine markets, {{it is possible that}} seven of them were actually divisible parts of two main markets: the East Market and West Market. Both the East Market and West Market had a two-story government office with a flag and drum placed on the roof. A market chief and deputy were headquartered in each of these buildings, <b>yet</b> <b>not</b> much is known about their involvement in the marketplace. In the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang, the market chief's office employed thirty-six sub-officers who ventured into the marketplace daily to maintain law and order. They also collected taxes on commercial goods, assigned standard prices for specific commodities on the basis of monthly reviews, and authorized contracts between merchants and their customers or clients. Besides merchants engaging in marketplace violations, other crimes were committed by adolescent street gangs who often wore clothes distinguishing their gang. The maintenance of law and order outside the market and in slum areas was conducted by constables; Han officials sometimes argued for increasing their salaries which they assumed would encourage them to reject bribes from criminals.|$|E
