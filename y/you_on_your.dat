He {{appeared}} in All's Well That Ends Well and As You Like It (1999–2000), and played Mercutio in a 1994 TV adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Other theatre credits include Waiting for Godot (1994) and 900 Oneonta (1994), which earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Evening Standard Awards. He also acted in Martin Yesterday (1998), for which he was nominated as Best Actor in the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards, Naked (1998), Tales From Hollywood (2001), Three Sisters (2003), Iphigenia at Aulis (2004), The God of Hell (2005), and The Wild Duck (2005–2006).

500|$|After {{completing}} his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), [...] "a formidable piece of abstract composition" [...] according to Bowen, Tippett {{returned to the}} modern vernacular in his fourth opera The Ice Break (1976). Describing the music in {{an introduction to the}} published libretto, Tippett identifies [...] "two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> shoulders in triumph, or stamp you to death". [...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage". William Mann in The Times [...] was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.|$|E
500|$|Krasinski {{received}} a haircut due to production on another film, Leatherheads (2008), which he thought [...] "ended up working perfectly" [...] {{for the season}} finale. Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> toes in terms of not knowing where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E
500|$|Ninnis was {{the father}} of Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis, a Lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers and Antarctic explorer. B. E. S. Ninnis {{accompanied}} the 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, under Douglas Mawson, as a dog handler. Along with Mawson and Xavier Mertz, he formed the Far Eastern Party, using sledge dogs to explore the area around the expedition's base in Adélie Land. On 14 December 1912, B. E. S. Ninnis died when the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a crevasse. When news of his death reached Australia in March 1913, several Australian newspapers—including The Advertiser, the Western Argus and The Sydney Morning Herald—ran biographies of Belgrave Ninnis, noting his surveying work in the Northern Territory and Arctic exploration. When Mawson returned to Australia a year later, a telegram was sent on behalf of the Australian people to Ninnis senior, condoling him on his [...] "great loss, but congratulating <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> son's imperishable fame." [...] Ninnis replied the following day, [...] "Grateful thanks to yourself and people of Australia for sympathetic message." ...|$|E

500|$|In November 1913, a {{month before}} the Aurora {{returned}} for the final time, Mawson and the six men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut. The cross, constructed from pieces of a broken radio mast, was accompanied by a plaque cut from wood from Mertz's bunk. The cross still stands, although the crossbar has required reattaching several times, and the plaque was replaced with a replica in 1986. The first glacier the Far Eastern Party crossed on the outward journey—previously unnamed—was named by Mawson after Mertz, becoming the Mertz Glacier. At a speaking engagement upon his return to Australia, Mawson praised his dead comrades: [...] "The survivors might have an opportunity of doing something more, but these men had done their all." [...] At another, Mawson said that [...] "Dr. Mertz was a Swiss by birth, but he was a man every Englishman {{would have liked to have}} called an Englishman ... He was a man of great feelings, generous—one of Nature's gentlemen."

500|$|The first scandal to taint the Grant {{administration}} in 1869 was Black Friday, {{also known as}} the Gold Panic, which was an attempt by two aggressive financiers to corner the price of gold without regard to the nation's economic welfare. The intricate financial scheme was primarily conceived and administered by Wall Street manipulators Jay Gould and his partner James Fisk. Their plan was to convince President Grant not to sell Treasury gold, in order to increase the sales of agriculture products overseas and increase the shipping business of Gould's Erie Railroad. Gould and Fisk were able to get Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Rathbone Corbin, involved with the scheme {{as a way to get}} access to Grant himself. [...] Gould had also given a $10,000 bribe to the assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel Butterfield, in exchange for inside information. On June 5, 1869, while Grant was traveling from New York to Boston on The Providence, a ship owned by both Gould and Fisk, the two speculators urged Grant not to sell any gold from the Treasury and attempted to convince him that a high price of gold helped farmers and the Erie Railroad. President Grant, however, was stoic and did not agree to Fisk and Gould's suggestion to stop releasing Treasury Gold into the market. Grant's Secretary of Treasury, George S. Boutwell, continued to sell Treasury gold on the open market. In late August 1869, President Grant consulted with businessman, A. T. Stewart, Grant's initial Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Treasury, concerning the Treasury's selling gold. Stewart advised Grant that the Treasury should not sell gold, in order that the Government would not be involved in the gold market. Grant accepted Stewart's advise and wrote to Boutwell that selling extra Treasury gold would upset agriculture sales. Boutwell had, on September 1, originally ordered $9,000,000 in gold to be sold from the Treasury in order to buy up U.S. Bonds with greenbacks. However, after receiving a letter from Grant, Boutwell cancelled the order. Previously, Secretary Boutwell had been selling regularly at $1,000,000 of gold each week. On September 6, 1869, Gould bought the Tenth National Bank, which was used as a buying house for gold, and Gould and Fisk then began buying gold in earnest. As the price of gold began to rise, Grant became suspicious of possible manipulation and wrote a letter to Secretary Boutwell on September 12, stating [...] "The fact is, a desperate struggle is now taking place...I write this letter to advise you of what I think you may expect, to put <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> guard." [...] However, President Grant's personal associations with Gould and Fisk gave them the clout that they needed to continue their financial scam on Wall Street.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked why}} The Run is from San Fran – New York rather than LA – New York, game’s {{producer}} Brian Lindley replied: [...] "That’s a good question.

But also, San Fran has some iconic landmarks and things like the bridge and the downtown. Also, {{what we can do}} with the environment with things like fog, it makes it of a bit cooler place to drive than LA. And my experiences driving in LA are largely being stuck in traffic! So that’s the primary reason, it’s just a cooler looking start for the game." [...] Black Box PR Manager Dana Sissons stated that The Run was going to be more exciting, more varied, and bigger than ever. The race from San Francisco to New York was full of new race modes, tons of different terrain, and a few [...] "Michael Bay movie moment" [...] avalanches to keep <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> toes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{developers}} considered having GLaDOS and Chell act as [...] "buddy cops {{against a}} new threat", but felt that since Chell never talked, {{it would not}} work. He compared her transformation into a potato and having her power stripped away to the game Jenga: [...] "You’re taking stuff off the bottom and seeing what happens." [...] While {{she was in the}} potato form, the designers noticed a [...] "very stark difference between this imperious, all-powerful GLaDOS talking to you, and this powerless GLaDOS talking to <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> gun". They found that play testers were not interested in her when she was powerless and insulting players and would question why they were [...] "carting this person along". They decided to give her a personality shift and become Chell's [...] "sidekick" [...] on the basis that [...] "she can’t just be needling you for a half hour". In order to keep players from feeling that they should want to abandon GLaDOS in her powerless form to prevent her from becoming powerful again, the designers made sure to give players reason to bring her with them. In considering the interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, Erik Johnson compared GLaDOS to [...] "a jealous ex-girlfriend", noting [...] " [...] the only person she can have interaction with, but the problem is her only way of interacting with anyone is to test them". While they introduced new characters into the game, the focus of the story in Portal 2 remained the connection and interaction between Chell and GLaDOS, and focuses more on the fallout from Chell's destruction of GLaDOS from the first game.|$|E

2500|$|Holland and Smith {{disagreed}} {{about which}} actor {{should have the}} part of Ali; Holland preferred Bilginer, while Smith preferred Salih. Holland believed Bilginer possessed the right [...] "look" [...] and that Salih was not tall or tough-looking enough, [...] "he didn't have the sort of physical presence that put <b>you</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> guard." [...] He also believed that Sandy Ratcliff, the actress playing Ali's wife Sue, would have [...] "made mincemeat of [...] ". Additionally, Holland visioned Ali with a moustache, and unlike Bilginer, Salih was unable to grow one. Conversely, Smith felt that Salih was [...] "the genuine article. Not Turkish, but Turkish-Cypriot. He would have so much actual knowledge {{to bring to the}} character [...] He wouldn't have to act the part, he was the part." [...] Both actors were given a script reading with the actress who would play Ali's wife, Sandy Ratcliff, who arrived for the reading 45 minutes late. Bilginer read with Ratcliff first, and Holland and Smith have commented that he [...] "had obviously thought about the part [...] because there was much more physical power in his performance. At one stage Julia and Tony were worried that he might even hit Sandy!" [...] Salih read next, and after being introduced to Ratcliff who apologised for her tardiness, to which Salih replied [...] "Not to worry. Typical bloody woman!" [...] His quip impressed Holland and Smith; they have since commented that Salih almost got the part on the strength of that line alone, as the felt it typified the character perfectly. Salih was eventually given the part of Ali, but as there were only two suitable Turkish speaking actors available, and as Ali would need a brother, Bilginer was given the part of Mehmet Osman.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 15 November 2010. In addition, Egan fully expressed what he felt on during recording Gravity: [...] "It’s hard to believe this is our 11th album but performing is our passion and it would seem like throwing it all away if we stopped."“Both us and Take That go for epic pop songs but them taking Robbie back hasn’t made us think about Brian McFadden returning. It would feel odd to have a fifth person back on stage with us". In addition Westlife told Digital Spy: [...] "We'd {{wanted to work with}} him for a long time, but all his loyalty was to Take That and he didn't want to work with another boyband," [...] "We'd been asking him and asking, but literally within moments of Take That deciding to go and work with Stuart Price, he said yes to us straight away. Afterwards he said he'd wanted to work with us for a long time, but he just couldn't do the Take That thing and the Westlife thing because they were too close." [...] "John created a sound for us in the same way he created a sound for Take That, a sound for Bon Jovi and a sound for all the other incredible artists he's worked with," [...] "He created a sound for Westlife that we haven't had before - it's not a massive departure, but it's definitely a step up in terms of production." [...] Filan also revealed that the group is currently in the process of selecting 12 or 13 songs for the album's final track listing from a pool of 16, with all but [...] "one or two" [...] likely to be originals. On 22 October 2010, Shanks stated that they have finished the Westlife record, all approved by Cowell. Shanks stated that the album ended up with two covers in it.
