5|$|When I met him for {{the first}} time he was a few years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now, and I was barely on the edge of manhood. He drew me into a vortex of his endless campaigns and projects... He {{introduced}} me to Bach and Brahms, and to the importance of maintaining a balance in life between the pursuit of our individual pleasures and engagements in, and responsibility for, the social condition. He believed that no class, caste or genre of people were exempt from this obligation.|$|E
500|$|In one of {{his final}} interviews, Carradine stated that at 71, he was still [...] "in {{excellent}} shape," [...] attributing it to a good diet and having a youthful circle of friends. [...] "Everybody that I know is at least 10 or 20 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> My wife Annie is 24 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> My daughter asks why I don't hang with women my age and I say, 'Most of the women my age are a lot older than me! ...|$|E
2500|$|Mel Gibson {{was cast}} as English settler John Smith {{following}} {{a desire to}} make [...] "something for my kids." [...] In a notable contrast to previous voice actors for Disney animated features, Gibson provided the singing voice for his character, which the actor has described as {{the most difficult part}} of his role. Christian Bale auditioned for the role of Thomas. As he explained in an interview with Disney Adventures, [...] "the directors played with Thomas being Irish and Scottish and <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> so I had to raise my voice and do different accents. But the more we did it, the more he became like me--older and English." [...] Richard White, the voice of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast was supposed to voice Ratcliffe, but the crew was worried he might sound too much like Gaston, so he was replaced by his co-star David Ogden Stiers. Russell Means was cast as Chief Powhatan, though he expressed displeasure with the script in that Native Americans addressed each other using proper names rather than the traditional [...] "my father" [...] or [...] "my friend". Indigenous Canadian First Nation actor Gordon Tootoosis was also cast as the tribal shaman Nekata.|$|E
6000|$|She {{would not}} consent. [...] "I know <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{a good deal}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> feel quite in the mood of that morning when we walked down Broadway on our wedding journey. Don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “For two reasons,” she condescended graciously. “First of {{all because}} Mr. Mills {{told me that}} you were much more mature than one would expect. In fact you look much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{prepared}} for.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{and stay}} with Aunt Mary if this home <b>is</b> gone. <b>I</b> shall want Sammy next time. I've settled that with the Skipper, you know, and I'll {{take good care of}} the little chap. He's not much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> shipped for my first voyage. You'll let him go?" ...|$|R
60|$|Shaved off his {{moustache}} again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look younger. He {{does look}} balmy. <b>Younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{how is it}} that you, who are {{at least}} eight years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> should argue as an old {{counsellor}} rather than a young ensign?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{or you may}} not," [...] the {{man said}} doggedly. [...] "You are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and maybe can run faster. I ain't agoing to chance it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Agnes! And I never knew! Don't cry, little girl. I {{want you}} to tell me all about it. She <b>was</b> much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and when our mother died my {{stepfather}} went away and took her with him. I remained with my father's people and eventually lost all trace of my sister. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a poor boy then, but things have looked up with me and I have often tried to find her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord! I'm a <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{few days}} ago. Before the snow flies? That's hardly another month. Pan, how'll we travel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> write this. My name <b>is</b> Humphreys. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a {{sergeant}} in the 30th, {{and it was}} at Agra, when we were stationed there, that the change of infants took place. My wife went over to England. I took to drink and disgraced myself, and five years afterwards deserted. I stayed in England for some years and then enlisted again in the 5th Dragoon Guards, and being young-looking gave my age as eight years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> <b>I</b> now go by the name of Bowen, and am {{a sergeant}} and bear a good character in the regiment. The lad did not wish me to say anything about this, at any rate until the campaign was over; but as we shall be marching in a day or two, and it may <b>be</b> that <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> killed, <b>I</b> write a letter to you and one to Captain Clinton, so that in case <b>I</b> <b>am</b> killed the truth may be known.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I {{dare say}} {{you are one of}} the men who ran after Alcharisi. But she married off and left you all in the lurch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Andrew slowly; [...] "I {{never liked}} anybody quite as much. But that's {{all there is}} to it. She's much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and she'll {{probably}} marry Dick." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. At all events, madam, I may remind you, if {{you come}} to capping ages, that {{whatever}} your secondaries and tertiaries may be, you are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b>|$|E
6000|$|That word [...] "Youth," [...] as {{the reader}} has perhaps already guessed, was my wife's pet name for me. It was gently satirical, but also affectionate. I had certain mental and {{material}} peculiarities and customs proper {{to a much}} <b>younger</b> person <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked in}} 2007 how well Reality Bites had aged, Janeane Garofalo replied, [...] "I {{think it means}} a lot more to people <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not the target audience. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 29 playing a 21-year-old, so I don't think I {{understand}} why younger people like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet Edith, who <b>is</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> {{seems to}} <b>be</b> {{too old for}} them: how do you arrange that? My mother's society will make me older," [...] Rose replied.|$|R
6000|$|Her silence {{admitted}} it. [...] "But still," [...] {{she said}} after a long pause, [...] "there are other girls, <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> in these things. They talk about--oh, all sorts of things. Freely...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your reverence is right," [...] said Stephen, [...] "he is {{twelve years}} old. He is two years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{and my father}} gave him to me {{when he was a}} little whelp." ...|$|E
6000|$|He mused, [...] "You're <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Your {{lips are}} for songs about rivers {{in the morning}} and lakes at twilight. I don't see how anybody could ever hurt you. [...] . Yes. We better go." ...|$|E
5000|$|George Armitage had met Roger Corman at 20th Century Fox {{when the}} latter was making The St Valentine's Day Massacre. Armitage later {{recalled}} he wrote a script - [...] "it was called either Carrot Butts or A Christmas Carrot — which had animated cartoon characters, Bugs Bunny and so on, coming to life. It was about the studio systems and all this stuff." [...] His agent gave the script to Gene Roger’s brother, who gave it to Roger, [...] "and he loved it, so they submitted it to UA (United Artists) where they had a deal—Mike Medavoy was just taking over there and he <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was.</b> From there, Roger said: “Well, that didn’t work, why don’t we try something else?” Usually he has a title or something and he’ll say: “Go ahead, write something, just keep the title.”" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> even <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now," [...] {{said the}} Minor Poet, [...] "I thought {{a good deal}} of marriage--very young men do. My wife, I told myself, must be a woman of mind. Yet, curiously, of all the women I have ever loved, no single one has been {{remarkable}} for intellect-- present company, as usual, of course excepted." ...|$|R
5000|$|His younger sister, Kathy, {{introduced}} him to the Houston music scene in the early seventies. [...] "My sister was a couple years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and she was like the world-champion Foosball player of downtown Houston", Keen said in a 2011 cover story for LoneStarMusic Magazine. Keen would accompany his sister to the bars where she played, many of which featured singer-songwriters playing both covers and original tunes. He started playing guitar himself shortly thereafter, teaching himself to play classic country covers out of a song book the summer before starting college at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English in 1978 and began writing songs and playing bluegrass and folk music with friends including his childhood friend (and future longtime fiddle player in his band), Bryan Duckworth. During his college years Keen met future musician Lyle Lovett.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you think, Maitre Charles? My cousin is {{two years}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and yet {{his wrist and}} arm are {{stronger}} than mine, as I could feel every time he put aside my attacks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What would Edmund have thought?' said Albinia; but {{the appeal}} came too soon, {{he made an}} angry gesture and said, 'He was nearly three years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now! He {{would not have been}} kept in these abominable leading-strings.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very great}} {{difference}} indeed. I {{think it is}} her own. But, at any rate, she is much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and there need be no settlement out of my property. That is the great thing. Don't you think she's--nice?" ...|$|E
60|$|Marx {{was much}} more {{advanced}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> as he remains to-day not more advanced but incomparably more learned <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> knew then nothing of political economy. I had not yet rid myself of metaphysical abstractions, and my Socialism was only instinctive. He, though <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> already an atheist, an instructed materialist, a well-considered Socialist. It was just {{at this time that}} he elaborated the first foundations of his present system. We saw each other fairly often, for I respected him much for his learning and his passionate and serious devotion (always mixed, however, with personal vanity) to the cause of the proletariat, and I sought eagerly his conversation, which was always instructive and clever, when it was not inspired by a paltry hate, which, alas! happened only too often. But there was never any frank intimacy between as. Our temperaments would not suffer it. He called me a sentimental idealist, and he <b>was</b> right; <b>I</b> called him a vain man, perfidious and crafty, and <b>I</b> also <b>was</b> right.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. There {{are three}} boys and two girls, all <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> to <b>be</b> looked out for, {{and he has}} all he can carry. Besides, she needs me right here and right now, and if I can do {{anything}} to make life easier for her I'm going t' do it. Besides," [...] he ended, in a peculiar tone, [...] "we don't feel as if we could live apart much longer." ...|$|R
60|$|Tears of mingled rage, grief, and {{helplessness}} {{came into}} my eyes as I spoke thus hotly, and I wheeled around quickly lest this stranger, seeing them, should set me down for a <b>younger</b> lad <b>than</b> <b>I</b> really <b>was.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Look at her, Harry," [...] whispers Beatrix, running up, and {{speaking}} in her sweet low tones. [...] "Doesn't the blush become her? Isn't she pretty? She looks <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and I am sure {{she is a}} hundred million thousand times better." ...|$|E
6000|$|If I were {{fifteen years}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> how happy I {{would be to}} [...] come over to my beloved England once more, and see you {{surrounded}} [...] by your sons and daughters, loved, admired, I would almost say [...] worshipped, by a whole grateful nation.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They're playful, Bella my dear; they're playful. They're {{more or less}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> and they're playful. What does it matter? It {{might be}} Surly, or Sulky, or fifty disagreeable things that I really shouldn't like to be considered. But Rumty! Lor, why not Rumty?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I used electricity," [...] she said. [...] "Now don't {{start as}} if you had a shock of it. That's what I used. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> then, and {{sometimes}} visited friends in the city, we often amused ourselves by rubbing our feet on the carpet until we got ourselves so full of electricity that we could put up our fingers and light the gas. So I said to myself that if I could get full of electricity for the purpose of lightin' the gas I could get full of it for other purposes, and so, without losin' a moment, I set to work. I stood up on one of the seats, which <b>was</b> dry, and <b>I</b> rubbed the bottoms of my shoes backward and forward on it with such violence and swiftness that they pretty soon got warm and I began fillin' with electricity, and when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fully charged with it from my toes to the top of my head, I just sprang into the water and swam ashore. Of course I couldn't sink, bein' full of electricity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. There {{are three}} boys and two girls, all <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> to <b>be</b> looked out for, {{and he has}} all he can carry. Besides, she needs me right here and right now. Two {{delicate}} women struggling along; suppose one of 'em should fall sick? I tell you they need me, and if I can {{do anything to make}} life easy, or easier, I'm going t' do it. Besides," [...] he ended in a peculiar tone, [...] "we don't feel as if we could live apart much longer." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Patrick O'Brian's novel The Surgeon's Mate, Stephen Maturin {{reflects}} on his friend Sir Joseph Blain's lament for his diminished sexual appetite. Blaine comments “You <b>are</b> a <b>younger</b> man <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> Maturin, {{and it may}} be that you do not know from experience that the absence of torment may be a worse torment still: you may wish to throw a hair shirt aside, not realizing that it is the hair shirt alone that keeps you warm. 'A Nessus' Shirt might be more apt' said Stephen, quite unheard." ...|$|R
