2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E
60|$|Because--because {{nobody ever}} said it was. <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> manufactory.|$|E
6000|$|... "As to that, I cannot {{so readily}} answer. If by {{abolitionist}} <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> zealot, I am none; but if <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> man, who, being a man, feels for all men, slaves included, and by any lawful act, opposed to nobody's interest, and therefore, rousing nobody's enmity, would willingly abolish suffering (supposing it, in its degree, to exist) from among mankind, irrespective of color, then am I what you say." ...|$|E
60|$|Flo. I warrant, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} whining lover; but I {{must have}} other proofs of love, ere I believe it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A native?" [...] {{repeated}} his companion, whose scenery had of late been chiefly of shellfish, [...] "what the deuce! Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>an</b> oyster?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>an</b> in-shore, high-latitude fellow. But {{what would}} you say to a shark as long as one of those pines on the mountain?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A window?' Nutty's {{brain was}} a little {{fatigued}} and he felt himself unequal to grasping this. 'How do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>a</b> window?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Jovita (musing). A drunkard! (Aside.) There was Diego, {{he was a}} drunkard; but he was faithless. (Aloud.) <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> weak, faithless drunkard? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Always {{understood}} that their gifts lay in their legs {{and not in}} their throats. But perhaps <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> prima donna," [...] remarked Stephen reflectively.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by [...] "it is {{a picture}} of a horse?"' she cried at her sister. 'What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by <b>a</b> horse? <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> <b>an</b> idea <b>you</b> have in YOUR head, and which you want to see represented. There is another idea altogether, quite another idea. Call it a horse if you like, or say it is not a horse. I have just as much right to say that YOUR horse isn't a horse, that it is a falsity of your own make-up.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, what do <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>As</b> to your {{notions of}} a vocation, ninety-nine {{out of a}} hundred are in my case. I have been bred up to this--nothing else is open--I mean to do my duty; and surely that is vocation--no one {{has a right to}} object--' ...|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[With amused sarcasm.] I see. <b>You</b> <b>mean</b> you're <b>a</b> lady-killer {{and they}} all fall for you.|$|R
6000|$|Lieutenant D'Hubert was surprised. [...] "A call! Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> call on a lady? The cheek of the man. But how do {{you know}} this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Clairvoyante!" [...] {{repeated}} the first unseen speaker, who, by his clean intonation, Millicent set {{down as a}} newly-arrived Englishman. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> professional soothsayer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> real, live ram?" [...] {{questioned}} Andrew Dale, with {{a slight}} smile on his face--that smile which made all the boys his friends.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think, my dear, {{that that}} is nonsense. You see company here, just as other people do in the country;--and as for not {{standing}} it, I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>As</b> long as <b>you</b> are one of your papa's family of course you must live where he lives.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>a</b> gang of hunted outlaws--bandits--have {{actually}} {{taken refuge}} somewhere in my house?" [...] demanded Madeline.|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. How clever you are, my dear! <b>You</b> never <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> {{single word}} <b>you</b> say.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By which <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> {{quartering}} of our shield,' said Ivinghoe. 'Of {{course it}} is the Clipp bearing. Or, two lions azure, regardant combatant, their tails couped.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> {{change of}} administration, the {{upsetting}} of a stage, or {{the death of}} a cart-horse; they are all equally crisises, in the American vocabulary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> cordial, I'll {{have some}} of that green stuff," [...] she decided. [...] "Don't know when I shall get another dinner like this again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, have it; {{perhaps you}} ought. Yes, I dare say it's right. What did <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by <b>a</b> family dinner seeming significant?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can {{understand}} why I'm interested, then. When you say you're <b>a</b> plant, <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> you're not capable of mobility? Or do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> you're <b>a</b> vegetable, {{as opposed to an}} animal? Or just what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} what <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by <b>a</b> hero; if <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> such men as Washington, Greene, or Warren, all are surely not so. These were heroes in deeds, but {{others may be}} equally brave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Mr. Lavender, bewildered; [...] "Joe, <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>A</b> good fellow. He has in him {{the sort}} of heroism which I admire more than any other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Laugh at you?--with you, <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>A</b> convent? Pooh, pooh! The old Prefect {{has enough}} sense, I will warrant him, not to refuse {{a good match}} for his child.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> real child?" [...] I says, [...] "a human child?" [...] Some {{folks have}} such a silly way of talking about their dogs--you never can tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>a</b> {{grandson}} of Henry Esmond, {{the master of}} this house, has been here, and none of you have offered him hospitality?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It helped Milly for {{the moment}} to the {{convenience}} of a puzzled pause. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> he's <b>an</b> acquaintance of whom you disapprove for her?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{reserved}} Englishwoman took up Mr Meagles in {{his last}} remark. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>a</b> prisoner forgives his prison?' said she, slowly and with emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> penny stamp?" [...] Mrs. Donovan, {{especially}} at departure, always observed all {{the forms of}} amity. [...] "You can't do it alone, my darling," [...] she declared.|$|E
60|$|BRASSBOUND. Your brother's, <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>A</b> {{man should}} wear his own clothes; {{and a man}} should tell his own lies. I'm sorry you had to tell mine for me to-day.|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>a</b> big street," [...] grumbled Tommy, who {{was going}} over proofs, [...] "why not say a big street? Why must you always call it a 'main artery'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yah!" [...] screamed {{the hapless}} woman, who (as the rest saw) heard {{perfectly}} well. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> frightening <b>a</b> lady in that way? Deaf, indeed!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> that <b>a</b> {{woman who}} had in her {{possession}} some article with my crest on it, and who had a child with her, died in your house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by <b>an</b> alliance," [...] said Mrs. Penniman. [...] "I take a great {{interest}} in Mr. Townsend; I won't conceal that. But that's all." ...|$|R
