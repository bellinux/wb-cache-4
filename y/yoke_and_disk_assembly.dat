40|$|The Optical Multi-Access (OMA) Terminal {{is capable}} of {{establishing}} up to six simultaneous high-data-rate communication links between low-Earth-orbit satellites and a host satellite at synchronous orbit with only one 16 -inch-diameter antenna on the synchronous satellite. The advantage over equivalent RF systems in space weight, power, and swept volume is great when applied to NASA satellite communications networks. A photograph of the 3 -channel prototype constructed under the present contract to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept is presented. The telescope has a 10 -inch clear aperture and a 22 deg full field of view. It consists of 4 refractive elements to achieve a telecentric focus, i. e., the focused beam is normal to the focal plane at all field angles. This feature permits image pick-up optics in the focal plane to track satellite images without tilting their optic axes to accommodate field angle. The geometry of the imager-pick-up concept and the coordinate system of the swinging arm <b>and</b> <b>disk</b> mechanism for image pick-up are shown. Optics in the arm relay the telescope focus to a communications and tracking receiver and introduce the transmitted beacon beam on a path collinear with the receive path. The electronic circuits for the communications and tracking receivers are contained on the arm <b>and</b> <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> <b>and</b> relay signals to an associated PC-based operator's console {{for control of the}} arm <b>and</b> <b>disk</b> motor drive through a flexible cable which permits +/- 240 deg travel for each arm <b>and</b> <b>disk</b> <b>assembly.</b> Power supplies <b>and</b> laser transmitters are mounted in the cradle for the telescope. A single-mode fiber in the cable is used to carry the laser transmitter signal to the arm optics. The promise of the optical multi-access terminal towards which the prototype effort worked is shown. The emphasis in the prototype development was the demonstration of the unique aspect of the concept, and where possible, cost avoidance compromises were implemented in areas already proven on other programs. The design details are described in section 2, the prototype test results in section 3, additional development required in section 4, and conclusions in section 5...|$|R

40|$|Planar linear motors {{have been}} shown to be capable of fast {{accurate}} 2 -DOF motions making them useful for assembly tasks. However, the lack of sensing capability has limited their applications. Previous planar motor sensors have been precise but bulky and sensed only a single direction of motion. We present a small integrated 3 -DOF sensor capable of 0. 2 Â¯m position resolution (1 oe) which has been integrated with an existing planar linear motor without changing its overall size. Physical design of the sensor is presented as well as the custom electronics used to attain a low-noise DC output from the small signal levels of the sensor. Finally, we present results that demonstrate the resolution and accuracy of the complete sensor system. 1 Introduction As electromechanical products have decreased in size, manufacturing them has become more challenging.

40|$|Bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{are very}} {{important}} parts in auto engine and gas turbine, and is widely used in practical engineering. The mistuning existing commonly in the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> can destroy the vibration characteristics of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies,</b> {{which is one of}} the reasons for the high cycle fatigue failure of bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies,</b> so it is necessary to research how to reduce the vibration of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies.</b> On the basis of the review of relevant research at home and abroad, the mistuning vibration mechanism of the bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> is introduced, <b>and</b> the main technical methods of the vibration damping of bladed <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> are reviewed, such as artificially active mistuning, collision damping, friction damping and optimization of the blade position.

40|$|Shown in Figure 1 is a {{side view}} of the D 0 F-disk assembly. SVX II chips are mounted to a flex copper/kapton Circuit, which is glued to a {{beryllium}} substrate. Figure 1 shows the top <b>and</b> bottom <b>disk</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted on the cooling channel. However the disks are not mounted directly opposite one another as shown, but alternately rotate through 30 {sup o} wedges mounted {{on either side of}} the cooling channel. The assumed channel temperature for these calculations is 0 C, as in the cases of the ladder cooling calculations, ref. [1] and [2]. The assumed SVX II chip power is 0. 400 W. The finite difference method is used to calculate the temperature profiles of the various components. It is described in Ref. [1]. Each disk is read out using SVX II chips on both sides of the silicon. The silicon is 59. 2 mm wide at its widest location. The SVX II chip location opposite the cooling channel has 8 chips mounted on the hybrid. and there are 6 SVX II chips mounted outboard of the cooling channel on the same side as the cooling channel. The SVX II chips mounted on the same side as the cooling channel read out the silicon via a jumper which passes between the beryllium substrate and the cooling channel. Currently there are two substrate materials under consideration for the jumper; kapton/copper and silicon/aluminum. The two materials have different thermal properties. so both will be considered in this note in order to compare their performance in the two different assemblies. The silicon jumper is assumed to be 0. 3 mm thick with a thermal conductivity of 0. 15 W/mm-K. The kapton/copper flex circuit is assumed to be 0. 075 mm in thickness, with 1 / 2 oz copper traces (a thickness of 0. 017 mm copper with 0. 4 W/m-K thermal conductivity) along the length. The thermal conductivity of kapton is 0. 12 E- 3 W/mm-K [3]. The F-Disk region is occupied by cables which extend from the barrel ladders. The cables dissipate power [4] and will contribute to warming the gas. The SVX IT chips on both the <b>disks</b> <b>and</b> the ladders will also contribute to warming the gas. In addition, this region will not be perfectly insulated from the surrounding gas, which is considerably warmer than the cooling channel. The exposed cooling channels (bulkhead <b>and</b> <b>disk</b> mount channels). on the other hand, will contribute to cooling the gas in this region. The gas temperature in which the disks reside is not known due to all these uncertainties. The range of gas temperatures considered for this thermal analysis is 10 - 15 C [5]. Figures 3 and 4 show the expected temperature profile in the various <b>disk</b> <b>assembly</b> components during operation of the SVX II chips...|$|R
