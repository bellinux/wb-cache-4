5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> the majority of incidents occur {{in the first year}} of life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>age,</b> <b>and</b> there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E
