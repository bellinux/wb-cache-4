500|$|A. A. Gill {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Sunday Times after {{the move to}} the Oak Room in late 1997. He summarised his visit by saying that [...] "If {{you are interested in}} the pursuit of excellence, then a table at the Oak Room is as high as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> this country, and close to as high as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the world." [...] He recommended the starters of red mullet soup, the ballotine of salmon, and the chicken oyster served with a celeriac remoulade. He called his main course [...] "utterly simple and completely perfect"; it consisted of roast partridge with choucroute garnie. He called the interior of the dining room [...] "soft and thick and luxurious", adding that a painting by Mark Gertler and three bronzes by Rembrandt Bugatti were [...] "worth the entrance fee alone".|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Winters {{became his}} [...] "idol" [...] early in life; Williams {{first saw him}} on {{television}} at age 8 and paid him homage in interviews throughout his career. Williams was inspired by Winters's ingenuity, realizing, he said, [...] "that anything is possible, that anything is funny He gave me {{the idea that it}} can be free-form, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and out of things pretty easily." ...|$|E
5000|$|The tower or its {{interior}} {{has been seen}} in the films Prizzi's Honor, Catch Me if <b>You</b> <b>Can,</b> <b>Going</b> <b>in</b> Style (2017), the music video [...] "Empire State of Mind", and the TV shows Pan Am, Law & Order, Bored to Death, White Collar, Gossip Girl, and Boardwalk Empire.|$|R
5000|$|... present {{permission}} (<b>in</b> informal speech): <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> now. <b>In</b> {{the past}} tense one can use could (When I was a child, according to my parents' rules I could swim once a week).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the video}} game Test Drive Unlimited 2 (2011), the club {{can be seen from}} the outside in Eivissa, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> not <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> A sign outside says [...] "Pure Pacha. Every Friday Night." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E
60|$|Madam, {{with this}} ring <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and out as you please; {{it is the}} Duchess's own ring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they {{advertise}} it for to-morrow, too," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the afternoon {{when we are}} at the offices." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here we are," [...] said Tom Shocker, as {{he stopped}} in front of a door {{at the back of the}} hallway on the third floor of the building. [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> right <b>in.</b> He's on the bed with his broken ankle." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not long}} before she saw Alick walking along the terrace above the croquet players, evidently in quest of her. [...] "How is it with you?" [...] he anxiously asked; [...] "you know <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> home <b>in</b> a moment if you have had enough of this." ...|$|R
50|$|From Winter Park to Fraser, {{the river}} can be {{accessed}} by the Fraser River Trail (hiking or mountain bikes), from USFS campgrounds, or road turnouts. The only exception is as the river flows through private land {{in the town of}} Winter Park. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> fishing <b>in</b> the forested lands, or where the river starts into the valley.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{but that}} will make no difference," [...] said the vetturino. [...] "You see I'm a return, and I will take you about as cheap as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> a small carriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has gone}} to bed, too," [...] said his mother; [...] "but she is not asleep, and I presume she will be very glad to see you. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> her room." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good. I {{will take}} your word for it, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and come out as you like without being watched, and you need not fear that we shall pay you another visit." ...|$|E
50|$|On November 24, 2009, Sambora {{launched}} charitable effort <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Go</b> Home <b>in</b> {{his home}} town of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, which unveiled a street renamed Richie Sambora Way. He also donated funds to renovate part of his alma mater Woodbridge High School, which opened a new weight room, the Adam Sambora Fitness Center, dedicated to Sambora's father.|$|R
6000|$|... "But there's {{no sense}} in going {{for it in the}} dead of night," [...] I objected. [...] "It will be quite safe. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> for it <b>in</b> the morning." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{summer season}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> for a canoe {{trip on the}} small and {{beautiful}} lakes surrounding the Outokumpu Nature Park. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> also <b>go</b> fishing <b>in</b> Children's fishing Oasis and rent a beach sauna from touristic services.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] she replied, [...] "if a {{stranger}} to his intrigues, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> safety to Garschattachin and his party without fear of being detained, and carry them {{a message from the}} wife of the MacGregor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Harry. In the world! (Boastful.) There's {{hardly a}} place <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> {{the world where}} you wouldn't find {{somebody}} that did care for Harry Hagberd. (Pause.) I'm not {{of the sort that}} go about skulking under false names.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jim's right," [...] the {{man behind}} the bar agreed. [...] "He's a very nasty customer, Bill the Tanner, sir. If he's coming down, I'd clear out for a moment. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the guvnor's sitting-room, if you like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'll {{tell you}} what, Larkins, I can't think how a fellow like <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> and give <b>in</b> to these sneaking, underhand tricks {{that make you}} ashamed to look one in the face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is one way}} still, I think," [...] {{said the}} third of the {{speakers}} in this scene. [...] "Let Lord Highgate come to Rosebury in his own name, leaving that of Mr. Harris behind him. If Sir Barnes Newcome wants <b>you,</b> he <b>can</b> seek <b>you</b> there. If you will go, as go you should, and God speed <b>you,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go,</b> and <b>in</b> your own name, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Genteel folks!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Lecks, indignantly. [...] "If you're {{too proud}} to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> as you are, Barb'ry Aleshine, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> set <b>in</b> the sun till you're dry. As for me, I'm goin' {{to ask for the}} lady of the house, and if she don't like me she can lump me, so long as she gives me somethin' to eat and a dry bed to get into." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir, {{he told me}} so--a handsome, slim, upright gentleman, in green-and-gold. In {{your old}} room up yonder, sir. No doubt <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> sir,' said John, walking {{backwards}} into the road and {{looking up at the}} window. 'He hasn't put out his candles yet, I see.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A little, I think," [...] she returned, smiling; [...] "now, what I {{wish you}} to do is to make Uncle Fenelon put into Far Harbor. If he refuses, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> in spite of him, since you and Mr. Farrar {{are the only ones who}} can sail. You have the {{situation}} in your own hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In a {{very few}} minutes she returned. 'If you gentlemen don't mind,' said she, 'I can give you your dinner here at the same price you'd have to pay {{anywhere}} else. I always cook a lot on Mondays, so's I can have something cold {{for the rest of}} the week. It's on the table now, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> and wait on yourselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Songbird is in trouble, Tom," [...] {{returned}} the brother. [...] "Are you {{going up to}} the college? If <b>you</b> are <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> with us <b>in</b> the automobile and we'll {{tell you all about it}} on the way." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{underground}} mortuary vaults {{of the old}} Cathedral were {{featured on}} the Secrets of New York episode [...] "Deep NY - How Low <b>Can</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> the Big Apple", on NYCTV.|$|R
50|$|The town is {{the centre}} of tourism - <b>in</b> winter <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> skiing, <b>in</b> summer <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> cycling, bicycle touring or bathing. The {{well-known}} Divisov-Sázava Cycle Route {{is part of an}} international network of cycling routes all over Europe. One of the main reasons however for its popularity is probably {{the fact that there are}} no significant level changes from Divišov on. It is practically downhill all the way from Divišov to Kutná Hora. Gliding, paragliding and hang gliding are also popular sports in the Divisov Region.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{that you will not}} think it very polite in me to propose it," [...] said Mrs. Gray, [...] "but it is this: that when we get into the museum, we should divide into two parties. Let Rollo go with me and the children, while you join your friends the students, and {{accompany}} them. Then we can go through the rooms in our way, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, pussy," [...] the squire said, {{when they}} had finished, [...] "you must amuse {{yourself}} for a bit. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the garden again, or sit with Mrs. Morcombe in her room. She will look you out some picture books from the library. I am afraid there is nothing very suited to your reading, but we will soon put all that right. Your grandfather and I want to have another quiet chat together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can show}} you her house {{at least in the}} meanwhile; and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> {{yourself}} when you will. I do not ask to enter. Come! I feel certain that my finding her is in some way bound up with Pelagia. Had I not met her on the Nile, had you not met her in the street, I might never have heard that I had a sister. And if she went with Miriam, Pelagia must know her--she may be in that very house at this moment!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She needn't know. I {{will tell}} her you've {{been out of}} your mind. I'll say {{anything}} <b>you</b> wish! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to her <b>in</b> the clothes you have on if you like--she will not recognize you as the prisoner I held the other night. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> have your beard trimmed, and not even the justice will know you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] the old {{man said}} to Frank, [...] "you can take these out into the back yard and skin them. Then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> to work <b>in</b> that back room. You will find arsenical soap, cotton wool, wires, and {{everything}} else you require there. This has been a fine cat," [...] he said, looking at the animal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] {{the captain}} said; [...] "that is settled. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> on shore <b>in</b> the next boat, and I shall {{advise you to}} take the opportunity, for I warn you that you will not get the chance of {{rambling}} on shore again until we return here next time. You need not come on board before to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
