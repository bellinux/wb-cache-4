At an October 2, 1990, protest to raise attention for McGovern’s lawsuit, two hundred ACT UP protestors gathered in Washington and chanted “How many more have to die before <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> qualify,” and carried posters to the rally with the tagline “Women Don’t Get AIDS/ They Just Die From It.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
