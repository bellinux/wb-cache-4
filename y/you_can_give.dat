500|$|Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush {{of lying}} and {{comparing}} {{the governor to}} Bill Clinton, which Bush said was [...] "about as low a blow as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> in a Republican primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, {{that he was a}} homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days.

[...] He stated that [...] "the whole point of the book is to raise awareness about the kiddie-sex tourism business in Thailand". Though the story uses more realism than the escapism typically associated with superhero fiction, Vachss did end the book with endorsements of two real non-profit groups; Don't! Buy! Thai! and End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism. The writing is not subtle, as Vachss noted [...] "If you don't get angry, you're not going to do anything". Understanding that the likely readers were young males with short attention spans, Vachss tried to be dramatic by using what author Adam Begley calls [...] "a motivational hat trick: sympathy for the victims, revenge, and a family calling".|$|E

500|$|It was {{nevertheless}} critically panned at the time. Various contemporary critics condemned {{what they}} {{deemed to be}} the political apathy of the story; as they pointed out, Hergé's depiction of regime change in San Theodores does not bring about any improvement for the nation's populace, with the critics from Belgium's Hebdo 76 and France's Révolution thereby characterising it as a reactionary work. On this front, Tintin in the Picaros was defended by the French philosopher Michel Serres, who stated that [...] "The criticism that has been leveled at Picaros is astonishing. There is no talk of revolution; the {{people are in the}} favelas, and they stay there. It is only a government overthrow. A general, aided by several assassins, takes the place of a general protected by his own bodyguards. This is why it is only repetition; it is just a movement reduced to this. And that is the chloroform; it is what we see everywhere. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> as many modern examples of the Alcazar-Tapioca rivalry, or of double identities, as you want." [...] In June 1977, Hergé travelled to Britain for Methuen's launch of the story's English translation, where he spent two weeks giving interviews and attending book signings.|$|E
500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J.

[...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> in a Republican primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain." [...] An unidentified party began a semi-underground smear campaign against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, audience plants, and the like. [...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls. During a break in a debate, Bush put his hand on McCain's arm and reiterated that he had no involvement in the attacks; McCain replied, [...] "Don't give me that shit.

2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff had in {{this building}} process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter.

You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> their works color. That is the most important thing for me in my interpretations, color. So you make music live. Without color it is dead." [...] Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.|$|E

2500|$|Visually, the {{presentation}} of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as [...] "bombardment". Rogers also believed in not acting out a different persona on camera compared to how he acted off camera, stating that [...] "One of the greatest gifts <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> anybody is the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away." [...] Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and skits. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the Gulf War (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise {{to take care of their}} own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Northcliffe's {{role was}} critical, {{as was the}} use Lloyd George made of him, and of the press in general. Northcliffe's {{involvement}} also highlights the limitations of both Aitken's and Lloyd George's accounts of Asquith's fall. Both minimised Northcliffe's part in the events. In his War Memoirs, Lloyd George stated emphatically [...] "Lord Northcliffe was never, at any stage, brought into our consultations." [...] Aitken supported this; [...] "Lord Northcliffe was not in active co-operation with Lloyd George." [...] But these claims are contradicted by others. In their biography of Northcliffe, Pound and Harmsworth record Northcliffe's brother Rothermere writing contemporaneously; [...] "Alfred has been actively at work with Ll.G. {{with a view to}} bringing about a change." [...] Riddell wrote in his diary for 27 May 1916: [...] "LG never mentions directly that he sees Northcliffe but I am sure they are in daily contact." [...] Margot Asquith was also certain of Northcliffe's role, and of Lloyd George's involvement, although she obscured both of their names when writing in her diary; [...] "I only hope the man responsible for giving information to Lord N- will be heavily punished: God may forgive him; I never can." [...] They are also contradicted by events; Northcliffe met with Lloyd George on each of the three days just prior to Lloyd George's resignation, on 1, 2, and 3 December, including two meetings on 1 December, both before and after Lloyd George put his revised proposals for the War Council to Asquith. It seems improbable that ongoing events were not discussed and that the two men confined their conversations to negotiating article circulation rights for Lloyd George once he had resigned, as Pound and Harmsworth weakly suggest. The attempts made by others to use Northcliffe and the wider press also merit consideration. In this regard, some senior military officers were extremely active. Robertson, for example, wrote to Northcliffe in October 1916, [...] "The Boche gives me no trouble compared with what I meet in London. So any help <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>give</b> me will be of Imperial value." [...] Lastly, the actions of Northcliffe's newspapers must be considered—in particular The Times editorial on 4 December which led Asquith to reject Lloyd George's final War Council proposals. Thompson, Northcliffe's most recent biographer, concludes; [...] "From the evidence, it appears that Northcliffe and his newspapers should be given more credit than they have generally received for the demise of the Asquith government in December 1916." ...|$|E
