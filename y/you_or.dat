5|$|Friends and comrades, {{the light}} {{has gone out}} of our lives, and there is {{darkness}} everywhere, and I do not quite know what to tell <b>you</b> <b>or</b> how to say it. Our beloved leader, Bapu as we called him, the father of the nation, is no more. Perhaps I am wrong to say that; nevertheless, we will not see him again, as we have seen him for these many years, we will not run to him for advice or seek solace from him, and that is a terrible blow, not only for me, but for millions and millions in this country.|$|E

("Who is the Monster, <b>You</b> <b>or</b> I?"). In 1995, the film was awarded the Bavarian Film Award for best documentary.|$|E
25|$|I do feel strongly, {{after my}} {{subcommittee}} has carefully and objectively reviewed this case from both sides, that injustice rather than justice has been served. The Moon case sends a strong signal that if one's views are unpopular enough, {{this country will}} find a way not to tolerate, but to convict. I don't believe that <b>you</b> <b>or</b> I or anyone else, no matter how innocent, could realistically prevail against the combined forces of our Justice Department and judicial branch in a case such as Reverend Moon's.|$|E

25|$|When {{the angels}} heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore {{to them by}} the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see <b>you</b> <b>or</b> your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her {{children}} die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.|$|E

25|$|The control yokes also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are yokes where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards <b>you</b> <b>or</b> away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|E
25|$|To you the IRA and all {{who support}} <b>you</b> <b>or</b> defend you, {{we have to}} say that we feel dirty today. Foul and dirty deeds by Irishmen are making Ireland a foul and dirty place, for it is things done by Irishmen that make us unclean. What the British could never do, what the Unionists could never do, you have done. You have made us bow our heads in shame and that is a dirty feeling. The IRA is like a cancer in the body of Ireland, {{spreading}} death, killing and corruption. It is the unrelenting enemy of life and the community is afraid because it cannot see or identify it. We want the cancer of the IRA removed from our midst but not by means that will leave the moral fibre of society damaged and the system unclean. Fighting evil by corrupt means kills pawns like Joe and leaves every one of us vulnerable and afraid. And it allows Joe's killers to draw a sickening veneer of respectability over cold-blooded murder and to wash their hands like Pontius Pilate.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Adams {{repeatedly}} {{tried to}} turn the correspondence {{to a discussion of}} their actions in the political arena. Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that [...] "nothing new can be added by <b>you</b> <b>or</b> me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age." [...] Adams made one more attempt, writing that [...] "You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other. Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{his short}} career in politics, Milk became an icon in San Francisco and a martyr {{in the gay}} community. In 2002, Milk was called [...] "the most famous and most {{significantly}} open LGBT official ever elected in the United States". Anne Kronenberg, his final campaign manager, wrote of him: [...] "What set Harvey apart from <b>you</b> <b>or</b> me {{was that he was}} a visionary. He imagined a righteous world inside his head and then he set about to create it for real, for all of us." [...] Milk was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009.|$|E
500|$|At that time, Madonna {{was dating}} British writer Andy Bird {{whom she had}} met during her Ray of Light (1998) album era. After {{the two of them}} split up, Madonna penned a song called [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] {{inspired}} by him, which she left in Bird's answering machine. [...] "I've written a song called 'Beautiful Stranger' and it's all about you. I hope you'll hear it one day because I'll never forget <b>you</b> <b>or</b> stop loving you", Madonna said in her message. [...] "Beautiful Stranger" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Madonna with William Orbit whom she had collaborated on Ray of Light.|$|E
500|$|In February 2007 {{the suits}} were settled {{out-of-court}} for undisclosed terms. Stephen F. DeAntonio, {{attorney for the}} plaintiffs, said that his clients felt [...] "totally vindicated." [...] W. W. Norton did not publicly retract or repudiate any of the material in Thompson's book, however, instead sending {{a letter to the}} plaintiffs stating, in part, [...] "To the extent you believe the book implies that any of you were engaged in a cover-up, were incompetent, committed criminal acts, violated Naval regulations or exhibited faulty seamanship or professional ineptitude, Norton regrets the emotional distress experienced by <b>you</b> <b>or</b> your family." ...|$|E

500|$|... "There is {{something}} very moral about Lecter in this film," [...] said Scott in his audio commentary. [...] "The behaviour of Hannibal is never insane— didn't want to use that excuse. Is he insane? No, I think he's as sane as <b>you</b> <b>or</b> I. He just likes it." [...] Scott did say, however, [...] "In our normal terms, he's truly evil." [...] Scott also brings up the notion of absolution in reference to Lecter towards the film's end. Verger has one overriding objective in life: to capture Lecter and subject him to a slow, painful death.|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{was photographed}} by Daniel Kramer {{several weeks before}} the {{recording}} sessions. Kramer captured Dylan sitting on the stoop of the apartment of his manager, Albert Grossman, located in Gramercy Park, New York, placing Dylan's friend Bob Neuwirth [...] behind Dylan [...] "to give it extra color". Dylan wears a Triumph motorcycle T-shirt under a blue and purple silk shirt, holding his Ray-Ban sunglasses in his right hand. Photographer Kramer commented in 2010 on the singer's expression: [...] "He's hostile, or it's a hostile moodiness. He's almost challenging me or <b>you</b> <b>or</b> whoever's looking at it: 'What are you gonna do about it, buster? ...|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{stated that}} he tried smoking {{cannabis}} ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and [...] "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin {{or any of that}} other stuff." [...] Zappa stated, [...] "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> does something that would affect your life that you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." [...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E

500|$|The aircraft's {{offensive}} capabilities were sarcastically {{referred to}} as a [...] "Triple Threat" [...] — it could bomb you, strafe <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> fall on you. Positive aspects, such as the F-105's responsive controls, strong performance at high speed and low altitude, and its outfit of electronics won over some pilots. For some, [...] "Thud" [...] was a term of endearment; retroactively the RF-84F Thunderflash became known as [...] "Thud's Mother". F-105 pilot Colonel Jack Broughton said of the nickname: [...] "The Thud has justified herself, and the name that was originally spoken with a sneer has become one of utmost respect through the air fraternity".|$|E
500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really <b>you,</b> <b>or</b> express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E
500|$|Davis' given {{names are}} Isaac and Benjamin (after his mother's two grandfathers). [...] Although Davis does not {{practice}} Judaism and is non-religious, he stated: [...] "I am {{really proud of}} my Jewish heritage" [...] and describes himself as [...] "culturally Jewish." [...] He reflected: [...] "It's funny about Judaism; It doesn’t matter if you're ultra-religious or not, {{as long as you}} know that it's in <b>you</b> <b>or</b> you're a part of it, everyone accepts you." [...] He often uses the Jewish greeting [...] "shalom". [...] Davis states: [...] "I'm glad Jewish kids get to see they can grow up to be professional baseball players." [...] Davis followed four other players of Jewish heritage on the Mets: Art Shamsky, Shawn Green, Scott Schoeneweis, and Josh Satin.|$|E
