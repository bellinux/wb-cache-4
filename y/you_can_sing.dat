500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was our religion, our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> about. It's just my DNA." ...|$|E
500|$|Buffy's {{numbers are}} the most complex, {{changing}} key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never would. This appears specifically in [...] "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: [...] "We'll sing a happy song / And <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work..." [...] While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not {{to give her a}} song, but [...] "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as [...] "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" [...] that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals [...] "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven" [...] with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats [...] "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word [...] "living." ...|$|E
500|$|Usher's stage {{performances}} {{have been}} complimented by critics for being [...] "packed with high-octane choreography {{held together by}} sleek, masterful showmanship", and his engaging skill with audiences being [...] "enough {{to pull off a}} one-man show". His performances and dancing technique have often marked comparisons to his influences Michael Jackson and James Brown. He told People Magazine in 2008 that [...] "James Brown introduced me to soul. Because of him I was given a clear view of what a real performance is and should be. I learned showmanship from him." [...] On his 8701 Evolution Tour in 2002, Larry Nager of The Cincinnati Enquirer hailed Usher's simultaneous ability, stating [...] "the 23-year-old Atlantan proved <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> and dance at the same time. Of course, that's how James Brown, Jackie Wilson and Usher's most obvious role model Michael Jackson did it, but in today's high-tech, gimmicky concerts, it's a lost art", and claims his show [...] "ended the reign of 'Nsync, Britney {{and the rest of the}} lip-synching, teen-pop acts". Usher performed singles [...] "Confessions Part II" [...] and [...] "Yeah!" [...] at 2004 MTV Video Music Awards under a rain machine, in which he eventually threw the mic stand at a mirror during the former. Rolling Stone placed it at number 13 of their [...] "20 Best MTV VMAs Opening Performances". Chad Batka for The New York Times said [...] "He has established himself as one of R's supreme performers and craftsmen, following through on what he learned from Michael Jackson in particular: songs that alternate between choppy and smooth, vocals punctuated by exultant high whoops, a dance vocabulary." [...] Capable of playing the piano, Usher also began to adopt playing on other instruments such as the drums and the bass guitar, amid singles [...] "Good Kisser" [...] and [...] "She Came to Give It to You" [...] in 2014. The UR Experience Tour was reported to have consisted of a nine-piece band and three backing vocalists according to Billboard, in which The Guardian called him [...] "a masterful all-rounder who surrounds himself with talent on stage". Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone labels him the [...] "Award Show King", explaining [...] "His dedication to choreography dates back to the days when Janet Jackson made videos that looked like they were shot in one take. He's an entertainer that would have been stunning at any point in the last 60 years of television." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1975, {{the song}} had a regular {{place as the}} finale of every Led Zeppelin concert. However, after their concert tour of the United States in 1977, Plant began to tire of [...] "Stairway to Heaven": [...] "There's only so many times <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> it and mean it ... It just became sanctimonious." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{medley of}} [...] "Kansas City" [...] and [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey" [...] was sequenced {{as the final}} song on side one of the LP. In McCartney's description, his {{performance}} on the track required [...] "a great deal of nerve to just jump up and scream like an idiot"; his efforts were egged on by Lennon, who [...] "would go, 'Come on! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> it better than that, man! Come on, come on! Really throw it!'" [...] The medley was inspired by Little Richard, who similarly combined Leiber and Stoller's [...] "Kansas City" [...] with his own composition, [...] "Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!" [...] Riley considers that, although McCartney's presence on Beatles for Sale appears relatively slight next to Lennon's, his performance of [...] "Kansas City" [...] goes some way to readdressing the balance. Hertsgaard says that the irony evident in Harrison's delivery of [...] "Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby" [...] "allows the Beatles to close the album with a not-so-veiled comment on the oddities of living inside Beatlemania".|$|E

2500|$|Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone placed [...] "Good for You" [...] {{at number}} 18 in his mid-year list of [...] "The Best Songs of 2015 So Far", saying, [...] "Somewhere, the late, great Lesley Gore is smiling". In a similar list raking the 15 best pop songs of same time, Lindner ranked it at number five {{describing}} the song as [...] "like you're wading through dark water {{with just the}} gleam of a treasure chest underneath". She called it [...] "a truly unique pop song" [...] and concluded, [...] "it's weird enough with a meandering melody, but it still has those repeated words <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>sing</b> along with and get stuck in your head". Entertainment Weeklys Kevin O'Donnell placed the song at the sixth position amid the 40 best of 2015, hailing it as [...] "blush-inducing, seductive" [...] and describing the track as [...] "the defining soundtrack for every late-night post-club comedown". Stereogum's Chris DeVille considered it as sixth best {{of the year and}} wrote it [...] "intensifies the smolder" [...] of the [...] "nice lane" [...] in the sound Gomez began with on [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants".|$|E

Even had you felt careless about your own affliction, you might have refrained from singing out of sheer pity for mine. God! if I were a man in such a position I would curse rather than sing." ...|$|E
