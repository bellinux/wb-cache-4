25|$|If <b>you</b> <b>climb</b> a {{mountain}} {{for the first}} time and die on the descent, is it really a complete first ascent of the mountain? I am rather inclined to think personally that maybe it is quite important, the getting down, and the complete climb of {{a mountain}} is reaching the summit and getting safely to the bottom again.|$|E
25|$|The Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) {{is unique}} and stone-sculptured. It was added in the 1860s, when several {{buildings}} were demolished {{to make way for}} it. The carvings by James Forsyth depict seven scenes from the Stations of the Cross. The first shows Christ being condemned by Pontius Pilate, while the second is Christ carrying his cross. The third sculpture illustrates Christ falling under his cross, supported by Simon of Cyrene. The next tableau is of Christ meeting his mother and then having his clothing removed. The final representations as <b>you</b> <b>climb</b> the steps towards the church are of Christ being nailed to the cross and then his death, which is displayed on the gable of the north porch.|$|E
25|$|The N2 {{crosses the}} River Boyne {{south of the}} village. The road descends a steep hill from the village and makes an almost ninety degree turn onto the 14th-century bridge. This bend has been the scene of at least 20 {{fatalities}} in living memory. As <b>you</b> <b>climb</b> the hill towards Slane village the wall on the right hand {{side of the road}} has a number of small white crosses, each representing a death on this stretch of road. Most of the crashes have involved heavy goods vehicles which are not able to slow down sufficiently to make the sharp bend after picking up speed on the hill. Meath County Council and the National Roads Authority have installed a number of traffic calming measures over the years in an attempt to make the bend onto the bridge safer, and since their installation, fatal accidents have ceased. It was hoped that the opening of the M1 motorway would divert a lot the heavy traffic from the village but there is evidence that many heavy goods vehicles still use the N2 (and thus Slane bridge) to avoid paying the toll on the M1 bridge.|$|E

500|$|Charles J. Shields, {{who wrote}} the first book-length {{biography}} of Harper Lee, offers {{the reason for the}} novel's enduring popularity and impact is that [...] "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal". [...] Atticus' lesson to Scout that [...] "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until <b>you</b> <b>climb</b> around in his skin and walk around in it" [...] exemplifies his compassion. [...] She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. [...] When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. [...] Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. [...] One writer remarks, [...] "...hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [...] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings." ...|$|E
