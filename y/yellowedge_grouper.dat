50|$|Pseudorhabdosynochus firmicoleatus is a diplectanid monogenean {{parasite}} on {{the gills}} of the <b>Yellowedge</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus flavolimbatus and the Snowy grouper, Epinephelus niveatus. It as {{been described by}} Kritsky, Bakenhaster and Adams in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively, {{the term}} [...] "white grouper" [...] {{is also used}} as a local vernacular name for several other species of fish, {{including}} the <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus flavolimbatus), Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), and Venezuelan grouper (Mycteroperca cidi) (http://filaman.ifm-geomar.de/ComNames/CommonNameSearchList.php).|$|E
50|$|Kritsky, Bakenhaster & Adams (2015) {{wrote that}} Pseudorhabdosynochus firmicoleatus most closely resembles Pseudorhabdosynochus sulamericanus (a species {{described}} by Santos, Buchmann and Gibson in 2000) {{in the general}} morphology of the vaginal sclerite. The structure in both species possesses a delicate distal funnel at its attachment to the vaginal vestibule, a proximal bulge of the distal tube, and a small chamber. In P. firmicoleatus, however, the vaginal sclerite is delicate and lacks the irregular sclerites along the distal tube typical of P. sulamericanus. It further differs from P. sulamericanus in that the deep root of the ventral anchor has its proximal end directed dorsally. Finally, tegumental scales are lacking and the squamodiscs of P. firmicoleatus have 11-13 rows of rodlets, vs tegumental scales present and 14-17 rows in the squamodics of P. sulamericanus). No significant differences were observed between specimens of P. firmicoleatus collected from <b>yellowedge</b> and snowy <b>groupers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The type-host is the <b>Yellowedge</b> <b>grouper,</b> Epinephelus flavolimbatus; {{the species}} {{has also been}} found on the gills of the Snowy grouper, Epinephelus niveatus. The type-locality is the open Gulf of Mexico, 70 miles south of Panama City, Florida. The record on the Snowy grouper is from the Gulf of Mexico, 60 miles {{south-west}} of Pensacola, Florida.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Age {{validation}} {{and estimates}} of longevity of <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus flavolimbatus) from the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) {{are needed to}} inform fishery management decisions. <b>Yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> sagittal otoliths (n= 100) were collected, aged using conventional means, and cores were submitted for radiocarbon (14 C) measurement. Radiocarbon values of <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> otoliths were compared to established radiocarbon chronologies {{in the region to}} validate the age and ageing methodology of this species. The <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> chronology dis-played a similar sigmoidal trend as previously published chronologies. In addition to the core analysis, multiple areas on otolith sections from eight specimens were analyzed for Δ 14 C to validate age estimates for fish born prior to the 14 C increase. Our results indicate that <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> live longer than previously reported (minimum of 40 years based on radiocarbon measurements). The validated ageing methodology supported an estimated maximum lon-gevity of 85 years and established that <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper</b> have the longest lifespan currently known for any species of grouper in the GOM. Results also indicate a depth-age interaction in that material extracted from adult otolith sections assigned to post-bomb dates exhibited lower Δ 14 C values than cores (juvenile material) assigned to the same post-bomb dates. This finding is likely explained by lower 14 C levels reported from water masses at deeper depths (> 100 m) which are inhabited by adults...|$|E
40|$|In July 2006, a {{mandatory}} observer program was implemented {{to characterize the}} commercial reef fish fishery operating in the U. S. Gulf of Mexico. The primary gear types assessed included bottom longline and vertical line (bandit and handline). A total of 73, 205 fish (183 taxa) were observed in the longline fishery. Most (66 %) were red grouper, Epinephelus morio, and <b>yellowedge</b> <b>grouper,</b> E. flavolimbatus. In the vertical line fishery, 89, 015 fish (178 taxa) were observed of which most (60 %) were red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, and vermilion snapper, Rhomboplites aurorubens. Based on surface observations of discarded under-sized target and unwanted species, the majority of fish were released alive; minimum assumed mortality was 23 % for the vertical line and 24 % for the bottom longline fishery. Of the individuals released alive in the longline fishery, 42 % had visual signs of barotrauma stress (air bladder expansion/and or eyes protruding). In the vertical line fishery, 35 % of the fish were released in a stressed state. Red grouper and red snapper size composition by depth and gear type were determined. Catch-per-unit-effort for dominant species in both fisheries, illustrated spatial differences in distribution between the eastern and western Gulf. Hot Spot Analyses for red grouper and red snapper identified areas with significant clustering of high or low CPUE values...|$|E
