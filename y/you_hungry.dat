Laura Betker of the Winnipeg Sun said [...] "Thankfully, the show moves far away from the health-class ideal that anorexia and bulimia simply stem from self-conscious teens. Rather, it displays it as the ugly disease that it truly is... All aspects of the story were done well. The plot was realistic. The display of the disease was truthful and progressive, while the acting was at an all time high... Miriam McDonald's performance was phenomenal. [...] performs with strength and credibility." [...] Bill Harris of the Toronto Sun criticized the episodes' [...] "ham-fisted handling of anorexia" [...] and wrote: [...] "It’s just that, well, the Degrassi foray, while well-intentioned, leaves <b>you</b> <b>hungry</b> for a fresh insight, some relevant information, a compelling storyline, good writing, believable dialogue, anything." [...] Harris even went as far as saying, [...] "That Degrassi episode was so bad it made me want to throw up." ...|$|E

A reviewer for Kidsreads.com said, [...] "This crisply-paced fantasy will leave <b>you</b> <b>hungry</b> for the four additional Harry books that J.K. Rowling is working on. Harry's third year is a charm. Don't miss it." [...] Kirkus Reviews did not give a starred review but said, [...] "a properly pulse-pounding climax...The main characters and the continuing story both come along so smartly...that the book seems shorter than its page count: have readers clear their calendars if they are fans, or {{get out of the way}} if they are not." [...] Martha V. Parravano also gave a positive review for The Horn Book Magazine, calling it [...] "quite a good book." [...] In addition, a Publishers Weekly review said, [...] "Rowling's wit never flags, whether constructing the workings of the wizard world...or tossing off quick jokes...The Potter spell is holding strong.|$|E

500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And you {{have never seen a}} computer-animated feature with this sort of visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves <b>you</b> <b>hungry</b> for more." ...|$|E
