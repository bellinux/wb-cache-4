5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one free, because it is the best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

2500|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the traumatic conditions is the stress of losing one’s background object. [...] A background object is someone on whom individuals have come to rely in ways they did not realize until the object is no longer present. [...] For instance, the relationship served as a mutual regulatory system. Multiple psychobiological systems helped to maintain individuals’ equilibrium. [...] As members of a couple, they became external regulators for one another. They were attuned on many levels: their pupils dilated in synchrony, they echoed one another’s speech patterns, movements, and even cardiac and EEG rhythms. [...] As a couple, they functioned like a mutual bio-feedback system, stimulating and modulating each other’s bio rhythms, responding to one another’s pheromones, and addicting to the steady trickle of endogenous opiates induced by the relationship. [...] When the relationship ends, the many processes it helped to regulate go into disarray. [...] As the emotional and bio-physiological effects mount, the stressful process is heightened {{by the knowledge that}} it was not you, but <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one who chose withdraw from the bond. This knowledge may cause people to interpret their intense emotional responses to the disconnection as evidence of their putative weakness and ‘limited capacity to perform the work of conquest’.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Push the Button", an uptempo pop, electropop and {{electronic}} song. Instrumentation consists of computer beats and electronics. The song {{was inspired by}} a limerance between Buchanan and an artist who collaborated with Austin, and is lyrically about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. The next track is [...] "Gotta Be You", a crunk and R number that runs through a [...] "monotonal crunk-influenced synthesised honking". The song is lyrically interpreted as reacting to judgements created by the press. It received several comparisons to [...] "Try Again" [...] by Aaliyah. Following this is [...] "Follow Me Home", a downtempo and romantic R ballad, instrumentatally accompanied by of keyboards, a guitar, beats and bass. The romantic song was inspired by Buena's daughter and is lyrically about protecting <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one. The fourth track on the album is [...] "Joy Division", which draws influences from dub and nu metal. K. Ross Hoffman of AllMusic described it as a [...] "breezy, ska-punk-tinged" [...] track. The song's is accompanied by keyboards, a guitar, beats and bass, and features the Sugababes singing lines such as [...] "Boy do I turn you round / Isn't this profound". Lyrically, [...] "Joy Division" [...] is about sleazy men; according to Range, [...] "My verse is about a guy who tries to chat you up and conveniently forgets the fact that he's got a wife and kids".|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] I used to get really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with <b>your</b> <b>loved</b> one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E
