It {{was a little}} bit {{frustrating}} at first but eventually we found a way to communicate. You figure out a way. With music it's so much about the vibe and the energy and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> things are working and when they’re not. When you're working with someone for the first time, there's a kind of shyness that everybody has, so with Benny it was more challenging because of that but we figured it out and by the end I felt like I knew him very well.|$|E

And <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

500|$|When The Chemical Brothers {{started to}} write music again after {{finishing}} the album Come with Us (2002), [...] "The Boxer" [...] {{was one of}} the earliest tracks that they wrote for their next album, Push the Button (2005). The Charlatans lead singer Tim Burgess, who had collaborated on the duo's debut album track [...] "Life Is Sweet" [...] ten years earlier, contributed the vocals to this song. According to the group, out of all collaborators, Burgess still remained a close friend to them. [...] "If he's in London, we would probably have a drink together, three of us, or, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> we're in LA, he will come to our gig," [...] they shared.|$|E

"Pam came up {{with the}} title 'Irresistible', and as she started talking about the whole concept we {{immediately}} became inspired and began working on the music. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> we hear a concept or a title that we like—no matter if it's ours or somebody else's—both Anders and I {{get a feel for the}} song's vibe; a feel for whether a keyboard or guitar should be used to give it a certain character, be it upbeat or melancholic. So, when Pam mentioned the title, we immediately {{came up with}} the tempo and the whole feeling of the song, and then she {{came up with the}} lyrics. There was a really good flow to that song. We played around with the melody, put down the demo, and it was done." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E

500|$|A mutant {{capable of}} {{emitting}} incredibly strong ultrasonic screams, sonic blasts, sonic bursts, and sonic waves used {{in various ways}} including {{as a means of}} flight. Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got red hair and freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> I can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
500|$|Davies is an {{admitted}} procrastinator {{and often}} waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits {{them to the}} script. In The Writer's Tale, he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career: at the time, his method {{of dealing with the}} pressures of delivering a script was to [...] "go out drinking" [...] instead. On one occasion in the mid-1990s, he was at the Manchester gay club Cruz 101 when he thought of the climax to the first series of The Grand. As his career progressed, he instead spent entire nights [...] "just thinking of plot, character, pace, etc" [...] and waited until 2:00am, [...] "when the clubs used to shut", to overcome the urge of procrastination.

According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided!

500|$|On January 22, 2014, and {{initially}} reported by media outlets the day before, Dunderdale {{announced that she}} would be resigning as Premier on January 24, 2014. In her speech Dunderdale stated [...] "Just as <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> it's time to step up, you also know when it is time to step back, and that time for me is now." [...] The announcement followed the defection of PC MHA Paul Lane to the Liberal Party, and months of poor performance in opinion polls. Dunderdale's Finance Minister Tom Marshall was sworn in [...] as premier and became the interim party leader on January 24. [...] Marshall will hold the post until the PC Party selects a permanent leader. On February 28, 2014, Dunderdale sent out a news releasing announcing she was resigning as the MHA for Virginia Water {{by the end of the}} day, ending a ten and a half year career in provincial politics. She subsequently returned to community work gaining employment with Gathering Place as their volunteer coordinator.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{version of}} [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was an {{international}} number 1 {{hit by the}} end of 1970 and through the early months of 1971 – the first solo single by a Beatle to reach the top, and the biggest seller by any of the four throughout the 1970s. Without the support of any concert appearances or promotional interviews by Harrison, the single's commercial success was due to its impact on radio, where, Harrison biographer Gary Tillery writes, the song [...] "rolled across the airwaves like a juggernaut, with commanding presence, much the way Dylan's 'Like a Rolling Stone' had arrived in the mid-sixties". Elton John recalls first hearing [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] in a taxi and names it as the last of the era's great singles: [...] "I thought, 'Oh my God,' and I got chills. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> a record starts on the radio, and it's great, and you think, 'Oh, what is this, what is this, what is this?' The only other record I ever felt that way about [...] was 'Brown Sugar'..." [...] In his 40-page Harrison tribute article for Rolling Stone in 2002, Mikal Gilmore credited [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] as being [...] "as pervasive on radio and in youth consciousness as anything the Beatles had produced".|$|E
500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you have an opening and when to run".|$|E

She said the episode was like dessert, adding [...] "That's what kept it fun and that's what kept it worth doing all the time." [...] Chris Carter said of writer Darin Morgan, [...] "It's been a wonderful coincidence of timing, talent, {{and the success of}} the show, allowing it to stretch in a direction it would never have been able to {{if it had been a}} less successful or if it had been a younger show. Darin is a truly original comic mind. I don't know anybody in the world working in film, and that's what we work in here even though it appears on television, who has the voice Darin has. He is one in many million." [...] Co-Producer Paul Rabwin said of the episode [...] "An instant classic. One of those seminal episodes. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> people talk about The Twilight Zone, they say 'Remember [...] "Eye of the Beholder"?' Or [...] "Trouble With Tribbles" [...] on the original [...] 'Jose Chung' is going to be one of those episodes that is immediately revered."
