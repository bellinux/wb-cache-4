60|$|By {{this time}} the {{afternoon}} sun had begun to be too warm for comfort, and it struck Wilton {{that he could be}} a great deal more comfortable nursing his wounded heart with his back against one of the rocks than tramping any farther over the sand. Most of the Marois Bay scenery is simply made as a setting for the nursing of a wounded heart. The cliffs are a sombre indigo, sinister and forbidding; and even on the finest days the sea has a curious sullen look. You have only {{to get away from the}} crowd near the bathing-machines and reach one of these small coves and get your book against a rock and your pipe well alight, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> wallow in misery. I have done it myself. The day when Heloise Miller went golfing with Teddy Bingley I spent the whole afternoon in one of these retreats. It is true that, after twenty minutes of contemplating the breakers, I fell asleep; but that is bound to happen.|$|E

Perhaps {{the idea}} does not at once approve itself to you of having your public {{buildings}} covered with ornaments; but, pray {{remember that the}} choice of subject is an ethical question, not now before us. All I ask you to decide is whether the method is right, and would be pleasant, in giving the distinctiveness to pretty things, which it has here given to what, I suppose it may be assumed, you feel to be an ugly thing. Of course, I must note parenthetically, such realistic work is impossible {{in a country where}} the buildings are to be discolored by coal-smoke; but so is all fine sculpture whatsoever; and the whiter, the worse its chance. For that which is prepared for private persons, to be kept under cover, will, of necessity, degenerate into the copyism of past work, or merely sensational and sensual forms of present life, unless there be a governing school addressing the populace, for their instruction, on the outside of buildings. So that, as I partly warned you in my Third Lecture, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> have no sculpture in a coal country. Whether you like coals or carvings best, is no business of mine. I merely have to assure you of the fact that they are incompatible.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR HOWELLS,--An actor named D. H. Harkins {{has been}} here {{to ask me to}} put upon paper a 5-act play which he has been mapping out in his mind for 3 or 4 years. He sat down and told me his plot all through, in a clear, bright way, and I was a deal taken with it; but it is a line of {{characters}} whose fine shading and artistic development requires an abler hand than mine; so I easily perceived that I must not make the attempt. But I liked the man, and thought there was a good deal of stuff in him; and therefore I wanted his play to be written, and by a capable hand, too. So I suggested you, and said I would write and see if you would be willing to undertake it. If you like the idea, he will call upon you in the course of two or three weeks and describe his plot and his characters. Then if it doesn't strike you favorably, of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>simply</b> decline; {{but it seems to me}} well worth while that you should hear what he has to say. You could also [...] "average" [...] him while he talks, and judge whether he could play your priest--though I doubt if any man can do that justice.|$|E

60|$|This real vagueness {{of class}} terms is equally true whether we {{consider}} those terms used extensively or intensively, {{that is to}} say whether in relation to {{all the members of the}} species or in relation to an imaginary typical specimen. The logician begins by declaring that S is either P or not P. In the world of fact it is the rarest thing to encounter this absolute alternative; S1 is pink, but S2 is pinker, S3 is scarcely pink at all, and one is in doubt whether S4 is not properly to be called scarlet. The finest type specimen <b>you</b> <b>can</b> find <b>simply</b> has the characteristic quality a little more rather than a little less. The neat little circles the logician uses to convey his idea of P or not P to the student are just pictures of boundaries in his mind, exaggerations of a natural mental tendency.

50|$|Burai Fighter is {{a single}} player two {{dimensional}} automatic sidescroller. It has three difficulty levels to choose from. At the start, the screen moves from left to right, but it can move in all four directions and even change directions in the same level. The player is expected to keep up, because getting stuck on the edge means you die. You {{start out with a}} basic gun that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> fire in all eight directions. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> hold the fire button to lock your firing position. You float through space blowing up robots that sort of look like animals most of the time. At the end of a level you must defeat a boss to continue to the next level. At times, you may find a gap {{at the side of the}} screen. If you time it right and push in that direction, the orientation of the screen will change and take you into a secret room with some power ups. However, the higher difficulty levels have fewer secret rooms and your timing also needs to be perfect. This means <b>you</b> <b>can</b> quite <b>simply</b> walk into a death trap. The game is fairly linear otherwise, but there are a few forks in the road where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> either travel on the left side or the right side of the screen for a little while. If you pick the wrong side, you need to be an exceptionally skilled player to make it out of there.|$|R
