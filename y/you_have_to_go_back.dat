500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Like other Disney media {{products}} {{which are}} often localized through Disney Character Voices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The Lion King). A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages. Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as [...] "exceptionally challenging"; he explained, [...] "It's a difficult juggling act {{to get the right}} intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. And then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and adjust for lip sync! ...requires a lot of patience and precision." [...] Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics. For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to [...] "ensure that the film feels 'local'." [...] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their [...] "blueprint" [...] in casting, and tried to match the voices [...] "as much as possible," [...] meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone. For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing. After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 900 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,300 recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for Religion Dispatches, Austin Dacey {{compared}} the protest movement to Martin Luther, stating, [...] "Forget the South Park dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day.

Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent." [...] Dacey argued, [...] "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between conflicting religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy." ...|$|E

[...] For Entertainment Weekly his second studio album, FutureSex/LoveSounds, [...] "redefined pop's cutting edge"; for Vibe it [...] "pushed boundaries more forcefully" [...] than works by his male contemporaries. Fuse TV's editor Jason Lipshutz stated it [...] "changed the game. [...] was steely and sweaty, a universal dance opus that made room for intimacy.
