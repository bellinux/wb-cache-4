60|$|LADY CICELY. Yes: so {{you told}} Howard. (With genuine pity for him) <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a very unhappy childhood.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Right,' {{said the}} captain; 'I {{like to see}} a child a child still. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some tussles with that little spirit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{been reading}} all about your grandeur, Mr. Brooks," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "What a {{beautiful}} day <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> at Enton." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're up to {{the eyes}} in trouble, as <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> guessed. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> asked {{yourself}} what {{the body of the}} shareholders are likely to think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I am too {{sensible}} of {{the trouble}} <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> already <b>had</b> with my writings to impose upon you now a long letter. I will only add, therefore, that I am, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a pity {{about my}} being so blind," [...] said she, [...] "or I might <b>have</b> seen them too.--And {{you were in}} the house? <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>having</b> the fine time with the fine music and the pretty ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Recovering himself, with a smile.] Has {{she been}} telling you my {{numerous}} faults? [To JENNY.] <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> plenty to talk about, my love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, if {{you have}} not gone stark mad, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a sunstroke," [...] said Harold, coming forward, [...] "what's the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor thing, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a rotten}} time," [...] she murmured, and {{by way of}} showing her sympathy {{put her hand on}} his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can imagine}} the concern we felt when your letter reached us, {{yesterday}} evening. Of course, I determined to start at once. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> indeed <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a hard time of it, for you <b>have</b> fallen away so much that I should hardly <b>have</b> known you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] said Mr. Sinclair. [...] "I {{did not mean}} to startle you. <b>Have</b> I been too abrupt? Surely <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> known--you <b>must</b> <b>have</b> expected--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> seen--you cannot <b>have</b> helped seeing--that {{my time is}} {{not long}} here. I <b>have</b> seen an English doctor today, {{and he says the}} end may come at any moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh sir,' said Mrs Varden, 'I think <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had.</b> It's {{impossible}} that you, who {{have so much}} now, can ever have been without any.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{positively}} a newer pattern; {{the old one}} had not that delicate straw line in the arabesque. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> it made for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks. I'm sorry I can't {{return the}} compliment. You're about the seediest, hungriest-looking fellow I ever saw.... Say, old man, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a tough time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is nothing," [...] he said; [...] "merely {{a broken}} collarbone. As to my looking ill, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> remember, I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> almost as anxious {{a time as}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> {{some other}} news for you, Miss Granger," [...] went on Lady Honoria. [...] "Your canoe <b>has</b> been washed ashore, very little injured. The old boatman--Edward, I think they call him--has found it; and your gun in it too, Geoffrey. It <b>had</b> stuck {{under the seat}} or somewhere. But I fancy that <b>you</b> <b>must</b> both <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough canoeing for the present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is most fitting," [...] she sobbed, [...] "that I {{should give}} you thanks who but for <b>you</b> <b>must</b> also <b>have</b> become <b>'a</b> woman of the Assassins,' or an {{inhabitant}} of the House of Death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how could}} you recover from so fearful an injury?" [...] I questioned. [...] "There {{must have been a}} splendid surgeon on board, and <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{wonderful}} vitality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have seen}} {{healthier}} men. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{a touch of}} the sun. Look here: if I write you a swingeing medical certificate, will you apply for leave on the spot?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Molly--poor Molly!" [...] {{said the}} dying man, his voice {{continuing}} full and deep to the last, [...] "what a sad time <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> of it after I did you that wrong!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{can easily}} {{comprehend}} the mortification <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> felt in <b>having</b> one so self-willed to deal with," [...] returned the surgeon, glancing his eyes reproachfully at his comrade. [...] "But you should rise superior to such opinions, and pity the ignorance {{by which they}} are engendered." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>have</b> been {{wondering}} about you," [...] Captain Dave said, as he shook {{him by the}} hand, [...] "but I can scarce say we <b>had</b> become uneasy. We learnt that {{a large body of}} seamen and others were at work blowing up houses, and as you <b>had</b> gone to offer your services we doubted not that you were employed with them. Truly <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> been <b>having</b> a rough time of it, for not only are you dirtier than any scavenger, but you look utterly worn out and fatigued." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no knowing, my lad--there's no {{knowing what}} might <b>have</b> come. The smart's {{bad for you}} to bear now: <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> time--you <b>must</b> <b>have</b> time. But I've that opinion of you, that you'll rise above it all and be a man again, and there may good {{come out of this}} that we don't see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, I say, you know, dash it, you've {{skipped a}} lot. I mean to say, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> an awful time in New York, didn't you? How {{on earth did}} you get along?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The same thing," [...] replied Jimmy. Then he chuckled. [...] "This is an {{unexpected}} meeting. I guess <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{the same thing}} on your mind all day that I have," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{never were}} such persons, perhaps,' said Venetia, 'but {{it is not}} true that there never were such things as papas and husbands, for all people have papas; <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a papa, Mistress Pauncefort?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The King looked grave. [...] "This is a {{much greater}} reward," [...] he said, [...] "than I <b>had</b> ever {{expected}} to pay; but, since <b>you</b> ask it, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> done something which none of my subjects <b>has</b> {{ever been able to}} accomplish, and it is right, therefore, that you should be fully satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Young gentleman,' was the answer, 'your {{appearance}} is hardly {{one to be}} vain of, {{and there is no}} need to waste your time looking in a glass. Besides, I <b>have</b> none here, and if <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> one <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better ask Urban the barber, who lives over the way, to lend you his. Good morning.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not," [...] {{said the}} youth, {{regarding}} the stern countenance of his parent with an amused look. [...] "I <b>have</b> {{no intention of}} acting such an ignoble part, and I'm surprised at you askin' the question, for you know I am not lazy--at least not more so than average active men--and there must be plenty of work {{for me to do}} in looking after the cargo, superintending repairs, taking care of the ship and men. I wonder at <b>you,</b> father. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> either <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a shock of dotage, or fallen into a poetical vein. What is a first mate fit for if--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A little longer? Why, that Lord Percy Whipple business--I know <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{excellent}} {{reasons for}} soaking him, Jimmy, {{but it did}} put the lid on it--surely, after that Lord Percy affair there's no chance--?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In their ways, {{in their}} places--Yes. But {{not if you}} go {{up to them and}} look at them. Not at the dinner table, not in their beds.... What a time of disillusionment <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell {{about your}} lovers: <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> some; actresses always do. Happy women, they can love as they like!" [...] said Helen, with the {{inquisitive}} frankness of an invalid for whom etiquette {{has ceased to}} exist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you will}} soon {{get used to}} me. Surely <b>you</b> and she <b>must</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> enough of shore people and their confounded half-and-half ways to last you both for a lifetime. A {{particularly}} merciful lot they are too. You ask Flora. I am alluding to my own sister, her best friend, and not a bad woman either as they go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ralph {{shook his}} head sadly. [...] "I might show it to you, but you'd never see it. The {{privilege}} isn't given to every one; it's not enviable. It <b>has</b> never been seen by a young, happy, innocent person like <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> suffered first, <b>have</b> suffered greatly, <b>have</b> gained some miserable knowledge. In that way your eyes are opened to it. I saw it long ago," [...] said Ralph.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady," [...] {{answered}} {{the old man}} coldly, [...] "we dare because we must, for honour cannot live before the assegai of thirst. You talk to us of storming the pass; we cannot storm it, for ten men can hold that place against a hundred; also our arms are weak and we are weary of war. Listen; {{on the one hand}} are the lives of thousands, with them your own and that of the White Swallow, and on the other this dishonour. We choose the dishonour, since if you and the Swallow do not desire to {{fall into the hands of}} Bull-Head, you can still do what <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> done <b>had</b> we chosen honour. Lady, you can die, knowing that by your death you <b>have</b> saved the lives of the multitude over whom you rule.|$|R
