5000|$|This sermon {{has been}} characterised as being {{particularly}} grounded in politics, and Swift sums up {{many of the}} political issues that he had previously addressed in pamphlets and essays. The solution to fixing the misery of the Irish people is:to found a school in every parish of the kingdom, for teaching the meaner and poorer sort of children to speak and read the English tongue, {{and to provide a}} reasonable maintenance for the teachers. This would, in time, abolish that part of barbarity and ignorance, for which our natives are so despised by all foreigners: this would bring them to think and act according to the rules of reason, by which a spirit of industry, and thrift, and honesty would be introduced among them. And, indeed, considering how small a tax would suffice for such a work, it is a public scandal that such a thing should never have been endeavoured, or, perhaps, so much as thought on.However, lack of education is not the only problem for Ireland; many problems come from the vices of the Irish citizenry. These vices span the way of dress to the inactivity of the common person. To correct the problems of Ireland, Swift emphasises the need for his people to contribute to various charities, and concludes:I might here, if the time would permit, offer many arguments to persuade to works of charity; but you hear them so often from the pulpit, that I am willing to hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> now <b>want</b> them.
