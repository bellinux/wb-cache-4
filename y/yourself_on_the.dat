25|$|But by {{your hard}} and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of wrath when God's righteous {{judgment}} will be revealed. For he will render to every man {{according to his}} works: to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life; {{but for those who}} are factious and do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and fury. There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek. For God shows no partiality.|$|E
500|$|Araya held {{concern about}} the lyrics that King penned to [...] "In the Name of God", voicing his opinion to guitarist Hanneman. King's {{viewpoint}} was; [...] "It's like, 'C'mon, man, you're in Slayer. You're the antichrist — you said it <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first album!' You can't draw the line like that. Whether he agrees with it or not, he didn't write it — I wrote it. So you have to say, 'Well, it's {{just a part of}} being in this band.' Now Jeff and I, we don't give a fuck. If Jeff wrote something I had a problem with, I would never even raise a fucking finger. I'd be like, 'Fuck yeah, let's do it! Gonna piss someone off? Alright!'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Me & the Rhythm" [...] is a dance, disco, R and synthpop song, {{while its}} {{production}} contains steel drums, deep house beats, [...] "pulsating" [...] percussion and [...] "smoky" [...] synths throughout its instrumentation. Lyrically the song addresses {{the concepts of}} losing <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dance floor and being free in the moment. [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] was well received by contemporary music critics, with praise directed towards its vintage disco sound and Gomez's sultry vocals. The promote the song, the singer appeared on The Today Show to perform a set which included a medley of [...] "Me & the Rhythm" [...] with [...] "Come & Get It". The song was performed during Gomez Today concert, she performed it on a medley with previous hit [...] "Come & Get It". The track was included on the setlist for Gomez's 2016 Revival Tour.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Taylor was the {{principal}} screenwriter in this, the first screenplay written specially for Astaire and Rogers. Astaire reacted negatively to the first drafts, complaining that [...] "it is patterned too closely after The Gay Divorcee", and [...] "I am cast as ... a sort of objectionable young man without charm or sympathy or humour". [...] Allan Scott, for whom this movie served as his first major project, and who {{would go on to}} serve on six of the Astaire-Rogers pictures, was hired by Sandrich to do the rewrites and never actually worked with Taylor, with Sandrich acting as script editor and advisor throughout. The Hays Office insisted on only minor changes, including probably the most quoted line of dialogue from the film: Beddini's motto: [...] "For the women the kiss, for the men the sword" [...] which originally ran: [...] "For the men the sword, for the women the whip." [...] Of his role in the creation of Top Hat, Taylor recalled that with Sandrich and Berlin he shared [...] "a kind of childlike excitement. The whole style of the picture {{can be summed up in}} the word inconsequentiality. When I left RKO a year later, Mark said to me, 'You will never again see so much of <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen.'" [...] On the film's release, the script was panned by many critics, who alleged it was merely a rewrite of The Gay Divorcee.|$|E
2500|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries {{execution}} in the British realm was commonplace {{and a part}} of life. During the 17th century alone around 800 people were hanged each year in the British Empire. [...] For a pirate however the odds of finding <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> gallows were much higher. In just the ten-year span between 1716 and 1726 at least 418 pirates, and possibly as much as half again more, were hanged. In this world a pirate could be nearly certain that if caught he would end up with a short drop and sudden stop with a noose cinched around his neck.|$|E

[...] He also said that, [...] "If I look at enough of your messaging and your location, and use artificial intelligence, we can predict {{where you are going}} to go.

2500|$|Doug Elfman of the Chicago Sun-Times stated, [...] "the show's super {{strengths}} are its well-developed filmmaking, smooth pacing and {{a perfect}} cast. It views like the first hour of a fun, thoughtful movie." [...] Barry Garron at The Hollywood Reporter also stated, [...] "Heroes is one of TV's most imaginative creations and might, with luck, become this year's Lost." [...] Less favorable reviews included the Philadelphia Inquirer, who commented that although the show had lots of [...] "cool effects," [...] it [...] "lands, splat, {{in a pile of}} nonsense and dim dialogue." [...] In response to the first pod of season one episodes, The Chicago Tribune went as far as saying, [...] "you could watch the first few episodes of Heroes, or you could repeatedly hit <b>yourself</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head with a brick. The effect is surprisingly similar." [...] At Metacritic, the Heroes pilot received a 67/100, with generally favorable reviews from critics. The show was declared the fourth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E
