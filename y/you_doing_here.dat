500|$|Hamels started Game 2 of the 2009 National League Division Series {{against the}} Colorado Rockies, {{allowing}} four earned runs through five innings {{to take the}} loss. Nevertheless, the Phillies won the series, three games to one. He earned the win in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 8–6. Hamels started Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching [...] innings, allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 8-5. Afterward, he told reporters, [...] "I can't wait for it (the season) to end. It's been mentally draining. It's {{one of those things}} where, a year in, you just can’t wait for a fresh start." [...] Later in the series, after the Phillies won game five, a confrontational Brett Myers mockingly asked Hamels: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> I thought you quit." [...] The Phillies lost the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games.|$|E
500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> Go home! Why {{do you want to}} be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following the release of the album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him. [...] "He looks at me right in the eyes and he goes, 'You're next,'" [...] remembered DeLonge, who blushed and shook off the compliment.|$|E
2500|$|An {{incident}} that probably dates to Skarbek's first visit back to Poland in February 1940 illustrates the hazards she faced {{while working in}} her occupied homeland. At a Warsaw café, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: [...] "Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> We heard that you'd gone abroad!" [...] When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered {{that she would have}} sworn she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the café.|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes from when I got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook {{started the}} innings in fine form against the fast bowlers, who {{struggled}} to make the ball lift on the unresponsive wicket. Lindsay Hassett soon took the off and brought on the spinners. Jack Iverson had not bowled in the first innings and with his negligible ability with the bat and in the field some thought he was due to be dropped. It was soon apparent {{that he was in}} complete control of the situation, his line and length were flawless and he was turning the ball from outside the off-stump past the leg-stump. He had Hutton out for 9, the ball was snicked behind, where the wicket-keeper Don Tallon knocked it to Ian Johnson in the slips who juggled the ball and dropped it, upon which Tallon dived across and took the catch. Reg Simpson showed his usual bad form against spinners and was caught behind for a duck (even though Tallon didn't appeal) and Washbrook was bowled for 34 after hitting two boundaries off Johnson. England were now 45/3 and Iverson had taken 3/2. Denis Compton avoided his pair and held out for 104minutes making 23, his highest score of a terrible series, before running out Gilbert Parkhouse for 18 and popping a catch to the hungry Ian Johnson off Bill Johnston (1/31). Evans whacked 14 runs with 3 fours before Johnson (1/32) bowled him. Trevor Bailey bravely came out to bat with one hand in plaster, much to the surprise of his captain who asked [...] "What are the devil are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here,</b> Trevor?", Bailey replied [...] "I thought I would hold them up for a bit Skipper" [...] and held up one end with his 0 not out. Iverson bowled Brown, Bedser and Warr to finish with 6/27 and as Doug Wright was absent hurt and England were out for 123.|$|E
6000|$|... "Demoiselle Candeille!" [...] ejaculated Marguerite, wholly {{taken by}} surprise. [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> alone? {{and at this}} hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hardly {{expected}} you would. You {{must keep}} on until <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> are your wages." [...] [13] He handed {{each of them}} a shilling.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>here,</b> sir?' asked Mr Gregsbury; 'a spy upon my privacy! A {{concealed}} voter! You {{have heard}} my answer, sir. Pray follow the deputation.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{bent over}} and {{adjusted}} his glasses. [...] "It's handwriting at any rate, and that's better {{than the rest of}} <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>Here,</b> Lute, your eyes are young." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dolores Kramer stood uncertainly, {{looking into}} the control room. She blinked in amazement. [...] "Phil! What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> What's going on?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no, Mr Noggs,' replied Gride, arresting his hand, 'A lady. You wonder {{to hear me}} say A lady. I know <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> I know <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here's</b> little Madeline. That's the toast. Mr Noggs. Little Madeline!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> so {{far from}} shelter? Are you benighted on your journey? Will you follow us home ('God forbid!' ejaculated Hobbie Elliot, involuntarily), and I {{will give you a}} lodging?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am endeavouring," [...] he said, [...] "to {{accommodate}} {{myself to}} the customs of this wonderful country of yours. In France one sends one's seconds. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> {{to a man who}} calls you a liar?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Why, it's young Nigger!' That {{was what}} they called me at the saloon. 'What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here?</b> Where {{did you get this}} dog, father?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Estelle," [...] he cried, more puzzled than {{angry when}} he {{suddenly}} {{caught sight of}} us both, [...] "what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>here</b> with that lout?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} go to Europe more often," [...] she said softly. [...] "I do not {{understand}} how men can make the slaves of themselves that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>here.</b> Don't <b>you</b> long sometimes to feel your feet off the treadmill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shall say goodnight now," [...] the English boy said. [...] "My father doesn't like {{my being}} out after ten. He keeps up his English habits of {{shutting}} up early, {{and has not}} learned to turn night into day as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>here</b> in Venice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{take the}} sculls," [...] Jacob said, [...] "and I will steer. It {{is a risky}} matter going through the bridge, I tell you, at half tide. Sit steady, {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Here</b> they come in pursuit, Roger. Bend to the sculls," [...] and {{in a couple of}} minutes they reached the bridge.|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course I shall; but it's got to go. You see, daddy's dead broke, an' I {{must have}} {{money to pay for}} the doctor's stuff.
