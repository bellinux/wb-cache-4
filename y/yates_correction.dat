40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 30) The exact {{distribution of}} Pearson chi-squared is discontinuous. Thus, the continuous chi-squared table may give a poor approximation {{to the exact}} probabilities. In 1934 Yates introduced his correction term (C. 1 / 2 N) for continuity. Since then, much {{research has been done}} to find out the extent of the necessity of the correction. In 1974, Conover with a sample size of forty examined the practicability of <b>Yates???</b> <b>correction.</b> His results showed that <b>Yates???</b> <b>correction</b> is useful in some situations but not in all circumstances. The main objective of this thesis is to examine <b>Yates???</b> <b>correction</b> for continuity for sample sizes of fifty-six, thirty, and twenty, on lines similar to Conover???s study. The Fisher exact probability test is used as a standard in comparing the performances of Pearsonx 2 with <b>Yates???</b> <b>correction</b> and x 2 without the correction term. A time-sharing computer program (APL) is used to perform all the necessary calculations. The results obtained agree with Conover's conclusions. Namely, in cases with predetermined marginal totals, the employment of Yates' correction improved the probabilities where one or both marginal totals are equal. In those conditions where none of the marginal totals are equal, Pearson???s x 2 without Yates??? correctio...|$|E

Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS with Pearson Chi-Square with <b>Yates</b> <b>Correction</b> and Fishers Exact utilised for testing. Odds ratios (OR) were also reported. Pearson Chi-square tests were used to compare the frequencies of self-reported concussion between groups for categorical variables such as age group (i.e. 18 - 29  years and 30 – 39  years), level of play (i.e. professional and semi-professional), and playing position (i.e. defenders, midfielders, and attackers). Pearson chi-square was utilised for initial significance testing and this was followed by or checking using a <b>Yates</b> <b>correction</b> and Fishers Exact tests as necessary. Fisher’s exact test was used when the chi-square criterion of a minimum cell number of five was not achievable. Any results of p <[*] 0.05 at the 95 %CI were deemed significant. Some comments were added based on the merit of the 90 %CI results in some cases.|$|E

Materials and Methods. OPG and CBCT images of 105 impacted canines were independently scored by three orthodontists at t 0 and after 1 month (t 1), using the KPG index and the following 2 D methods: distance from cusp tip and occlusal plane, cusp tip position in relation to the lateral incisor, and canine inclination. Pearson’s coefficients were used to evaluate the degree of agreement and the χ 2 with <b>Yates</b> <b>correction</b> test was used to assess the independence between them. Results. Inter- and intrarater reliability were higher with KPG compared to 2 D methods. Pearson’s coefficients showed a statistically significant association between all the indexes, while the χ 2 with <b>Yates</b> <b>correction</b> test resulted in a statistically significant rejection of independency only for one 2 D index.

There is also evidence of discrimination against those with HIV reported within the dental profession and service users. We decided to assess the extent of this problem in our HIV outpatients by conducting a cross-sectional survey, asking them to complete a questionnaire exploring issues related to dental care access, and using clients attending the routine genitourinary (GU) medicine outpatient clinic as controls. A total of 241 outpatients completed the survey, of whom 51 (21 %) were HIV patients. Significantly, more HIV patients reported difficulty registering with a dentist than GU patients (58. 8 % versus 18. 2 %, x 2 with <b>Yates</b> <b>correction</b> 8. 76, P 0. 0031). They also report significantly more dental health problems compared with controls (54. 9 % versus 32. 1 %, x 2 with <b>Yates</b> <b>correction</b> 8. 02, P 0. 0046). In total, 34. 6 % of HIV patients who had declared their status to a dentist thought that it had negatively impacted on their care, with 6. 2 % being refused treatment. Our small survey confirms that discrimination in relation to access and level of dental care exists, with black African women being at most risk.

40|$|Background – The {{etiology}} of most primary immunodeficiency disorders is unknown, though {{a variety of}} genetic imbalances {{have been reported to}} be implicated. The histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) genes and antigens play a decisive role in immune regulation. Therefore, lower or higher representation of some HLA alleles may contribute to the presentation of some immunodeficiency conditions. One important human immunodeficiency that has recently been shown to be associated with particular HLA antigens is common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). We investigated {{for the first time the}} association between HLA antigens and this condition in Iranian patients. Methods – Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -transformed B-cell lines established from 16 patients with CVID and 85 healthy controls were screened using the microlymphocytotoxicity method, with a panel of anti-HLA antisera. The statistical of differences was determined using Chi-squere test with <b>Yate’s</b> <b>correction.</b> Results – Expression of HLA-A 2 (p < 0. 02) and A 33 (p < 0. 001) was significantly increased in patients compared to controls.

We aimed to study maternal morbidity and mortality among women admitted to a general intensive care unit during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, using the new World Health Organization criteria. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 158 cases of severe maternal morbidity were classified according to their outcomes: death, maternal near-miss, and potentially life-threatening conditions. The health indicators for obstetrical care were calculated. A bivariate analysis was performed using the Chi-square test with <b>Yate's</b> <b>correction</b> or Fisher's exact test. A multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} calculate the crude and adjusted odds ratios, together with their respective 95 % confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among the 158 admissions, 5 deaths, 43 cases of maternal near-miss, and 110 cases of potentially life-threatening conditions occurred. The near-miss rate was 4. 4 cases per 1, 000 live births. The near-miss/death ratio was 8. 6 near-misses for each maternal death, and the overall mortality index was 10. 4 %. Hypertensive syndromes were the main cause of admission (67. 7 % of the cases, 107 / 158); however, hemorrhage, mainly due to uterine atony and ectopic pregnancy complications, was the main cause of maternal near-misses and deaths (17 / 43 cases of near-miss and 2 / 5 deaths).
