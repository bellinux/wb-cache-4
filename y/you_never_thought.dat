500|$|... "Slow Fade" [...] {{was written}} in the [...] "light of the well publicised falls from grace of several high profile church leaders". According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade. It's a series of minor compromises until you're in a place <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> you'd be, doing things <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> you'd do and rationalising all of it". He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too much going against us. If we're not careful, we're going to crash and burn".|$|E
500|$|In The Mail on Sunday, William Leith found Sense and Sensibility to be [...] "an {{extremely}} sharp, subtle, clever, lovely looking film" [...] {{that was}} superior to the serial Pride and Prejudice. Leith especially saved praise for the cast, writing that Grant plays his role [...] "masterfully" [...] and Harriet Walter [...] "conveys sour bitchiness like <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> she could." [...] Jarr Carr of The Boston Globe thought that Lee [...] "nail Austen's acute social observation and tangy satire," [...] and viewed Thompson and Winslet's age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility. The Radio Times David Parkinson was equally appreciative of Lee's direction, writing that he [...] "avoid the chocolate-box visuals that cheapen so many British costume dramas" [...] and [...] "brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows Emma Thompson's respectful Oscar-winning script to flourish." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E

500|$|Boam and Cuse did {{not intend}} for the series to be {{historically}} accurate. Their aim was to create an action-adventure with a modern feel. Cuse told USA Today, [...] "We're not approaching this show {{as if we were}} doing a period piece. We see it as a contemporary program. Our characters just happen to be living in the West with 1990s sensibilities. The Indiana Jones movies were period pieces too, but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of them that way." [...] Anachronisms and pop culture references were intentionally inserted into the series. The show was intended to be family friendly, so violence was minimized in favor of having Brisco think his way out of dangerous situations. Boam said, [...] "In the two-hour pilot Brisco doesn't even once have to shoot his gun. Our violence is cartoonish. There is no pain and suffering." [...] Bruce Campbell was prominently featured in advertisements, billboards, and even a trailer shown in movie theaters. When the series was being promoted in the summer of 1993, Fox Entertainment chief Sandy Grushow said that if Campbell [...] "isn't the next big television star, I'll eat my desk".|$|E
500|$|Cameron Adams from News.com.au wrote: [...] " [...] poured {{much of her}} sadness {{into her}} {{intimate}} two-hour Tears of a Clown show, peppering emotional renditions of her hits with cheeky jokes and banter." [...] In another article reviewing the show, Adams noted that Tears of a Clown was [...] "the sort of thing <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> you'd see a superstar do". He complimented Madonna's jokes, chatting about her life in-between songs, for being [...] "raw and vulnerable" [...] and confessed that it was [...] "fascinating— and difficult— to watch. We're not used to Madonna on stage doing {{anything less than a}} fully rehearsed, slick stage show." [...] Concluding the review, Adams believed that Tears of a Clown professed Madonna's touring direction into the future. Writing for The Independent Nick Levine noticed that the singer [...] "tested out her stand-up comedy skills with a series of risqué jokes and took the opportunity to defend her controversial fashion sense." [...] Debbie Cuthbertson from The Sydney Morning Herald gave a positive review of the show, saying [...] "For the queen of self-control, it was an open, at times even vulnerable insight into her persona. She seemed relaxed, drinking Cosmopolitans as she spoke at length between songs." [...] Cuthbertson also commended the choice of Forum Theatre as a venue believing it to be [...] "inspired, and her crew lit up the grand old dame in a way that showcased all her delicate charms in a way I can't recall any other act having ever done." ...|$|E
