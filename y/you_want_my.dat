500|$|Rebecca Blissett of The Georgia Straight {{described}} the song as a [...] "percussion-bombed snot-rapper". According to Andrew Burgess of musicOMH, [...] "Dinosaur" [...] features a [...] "Mark Mothersbaugh-like whistle-synth" [...] {{and focuses on}} [...] "the grossness of older men hitting on younger girls". Burgess cites the line [...] "hey carnivore, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> meat, I know it" [...] as evidence for this. The UrbanWire's Cheryl Chia noted that the song is similar to [...] "Girlfriend" [...] by Avril Lavigne and Gwen Stefani's [...] "Hollaback Girl", while Monica Herrera of Billboard found it reminiscent of Vanity 6. According to Althea Legaspi of the Chicago Tribune, [...] "Dinosaur" [...] contains [...] "lyrical merit in that most women have experienced unwanted advances from a creepy way-too-old man".|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} Brown's laugh, {{followed}} by [...] "undislodgeable [...] piano notes." [...] Over these notes, the first {{lines of the}} refrain are rapped in a call and response interaction between Brown and Halliwell. The words [...] "tell," [...] "really" [...] and [...] "I wanna" [...] are repeated, so that the vocal tone and lyrics build up an image of female self-assertion. The refrain ends with the word [...] "zigazig-ha," [...] a euphemism for female desire, which is ambiguously sexualised or broadly economic. The first verse follows; Brown, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton sing one line individually, in that order. In this part, the lyrics have a pragmatic sense of control of the situation; they begin, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> future, forget my past." [...] This, according to musicologist Sheila Whiteley, taps directly into the emotions of the young teenage audience.|$|E
500|$|The title track, {{which was}} also the theme song to her MTV reality series The Ashlee Simpson Show, opens the album by {{introducing}} Simpson, who sings [...] "got stains on my t-shirt, and I'm the biggest flirt" [...] and [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> auto, want my autobiography / baby, just ask me". The Village Voice review described the song as [...] "wrist-pumping Joan Jett rock candy", but Stylus labelled the track [...] "an age-old trope and a boring one at that". [...] "Pieces of Me", a song about the comfort and happiness Simpson found in her relationship with Ryan Cabrera, has been characterised as a soft rock ballad with [...] "stringy guitar riffs". [...] "Shadow", described by People magazine as the [...] "most personal song" [...] on the album, is a slower tune in which Simpson recounts playing a lesser role to her sister when she was younger, but eventually finding her own identity.|$|E

500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can feel my burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>my</b> body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed her feet were [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all <b>you</b> <b>want,</b> <b>my</b> feet hurt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Jackson {{participated in}} the Sanremo Music Festival, {{entering}} [...] "You and Me" [...] an English-language version of [...] "Verso l'ignoto" [...] by siblings Marcella and [...] While [...] "You and Me" [...] did not win Best Song, it entered Italy's hit parade, peaking at number twenty-eight. That year Jackson signed on with German-based BCM Records and released the single [...] "Why Don't <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Love?" [...] Jackson recorded other material with BCM, but the label went bankrupt and album plans were scrapped. Jackson signed with Dino Records quickly thereafter. 1991 saw the release of No Relations, an album with strong house and funk influences. This album featured Jackson's top twenty-five Netherlands hit [...] "Sexbox".|$|E
2500|$|On August 26, 1980, {{before the}} release of All Shook Up, Petersson left the group to record a solo album with his wife Dagmar. The five-song mini-LP titled Tom Peterson and Another Language was {{released}} in 1984. Pete Comita replaced Petersson for the All Shook Up tour, and the band recorded five songs with Comita to contribute to two movie soundtracks. [...] "I'm the Man", [...] "Born to Raise Hell", and [...] "Ohm Sweet Ohm", which were produced by Jack Douglas, went to the film Rock & Rule. An accompanying soundtrack album for the film was never released and the songs weren't released until 1996 (on the Sex, America, Cheap Trick box set). [...] "Reach Out" [...] and [...] "I Must Be Dreamin'" [...] went to the film Heavy Metal and were produced by Roy Thomas Baker. [...] "Reach Out" [...] was written by Comita and Bob James. Comita left the band after completing the 1980–81 World Tour that promoted the All Shook Up album {{as well as the}} demo sessions for the band's forthcoming album. He would later claim that he co-wrote songs that appeared on the band's next two albums and was not credited. Jon Brant became Petersson's steady replacement. In July 1981, CBS Inc. sued Cheap Trick and their manager Ken Adamany for $10 million, alleging they were attempting to coerce CBS into re-negotiating their contract and had refused to record any new material for the label since October 1980. [...] The lawsuit was settled in early 1982 and work commenced on the next album—One on One, produced by Roy Thomas Baker. The band changed direction again, this time opting for an album full of brash, shout-along hard rock songs. The album spawned two minor hits with the power ballad [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>My</b> Love" [...] and the innuendo-laced rocker [...] "She's Tight". The music videos for both songs received heavy rotation on MTV.|$|E
