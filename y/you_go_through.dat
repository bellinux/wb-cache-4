Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor.

However, once Fox pushed X-Men from December to July, Ottman's commitment to direct [...] made him unable to work with Singer. Michael Kamen was eventually hired. Given the film was only completed shortly before its premiere, Kamen wrote the score to the finished scenes, which were sent to him just as work was done on them. Singer asked him not to use any songs in the soundtrack as he [...] "didn't want to date the movie". Due to Kamen's unfamiliarity with the comics, he only tried to [...] "represent Bryan Singer's filmic tone that he's made, for a comic book, a quite serious movie, {{which is about the}} capacity of humanity to categorize people by race, religion or type, and prejudice people against them based on their innate characteristics". Character-specific themes were written to [...] "identify these characters, as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the film, because they're not always clear." [...] For instance, Mystique's motif, focused on the cello as Kamen found it [...] "a very erotic-sounding instrument", played in the soundtrack as she was disguised as Wolverine. Due to time restrictions, the producers scrapped their original plan to record the score in London and did it in Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Forget About Us" [...] is a mid-tempo song lasting {{three minutes}} and fifty-three seconds, while drawing {{influence}} from pop and R with downtempo beats music genres. Written by Carey, Jermaine Dupri, Bryan-Michael Cox and Johntá Austin, and {{produced by the}} former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's [...] "We Belong Together". According to Michael Paoletta from Billboard, the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute. The song is composed in the key of G minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of F6. Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a [...] "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to [...] "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings, [...] "You just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding, [...] "There's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> / We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny", indicating that while {{they are no longer}} together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them and how strong their love was.

The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song, opining that [...] "It's similar to the process <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> when writing a melody: certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener. I wanted to find a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance". José Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, commented that Shakira was completely involved {{in the process of developing}} the fragrance and was [...] "extremely hands-on". Didier Maine de Biran, general manager of Puig USA, opined that S by Shakira was different from other celebrity-branded fragrances, saying [...] "What makes this stand out is how involved she [...] was. The key difference is she has the knowledge of what she wants and really wants to share it with her fans. She's involved. She's committed.

2500|$|Korzeniowski and {{conductor}} Terry Davies {{recorded a}} 60-piece orchestra at London's Abbey Road Studios in April 2011, concentrating on purely the emotional {{states of the}} characters, and did not concern himself too much with differentiating the periods of the film. In an interview with Variety, the composer said that for the scenes featuring Simpson, {{he tried to make}} the score be more modern than the scenes featuring Winthrop. Madonna wanted Korzeniowski to keep the score simple and direct. She felt that Korzeniowski being a classically trained musician, he would be cerebral in his approach to music and would over complicate the score. [...] "It is not the type of score where <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> crazy harmonic changes and modulations," [...] said the composer. [...] "This was one of the very precise notes I got from Madonna, that I was not supposed to over-think this music." [...] The main inspiration behind the score was the irrational love as portrayed in the film, which Korzeniowski said could be [...] "just an illusion". He wanted the music to reflect those powerful and conflicting emotions through the melodies, repeating between despair and sorrow, and hope and joy.|$|E

Metzen stated: [...] "Specifically for Overwatch {{over the past year}} we've been really cognizant of that, trying not to oversexualize the female characters."
