500|$|On February 1, 2006, Insane Clown Posse fan Jacob D. Robida {{attacked}} {{individuals in}} a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts with a handgun and a hatchet—a weapon {{featured in the}} logo of the group's record label, Psychopathic Records. Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious that this guy had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about. If anyone knows anything at all about ICP, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have never, ever been down or will be down with any racist or bigotry bullshit".|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums to let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} ask you," [...] said Kennedy, quietly, [...] "what you meant by giving the fags leave down town when <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ought to come to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's hard to say," [...] Matt answered. [...] "I thought so, too, at first. I {{thought it}} was cowardly and selfish of him to take away his children's superstition about his honesty. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> held to <b>that</b> through all?" ...|$|R
50|$|And so <b>you</b> should <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are taking}} 50 men from each town to {{help on the}} ships.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you bring}} {{division}} {{between these two}} mad creatures?' she returned. 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are both mad with their own self-will and pride?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he said, [...] "I can see {{a number}} of hoof-prints now you point them out. But how do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are Indian prints?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have no Colonies," [...] Brooks answered, smiling. [...] "You {{are only}} half an Imperialist. Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have been {{incorporated}} in the British Empire? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! he's {{going home}} to Down East," [...] said another; [...] "so far eastward, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> shippy, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have to pry up the sun with a handspike." ...|$|R
6000|$|They all waited, as if {{expecting him}} to speak, and then Corey said: [...] "How {{incredible}} those things seem already! <b>You</b> gentlemen <b>KNOW</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> happened; but are you still able to believe it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why did {{you come}} to tell me this?' said the King, passionately. 'Do <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have killed me already? I thought you came because there was still some one I could aid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Or, better still," [...] Mr. Hennibul said, [...] "do {{both with}} the Speaker. By the bye, did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{are going to make}} me a judge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Hanscom's {{tone was}} still defiant as he replied: [...] "It is, but I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were being chased {{out of the}} country at the time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Old Mr. Toad grew indignant. [...] "Those are not Grandfather Frog's children; they're mine!" [...] he sputtered. [...] "And I'll have <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{the most}} {{beautiful}} babies in th' world!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jack, [...] "if I fight, let me fight honest {{flesh and}} blood, that's all, {{and none of}} these outlandish monsters. How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> but <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are invulnerable by art-magic?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, sir, I am {{the bearer}} of {{something}} like a defiance; the people wish <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> hold your right cheaply, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> laugh at it. Not to mince matters, they defy you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will make}} <b>you</b> happy to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are making your mother happy, and the dear girls--and--and I {{have no doubt}} you will very soon get used to it. Many clergymen, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> think <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ought not to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{where you}} see one of them blue lights {{flickering}} around, Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason. Becuz <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> don't anybody but ghosts use 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Listen to me, Ram Das,' he said, 'and {{keep your}} counsel. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have tried to}} make all the sepoys lose caste and become like dogs and Pariahs, by putting cow's grease on the cartridges?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody does," [...] replied Johnny. [...] "Everybody {{loves them}} as much as they hate Bully and his wife. Did <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{sometimes}} called Tree Sparrows? I suppose it is because they so often build their nests in trees?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your investments," [...] he remarked, [...] "you will be content, perhaps, {{to leave}} as they are. It is, no doubt, of some {{interest}} to <b>you</b> to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are showing already a profit of considerably over a thousand pounds." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Police, indeed!" [...] she answered. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> all <b>they</b> {{have done}} so far is to keep sending {{for me to go}} and look at dead bodies down at the Morgue? I think that I shall send over for an English detective." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>know,</b> I suppose, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> elected {{me at the}} Athenæum? Pray thank Mr. Serjeant Storks for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, you did; but {{you forget}} everything. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> met two Boston ladies just {{after they were}} engaged, and she {{believed}} {{that he did n't}} introduce her because he was ashamed of her countrified appearance before them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{may be true}} of Ben Isaje himself; {{but what}} of his wife? his sons or daughters if he have any? his serving wenches, his {{apprentices}} and his men? How do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not amenable to promises of heavy bribes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you keep}} your tongue between your teeth, or else you'll get {{yourself}} in the hottest kind of water!" [...] burst out Bud Haddon. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can send you to prison for ten years for what you did?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It don't prevent {{your mother}} from going out, though," [...] {{continued}} my lord. [...] "Upon my honour, I think unless she got {{two or three}} things every night, I think she'd die. Lady Kew's {{like one of those}} horses, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>they</b> go they drop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On good terms? Do <b>you</b> not <b>know,</b> then, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are {{fighting}} again, outlaws, and desperate at the Frenchman's treachery? Do <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{have been driven}} out of York, after defending the city street by street, house by house? Do <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{there is not an}} old man or a child in arms left in York; and that your nephews, and the few fighting men who were left, went down the Humber in boats, and north to Scotland, to Gospatrick and Waltheof? Do <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> your mother is left alone--at Bourne, or God knows where--to endure at the hands of Norman ruffians what thousands more endure?" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{you wrote}} before, {{you were able}} to say the charges against him were not proven. But <b>you</b> <b>know</b> now <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are proven, {{and it seems to me}} that that bars you and all other honest and honorable men (who are {{independently}} situated) from voting for him.|$|R
6000|$|Strether on {{his side}} also reflectively smoked. It was as if their high place really {{represented}} some moral elevation from which they could look down on their recent past. [...] "There never was the smallest chance, do <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> WOULD have it for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I shall apologise to Mr. Hamel {{at all for}} the young people being away," [...] she declared. [...] "Just fancy what we have saved him from--a solitary meal served by Hannah Cox! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> say she is half-witted, Mr. Hamel?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{alluded to}} them yourself. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> cannot be forgotten. What do you expect? Let me also {{talk to you}} in figurative language. It happens {{sometimes}} that a tree is struck by lightning and killed in an instant--leaf, branch, and root--killed and turned to dust and ashes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must forgive {{my family}} {{for not being}} more hospitable. <b>You</b> must <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> live a very lonely life, and have no society because every living thing fears them. But I go abroad more and {{see more of the}} world, so I know very well how guests ought to be treated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> {{very well}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will {{disembark}} again upon {{the wrong side}} of the Channel. Unless Villeneuve scatters the English fleet, nothing can be attempted.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{a little}} hard to make them believe anything," [...] said the squire. [...] "They fancy, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>that</b> if <b>they</b> could get a hold of Mountjoy, so as to have him in their hands when the breath is out of my body and the bonds are really due, that then it may be made to turn out that he is really the heir." ...|$|R
