500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere.

500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> like it Daddy {{when you hit the}} spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E

2500|$|... "Were I {{no more to}} fare to Valhalla's fortress, do {{you know}} whither I fare? I depart from the home of desire, I flee forever the home of delusion; the open gates of eternal {{becoming}} I close behind me now: To the holiest chosen land, free from desire and delusion, {{the goal of the}} world's migration, redeemed from incarnation, the enlightened woman now goes. The blessed end of all things eternal, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> attained it? Grieving love's profoundest suffering opened my eyes for me: I saw the world end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Venetia, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have doted upon you; <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> {{have watched}} and tended {{you from your}} infancy.
