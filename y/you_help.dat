[...] Minaj's single [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] with Eminem was {{believed}} to be a response to Kim's comments, although she later denied this, she responded to the situation in an interview with HOT 97's Angie Martinez saying, [...] "She picked a fight with Foxy, then she picked a fight with Eve, then she picked a fight with Remy, then it was Mrs. Wallace, then it was Nicki Minaj. Every time you in the news, it's 'cause you gettin' at somebody! Where's your music? Put your music out, and when I see your name on Billboard, that's when I'll respond to you. Other than that, goodbye. It's Barbie, bitch." [...] Lil' Kim reignited the feud with the release of her mixtape Black Friday (the title of which directly referenced Minaj). The artwork portrays Lil' Kim decapitating Minaj with a sword. A fragment of a diss track called [...] "Tragedy" [...] was released in response by Minaj in April 2011. Following the release of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, critics suggested that the track [...] "Stupid Hoe" [...] may have contained attacks directed at Kim.

500|$|Karen Foss, a {{communications}} {{professor at the}} University of New Mexico, attributes Milk's impact on San Francisco politics {{to the fact that}} he was unlike anyone else who had held public office in the city. She writes, [...] "Milk happened to be a highly energetic, charismatic figure with a love of theatrics and nothing to lose... Using laughter, reversal, transcendence, and his insider/outsider status, Milk helped create a climate in which dialogue on issues became possible. He also provided a means to integrate the disparate voices of his various constituencies." [...] Milk had been a rousing speaker since he began campaigning in 1973, and his oratory skills only improved after he became City Supervisor. His most famous talking points became known as the [...] "Hope Speech", which became a staple throughout his political career. It opened with a play on the accusation that gay people recruit impressionable youth into their numbers: [...] "My name is Harvey Milk—and I want to recruit you." [...] A version of the Hope Speech that he gave near the end of his life was considered by his friends and aides to be the best, and the closing the most effective: And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias and the Richmond, Minnesotas who are coming out and hear Anita Bryant in television and her story. The only thing they have to look forward to is hope. And you have to give them hope. Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow, hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great. Hope that all will be all right. Without hope, not only gays, but the blacks, the seniors, the handicapped, the us'es, the us'es will give up. And if <b>you</b> <b>help</b> elect to the central committee and other offices, more gay people, that gives a green light to all who feel disenfranchised, a green light to move forward. It means hope to a nation that has given up, because if a gay person makes it, the doors are open to everyone.|$|E

2500|$|Shanties {{have also}} been {{well-documented}} in use for tasks other {{than those of the}} deep-water sailor.

The category of menhaden chanties refers to work songs used on menhaden fishing boats, sung while pulling up the purse-seine nets. The musical forms, and consequently the repertoire, of menhaden chanties differ significantly from the deep-water shanties, most noticeably in the fact that the workers [...] "pull" [...] in between rather than concurrently with certain words of the songs. Common examples are [...] "The Johnson Girls" [...] and [...] "Won't <b>You</b> <b>Help</b> Me to Raise 'Em Boys."

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{moves the}} reader {{from the idea}} of the Creator to that of an eternal salvation. Is {{there such a thing as}} an eternal salvation? He says. It may be a merit of our present age that in many ways it has known how to work the wish weary and in that way to wean the soul from wishing; it may be to its {{advantage}} if it thereby has developed an honest earnestness that for the good renounces the fraudulence of wishes. We do not reproach the age for having made the idea of the power of the wish into playing with words if it thereby motivates someone to work with his own hands instead of with the borrowed energy of the wish. But the wish for heaven's salvation-is this, too, a play on words, as wishing for heavenly help has become for the frivolous, who thinks that we ought to depend on God the way we depend on people –that is, if <b>you</b> <b>help</b> yourself then God does the rest. And if the wish for heaven's salvation has become playing with words, has the aim in it been to incite people to work all the harder to gain it? This seems not at all to be the case. Instead, eternal salvation seems to have become what the thought of it has become, a loose and idle phrase, at times virtually forgotten, or arbitrarily left out of the language, or indifferently set aside as an old-fashioned turn of speech no longer used but retained only because it is so quaint. And whereas in the old days one received heaven's salvation by the grace of God, nowadays heaven's salvation often seems to have become like an old, decrepit person who in the house of the mighty sustains his life on the miserable bread of charity.
