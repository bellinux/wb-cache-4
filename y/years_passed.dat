5|$|The {{following}} plot summary {{is that of}} {{the first}} performances in Paris with Grisi in the title role. The plot changed slightly in details as the <b>years</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alabama was a {{strongly}} Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic-Republican and Democratic parties. It had two Republican governors following Reconstruction, {{but after the}} Democratic Party re-established control, 112 <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before voters chose another Republican.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> {{between the}} first {{publication}} of Scouting for Boys {{and the creation of}} the current largest supranational Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the purview of the world's youth, and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries.|$|E

5|$|Florida was a {{strongly}} Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the Democratic and Whig parties. It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, {{but after the}} Democratic Party re-established control, 90 <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before voters chose another Republican.|$|E
5|$|Later events, {{such as the}} Boston Tea Party, further {{illustrated}} the crumbling relationship between Britain and its colonies. Although five <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> between the massacre and outright revolution, and direct connections between the massacre and the later war are (according to historian Neil Langley York) somewhat tenuous, it is widely perceived as a significant event leading to the violent rebellion that followed.|$|E
5|$|As <b>years</b> <b>passed,</b> the {{athletics}} department {{began to}} experience moderate success, and in 1945, Garden City won its first state championship in track {{as well as}} repeating the feat in 1946. A new high school was constructed in 1954, with the auditorium being completed the following year. The graduation credit limit was increased further to 19 credits in 1958. Garden City High School experienced many changes in 1959, including {{the creation of the}} counseling and honors programs.|$|E

5|$|Our Friends in the North {{helped to}} {{establish}} the careers of its four lead actors, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. Daniel Craig's part in particular {{has been referred to}} as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before it was adapted from a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, {{due in part to the}} BBC's fear of litigation.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Six <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> {{before the}} couple {{returned}} to screen writing, {{this time for}} the romantic comedy Murphy's Romance, based on a novel by Max Schott. Once again they worked with director Martin Ritt, their seventh project together, and Sally Field, who had played the titular lead role in Norma Rae. Despite Murphy's Romance being well-received (it was nominated for two Academy Awards) {{it would be another}} five years before Frank and Ravetch wrote another screenplay; hired by Martin Ritt, the couple wrote the screenplay for Stanley & Iris, loosely based on the novel Union Street.|$|E

5|$|The album {{received}} some critical acclaim, but achieved no commercial success, and Columbia Records ended their contract with Blue Öyster Cult {{at the completion}} of the Imaginos Tour. Albert Bouchard, excluded from the recording progress of Imaginos after the initial rejection from Columbia Records, then took legal action against the band and the label to protect his rights as author and producer on the album. Blue Öyster Cult continued to perform and remained a live attraction, but ten <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before they released an album of new songs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{permanent}} Portuguese {{settlement in}} the land which would become Brazil was São Vicente, which was established in 1532 by Martim Afonso de Sousa. As the <b>years</b> <b>passed,</b> the Portuguese would slowly expand their frontiers westward, conquering more lands from both indigenous Americans and the Spanish. Brazil had secured most of its present-day borders by 1750 and was regarded by Portugal {{as the most important}} part of its far-flung maritime Empire. On 7 September 1822, the heir of Portuguese King Dom João VI secured the independence of Brazil from Portugal and, as Dom Pedro I, became its first Emperor.|$|E
5|$|The first {{subatomic}} particles to be formed included protons, neutrons, and electrons. Though simple atomic nuclei formed {{within the first}} three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before the first electrically neutral atoms formed. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were hydrogen, along with helium and traces of lithium. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity to form stars and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either within stars or during supernovae.|$|E

5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music. Most {{of the members of}} Mahaleo have also launched individual humanitarian projects, in addition to the cooperative they formed together in the 1980s to support the hand-made production of traditional musical instruments, and the Centre des informations de communication, d'animation, formation et d'éducation (CICAFE) rural development center they launched in 2000. As the <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics as environmental conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Eleven <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> {{until the}} next Scottish Cup final appearance, when United lost 1–0 to Celtic in 2005. Sandwiched {{in the middle of}} these {{appearances}} was a defeat on penalties to Stenhousemuir in the Scottish Challenge Cup (when United failed to concede a goal in the whole competition) and a 3–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1997 Scottish League Cup Final. United then lost the 2008 Scottish League Cup Final on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2–2 after extra time. Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010, under the guidance of manager Peter Houston, when First Division side Ross County were defeated 3–0 in the 2010 Scottish Cup Final. David Goodwillie scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). Though none of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted to reassert himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. However, as the <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> he became increasingly distanced from his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking, the nightclub industry, and parliament {{by the time of}} his death in 1971.|$|E

5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the <b>years</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
5|$|On August 28, the {{occupation}} of Japan led by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers began. The surrender ceremony was held on September 2, aboard the United States Navy battleship , at which officials from the Japanese government signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, thereby ending the hostilities. Allied civilians and military personnel alike celebrated V-J Day, {{the end of the}} war; however, some isolated soldiers and personnel from Japan's far-flung forces throughout Asia and the Pacific islands refused to surrender for months and years afterwards, some even refusing into the 1970s. The role of the atomic bombings in Japan's unconditional surrender, and the ethics of the two attacks, is still debated. The state of war formally ended when the Treaty of San Francisco came into force on April 28, 1952. Four more <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> before Japan and the Soviet Union signed the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, which formally brought an end to their state of war.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the <b>years</b> <b>passed</b> he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. His hard work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

50|$|So Let Five <b>Years</b> <b>Pass</b> (Así que pasen cinco años), {{also known}} as If Five <b>Years</b> <b>Pass</b> and When Five <b>Years</b> Have <b>Passed,</b> is a play by the 20th-century Spanish dramatist Federico García Lorca. It was written in 1931 but was not given a {{professional}} theatrical production until several years after Lorca's death, despite plans to stage it in 1936. It was produced in an English-language translation at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York in April 1945. It received its Spanish-language première in 1954 at the University of Puerto Rico. In September 1978 it opened at the Teatro Eslava in Madrid.|$|R
