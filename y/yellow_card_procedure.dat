50|$|Field hockey: A <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> {{indicates}} a temporary suspension {{of at least}} 5 minutes. The length of the suspension {{is determined by the}} umpire. It is possible for a player to receive two <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> for different offences during the same match; however, the period of suspension must be significantly longer with each <b>yellow</b> <b>card.</b> When an offence for which a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> has been awarded is repeated, the <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> must not be used again and a more severe penalty must be awarded. There must also be a clear difference between the duration of a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> suspension for a minor offence and the duration for a major offence. The <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> can be shown to a specific player or to the captain for misconduct by the entire team. In this case, the captain is temporarily suspended.|$|R

25|$|The {{deciding}} {{game for}} the Group F runners-up place, Croatia vs. Australia, saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly issue three <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> to Croatian Josip Šimunić before sending him off. Šimunić was shown a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Australian Harry Kewell. In the 90th minute, Poll held up a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in front of Šimunić for a foul, but did not follow it with a red card, as is required upon a second <b>yellow</b> <b>card.</b> In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll angrily {{and gave him a}} push. Poll thus issued Šimunić with a 3rd <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> and also showed him the red card.|$|R
50|$|Players also {{received}} a one match ban if they picked up a single <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> in two different games {{from the beginning of}} the group stage until the end of the quarter-final matches, at which point single <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> were negated. However, such a ban did not carry over beyond the World Cup finals if the second <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> was collected in his team's last match of the tournament. Previously, players received a one match ban if they picked up two <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> within the group stage or within the knockout stage. The carried <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> rule was changed to give players a better chance to compete in the final in case their team advanced that far.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{qualification}} tournament, {{a player}} would be suspended for the subsequent match {{in the competition}} for either getting red card or accumulating two <b>yellow</b> <b>cards</b> in two different matches.

30|$|Soccer is an eventful sport. Any unfair {{behaviour}} or some foul {{may cause}} {{the issue of}} a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> to the player. The <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> itself is a very important event because it is like a warning to the issued player. Issuing a second <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> to the player (red card) compels the player to discontinue the game. This event itself gains very high importance; if the <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> has been issued in the penalty area, then the opponent may be offered a penalty kick which may eventually end in scoring a goal by the opponent. Hence, it may generate a series of events. An algorithm to detect a <b>yellow</b> <b>card</b> by examining every frame of the segments obtained after event segmentation is described below.|$|R
