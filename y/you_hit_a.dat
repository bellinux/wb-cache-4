500|$|After more behind-the-scenes {{contract}} wrangling, Smith {{became a}} St. Louis Cardinal on February 11, 1982. Herzog believed Smith could improve his offensive production by hitting more ground balls, and subsequently created a motivational tool {{designed to help}} Smith concentrate on that task. Approaching Smith one day during spring training, Herzog said, [...] "Every time <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> fly ball, you owe me a buck. Every time <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> ground ball, I owe you a buck. We'll keep that going all year." [...] Smith agreed to the wager, {{and by the end}} of the season had won close to $300 from Herzog. As the 1982 season got underway, Herzog's newly assembled team won 12 games in a row during the month of April, and finished the season atop the National League East division. Herzog would later say of Smith's contributions that, [...] "If he saved two runs a game on defense, which he did many a night, it seemed to me that was just as valuable to the team as a player who drove in two runs a game on offense." ...|$|E

If a man gets a heavy bullet, whether in an arm, a leg, or the body, there is no more fight in him. You can tell by the sound of the bullet if you hit the figure, and if you hit him you have done what you want to. You do not need to practise at distances over three hundred yards; that is quite the outside range at which you would ever want to do any shooting, indeed from fifty to two hundred I consider the useful distance to practise at. If you get to shoot so well that you can with certainty hit a man between those ranges, you may feel pretty comfortable in your mind that you can beat off any attack that might be made on a house you are defending.|$|E
60|$|Saumarez {{knew this}} when he {{made up his mind}} to propose to the elder Miss Copleigh. Saumarez was a strange man, with few merits, so far as men could see, though he was popular with women, and carried enough conceit to stock a Viceroy's Council and leave a little over for the Commander-in-Chief's Staff. He was a Civilian. Very many women took an {{interest}} in Saumarez, perhaps, because his manner to them was offensive. If <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance, he may not love you, but he will take a deep interest in your movements ever afterwards. The elder Miss Copleigh was nice, plump, winning and pretty. The younger was not so pretty, and, from men disregarding the hint set forth above, her style was repellant and unattractive. Both girls had, practically, the same figure, and there was a strong likeness between them in look and voice; though no one could doubt for an instant which was the nicer of the two.|$|E

6000|$|The next sect of {{superficial}} objectors is {{even more}} irritating. I have called them, for immediate purposes, the Casuists. Suppose I say [...] "I dislike this spread of Cannibalism in the West End restaurants." [...] Somebody is sure to say [...] "Well, after all, Queen Eleanor when she sucked blood from her husband's arm was a cannibal." [...] What is one to say to such people? One can only say [...] "Confine yourself to sucking poisoned blood from people's arms, and I permit you to call yourself by the glorious title of Cannibal." [...] In this sense people say of Eugenics, [...] "After all, whenever we discourage a schoolboy from marrying a mad negress with a hump back, we are really Eugenists." [...] Again one can only answer, [...] "Confine yourselves strictly to such schoolboys as are naturally attracted to hump-backed negresses; and you may exult {{in the title of}} Eugenist, all the more proudly because that distinction will be rare." [...] But surely anyone's common-sense must tell him that if Eugenics dealt only with such extravagant cases, it would be called common-sense--and not Eugenics. The human race has excluded such absurdities for unknown ages; and has never yet called it Eugenics. You may call it flogging when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>a</b> choking gentleman on the back; you may call it torture when a man unfreezes his fingers at the fire; but if you talk like that a little longer you will cease to live among living men.

5000|$|<b>Hitting</b> is <b>a</b> {{variation}} of the common laying off of another player's meld (i.e.: <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>an</b> opponent's set of three 10s with the other (10).
