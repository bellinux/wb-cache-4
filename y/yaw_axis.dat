5|$|The {{avionics}} software {{incorporates the}} concept of open architecture. Instead of the military-optimised Ada programming language, the software is written using the popular C++ programming language, enabling {{the use of the}} numerous civilian programmers available. The aircraft also includes a health and usage monitoring system, and automatic test equipment. The flight control system (FCS) comprises conventional controls with stability augmentation in the yaw and roll axis and a digital fly-by-wire (FBW) system in the pitch axis. The leading edge slats/flaps and trailing edge flaps are automatically adjusted during manoeuvring to increase turning performance. The FCS of serial production aircraft reportedly have a digital quadruplex (quad-redundant) FBW system in the pitch axis and a duplex (dual-redundant) FBW system in the roll and <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E

The measurements areacquired through Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), whichdetermine the position, velocities and rotations at roll, <b>yaw</b> andpitch <b>axis</b> respectively. Usually IMU’s are very expensive, but herewe have used low cost IMU and by low cost it means lowperformance as well. This is the main reason of introducing GPSto provide stability and feedback to the system. It is observed fromthe results that the errors of GPS are above 8 meters. These errorsare reduced up to 2 - 3 meters by combining Inertial NavigationSystem with GPS...|$|R

40|$|A {{hydrogen}} peroxide fueled rocket system, {{which is to}} be used as a research tool in flight studies of stall and spin maneuvers, was installed on a light, four place general aviation airplane. The pilot controlled rocket system produces moments about either the roll or the <b>yaw</b> body <b>axis</b> to augment or oppose the aerodynamic forces and inertial moments acting on the airplane during various flight maneuvers, including the spin. These controlled moments of a known magnitude can be used in various ways to help analyze and interpret the importance of the various factors which influence airplane maneuvers.

50|$|Rudder pedals control {{rotation}} of the plane about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b> There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{falling leaf}} is a {{controlled}} stall {{performed in a}} fixed-wing aircraft. The maneuver is performed by purposely stalling the airplane and then carefully using the rudder to try to hold the aircraft on a steady course. The falling leaf consists of a constant rotation about the <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> while continually changing the direction. This is opposed to a flat spin, where the aircraft constantly rotates around its <b>yaw</b> <b>axis</b> in only one direction, similar to a Frisbee. The falling leaf is sometimes described as carefully [...] "walking" [...] the aircraft while stalled. The maneuver is typically performed mostly with the rudder, trimming with the elevator but keeping the ailerons neutral.|$|E
40|$|Several large (1500 kW) {{horizontal}} rotor configurations were analyzed {{to determine the}} effects on dynamic loads of upwind downwind rotor locations, coned and radial blade positions, and tilted and {{horizontal rotor}} axis positions. Loads were calculated for a range of wind velocities at three locations in the structure: (1) the blade shank; (2) the hub shaft; and (3) the <b>yaw</b> drive.

40|$|Blade {{rotation}} routinely {{and significantly}} augments aerodynamic forces during zero <b>yaw</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> wind turbine operation. To {{better understand the}} flow physics underlying this phenomenon, three-dimensional and rotational viscous effects on wind turbine blades are investigated by means of 3 -D boundary layer model. The governing equations of the model are derived from 3 -D primitive variable boundary-layer equations written in cylindrical coordinates in the rotating frame of reference. The latter are integrated along the peripheral direction with the radial distance as parameter for a particular external flow. The skin friction coefficient is used to identify boundary layer separation and shear layer reattachment locations, Separation and reattachment kinematics shows at inboard locations that while the separation point location is not really affected and remains near the leading edge, the reattachment point advances forward rapidly on the blade chord from the trailing edge as radial distance decreases. It is concluded that the rotational augmentation is linked to specific separation and reattachment state strictly determined by the Coriolis forces. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new method of computing constant scallop height tool paths in 5 -axis milling. Indeed, usual iso-scallop tool path computation methods in 3 -axis or 5 -axis milling generate tool path selfintersections, which prevent {{from reaching the}} required quality and productivity. The proposed approach consists in following parallel planes in 5 -axis milling to avoid self-intersection of the tool path. The constant scallop height is guaranteed by modifying the machined strip width {{by means of the}} orientation angles of tool <b>axis</b> (<b>yaw</b> and tilt angles). Resulting scallop height and surface roughness are simulated using the NBuffer method...|$|R

Resulting nystagmus slow component velocity (SCV) was analyzed for EOD, FIX, and VVR conditions.

Using data collected at a number of sites, the time-dependent simulation of a MOD- 2 wind turbine using various, site-dependent operating strategies provided evidence that site-specific fine tuning can produce significant increases in long-term energy capture as well as reduce the number of start-stop cycles and yawing maneuvers, which may result in reduced fatigue and subsequent maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Unlike statically stable wheeled mobile robots, {{dynamically}} stable mobile robots {{can have}} higher centers of gravity, smaller bases {{of support and}} can be tall and thin resembling {{the shape of an}} adult human.

40|$|Abstract: An {{improved}} {{dutch roll}} approximation for hypersonic vehicle is presented. From the new approximations, the dutch roll frequency {{is shown to}} be a function of the stability <b>axis</b> <b>yaw</b> stability and the dutch roll damping is mainly effected by the roll damping ratio. In additional, an important parameter called roll-to-yaw ratio is obtained to describe the dutch roll mode. Solution shows that large-roll-to-yaw ratio is the generate character of hypersonic vehicle, which results the large error for the practical approximation. Predictions from the literal approximations derived in this paper are compared with actual numerical values for s example hypersonic vehicle, results show the approximations work well and the error is below 10 %.

5000|$|The initial {{production}} {{version of}} the Greif, the He 177 A-1, tended to be unstable in the yaw and pitch axes during flight tests in August 1942, which would have led to poor bombing accuracy. Shortly after these tests, the third production A-1 example (factory serial number 15153, with Stammkennzeichen of GI + BN) had its fuselage lengthened by 160 cm (63 in) just aft of {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The modified aircraft, with the longer distance of the [...] "tail moment", showed a marked degree of improvement in <b>yaw</b> and pitch <b>axis</b> stability, enough to mandate the construction of the He 177 A-3 and all later models of the He 177 with the lengthened fuselage.|$|R
30|$|Considering online proclivity test, {{response}} latency {{was computed}} {{in the two}} categories: <b>axis</b> (<b>yaw</b> and pitch) and response type/strategy (egocentric, allocentric, and incorrect). For statistical analysis, we excluded ‘incorrect’ response type from online proclivity test. For analysis, first, a two-way ANOVA with factor axis and response type was calculated to root out differences in the response latency. The analysis revealed non-significant effect of factor axis, F(1, 210) =  2.8, p >  0.05, and factor response type, F(1, 210) =  3.545, p >  0.05. Second, one-way ANOVA was applied to see interaction effect of response latency on the navigation performance. The results showed that that neither of the two FORs introduced any bias, positive or negative, to the aggregate performance measure, F(4, 22) =  1.427, p >  0.05.|$|R
