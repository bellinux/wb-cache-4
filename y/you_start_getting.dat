2500|$|Rollins {{said that}} he had {{conducted}} a thorough internal investigation into Harris's ties to MZM in hopes of finding conclusive proof of her innocence; but when he could not, he and other advisers, including her lawyer, urged her to drop her candidacy rather than risk federal corruption charges.

Supermarket chain ASDA said that the sales of frozen chargrilled aubergine slices had increased by 150% due to the book. Smith responded to criticism about naming specific products by saying, [...] "We debated long and hard whether to mention products {{but at the end of}} the day this book is for people who are either in a hurry or are afraid to cook.

5000|$|Couldn't Stand the Weather, the band's second studio album, saw an outpacing {{of sales}} to Texas Flood. Recorded in January 1984, the album {{included}} musicians such as Fabulous Thunderbirds' members Jimmie Vaughan and Fran Christina, {{as well as}} saxophonist Stan Harrison, who performed on [...] "Stang's Swang". Following the album's release in May 1984, the group toured internationally, staging concerts in Scandinavia, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. Acknowledging the challenge posed by constant international touring to his marriage, Vaughan admitted, [...] "The hard part is that I don't get to see my wife very often, but if she comes {{out on the road}} it's harder because she's not used to it. If you're not used to it, it only takes two or three days and then <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>getting</b> on each other's nerves, and that's worse." [...] On October 4, 1984, the group performed at Carnegie Hall in celebration of Vaughan's thirtieth birthday, featuring many special guests such as the Roomful of Blues horn section, Dr. John, Jimmie Vaughan, Angela Strehli, and George Rains, and was met with positive reception. The band's first Australia visit, in October-November, included two sold-out shows at the Sydney Opera House.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Trevor de Brauw {{stated that}} [...] "City of Echoes is moulded by the {{experience}} of touring—the title sort of refers to the feeling you get that, although {{you go to a}} lot of different places, one of the effects of globalisation is that you see so many similarities from city to city."

But I've found in working with the sonnets they even transcend the plays, though to even fathom that is inconceivable since the plays are so amazing. But once <b>you</b> <b>start</b> to <b>get</b> into the sonnets it takes on this timeless, ageless, almost futuristic quality. So much of the language and so much of the sentiment is contemporary -- gender and sexuality and love and hate are just so plainly exhibited that it's really searing.|$|R

5000|$|Howard {{began writing}} songs {{when he was}} eleven. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, he stated {{that when he was}} a kid he started playing guitar because he liked to put words together and make stuff up. [...] "I was quite an imaginative little kid I guess. So your standard little love songs turned into your standard adolescent love songs. I think <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>getting</b> your own take on things when you're a late teen. That's when everything changes." [...] Besides playing the guitar, Howard also played other instruments as a kid. He easily picked up the drums and contrabass, but after some time he decided to focus on the guitar. After attending King Edward VI Community College and Torquay Boys' Grammar School he began studying Journalism at University College Falmouth, Cornwall. Six months prior to completion of his course, Howard decided to focus on making music full-time, making melodic rootsy folk music, with progressively darker lyrics. His reputation grew around Cornwall and Devon, and soon spread to other areas of the UK. After a month of sold-out dates across Europe and the UK Howard was eventually asked to sign for Island Records.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} {{about the new}} direction the series would be taking, Silvio Horta told E!'s Kristin Dos Santos at an ABC press meeting for its show runners, [...] "This season {{is going to be}} about growing up. We aren't going to be doing anymore child-like storylines. It {{is going to be about}} moving Betty forward." [...] He then added more details to MediaWeek about the changes: [...] "On Ugly Betty I think we started to veer a little too much into the romantic storyline, where it started to really become the show. And it started to just get away from what I originally wanted to do and where we originally started, which was about a girl making it in the city and her work life. So we're trying to refocus that back. But there's always temptation and you want to explore it. You want to have the opportunity to explore it. And the second <b>you</b> <b>start</b> <b>getting</b> too involved in it, it's like any plot line. You go in; it's very hard to get out and it takes a little longer." [...] He later revealed that the audience would see a more evolving Betty: [...] "Betty will solve a crime. Inject Botox. Get attacked by an animal. Throw a Wilhelmina mannequin down a flight of stairs. And that's just the first three episodes." ...|$|E
