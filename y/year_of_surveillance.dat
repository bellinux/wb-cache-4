Methods: hospital-based mass screening of 6339 65 – 73 -year-old men from 1994 – 98. 76. 4 % attended. One hundred and ninety-one (4 %) had AAA≥ 3 cm. Twenty-four (0. 5 %) were initially > 5 cm and referred for surgery, {{while the rest}} were offered annual control scans to check for expansion. Later, all 348 (7. 5 %) men who 3 to 5 years ago had an ectatic aorta (infrarenal aortic diameter of 25 – 29 mm or distal/renal aortic diameter ratio > 1. 2) were offered rescreening. Of these, 62 (18 %) died before rescanning, while 248 of the survivors attended rescreening (87 %). Furthermore, {{a random sample of}} 380 of those with non-ectatic aortas were offered rescreening. Of these, 49 (13 %) died before rescreening (p= 0. 06), while 275 (83 %) of the survivors attended re-screening. Results: none of the controls had developed AAA. Of those who initially had an 25 – 29 mm aorta, 29 % had developed AAA (size range 30 – 48 mm) with expansion rates varying from 1. 0 to 4. 7 mm/year. Only 3. 5 % with a ratio > 1. 2 developed AAA (size range: 30 – 34 mm) with expansion rates from 1. 3 to 2. 4 mm/year. During the fourth <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> some AAA initially sized below 3. 5 cm expanded to above 5 cm, while some sized 3. 5 – 3. 9 cm did so during the second year, > 4 cm did so during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Conclusion: rescreening for AAA can be restricted to initially ectatic aortas sized 25 – 29 mm at 5 -year intervals.

40|$|Abstract. An {{outbreak}} of cholera began in Haiti in October of 2010. To understand {{the progression of}} epidemic cholera in Haiti, in April of 2012, we initiated laboratory-enhanced surveillance for diarrheal disease in four Haitian hospitals in three departments. At each site, we sampled up to 10 hospitalized patients each week with acute watery diarrhea. We tested 1, 616 specimens collected from April 2, 2012 to March 28, 2013; 1, 030 (63. 7 %) specimens yielded Vibrio cholerae, 13 (0. 8 %) specimens yielded Shigella, 6 (0. 4 %) specimens yielded Salmonella, and 63 (3. 9 %) specimens tested positive for rotavirus. Additionally, 13. 5 % of children < 5 years old tested positive for rotavirus. Of 1, 030 V. cholerae isolates, 1, 020 (99. 0 %) isolates were serotype Ogawa, 9 (0. 9 %) isolates were serotype Inaba, and 1 isolate was non-toxigenic V. cholerae O 139.

40|$|In Finland {{there is}} {{statutory}} surveillance of several swine diseases. We {{have studied the}} representativeness of the control programs for AD, TGE and PRRS. These diseases are not at the moment present in Finland and moreover Finland has additional guaranties in the EU for AD and TGE. The control programs are based approximately on 1000 yearly blood samples that are taken from sows in the slaughterhouses. Surveillance of the studied diseases in Finland has been implemented as planned during the studied years 2008 - 2009.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Infection with Cryptosporidium parvum {{generally}} {{causes a}} self-limiting diarrheal illness. Symptoms can, however, last {{for weeks and}} can be severe, especially in immunocompromised individuals. In 1994, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) recommended that cryptosporidiosis be a nationally notifiable disease. Forty-seven states have made infection with C. parvum notifiable to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and laboratories in the three remaining states report cases to state health departments, which may report them to the CDC. To see what the data show about patterns of infection, the authors reviewed {{the first four years}} of reports to the CDC. METHODS: The authors analyzed reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis for 1995 - 1998. RESULTS: During 1995 - 1998, 11, 612 laboratory-confirmed cases of cryptosporidiosis were reported to the CDC. All ages and both sexes were affected. An increase in case reporting was observed in late summer during each <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> for people < 20 years of age. CONCLUSION: The first national data on laboratory-confirmed cryptosporidiosis cases, although incomplete, provide useful information on the burden of disease in the nation as well as provide baseline data for monitoring of future trends...|$|E
