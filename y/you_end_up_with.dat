He felt that [...] "The List" [...] embodied a bland stand-alone X-Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script, with [...] "attempts at drama" [...] that had no depth, and [...] "sideplots [...] have so {{little effect on the}} main narrative as to be basically padding".

[...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental.

2500|$|Kabakov {{described}} {{the colors of}} paint in The Russian Series and Three Green Paintings as the main characters. The brown sandy soil color of the first series was the same enamel used in the Soviet Union during the 1950s and 1960s to paint everything from roofs to hallways, but most often floors. Kabakov {{points out that the}} color of the state is red but the color of the country is gray, due to its “humdrum existence”. [...] Kabakov assigns these colors a metaphysical meaning of earth and nature as controlled and depicted by the Soviet state. [...] He then suggests that if you mix these two colors <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the brown sandy soil color, which signifies both the floors and the ground that support the feet of the populace of the Soviet Union. The green of the second series is enamel that was used to paint {{the lower part of the}} walls up to one meter high in order to protect them from dirt and scuffs. For Kabakov, these colors evoke feelings of unavoidable hopelessness. More pertinent to this argument is what these series of paintings do not address. Political ideology is absent and only impersonal colors exist to dominate minor features, all of which are faceless texts and objects.|$|E

2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously {{want to hear about}} the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, the last word in tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E
2500|$|Final Fantasy All the Bravest was [...] {{critically}} panned. [...] Critics {{mainly focused}} on the [...] "poorly and greedily structured in-app purchases" [...] and [...] "shallow" [...] gameplay.

[...] Pocketgamer strongly criticized the gameplay and in-app purchase system stating, [...] "There's hardly a game here to begin with - it's more a series of flashing lights to try and entice you to throw some cash down, cross your fingers, and hope <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a character you like." [...] Slide to Play criticized the game for having [...] "No rhyme, reason, or strategy to gameplay; the game is a thinly-disguised piggy bank for in-app purchases." [...] Digital Spy echoed the criticisms on the method of in-app purchases and poor gameplay, stating that it was [...] "almost a parody of the worst examples of free-to-play games" [...] and criticizing [...] "its reliance on predatory in-app purchases that exist solely to make loyal fans waste their money. As a free-to-play cash grab it would have still held some appeal, but the core gameplay is just too shallow without significant rewards to make it even worth the price of admission." [...] 1UP.com also stated, [...] "ATB is essentially a narrow tunnel you blindly run down, and where games typically have choices for you to make -- whether it be what skill to choose, what weapon to pick up, what player to substitute in, what kind of unit to build, or whatever else -- there is nothing here." [...] In a rare move, IGN issued a public service announcement not to buy the game, and later cited the game for making money despite bad reviews and high prices. Pocket Tactics also gave a similar public service announcement to not buy the game stating, [...] "I have been an apologist in the past for Square Enix’s unusually high price points for its Final Fantasy iOS ports. [...] Developers have to make money, and no one should begrudge that. But the way that All The Bravest goes about it is so gauche, so ill-mannered, that it can only be interpreted as a measure of Square Enix’s disdain for its own fans." [...] Kotaku stated that the game is emblematic of Square Enix's lack of respect for fans, and a desire to milk the franchise for money. GamesRadar ranked it as the 44th worst game ever made. The staff accused its developers of cashing in on the Final Fantasy brand. US Gamer cited the game as being the most notable misstep Square Enix had done since CEO Yosuke Matsuda took over, though it also noted that the project had begun under the previous CEO Yoichi Wada.|$|E
