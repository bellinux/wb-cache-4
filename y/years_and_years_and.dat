500|$|Adam Noah Levine {{was born}} in Los Angeles on March 18, 1979 to Fred Levine, the founder of retail chain M. Fredric, and Patsy (née Noah) Levine, an admissions counselor. He has a brother Michael, two half-siblings Sam and Liza Levine and step-sister Julia Bartolf Milne. Levine's father and {{maternal}} grandfather are both Jewish, while his maternal grandmother was a Protestant. Levine considers himself Jewish, though according to an interview with The Jewish Chronicle, he [...] "has rejected formal religious practice for a more generalized, spiritual way of life." [...] He chose {{not to have a}} Bar Mitzvah as a child, explaining: [...] "I felt as though a lot of kids were trying to cash in ... I just don't think it's the most respectful way to deal with God and beliefs and <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years of cultural heritage." [...] Levine is a nephew of journalist and author Timothy Noah, television producer and writer Peter Noah, and economist Jordan Levine.|$|E

She had been with Liverpool's {{forerunners}} Knowsley United, but was cup-tied for their appearance in the 1994 final. Easton said: [...] "I've been trying for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> haven't {{been able to do}} it [...] before. It would obviously be great for the club, because we haven’t won it as 'Everton', but on a personal note it would just be absolutely fantastic."

2500|$|After [...] "Normal" [...] aired, {{internet}} sources {{began to}} summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting [...] "JFK! FDR!" [...] and walking on chairs. As the cast {{did not understand the}} game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to [...] "have fun, dig in, jump in" [...] and play it as if [...] "they'd been playing this thing for <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years." [...] The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MS) is {{a combination}} of medical disorders that increase one's risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Little information exists on the prevalence of MS in a general adult population in Taiwan. Methods We did a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 2, 359 Chinese adults aged 40 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over who lived in a metropolitan city, Taiwan in 2004 – 05. MS was defined by Adult Treatment Panel III criteria modified for Asians. Results The prevalence of MetS was 35. 32 % and 43. 23 % in men aged 40 – 64 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over, respectively, and 24. 19 % and 51. 82 % in women aged 40 – 64 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 65 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over. Older age, postmenopausal status, higher body mass index, current smoking, low education attainment, low household income, no alcohol consumption, lower level of occupation physical activity, and a family history of diabetes were associated with increased odds of MetS. Conclusion MetS was present in more than 30 % of the Taiwan adult population aged 40 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> over in a metropolitan area; there were substantial variations by age and body mass index groups. </p...|$|R

40|$|Studies on age {{and growth}} in fishes are {{essential}} to establish models on population dynamics. The previos issues were determined in this study by scale growth analyses. Between September 2003 and May 2004, 382 organisms were captured using gill and atarraya nets. Eight samples were developed every month a long this study. Standard length in centimeters (Le), total weight in grams (Pt), scale length in centimeters (Lesc) and growth rings were determined. The size and weight ranged from 38 to 232 mm (Le) and 8. 7 to 311. 9 g (Pt), respectively. The growth rings analyses reveal four age groups, being the second group the most representative with 34. 3 % of the total sampled. The scale ring analyses showed two growth rings, one develops between November-January and the other between April-May, in good correlation with low temperature and gonad development, respectively. The growth parameters were established as: L??= 281. 1 mm, W??= 877. 1 g, K= 0. 33 and T 0 = 0. 88 year- 1. The growth curves based on length and weight were described by using the von Bertalanffy model: Le = 28. 11 [1 -e- 0. 33 (t+ 0. 88) ] and Pt= 877. 17 [1 -e- 0. 33 (t+ 0. 88) ] 3.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the economic costs of avoidable mortality (AM) in Colombia {{during the period}} 1998 to 2011, with the human capital perspective valuing the productivity lost. MethodsThe information of cases of avoidable death was identified from the Colombian official general mortality database, and we estimated the potential productivity years of life lost, assuming a productive life span between 18 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 57 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 18 <b>years</b> <b>and</b> 62 <b>years</b> in women <b>and</b> men, respectively. Two scenarios were built: lower loss with the minimum wage, and higher loss with the per capita gross domestic product. Total costs for the period were reported by sex and health event. Average cost per 1000 people was also estimated. All costs were adjusted and reported in 2012 US dollars. ResultsSixty-eight {{percent of the total}} AM in Colombia during the period 1998 to 2011 occurred during or before the productivity age. The total AM costs were estimated to range between US $ 80. 5 million and US $ 150. 4 million. Higher costs of AM were incurred in men. Events from the injuries group caused the higher productivity lost. ConclusionsAll the avoidable deaths in Colombia have a huge economic impact from the productivity lost perspective, equivalent to between 1. 6 % and 3. 0 % of the annual gross domestic product. The cost analyses in public health are an additional input for decision making and prioritization of intervention...|$|R
40|$|The {{concerns}} about {{global climate change}} are growing <b>year</b> <b>and</b> <b>year</b> <b>and</b> carbon capture on ships is an excellent solution to global warming. To meet the IMO target of 20 % CO 2 reduction from shipping by 2020, solidification of CO 2 separated from engine exhaust had been proposed and tested by the authors as {{an effective way to}} mitigate the CO 2 emission while other low carbon shipping technologies being developed. After a comprehensive literature review on onshore CCS methods, mechanically implemented current carbon capture and storage technologies on ships is not practical because there are various limitations on practical application on ships. In this paper, a novel chemical CO 2 absorption and solidification method for CO 2 storage onboard is proposed, presented and analyzed. Technical feasibility with principles explanation and cost assessment are carried out for a selected case ship with a comparison of proposed method and liquefaction methods. This paper presents results obtained from laboratory experiment and CFD simulations including key factors that affect the absorption rate, such as the geometry of reaction tank, flow rate of gas input and concentration of alkaline solution. Case study and laboratory experiment have indicated that the proposed CO 2 solidification method is a promising, cost effective and practical feasible method for carbon emission reduction on ships...|$|R
