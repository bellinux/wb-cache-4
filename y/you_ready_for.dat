500|$|The episode {{ends with}} a {{reference}} to [...] "Restore Stephen Baldwin", a real-life website seeking to restore actor Stephen Baldwin's career and solicit donations to repay his $2.3 million debt. The joke compares Towelie's addiction and rehabilitation to that of Baldwin, who {{had a history of}} drug abuse before becoming a born-again Christian. A version of [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>for</b> the Summer?", a camp theme song sung by children in the comedy film Meatballs, is featured. The episode makes reference to actress Kirstie Alley when a counselor says Towelie is the most troubled towel he had seen since Alley's towel, who he said [...] "has seen some nasty stuff".|$|E

500|$|During the riffing of the film, {{the robot}} {{character}} Crow T. Robot claims the film [...] "was {{run through a}} highly technical process called 'tension extraction, and the other robot Tom Servo calls it so dull, [...] "There's {{a point where it}} stops being a movie". Mike and the robots make particular note of film critic Leonard Maltin's relatively high two and-a-half star rating of the original film. The episode also makes several references to McDowall's performances in the Planet of the Apes films, and makes several jokes at the expense of Deezen and his stereotypically nerdy character, at one point dubbing him [...] "heir to the Arnold Stang fortune". Mike and the robots repeatedly sang [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>for</b> Some Football?" [...] whenever Deputy Ungar appeared on screen due to his resemblance to country singer Hank Williams, Jr.|$|E
500|$|During the 1970s, Jennings {{joined the}} Outlaw Country movement. He {{released}} critically acclaimed albums Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes followed by hit albums Dreaming My Dreams {{as well as}} Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>for</b> the Country. In 1976, he released the album Wanted! The Outlaws with Willie Nelson, Tompall Glaser, and Jessi Colter, the first platinum country music album. That success was followed by Ol' Waylon and the hit song [...] "Luckenbach, Texas". Jennings was featured in the 1978 album White Mansions performed by various artists documenting the lives of white people in the Confederacy during the Civil War. The songs on the album were written by Paul Kennerley. By the early 1980s, Jennings was struggling with a cocaine addiction, which he quit in 1984. Later, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen with Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash, which released three albums between 1985 and 1995. During that period, Jennings released the successful album Will the Wolf Survive. He toured less after 1997 {{to spend more time}} with his family. Between 1999 and 2001, his appearances were limited by health problems. On February 13, 2002, Jennings died from complications of diabetes.|$|E
500|$|The {{basic premise}} of the episode, {{as well as the}} design of Peter's panic room, are based on the movie Panic Room. When Peter's Paleolithic {{ancestor}} is attempting to market the wheel, Brian tells him [...] "You so money, you don't even know it", a reference to the film Swingers. His ancestor says [...] "Let's party like it's 9" [...] in reference to the Prince song [...] "1999." [...] The story of Nate Griffin, an ancestor of Peter, makes references to the first installment of Roots, as well as the LAPD's low-speed pursuit of O. J. Simpson following his wife's murder and the song [...] "Hot for Teacher". Nate Griffin {{is a member of the}} tribe of Tootie-and-Blair, a reference to The Facts of Life. The scene in which the slave ship captain is thrown overboard uses the song [...] "Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>For</b> the Summer?" [...] from the film Meatballs. The story about Peter's ancestor who was a silent film star is a spoof of Singin' in the Rain, as the girl in Singin' in the Rain did not have a good voice for the talking pictures. His speaking voice, deemed unacceptable for talkies, was a spoof of Bobcat Goldthwait.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, Jennings {{released}} Lonesome, On'ry and Mean and Honky Tonk Heroes, {{the first}} albums recorded and released under his creative control. The release of these albums heralded a major {{turning point for}} Jennings, kicking off his most critically and commercially successful years. More hit albums followed with This Time and The Ramblin' Man, both released in 1974. The title tracks of both albums topped the Billboard Country singles chart, with the self-penned [...] "This Time" [...] becoming Jennings's first no. 1 single. Dreaming My Dreams, released in 1975, included the no. 1 single [...] "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way" [...] and was his first album to be certified gold by the RIAA; {{it was also the}} first of his next six consecutive, solo studio albums to be certified gold or higher. In 1976, Jennings released Are <b>You</b> <b>Ready</b> <b>for</b> the Country, Jennings wanted the record to be produced by Los Angeles producer Ken Mansfield. Although RCA denied the request, Jennings and The Waylors went to Los Angeles and recorded with Mansfield at his expense. After a month, Jennings presented the master tape to Chet Atkins, who decided to release it. The album hit number one on Billboards country albums three times the same year, topping the charts for 10 weeks. It was named Country album of the year in 1976 by Record World magazine and it was certified gold by the RIAA.|$|E

2500|$|Newfound {{goes off}} of the Summative {{assessment}} and Formative assessment continuum. Most of the teachers weigh the summatives as 90% of the overall grade for the quarter and 10% formatives for the overall grade for the quarter. Each quarter (4) is 20% of the overall grade, and exams (midterm/Test (assessment)) are 20% of the final grade. So they factor in 80% from the four quarters, and 20% from the midterm grade and the final exams. That adds up to 100% for the final grade. Formatives would be homework, short essays, and Document-based question. Most of the time, these materials would get <b>you</b> <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> the Summatives. Summatives would be quizzes (sometimes formative), projects, tests, etc. The following table shows the grading table that Newfound goes off of: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Detroit Spinners {{were also}} signed to the Motown label {{and had a}} hit with the Stevie Wonder-produced song [...] "It's A Shame" [...] in 1970. They left soon after, {{on the advice of}} fellow Detroit native Aretha Franklin, to Atlantic Records, and there had disco hits like [...] "The Rubberband Man" [...] (1976).

The Four Seasons themselves were briefly signed to Motown's MoWest label, a short-lived subsidiary for R/soul artists based on the West Coast, and there the group produced one album, Chameleon (1972) - to little commercial success in America. However, one single, [...] "The Night", was released in Britain in 1975, and thanks to popularity from the Northern Soul circuit, reached number 7 on the UK Singles Chart. The Four Seasons left Motown in 1974 and went on to have a disco hit with their song [...] "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" [...] (1975) for Warner Curb Records.|$|E
