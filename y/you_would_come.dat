500|$|Shaw was one {{of three}} {{children}} born to Dr. Geoffrey Shaw, the music master at Gresham's School, a Norfolk independent boarding school, where Shaw began his education. His uncle, Martin Shaw, was a composer of church music, and his family's love of music heavily influenced Shaw's career path. Shaw made his acting debut at age eight on the London stage as one of the juvenile band in The Cockyolly Bird at the Royal Court Theatre in Chelsea on New Year's Day of 1914. During his time at Gresham's, he also played Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, his first of many performances from the works of William Shakespeare; schoolmate W. H. Auden, who would go on to become a highly regarded poet, portrayed Katherina in the play opposite him. After Gresham's, Shaw planned to become a painter and spent two years at the Slade School of Fine Art before switching his interests to acting; regarding the change, his father informed him, [...] "I wondered when <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to your senses." [...] He earned a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in Bloomsbury, London. Actor Charles Laughton enrolled in the Academy {{at the same time as}} Shaw, who later said his first impression of Laughton was [...] "a poor fat boy". Although Shaw and his fellow students initially felt pity for Laughton, they were quickly impressed with his talent.|$|E
2500|$|Kugle quotes the Qur'an: [...] "O people, {{we created}} you all from {{a male and}} a female And made you into {{different}} communities and tribes So that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{to know one another}} Acknowledging that the most noble among you Is the one most aware of God.” Qur'an 49:13 (Kugle’s translation). Then Kugle continues, “the implication of this verse is that no Muslim is better than another,” even “a gay or lesbian Muslim.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In pre-release {{publicity}} for I have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, Ellison {{said that it}} would be a game [...] "you cannot possibly win". Though the gaming media found that the finished game backed away from this controversial promise, and Sears said that he had convinced Ellison that having a game with only negative endings was a bad idea, in a 2013 interview Ellison insisted that [...] "I created it so you could not win it. The only way in which you could [...] "win" [...] was to play it nobly. The more nobly you played it, the closer to succeeding <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come,</b> but you could not actually beat it. And that annoyed the hell out of people too." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I knew <b>thee</b> <b>would</b> <b>come,</b> Ralph, and I was {{longing for}} a face that I knew," [...] he said. [...] "Ay, to the last my poor girl remembered thee. I'm going home to England--stayed here too long; and Canada seems empty without her. Only time to catch the liner, or I'd have come to Fairmead, and I've much to tell thee {{on the road to}} Winnipeg." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah!" [...] {{cried the}} Daughter of the House, involuntarily {{springing}} to her feet. [...] "I {{was so afraid}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> to that." ...|$|R
2500|$|..... when you'd {{finished}} {{your duty}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> away {{nothing had happened}} no bombs or anything and the driver would switch his wheel back {{and to make the}} truck waver and the poor wog on the front would roll off into the deck. Well if he was lucky he'd get away with a broken leg but if he was unlucky the truck behind coming up behind would hit him. But nobody bothered to pick up the bits they were left. You know we were there we were the masters we were the bosses and whatever we did was right... Well you know you don't want him any more. He's fulfilled his job. And that's when Bill Usher [...] said that it had to stop because before long they'd be running out of bloody rebels to sit on the bonnet.|$|E
6000|$|... "If only <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to help me! Oh! Richard, if only <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to help me," [...] the poor, {{worn-out}} girl {{murmured to}} herself, and so murmuring fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|THE BISHOP. Yes, you! {{think of}} what it would do for you. For her sake <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to care unselfishly and {{diligently}} for money instead of being selfishly and lazily indifferent to it. For her sake <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to care in the same way for preferment. For her sake <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> to care for your health, your appearance, the good opinion of your fellow creatures, and all the really important things that make men work and strive instead of mooning and nursing their salvation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, mamma? Wherever we have been, we {{have always}} been together. Mrs. Bluestone was quite unhappy because <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come.</b> They are so good-natured! I wish <b>you</b> <b>would</b> go there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "What is the matter, Rupert,--has {{anything}} happened to Edgar? I {{know that it}} must be something very serious or <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>come</b> like this." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Maybe {{they thought}} <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>come</b> {{down here and}} wait for them and so changed their plans and went up the river instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|Geoffrey hastily disclaimed {{any such}} intention, and Elizabeth started alone. [...] "Ah!" [...] {{she said to}} herself, [...] "I thought that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come,</b> my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, M'sieu," [...] said Dominique, grimacing, [...] "I {{must not}} go back with such an answer. If <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come,</b> I was to give you this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At any rate," [...] Tavernake declared, [...] "you must be fond of your {{daughter}} or <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not <b>come</b> here {{night after night}} {{just to look at}} her." ...|$|R
