500|$|In March 2008, Bleeding Through {{announced}} Declaration as {{the title}} of its fifth studio release, a concept album about the rigors of being away from home. The band's frontman and lyricist Brandan Schieppati explained to Revolver in the magazine's May 2008 issue, [...] "There are definitely places when we're traveling where every time we go there, we're like, 'Fuck, {{why do we have to}} be here?' Like, we'll be in France and all of a sudden we'll feel totally insignificant. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> people's eyes are just burining a hole through you." [...] The group recorded Declaration between April and May 2008 in Vancouver, Canada with producer Devin Townsend.|$|E
500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), and that may be true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} two stars out of five and said that [...] "when you play , <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{everyone}} involved with the franchise will be secretly relieved when the whole juggernaut finally grinds to a permanent halt." [...] The Escapist also gave it two stars out of five and said, [...] "If you want {{to stare at the}} back of Harry's head while he shouts [...] "Stupefy!" [...] forty times a minute, this is the game for you. If not, then you'd better look elsewhere." ...|$|E
5000|$|Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "While dark, 'Headache' {{also offers}} up lots {{of action and}} a couple of genuine jaw-droppers. It also sets up the last episode of the season for some big explosions, with Nick running on vengeance. Nick, Renard and Adalind all have cause to look for payback, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> n next week's finale will deliver." ...|$|R
2500|$|Critic Desson Howe {{liked the}} look of the film and wrote, [...] "Cinematographer Haskell Wexler etches the {{characters}} in dark charcoal against a misty background. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of dirt, sweat and – despite the story's mythic intentions – the grim grey struggle of it all. And Sayles, struggling for authority from Return of the Secaucus Seven through The Brother From Another Planet, has finally tapped the vein." ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusics Jared Johnson said [...] "together with a {{powerful}} rhythm section, Hancock and Clark prove they are the real thing by connecting with listeners who resonate with the struggles and prodigal cries invested in <b>the</b> lyrics. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> these guys know {{a thing or two}} about heartache, personal adversity, and overcoming rebellion. Kudos also for turning out a full volume of new material rather than simply retooling their EP." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a good review, {{giving it a}} B overall. In her recap: [...] "There are two {{competing}} themes in this Once Upon A Time double-episode finale, and one is leagues more successful than the other. Just when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> OUAT can do little else but beat a dead horse forever (Hades’ blue hair! The River Of Lost Souls!), it pulls out actual insight about the duplicitousness of personality, handily personified by Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, {{as well as the}} Evil Queen herself, Regina." ...|$|E
5000|$|The PopMatters {{review by}} Daniel Spicer claims [...] "This is breathtaking stuff" [...] and notes that [...] "Anderson may be 77 years old but {{his is a}} powerful, thrashing, muscular tone that’s not afraid to take risks. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that,</b> here in his own club, he’s {{comfortable}} enough to just blow." ...|$|E

"From the off the {{charisma}} {{between the}} characters is obvious … Mundair clearly {{has an excellent}} grasp over dialogue as everything fits into place perfectly, to the extent where <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> you're just eavesdropping on the group at {{the table next to}} you on your average Saturday night out."Radio Telefís Éireann (R.T.E.

5000|$|Crystal Castles' musical {{style has}} been {{described}} as [...] "ferocious, asphyxiating sheets of warped two-dimensional Gameboy glitches and bruising drum bombast that pierces your skull with their sheer shrill force, burrowing deep into the brain like a fever." [...] To listen to Crystal Castles, according to the BBC, [...] "is to be cast adrift in a vortex of deafening pain without a safety net. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>you</b> could do anything in the world, but that 'anything' would ultimately mean nothing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Susie Garrard of Renowned for Sound {{gave the}} album a {{favorite}} review saying [...] "Though {{there was a}} great deal of charm to the untried, untested talent that hinted at a great deal more to come, Rhodes more than delivers on that promise with Wishes... <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> even now, Rhodes is still just beginning to touch the edges of his talent." ...|$|E
5000|$|Declaration is {{the fifth}} album by American metalcore band Bleeding Through. The song's titles are named after {{different}} states and cities. Frontman Brandan Schieppati commented, [...] "There are definitely places when we're traveling where every time we go there, we're like, 'Fuck, {{why do we have}} to be here?'

5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{rated the}} album 3.5 out of 5 stars, praising the ballads and noting that [...] "The tension between Combs' {{traditional}} side and modern inclinations {{is what gives}} This One's for You some freshness and it surfaces often." [...] Chuck Dauphin of Sounds Like Nashville wrote that [...] "vocals are one thing that Combs has in his favor. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> no producer had to coach him to be country", while also praising Combs's songwriting.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Bands windup {{pitch to}} Going, Going, Gone is a wonder of {{pinpoint}} ensemble playing," [...] writes Riley. [...] "Robertson makes his guitar entrance choke as if a noose had suddenly tightened around its neck, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> these guys could shadow Dylan in their sleep." [...] Riley also writes that [...] "Tough Mama is the track that exemplifies the best playing on Planet Waves, and a pitch of writing that shows Dylan can still challenge himself." [...] Clinton Heylin also singled out Dylans performances, noting that [...] "Tough Mama" [...] featured [...] "one of his raunchiest vocals".|$|R
5000|$|Director Eli Roth {{has called}} the giallo [...] "one of my {{favorite}}, favorite subgenres of film," [...] and specifically cited Sergio Martino's Torso (I corpi presentano tracce di violenza carnale) (along with the Spanish horror film Who Can Kill a Child?) as influential on his 2005 film Hostel, writing, [...] "...these seventies Italian giallos start off {{with a group of}} students that are in Rome, lots of scenes in piazzas with telephoto lenses, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> they're being watched. There's this real ominous creepy <b>feeling.</b> <b>The</b> girls are always going on some trip somewhere and they're all very smart. They all make decisions the audience would make." ...|$|R
500|$|Sing's {{life was}} recounted in {{a chapter of}} Laws and Stewart's book, There's always {{more to the story}} (2006), and in greater depth by Hamilton in his book, Gallipoli Sniper: The life of Billy Sing (2008). Hamilton's book {{includes}} a detailed account of how snipers worked at Gallipoli and their contribution to the progress of the campaign. Reviewer John Wadsley wrote that [...] "Hamilton is able to bring together a range of sources to create the story, and while at times, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> he is padding it out {{to make up for the}} lack of direct material about Billy Sing, the book works." ...|$|R

5000|$|For {{the second}} series, David Renshaw of The Guardian {{said it was}} [...] "a welcome return from the gang", and commented [...] "Despite its larger-than-life characters, People Just Do Nothing’s success lies in its believability ... <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if you drove out to Brentford you might {{actually}} run in to them." [...] He especially praised the comedy provided by DJ Steves and Chabuddy G.

5000|$|The album {{received}} generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 15 reviews. All-noise said [...] "Colour of the Trap is a promising and entertaining first solo effort, {{if he can}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> mix of attention-grabbing chart fodder and deeper, engaging album tracks right then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> Miles Kane might just become unstoppable", while Scotsman.com said [...] "He has the tunes, but occasionally sounds strained with the effort of being hip and popular. <b>The</b> retro hang-ups <b>get</b> in <b>the</b> way of something undeniably modern. Colour of the Trap {{is one of the}} few to escape that syndrome." [...] Jamie Crossman from NME said [...] "‘Colour of the Trap’ isn’t quite a perfect debut, but by stepping out from the shadows, Miles Kane has come away smelling of roses." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ian Mc.Farlane {{regarded}} the [...] "notorious" [...] Vampire Lovers as [...] "a third-generation garage punk outfit". British fanzine, Bucketfull of Brainss journalist, Hugh Gulland, {{felt they were}} [...] "irmly rooted in The Damned / Misfits – horror punk axis" [...] and suggested that their appeal extended to fans of garish apparel exemplified by [...] "pink leopardskin". The Vampire Lovers' admiration for unusual or camp horror movies were expressed in their lyrical themes for songs such as [...] "Drink My Blood, Suck My Veins" [...] and [...] "Second Generation Psychopath". A review by The Barman of the website I-94 Bar, described them as [...] "our young, trash movie-obsessed reprobates". Jeff Dahl {{former member of the}} Angry Samoans and Powertrip said of the Vampire Lovers, [...] "(w)ild and raunchy displays of ultra-punkness from this infamous Aussie backwoods unit..., <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> these guys weren't playing punk rockers".|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All I Have" [...] was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers, and was shot in New York City in November 2002. MTV News revealed that Lopez and LL Cool J would be playing ex-lovers in the music video. According to a synopsis provided by Meyers' production company, [...] "They keep seeing visions of each other, and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they are {{still very much in}} love, yet they don't get back together because they feel that this is the best thing for them. It will have a very happy winter wonderland-type feel, but a sad vibe." [...] The video was shot right before Thanksgiving, but did not premiere on television until after Christmas.|$|E
5000|$|... "From {{the opening}} stereopanned {{hypnotic}} indian riffs, this album began to reel me in. Expertly executed performances from all. [...] "She" [...] - a great rock song sandwiched between the aforementioned 'indianisms' {{and a beautiful}} chamber orchestra finale! Then the straight-ahead riffing of [...] "Sirens" [...] gets serious. Comparisons to anyone do this band a disservice. [...] "Sense", like [...] "She" [...] makes fine use of the stereo picture in its guitar and vocal work. Simple but highly effective. Great contemporary rock harmonies, just enough edge to the singer's vocals - which are inherently listenable. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> this band's creative well runneth over. A truly great rock album, by anyone's standards." [...] - Kevin Moore, Jamendo UK.|$|E
500|$|... "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. While reviewing Femme Fatale, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted Spears [...] "does what pop stars invariably do {{in lieu of}} having a detectable character of their own: {{goes on and on}} about sex", while commenting that [...] "after a while, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>the</b> lyricists just gave up trying in the face of her indifference: 'You got me kind of hot … Steaming like a pot full of vegetables,' she sings, which somehow makes you think not of thrillingly sweaty congress but the smell of boiled cabbage." [...] Contemporary critic Robert Christgau noted the songs on the album are [...] "such a convincing illusion that any guy who goes all the way with it has too much libido invested in the bimbo fantasy", saying that the singer is [...] "just too straight-faced" [...] on [...] "the nauseous 'Your body look so sick I think I got the flu'". A reviewer of Samesame.com.au compared the background vocals of the song to Kesha's [...] "Blow" [...] (2010), and noted [...] "guest rapper Sabi wish she was Nicki Minaj". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani considered [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] one of the album's [...] "best offerings", comparing the song to Christina Aguilera's [...] "Desnudate" [...] (2010).|$|R
5000|$|A {{review by}} The A.V. Club writer Evan Rytlewski felt Krell's voice was better off hiding in many effects, writing that [...] "He wails in a gaunt falsetto that’s {{continually}} stretched just past its range, {{and the effect}} is something like Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne singing Prince in the shower." [...] The review was still positive; Rytlewski wrote that the tracks [...] "reveal how harmonically rich those Love Remains songs were under all their static" [...] and that [...] "it’s a marvel, in retrospect, how Krell condensed such oversized melodies into such scruffy recordings." [...] Coke Machine Glow summerized the record's move from Love Remains towards a more quality recording style as an [...] "interesting but ultimately disappointing experiment", writing {{that all of the}} tracks [...] "lack something abstract but necessary". Pitchfork described it as [...] "a potential argument that How to Dress Well is best in short four- or five-song bursts, the way the first few EPs arrived-- <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> Krell's songs evoke for 18 or 20 minutes, and then you move on." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jono Davies, {{giving the}} album {{three and a}} half stars from Louder Than the Music, writes, [...] "Some songs on this album are more {{creative}} than others, {{but at the end of}} the day, these are top songs from a top vocalist." [...] In a three star review, Andrew Funderburk of CM Addict says, [...] "It is still fun and creative at its respective points, but ultimately it doesn’t live up to the potential that it could have had." [...] Awarding the album five stars for Christian Review Magazine, Leah St. John states, [...] "The Remixes is a replay-worthy collection of awesome tracks." [...] Indicating in a four-star review at 365 Days of Inspiring Media, Micah Garnett describes only one [...] "minor gripe on an otherwise outstanding remix album." [...] Reggie Edwards, writing for The Front Row Report, rating the album eight stars out of ten, says, [...] "While The Remixes doesn't offer up any original song material, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> of listening to an all-new record." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "(I Love It When You) Call Me Names" [...] {{was written}} about {{two men in}} a band who were always arguing, and {{features}} a guitar solo by Adrian Belew. It was released as a single, though it did not chart. It subsequently became a staple of Armatrading's live performances and has appeared on many of her compilation albums. Armatrading said of the song, [...] "It's come out as {{a man and a}} woman, but I was really looking at two guys. Not two gay guys, just two guys who are friends who tend to treat each other like this, always calling each other names. There's sort of this love/hate relationship between them, but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they really enjoy this thing that they're going through." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{filming of}} the movie was mostly done later in the day, Sinatra preferring to work {{at that time and}} the filming {{schedule}} being tailored around this. Sinatra also insisted that all the musical scenes in the film and songs therein be recorded live on set to keep the performances more genuine. Frank Sinatra: [...] "When I do a concert and someone coughs, I like that," [...] Sinatra remarked. [...] "I like the scraping of chairs. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it's really happening. I've always thought Lewis was one of only about four or five great artists in this century - one of them was Jolson - and I remember him screaming like the devil when he made a soundtrack."

5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "in one song after another on this album, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> he started out playing some {{familiar}} song in a specific genre and eventually extrapolated upon it enough to call it an original." [...] In his review for Rolling Stone magazine, David Wild gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars, writing that the album is [...] "a welcome flashback" [...] to Knopfler's earlier work with Dire Straits. Wild continued: Knopfler duets with James Taylor on the title track, which deftly explores the relationship between Mason and Dixon; Van Morrison trades lines on the soulful [...] "The Last Laugh." [...] With Sailing to Philadelphia, Knopfler has taken a break from the rootsy side projects and soundtrack work that have occupied him for the last seventeen years, and has evoked some of the grandeur of prime Dire Straits.|$|E
5000|$|Upon its release, Peace Kehd was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. Jordan Lebeau of XXL said, [...] "Backed by nostalgic production, EP and Matter Ov Fact rhyme well and exhibit a great level of chemistry on the mic. Upon numerous listens, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> it sounds more like a compilation of never before released Camp Lo and Mobb Deep cuts than something original. However, the duo does venture outside the NY golden-era blueprint such as “KnowntchooTahLie,” {{which is one of}} the better songs on the LP." [...] Daryl Keating writing for Exclaim! stated, [...] "Even if the reiterations and sexual focus drag Peace Kehd down a few notches, the Doppelgangaz still have some slick production holding up the album. Aside from a couple of so-so, club-friendly tracks, the record is beautifully produced, particularly the short interlude songs." [...] William Donovan of HipHopDX said, [...] "With quality production to offset the sometimes repetitive themes in their obscene raps, Peace Kehd is another enjoyable listen from The Doppelgangaz." ...|$|R
5000|$|Martin D'Souza, of Glamsham.com noted that, Minor flaws apart, college {{students}} are going to identify with this flick and I suspect there will be mass bookings {{in the days to}} come. Nikhat Kazmi of Times of India rated the movie 2 out of 5 stars and opined that, [...] "The film's too slow and the scene's are too repetitive and <b>you</b> do <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> things aren't really going anywhere. But wait patiently, and the mood will catch up".|$|R
5000|$|Classic Rock stated: [...] "Jimmy Lea {{was always}} the most enigmatic, talented and {{attractive}} member of Slade. Now pursuing a successful career as a therapist, his solo album {{seems to be more}} a labour of love than a stab at a comeback. Virtually a one man show a la Todd Rundgren/Roy Wood, Lea doesn't hide his influences, lyrically it's a universe away from the dyslexic musical football chants of his former employees. It's a treasure trove of lo-fi nuggets. And any album that name checks John Bonham and Phil Lynott in one verse has got to be worth the price of admission. Commendable and inspiring." [...] Trucking magazine wrote: [...] "OK, it's definitely not Slade Mk II - and it's not even The Dummies Mk II. It's light years from [...] "Cum On Feel the Noize" [...] but is not easy to pigeonhole, being a collection of tracks that are clearly the work of a multi-talented one-man band a la Roy Wood. Broadly speaking, it's a great album to listen to - and [...] "listen" [...] is <b>the</b> key word. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> these are personal lyrics, a genuine labour of love in both words and music - and because of that, maybe not necessarily a serious comeback in terms of chart success, but more a case of [...] "doing what I like, how I like it". Jim promises more in the future and I personally can't wait." ...|$|R
