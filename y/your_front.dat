5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get <b>your</b> <b>front</b> wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

500|$|In July 2015, Underoath began teasing {{the phrase}} [...] "rebirth is coming" [...] and an {{accompanying}} cryptic video across their social media accounts. The audio portion to the cryptic video, when played backwards, {{turned out to}} be the chorus for [...] "It's Dangerous Business Walking Out <b>Your</b> <b>Front</b> Door" [...] off the band's 2004 album They're Only Chasing Safety, and later a countdown timer ending on August 24, 2015 later appeared on the band's website.|$|E

500|$|The song's final choruses {{include the}} line [...] "You {{may think of}} Sexy Sadie, let her in through <b>your</b> <b>front</b> door", reprising the late-period Beatles device of self-reference. In this case, Harrison name-checks [...] "Sexy Sadie", John Lennon's thinly veiled attack on the Maharishi and the latter's alleged sexual {{advances}} towards one of the female students at the Rishikesh retreat. Inglis views this mention in [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as significant on three levels: Harrison is alluding to a casual sexual partner in the present; recalling his former mentor and guru, the Maharishi; and supplying [...] "a coded reference" [...] to his past as a Beatle.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} months of 2004, Underoath {{returned}} to the studio with Chamberlain as lead vocalist and producer James Paul Wisner. They're Only Chasing Safety was released on June 15, 2004, and proved to be a more commercial success for the band, going onto outsell the previous three albums combined. The album sold close to 100,000 copies in its first week of release and was certified gold by the end of 2005, selling more than 487,000 copies. With Gillespie being the only original member, They're Only Chasing Safety had been a vast change in sound and rhythm from what they performed earlier on. [...] "Reinventing Your Exit" [...] and [...] "It's Dangerous Business Walking out <b>Your</b> <b>Front</b> Door" [...] were released as the album's two singles and both songs spawned music videos that received frequent airplay on MTV2 and Fuse.|$|E
500|$|Meade {{made his}} {{decision}} {{late that night}} in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There {{is some evidence that}} Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, [...] "If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in <b>your</b> <b>front.</b> ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre." ...|$|E

2500|$|A proper stance {{starts with}} your feet being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, <b>your</b> <b>front</b> foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. [...] As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. [...] Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. [...] Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. [...] The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. [...] <b>Your</b> <b>front</b> arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E
