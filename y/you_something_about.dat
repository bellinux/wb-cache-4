People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have {{the same level of}} connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told you have money is an insult." ...|$|E

Bra companies remain reluctant to manufacture Tyrer's prototype, which is a front closing bra with more vertical orientation and adjustable cups.|$|E
2500|$|At Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek {{writes that}} Dark Willow is [...] "far {{from being a}} cut-out angry lesbian, is more fleshed out, and more terrifyingly alive, than she has ever been before. More than any other character, she has driven the {{momentum}} of the past few episodes; she very nearly drove it off a cliff." [...] Several writers state that Willow's transition into Dark Willow is inevitable, grounded in Willow's self-hatred that had been festering from the first season. Both Dark Willow and even Willow herself state that Willow's sacrifices for her friends and lack of assertiveness are her undoing. In [...] "Doppelgangland", Willow (posing as Vampire Willow) says [...] "It's pathetic. She lets everyone walk all over her and gets cranky at her friends for no reason." [...] In [...] "Two to Go", Dark Willow remarks [...] "Let me tell <b>you</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Willow. She's a loser. And she always has been. People picked on Willow... and now Willow's a junkie." [...] Vamp Willow served as an indicator of what Willow is capable of; immediately before she flays Warren in one violent magical flash, she uses the same line Vamp Willow used in the third season: [...] "Bored now." ...|$|E
