25|$|In Rationality in Action (2001), Searle {{argues that}} {{standard}} notions of rationality are badly flawed. According {{to what he}} calls the Classical Model, rationality is seen as something like a train track: you get on at one point with your beliefs and desires and the rules of rationality compel <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to a conclusion. Searle doubts this picture of rationality holds generally.|$|E

6000|$|... "To {{a certain}} extent, my dear," [...] her father admitted, [...] "I am with <b>you.</b> Not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> though. One needs, of course, to discriminate.

6000|$|... "Every {{round of}} it! By George! {{to think that}} I should have lived to have had such a fight all to myself! Oh, but it was grand," [...] he cried, {{in a frenzy of}} delight, [...] "to see his lordship go down like a pithed ox and her ladyship {{clapping}} her hands behind the bush! I guessed there was something in the wind, and I followed <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> When you stopped, I tethered little Ginger in a grove, and I crept after you through the wood. It's as well I did, for the whole parish was up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{any other}} {{time of the year}} and for a shorter cruise, I should be delighted to join you. But as I prefer dying a dry death, I must decline {{accompanying}} <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Scilly Islands in a little pleasure boat of thirteen tons, just {{at the time of the}} autumnal equinox. You may meet with a gale that will blow you out of the water. You are running a risk, in my opinion, of the most senseless kind--and, if I thought my advice had any weight with you, I should say most earnestly, be warned in time, and give up the trip."--Extract from the letter of A Prudent Friend.|$|E

From that summit you would see nothing but a vast dim desert, {{mountain}} and forest, mountain and forest, where you might wander for years, or until you perished of hunger or fever, or were slain by some beast of prey or by savage men; but oh, Rima, never, never, never would you find your people, for they exist not. You have seen the false water of the mirage on the savannah, when the sun shines bright and hot; and if one were to follow it one would at last fall down and perish, with never a cool drop to moisten one's parched lips. And your hope, Rima--this hope to find your people which has brought <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Riolama--is a mirage, a delusion, which will lead to destruction if you will not abandon it." ...|$|E

60|$|Look {{under the}} crimson sumach yonder, {{there in the}} bit of brown grass, with the purple asters hanging over, {{and you will find}} his form, where he has been sitting all the morning and where he watched <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up the hill. But you need not follow; you will not find him again. He never runs straight; the swaying leaves there where he {{disappeared}} mark the beginning of his turn, whether to right or left you will never know. Now he has come around his circle and is near you again--watching you this minute, out of his bit of brown grass. As you move slowly away in the direction he took, peering here and there among the bushes, Bunny behind you sits up straight in his old form again, with his little paws held very prim, his long ears pointed after you, and his deep brown eyes shining like the waters of a hidden spring among the asters. And he chuckles to himself, and thinks how he fooled you that time, sure.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then the}} getting forward of our cannon! On the Muhlberg itself the seventy-two Russian guns, [...] "owing to {{difference}} of calibre," [...] or artillery-men know what, {{cannot be used}} by us: a few light guns, Tempelhof to one of them, a poor four in all, with perhaps 100 shot to each, did, by the King's order, hasten {{to the top of}} the Muhlberg; and never did Tempelhof see a finer chance for artillery than there. Soft sloping ground, with Russians simmering ahead of <b>you,</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> down to Kunersdorf, a mile long: by horizontal pointing, you had such reboundings (RICOCHETS); and carried beautiful execution! Tempelhof soon spent his hundred shots: but it was not at once that any of our sixty heavy guns could be got up thither. Twelve horses to each: fancy it, and what baffling delays here and elsewhere;--and how the Russian whirlpool was settling more and more, in the interim! And had, in part, settled; in part, got through to the rear, and been replaced by fresh troops! ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus have my {{spouse and}} I {{informed}} the nation, [...] And led <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to reformation; [...] Not with dull morals, gravely writ, like those, [...] Which men of easy phlegm with care compose,-- [...] Your poets, of stiff words and limber sense, [...] Born on {{the confines of}} indifference; [...] But by examples drawn, I dare to say, [...] From most of you who hear and see the play. [...] There are more Rhodophils in this theatre, [...] More Palamedes, and some few wives, I fear: [...] But yet too far our poet would not run; [...] Though 'twas well offered, there was nothing done. [...] He would not quite the women's frailty bare, [...] But stript them to the waist, and left them there: [...] And the men's faults are less severely shown, [...] For he considers that himself is one.-- [...] Some stabbing wits, to bloody satire bent, [...] Would treat both sexes with less compliment; [...] Would lay the scene at home; of husbands tell, [...] For wenches, taking up their wives i' the Mall; [...] And a brisk bout, which each of them did want, [...] Made by mistake of mistress and gallant. [...] Our modest author thought it was enough [...] To cut you off {{a sample of the}} stuff: [...] He spared my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not, [...] For you were all for driving on the plot: [...] You sighed when I came in to break the sport, [...] And set your teeth when each design fell short. [...] To wives and servants all good wishes lend, [...] But the poor cuckold seldom finds a friend. [...] Since, therefore, court and town will take no pity, [...] I humbly cast myself upon the city.|$|E
