40|$|One of {{the methods}} used for real estate {{evaluation}} is method <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> rates. From a database <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> rates it is clear that capitalization rates are different for every real estate. We assume that factors which have an influence on degree <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> are: floor where the real estate is located, equipment, type of property and part of town in witch the property is located. The first step is the organization <b>of</b> data (<b>capitalization</b> rates) in relative classes. The data is arranged in classes for every factor. E. g., in this way we arrange data for floor into classes p- 2 (properties are located in floors from basement to second floor), 3 - 5 (properties from third to fifth floor) and class for property in 6 and higher floors. Statistical method analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been be used to check all the assumptions. It is necessary to arrange formula for calculation of analysis of variance for classes with different number of elements because number of data is different for each class. With data organized in classes and formulas arranged for calculation of analysis of variance with classes with different number of data we do a series of calculations to accept or reject hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the present}} paper we conduct a deep study on some basic {{concepts}} of fi-nancial mathematics. The financial mathematics involves several mathematical tools (even though at elementary level). But these tools are not organized in a theoretical framework. This circumstance affected badly {{on the development of}} financial mathematics and its ap-plications. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the building of a theoretical structure for the basic part of financial mathematics, all with elementary mathematics. In particular, the goal consists of describing the “evolution ” of an amount of money as a time dependent-process, using the one parameter families of operators. The generalization to the case of the evolution of a portfolio of goods is very natural. In section 1, we define the capitalizations and the family <b>of</b> the <b>capitalization</b> factors <b>of</b> a <b>capitalization.</b> In section 2, we give a definition <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> law, more general than the usual one. Furthermore, we introduce the main concept of the paper: the family of operators <b>of</b> a <b>capitalization</b> law. In section 3, we connect the financial laws to the capitalizations. In section 4, we introduce a subclass <b>of</b> <b>capitalization</b> laws (the self-actualizing capi-talization laws). Finally, we characterize them and the classic separable financial laws in the new framework. We have to note that almost all the proofs of the paper are straightforward computa-tions. Nevertheless, we resolved to give them, we did it not so many for desire of com-pletness, but, above all, to build a bridge beetwen the language and thoughts of economists and mathematicians. 1.
