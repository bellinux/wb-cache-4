5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast tenderness and irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, anovulatory cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E

5|$|Most middle {{aged and}} young women in urban Maharashtra dress in western outfits such as skirts and {{trousers}} or shalwar kameez with the traditionally nauvari or nine-yard sari, disappearing from the markets {{due to a lack}} of demand. Older women wear the five-yard sari. Traditionally, Brahmin women in Maharashtra, unlike those of other castes, did not cover their head with the end of their saree. In urban areas, the five-yard sari is worn by <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> for special occasions such as marriages and religious ceremonies. Maharashtrian brides prefer the very Maharashtrian saree – the Paithani – for their wedding day.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{created a}} public {{image as a}} celibate man without a {{domestic}} life, dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation. He considered himself to be attractive to women, partly because of his position of power. Hitler's friend Albert Speer recalled him stating a preference for unintelligent women who would not challenge him about his work or prevent him from relaxing in his leisure time. Kershaw speculates that Hitler preferred <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> who were easy to dominate and mould. He notes that {{at least three of}} Hitler's close female associates (Eva Braun, Geli Raubal, and Maria Reiter) were far younger than himself: Braun was 23 years younger, Raubal was 19 years younger, and Reiter was 21 years his junior.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the {{distribution}} company United Artists, {{which gave him}} complete control over his films. His first feature-length was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. Chaplin became increasingly political, and his next film, The Great Dictator (1940), satirised Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> caused scandal. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin {{was forced to leave}} the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong (1967).|$|E

5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length and age, which indicates that <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length and age.|$|E

5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|<b>Younger</b> <b>women</b> with {{an age of}} {{less than}} 40 years or women over 80 years {{tend to have a}} poorer {{prognosis}} than post-menopausal women due to several factors. Their breasts may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in their breasts. Therefore, <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed. There may also be biologic factors contributing to a higher risk of disease recurrence for <b>younger</b> <b>women</b> with breast cancer.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{the determinants of}} institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> in Nepal. DESIGN: Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data sets 2011 were analysed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using a subset of 1662 ever-married <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (aged 15 - 24 years). OUTCOME MEASURE: Place of delivery. RESULTS: The rate of institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> was 46 %, which {{is higher than the}} national average (35 %) among all women of reproductive age. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had more than four antenatal care (ANC) visits were {{three times more likely to}} deliver in a health institution compared with women who had no antenatal care visit (OR: 3. 05; 95 % CI: 2. 40 to 3. 87). The probability of delivering in an institution was 69 % higher among <b>young</b> urban <b>women</b> than among <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who lived in rural areas. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had secondary or above secondary level education were 1. 63 times more likely to choose institutional delivery than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who had no formal education (OR: 1. 626; 95 % CI: 1. 171 to 2. 258). Lower use of a health institution for delivery was also observed among poor <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Results showed that wealthy <b>young</b> <b>women</b> were 2. 12 times more likely to deliver their child in an institution compared with poor <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (OR: 2. 107; 95 % CI: 1. 53 to 2. 898). Other factors such as the age of the <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> religion, ethnicity, and ecological zone were also associated with institutional delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal health programs should be designed to encourage <b>young</b> <b>women</b> to receive adequate ANC (at least four visits). Moreover, health programs should target poor, less educated, rural, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who live in mountain regions, are of Janajati ethnicity and have at least one child as such women are less likely to choose institutional delivery in Nepal...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{discussions of}} young women's {{relationship}} to feminism rest on assumptions that position both <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism in particular ways. Feminism is constructed as irrelevant to <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> and/or <b>young</b> <b>women</b> are represented as antagonistic or apathetic towards feminism, {{at least in}} contemporary western societies. Such representations position <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism as distinct and separate entities, each with their own internal cohesion, so that diversity between <b>young</b> <b>women</b> [...] and between feminisms [...] is overlooked. These assumptions comprise the discursive arena in which discussion of the possible meanings and relevance of feminism for <b>young</b> <b>women</b> takes place.
