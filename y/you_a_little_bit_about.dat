40|$|A {{couple of}} years ago I was invited to write a story about myself for the ACL Lifetime Achievement Award. I called it “Word Play. ”[1] You can read it on my parc web page or in the December 2007 issue of Computational Linguistics. That piece starts with my arrival in Bloomington in 1964 but it doesn’t tell the story of how I got here and it quickly skips to my stay at the rand {{corporation}} in Santa Monica, CA and at UT Austin. So I will take this opportunity to tell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> how I got here {{and some of the things}} I still remember about my short stay in Bloomington. 1 I graduated from high school in Tampere, Finland in 1959 and spent a miserable year doing my military service in the Finnish Army. Arriving at the University of Helsinki in the Fall of 1960, I had no idea what I wanted to study. In the Finnish university system at the time, there was no notion of a general undergraduate education. One had to choose a small set of fields of study from the start. I ended up majoring in the Finnish language with a minor in Psychology. But I wasn’t interested in either of those subjects. My passion at the time was poetry. I discovered that two of the girls in my entering class of students of Finnish, Maija Turunen and Anja Kosonen, had just published collections of poems right out of high school [2, 3]. Maija was a daughter of Aimo Turunen, one of our professors of Finnish. I had a hopeless crush on Anja. Another friend I made at the time was Auli Hakulinen, the daughter of Lauri Hakulinen, the most senior professor of Finnish in the department. It was thanks to Maija and Auli that I landed in Bloomington in the Fall of 1964. They both preceded me here. I will come to that shortly. I did not attend many classes during my first two undergraduate years in Helsinki. I wrote a lot of poems, among them a wedding poem for Anja who 1 This is the written version of the speech the author gave in accepting the “Distinguishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{semantic}} {{category of}} modality specializes in expressing {{the relation between}} text and world, especially highlighted in approaches that invoke the analytical apparatus of ‘possible worlds’. Its theoretical assumption (cf. Rescher 1979 : 16 ff) is that a proposition {{can be said to}} be true in one specific (real or virtual; past, present, or future) world and false in another. This corpus-based study investigates the potential of the semiotic noun chance to participate in modal expressions in PDE. In examples like (1) have no chance functions as a secondary modal auxiliary expressing dynamic participant-imposed impossibility (cf. Nuyts 2005) (‘Clifton could not make a tackle’), and in (2) there is a very good chance functions as a modal marker signaling the speaker’s epistemic assessment of the propositional content coded by the that-complement (‘the Republicans will take back the Senate’). In addition, examples like (3) indicate that NPs with chance also occur in semi-insubordinate constructions (cf. Van linden & Van de Velde 2014), which can be interpreted as elliptical counterparts of modal marker structures like in (2) (‘Couldn’t he be kidding?’). (1) 	During an interception return, when Clifton had no chance of making a tackle, Sapp blindsided Clifton. He went down. And stayed down for 15 minutes. (COCA, news) (2) 	Let me ask <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> politics. You have got the midterm election coming up here. My sense is that there’s a very good chance the Republicans are going to take back the Senate. (COCA, spoken) (3) 	A: He says I would have done him in if he was still alive. And he says I found a person that met his description as far as abusiveness. And I says, yeah? And he says, well, I shot him in the head and killed him. B: No chance that he was kidding or not telling the truth? A: I knew he was telling the truth. (COCA, spoken) In addition, chance also has lexical uses (e. g. take [your] chances as an idiomatized complex predicate ‘give it a try’). Based on data extracted from the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) or WordBanksOnline, this study will provide detailed lexicogrammatical descriptions of the constructions featuring chance NPs, taking into account such decategorialization reflexes as determiner drop, reduction in adjectives, loss of singular-plural contrast, etc. From a theoretical point of view, this study aims to adduce corroborating evidence for the role of negation as a trigger of the shift from lexical uses to grammatical ones (cf. Van linden et al. 2011; Saad et al. 2012; Davidse et al. 2015; Van linden et al. 2016). status: publishe...|$|E
