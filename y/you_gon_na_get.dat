6000|$|He {{walked down}} to Callerfoot, refusing the loan of the Colonel's pony carriage, and thence had himself carried across the lake in a hired boat to a place called Sandy's Quay. That, he was assured, was the spot {{on the other side}} from whence the nearest road would be found to Glenbogie. But nobody on the Callerfoot side could tell him what would be the distance. At Sandy's Quay he was assured that it was twelve miles to Glenbogie House; but he soon found that the man who told him had a pony for hire. [...] "Ye'll <b>nae</b> <b>get</b> there under twalve mile,--or maybe saxteen, if ye attampt to walk up the glin." [...] So said the owner of the pony. But milder {{information}} came to him speedily. A little boy would show him the way up the glen for sixpence, and engage to bring him to the house in an hour and a half. So he started with the little boy, and after a hot scramble for about two hours he found himself within the demesne. Poking their way up through thick bushes from a ravine, they showed their two heads,--first the boy and then the sculptor,--close {{by the side of the}} private road,--just as Sir Thomas was passing, mounted on his cob.

40|$|Non-innocent ligands are a {{hot topic}} in {{homogeneous}} catalysis, due to their attractive ability of storing and releasing electrons during the catalytic cycle, conferring noble character to first row transition metals. In this work, a comprehensive overview of the redox active ligand bis(methyl benzimidazolyl) ketone and its Fe complex is presented. The electronic properties of the ligand and the complex, were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). They {{were found to be}} quasi-reversible, with a reduction potential of - 1. 75 V and - 1. 08 V, respectively. The complex showed a ligand-centred reduction. Electronic behaviours of the ligand and complex were probed also with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and the positions of their LUMO were identified at 2. 07 V and 1. 15 V. CV and STS data for the free ligand were compared, showing agreement in the results. The reduction of the ligand was further studied by actually reducing it with <b>Na(s),</b> <b>getting</b> to a doubly and a singly reduced species. These species were both analysed with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The unpaired electron was found to be delocalized over the aromatic system of the ligand. The complex was synthesised on surface via lateral manipulation of single molecules and individual iron atoms. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) on the complex, showed signals due to frustrated external vibrations of the molecule. IETS features on the Fe position may be related to Kondo resonance or convolution of substrate-ligand vibrations...|$|R
