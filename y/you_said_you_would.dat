60|$|Don Jose. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> reform. How {{have you}} kept your word? You were drunk last Wednesday.|$|E
60|$|CZAR. Sweet, you {{are safe}} here. Nothing can harm you here. O love, I knew you trusted me! <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have trust.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} asleep,' snarled Jeremiah, {{referring}} to his watch, 'two hours. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be rested enough {{if you had a}} short nap.' ...|$|E
50|$|Ju spræk på moja kantor kom - <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{come to my}} office.|$|R
6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Bewildered and unnerved.] Wait a moment! What did <b>you</b> propose? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give me back my letter, didn’t you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I told <b>you</b> that I <b>would</b> find him, Cousin Louis!' she cried; 'I {{have come}} {{straight}} to <b>you,</b> because <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{help in the}} taking of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time;--yes; but cannot we arrange some {{plan for}} the future? Cannot {{something}} be done? I thought <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ask her to come here?" ...|$|E
60|$|LORETTA. [With sad conviction.] Oh, yes, there is. You said {{yourself}} that I {{had to marry}} Billy. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> s-s-shoot him if he didn't.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{told me of}} the Dorking,' cried Lucilla, 'and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{not miss}} the sight for anything; but I never said you should have it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not going}} to quarrel with me, Will, because--because--because--. If you had really been my brother, as <b>you</b> once <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be, <b>you</b> could not but have {{approved}} of what I have done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} working harder than usual," [...] Petroff said; [...] "our last {{examinations}} are just coming off. But <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come to see us, and you have never done so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's the rub! If <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'what,' <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be more grammatical. Norton swears {{that it was}} not human, and, indeed, {{from the}} {{scratches}} on his throat, I should be inclined to agree with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|As grandma paused, {{the girls}} cried {{out with one}} voice: [...] "Yes, we do! we like it best. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> Tell about the wedding and all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you mind}} telling about him? You know, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> some time; but don't, if you 'd rather not," [...] said Tom, {{lowering}} his rough voice respectfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't forgive you," [...] {{interrupted}} Bella pettishly. [...] "You are a false man. Nothing {{should have}} prevented you from walking round by Simpson's, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, father," [...] said Rollo, [...] "I {{think it}} would be pleasanter to go in a sail boat. Besides, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> take me to a sail; and going in a {{steamboat}} is not sailing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{she does}} care about it," [...] said Rowland, [...] "and {{to bring him}} to his knees she is working upon his jealousy by pretending to be {{interested}} in my friend Hudson. If <b>you</b> <b>said</b> more, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> say that, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stopped at}} once. [...] "Don't go," [...] he <b>said</b> imploringly. [...] "Listen. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not marry me {{because you did}} not love me. Supposing that you learned to love me, say in a year's time, Beatrice, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> marry me then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way," [...] {{interrupted}} Dominick, [...] "have {{you tried}} to climb our signal-tree, as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do, to replace the flag that was blown away by last night's gale?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'but I {{was afraid}} it might {{distress}} him; and as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be here again soon, Mama, {{and are the}} mistress of everything, I determined to take courage and ask you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I cried. [...] "I want to {{help you}} beyond measure. You are entangled. What is the trouble? I asked you to marry me. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> But there's something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> know, that I {{should make}} you an {{antidote}} to those black humours; and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> hoped I <b>would</b> consign them to the flames.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But in this {{instance}} it would suit me, and I really think it <b>would</b> suit <b>you</b> too, {{that you should be}} as little at Hartlebury as possible. <b>You</b> have <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> go there, and of course you will go. But if I were <b>you,</b> I <b>would</b> not stay above a day or two." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was exactly}} what Arnold was about to do. But it was plain that if he {{admitted}} it just then Sir Patrick (for some unintelligible reason) would decline to listen to him. He answered cautiously, [...] "I asked leave to consult you in private, Sir; and <b>you</b> kindly <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> give me the opportunity before I left Windygates?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. You are right--you are terribly right. But {{where am}} I to turn? <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be my friend, Lord Darlington.-- Tell me, what am I to do? Be my friend now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--yes. I {{ought to}} have told you the fact this morning, as soon as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> buy the place. I know that you like people to be {{perfectly}} truthful. But--I couldn't--without seeming to--brag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I saw the carts full {{of bricks}} go by," [...] said the squire, querulously. [...] "I didn't {{know there was}} to be any brickwork. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have it made of deal slabs with oak posts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> but now <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ask {{my opinion}} when Miss Helstone was gone. I am {{scarcely}} {{likely to give}} it in her presence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must come," [...] she <b>said,</b> [...] "and <b>you</b> {{must have}} a dance with me. You have not been keeping your word, Major Mallett. <b>You</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> always be the same to me, and you are not. You have never once asked me to dance with you, and you are changed altogether." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> {{remember}} <b>you</b> <b>said</b> Polly <b>would</b> {{be tired}} of her teaching {{and give it}} up in three months, and I said she would n't?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} to see you about last night," [...] said Mr. Farrer, before the other could speak. [...] "A joke’s a joke, but when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come I {{naturally}} expected you would keep your word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{look at me}} like that, darling; and don't {{shake your}} head so. It is all right! I told you I had my reasons, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> trust me. I have only done what I thought best!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is down, dear. I {{thought you}} wouldn't {{go into the}} study, because <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> letter and number the books for the Lending Library. Patty and I have been {{covering}} them, {{and they are all}} ready in the sitting-room.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{relieves}} me of anxiety, uncle; for {{you know}} you had a letter this morning from Colonel Fitzhugh, {{saying that he had}} been unexpectedly called out of town, and <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> ask somebody at the club to fill his place, but {{you know you}} very often forget things that you ought to remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{thought that}} what <b>you</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> out of pity, because you fear lest my necessities should hurt me, I {{could give you}} no hope at all. I have my pride, mon ami. But if what <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> still have <b>said</b> though I had {{continued}} mistress of Condillac, then, Tressan, you may repeat it to me hereafter, at a season when I may listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Florence, [...] "do not {{shrink from}} doing what is safe, and necessary, and right for you to do, because <b>you</b> have once <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not do it. You {{understand}} me." ...|$|R
