25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. I think there was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> letting down the team.|$|E
500|$|While {{other films}} {{tend to use}} only one {{storyboard}} artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on {{the rules of the}} teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: [...] "I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> pushing yourself to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways that you could use this jumping talent that these characters have." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Denise [...] "Vanity" [...] Matthews {{claimed she}} {{was engaged to}} Sixx. In his book , he {{describes}} his relationship with her, [...] "Vanity came and went during different periods of my addiction. She was a wild black chick who had sung with Prince: she’d also been his lover for a while. At the time I thought of Vanity as a disposable human being, like a used needle. Once its purpose was fulfilled it {{was ready for the}} trash, only to be dug up if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> desperate…We became drug buddies: sometimes, you could even just about call us boyfriend and girlfriend. Vanity also taught me how to really freebase: the first time I based was with Tommy when Mötley just started and only a few times after that. So up until then, I’d been mostly snorting or injecting. But as soon as she showed me the real ins and outs of cooking up a good rock…it was love. Not her. The drug." ...|$|E

60|$|LADY BRITOMART. I {{see nothing}} {{to laugh at}} in that; nor should <b>you</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> converted.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> in love, {{it would}} not make you foolish: it would give you dignity---earnestness---even beauty.|$|E
60|$|Wife.--I had {{rather a}} hundred should {{say you were}} going to break, than one could say <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> broke already.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a snob, Helen. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> as narrow as {{you sound}} I'd cut you dead! Furthermore, the barber isn't invited." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Living, thank God! {{and your}} own husband; that <b>is,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> Eustacie. Are <b>you</b> indeed?' he added, {{becoming}} doubtful.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, perhaps so, {{when you}} talk. Then <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{surprisingly}} gentle. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> silent, I am even afraid of you--you seem so grave.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> fool {{enough to}} think that if you {{captured}} me single-handed I should walk with you like a lamb to the gallows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{a matter}} of {{quantity}} at all," [...] she assured him. [...] "One blossom {{would have been enough}} and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> frightfully extravagant." ...|$|E
6000|$|Maisie hadn't long to cast {{about or}} to {{question}} his pleasant eyes. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> {{to go with}} us? He'd make a great complaint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{opinion to}} a T! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> an {{exceptionally}} sensible young woman. There's {{my name and}} address; I start on Monday.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never quite}} know when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in earnest, Cuthbert; {{but if it}} is true it is very good news. Do you mean that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> studying?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{going to}} leave for Niagara to-morrow, Mr. Payne, hadn't we better finish this bit of {{business}} out of hand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Henry! Henry, {{you must}} forgive me! I never knew--I never dreamed what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> doing. I shall never forgive myself, but you--you will be generous." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} see if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> {{attached}} to me. You have given me a proof of esteem which I promise you I will never forget.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, George, I {{have often}} {{suspected}} it, but now I feel quite persuaded, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> the greatest humbug that ever existed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{afraid of}} poor old White-Face? Why, she's as gentle as Snippey, {{though of course}} you couldn't pet her so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your charming frankness, then, has its limits! My poor cousin, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> too naïf. Do {{you suppose}} it matters a straw to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From you and Lady Julia? I see. Well, {{of course}} with time SOME change is natural, isn't it? But so different," [...] Vanderbank pressed, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> shocked?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Odious! Do you {{not know}} that I have loved you as my cousin--that I have already learned to trust you as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> my brother? But this breaks it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may laugh," [...] said Maruja, who had {{recovered}} her spirits, [...] "but if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> clever you'd {{find out what}} it all means. Don't you see that Amita is dying of curiosity?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "George {{regarded}} her with some surprise. She was pale, {{but she looked}} extraordinarily healthy, he thought; so did her sisters. Perhaps if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> spiritual you needed less food. He, clearly, was not spiritual.|$|E
6000|$|Of course I was {{not content}} till I had {{likewise}} again convinced myself by searching into the beard, and then I added, [...] "Ah! this {{is worse than}} the lion, though then <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> hurt." ...|$|E
