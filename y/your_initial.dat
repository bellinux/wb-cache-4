25|$|When not {{properly}} implemented, continuous auditing {{can result in}} hundreds—even thousands—of false positives and wasted effort. Many companies that have experienced success with continuous auditing recommend that you start small. Select which area of the company poses the greatest risk and where its transactions and control systems are most important to the company for <b>your</b> <b>initial</b> foray into continuous auditing. Automate {{a small number of}} key initial tests, such as comparing your accounts payable vendor master file with the employee address file, to uncover potential policy violations or fraud. Moving forward, increase the tests and gradually expand into other business processes in stages.|$|E
25|$|Phan {{met with}} his wife only once more {{following}} the divorce: when he was pardoned and released from Hỏa Lò Prison {{more than two decades}} later. He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to <b>your</b> <b>initial</b> aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do not worry about your wife and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{controversy}} artist Mitch Clem published a six-part comic strip satirizing the events in his webcomic Nothing Nice to Say. He received an email from the album's producer Dave Gardener criticizing his satire of the situation: [...] "As the guy who recorded the record I have to say I found your attempt at social commentary via satire was pretty weak and actually fairly insulting. If you had any idea of the work that all of us, the band, the other guy who did the record and honestly the label put into making the record happen you might have an inkling over how shitty the leaking of the record is to us all." [...] Clem responded that the comic was actually intended to oppose music piracy, not to advocate it. Punknews.org editor Jesse Raub addressed the situation in his blog, stating that [...] "It sucks that Mr. Hale’s decision to share the album with his friends turned out this way. But he is directly responsible for the leak and needs to accept accountability for his actions. You can’t place the blame on everyone but you because they were forced to react to <b>your</b> <b>initial</b> actions." [...] Punknews.org posted a synopsis of the controversy, stating that [...] "Punknews.org does not support or condone leaking albums. It's not just about the commerce; {{there are many people who}} work on an album like this one, it is fair for people to at least be compensated for the time they took away from other jobs, families and friends in order to put together an album for you." ...|$|E

Such is politeness. We may note, in passing, that all her remarks and all yours, barring <b>your</b> <b>initial</b> question, meant absolutely nothing. She understood you perfectly from the first, and you knew she did; but then, if all of us were to say only what were necessary, the delightful art of conversation would soon be nothing but a science.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{once there}} was a little girl who liked Christmas so much that [...] she wanted it to be Christmas every day in the year; and as soon as [...] Thanksgiving was over she began to send postal-cards to the old [...] Christmas Fairy to ask if she mightn't have it. But the old fairy [...] never {{answered}} any of the postals; and after a while the little girl [...] found out that the Fairy was pretty particular, and wouldn't notice [...] anything but letters--not even correspondence cards in envelopes; but [...] real letters on sheets of paper, and sealed outside with a [...] monogram--or <b>your</b> <b>initial,</b> anyway. So, then, she began to send her [...] letters; and in about three weeks--or just the day before Christmas, [...] it was--she got a letter from the Fairy, saying she might have it [...] Christmas every day for a year, and then they would see about having [...] it longer.|$|E
