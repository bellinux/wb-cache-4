500|$|Cross, a {{resolute}} Christian, {{converted to}} Christianity while {{on leave from}} a posting to Cyprus in 1981. He visited Jerusalem over the Easter weekend and {{was inspired by a}} retired British Army officer he met there to convert. After converting, he considered leaving the Army, but has said in interviews that he reconciled his beliefs with his military service, contending that [...] "the British Army as a community [...] recognises the issue of spirituality and goodness and righteousness and justice and evil and wrong probably far more than most". He is a licensed lay reader in the Church of England and has involvement with a number of Christian organisations, including as a trustee of the British and Foreign Bible Society and {{a former president of the}} Armed Forces Christian Union. In an interview for the Christian Broadcasting Network in 2009, he said [...] "The moral component of fighting power is about leadership, it's about ethics, it's about culture, it's about how do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to fight and embedded within that is an element of justice and righteousness. f you lose the moral component, you lose everything. I think we – collectively in the West – have gone through 30 - 40 years really of pretending that this moral component is not important, and that I don't need to have a biblical foundation in my life. And I challenge that." [...] He has written on the subject in the British Army Review, an in house publication aimed at generating professional debate, where he described ideas of a secular Army as 'tripe' and 'dangerously wrong' and the rewrite of the motto of the Girl Guides, removing reference to God, as 'vapid and anodyne'.|$|E

[...] to reach 25% of female editors (originally targeted by 2015), since the Foundation had [...] "totally failed" [...] so far. Wales said [...] "a lot of things need to happen ... a lot of outreach, a lot of software changes". Andrew Lih, writing in The New York Times, was quoted by Bloomberg News in December 2016 as supporting Wales comments concerning shortfalls in Wikipedia's outreach to female editors. Lih states his concern with the question indicating that: [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> {{to participate in an}} (editing) environment that feels unsafe, where identifying yourself as a woman, as a feminist, could open you up to ugly, intimidating behavior".|$|E

Despite all of this support for Colón Sánchez, Councilman Nicholas Carbone, who was a powerful figure in the Democratic political machine, supported Mildred Torres instead. Carbone may have been prejudiced against Colón Sánchez's physical appearance and made her feel that she just wasn't ready. According to a statement made by Carbone when she ran for the school board:“We ran María for the school board and she spoke broken English. She wasn't an attractive woman, she was heavy, so where would you take her? How did you sell her? How did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to vote for her?

5000|$|Levine {{stated that}} {{choosing}} the licensed music for Infinite {{was much more}} challenging compared to the original BioShock. He commented that with the original BioShock, set in 1959 in the mid 20th century, {{it was easy to}} acquire musical pieces representative of the era, with him saying that the team [...] "had this huge slate of great music to choose from." [...] Levine stated that with Infinite, however, it was set in 1912 in the early 20th century, which had music he described to be [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "not very listenable" [...] to the [...] "modern ear." [...] Consequently, the development team had to [...] "dig really deep" [...] and research extensively for more satisfactory music in Infinites time period. Levine noted that he was not strict with selecting the music and songs that was accurate to the game's time period, as he felt {{that the most important thing}} with regards to the music was [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>people</b> to feel things." [...] He added that the game's fictional nature justified him and the team [...] "playing a little fast and loose" [...] and [...] "doing things a little differently" [...] with the music. Levine also stated that Infinites music would play a [...] "strange role" [...] in the game; he explained that the music would [...] "tie into the macro story, to some degree," [...] and that the team had [...] "a lot of little stories" [...] to tell about it.|$|E
