5000|$|Khan further {{clarified}} {{his stand}} on this issue; he said, “I respect everyone’s opinion. For me {{freedom of speech}} and expression is an important right and should be protected at all costs. But I also feel that freedom comes with responsibility which should be self-exercised. It’s unfortunate that caught between the rightwing fascists and the ‘no-holdsbarred’ faction, the moderates are in danger of losing their voice. I’m aware that if <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> for the Roast, <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> <b>up</b> to insult each other. But, in this case, even those who hadn’t signed up were being targeted, like Farida Jalal, Reema Lagoo and a beautiful, young girl I love dearly.The young girl whom I’ve known since she was a kid, was the butt of racist and sexist jokes. She did not even know that a live audience was watching this and couldn’t protect herself. That is unfair! This is what I meant when I described the show as “violent”. Films which depict violence are fictional but this young girl is real. So my reaction was more emotional than moralistic.I wasn’t objecting to the use of expletives or adult jokes. If two consenting adults wish to insult each other, that’s their problem. But you can’t go around attacking anyone you feel like. That is no different from the physical violence we see around us and object to. And when someone uses the words “shut up”, it makes me believe that these people are certainly {{not a part of the}} group that is for freedom of speech.” ...|$|E
