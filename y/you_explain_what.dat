5000|$|If {{we want to}} {{consider}} how actors will interact, we must look at the system within which they interact. This isn't a new concept; economists look at structural constraints (e.g. capitalism vs socialism, I guess), political scientists argue that presidents will behave differently from prime ministers, and so on. Waltz begins by looking at domestic political structures and sees three important characteristics: The principle by which the system is ordered (what form of hierarchical structure is in place), the functions that each unit fulfills (presidential vs parliamentary, etc.), and each unit's capacity/ability to act. By analogy, Waltz extends these three principles to the international system. The ordering principle is anarchy; if this changed, inter-unit interactions would also change. In anarchy, different units exist in a self-help system; there is therefore no functional differentiation among them. So the two relevant characteristics {{of the international system}} are anarchy and relative capacity (power). By analogy, Waltz argues that microeconomic thinking should explain how states will act. States in the international system are like firms in a domestic economy. Every state has the same fundamental interest: to survive. Even if it wants to do other things, it can't do them unless it survives. are there higher needs? How do <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> a state will do if its survival isn't threatened? Can you use this model to explain trade, or environmental treaties, and so on? Waltz argues that states are the only important actors in this model. He recognizes that other actors exist, but says they don't matter. He uses an economic analogy to justify this: If all firms are equally sized, they all matter. If the market is dominated by a few large firms, however, then economic models need focus on these. Similarly, since states are the [...] "large firms," [...] models can disregard the insignificant [...] "small firms" [...] (NGOs, IGOs, etc.).

40|$|The {{papers of}} Ruth Geller Gold consist {{predominantly}} of correspondence {{with a family}} of Soviet Jewish Refuseniks located in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, the Poltinnikovs. The case of the Poltinnikovs was referred to by the American Soviet Jewry movement organizations {{as one of the}} most tragic stories in the annals of the emigration movement. Two members of the family were driven to suicide after eight years of systematic persecution by the KGB as a punishment for stating their intent to leave for Israel. The collection consists mainly of letters received by Ruth Geller Gold from the Poltinnikov family. It also includes several photographs of the family. Correspondence of Ruth Geller gold with the American Soviet Jewry organizations and activists regarding the Poltinnikov family is also included. The collection consists of one folder. Published citations should take the following form: Identification of item, date (if known); Ruth Geller Gold Papers; *P- 953; box number; folder number; American Jewish Historical Society, Boston, MA and New York, NY. far 0315 Correspondence with and photographs of the Refusenik Poltinnikov FamilyThe Papers of Ruth Geller Gold represent one collection housed within the Archive of the American Soviet Jewry Movement (AASJM). These papers reflect the effort, beginning in the 1960 s through the late 1980 s, of thousands of American Jews of all denominations and political orientations to stop the persecution and discrimination of Jews in the Soviet Union. The American Soviet Jewry Movement (ASJM) is considered to be the most influential Movement of the American Jewish community in the 20 th century. The beginnings of the organized American Soviet Jewry Movement became a model for efforts to aid Soviet Jews in other countries, among them Great Britain, Canada, and France. The movement can be traced to the early 1960 s, when the first organizations were created to address the specific problem of the persecution and isolation of Soviet Jews by the government of the Soviet Union. Ruth Geller Gold was active in the American Soviet Jewry movement when she resided in Anaheim, CA during the 1970 s. She had extensively corresponded with the family of Soviet Jewish Refuseniks located in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, the Poltinnikovs. The Poltinnikovs, a husband and wife and their two daughters, became inspired to get in touch with their Jewish roots and make Aliyah after the Six Day War. Their younger daughter Eleanora, a professional translator, was able to leave for Israel by way of marriage shortly thereafter. In 1971 the parents and the elder daughter, all three medical doctors, applied for exit visas to follow Eleanora and were repeatedly denied with various superfluous explanations, such as lack of close relatives in Israel, exposure to State secrets, or without any reason given at all. For the next eight years the family suffered humiliation and suffering from the Soviet authorities. Isaac Poltinnikov was stripped of his military rank of Colonel of Medical Corps and lost his job as the head of the Department of Ocular Diseases at the Novosibirsk Medical Institute. Irma and Victoria were also fired from their medical jobs without the chance of reinstatement, and were under constant threat of being prosecuted for parasitism (can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> parasitism is in a few words in parentheses here) under the Soviet law. After Isaac Poltinnikov was injured in a hit-and-run car accident and their dog was killed by a KGB agent, the family tried to isolate themselves in their home. (Telushkin, J., and Prager, D. (1983). âWhy the Jews?: The reason for antisemitism.) Their only connection with the outside world was correspondence with Western human rights, Jewish organizations and individual activists. In 1979 the family received permission to leave, yet Irma and Victoria, exhausted and traumatized by eight years of constant torment, became convinced that the permission was false and a ploy by the KGB to further persecute them. In order to persuade them otherwise, Isaac Poltinnikov proceeded to Israel and informed them of his safe arrival. The two women persisted in their paranoia and continued their self-imposed isolation, too afraid to leave their apartment to obtain food. Despite the desperate pleas from their relatives to the Soviet authorities to help Irma and Victoria, no medical attention was provided. In late August 1979 Irma Poltinnikov died of starvation. Three weeks later Victoria Poltinnikov hung herself. Ruth Geller GoldDonated by Ruth Geller Gold in 2010. Finding Aid available in Reading Room and on Internet. Ruth Geller Gold 2010081...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{nutrition}} orchards Cue: A diet rich in {{vitamins and}} minerals is important for everyone. But to someone suffering with an illness, particularly an illness such as HIV/AIDS, it?s even more important. A convenient, constant supply {{of a range of}} fresh fruits and vegetables will ensure nutritious meals that will boost the human body?s immune system and help to fight off other secondary infections. In many African countries, families and communities are being encouraged to plant special areas or orchards to supply a range of nutritious fruits and vegetables close to home. Blessings Muwalo Nq?umayo ? Chief Clinical Officer in the Malawian government ? wanted Excello Zidana to know just how productive these nutritious orchards can be. IN:	?This one is specifically?? OUT:	?suffering from HIV/AIDS. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: That was Blessings Muwalo Nq?umayo ending that report from Malawi. He says that nutrition orchards are multipurpose, cheap to maintain, and can even make some money. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Nq?umayo 	This one is specifically called nutrition orchard with this name at the beginning nutrition because people affected with HIV/AIDS for example require fruits of this kind that are grown in the nutrition orchard. Zidana	Nq?umayo can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> nutrition orchard is all about? Nq?umayo 	Nutrition orchard talks about a long term source of nutrition requirement for people affected with HIV/AIDS, it does not require a lot of labour and a lot of input. It is good for these people living with HIV/AIDS because they require vitamins, {{vitamins and minerals}} that is, {{to take care of their}} body because these are the elements that are required to fortify the body to fight against diseases that can take advantage of the HIV condition of this person. As people are infected with HIV/AIDS they do not need to do some laborious work because the HIV itself takes a lot of energy from the bodies of these people affected and as such raising a nutrition orchard is quite easy and they will rely on this nutrition orchard as a source of the varied required nutrients. Zidana	People talk about nutrition orchard, how different is it from other types of orchards? Nq?umayo 	Ok nutrition orchard is quite different from these other local orchards in the sense that it is easy to come up with inputs that do not demand a lot of money and again these types of crops that are grown in this orchard are those that first multiply and do not take long to come up with the fruits and as such it is very different from these other orchards. For example a nutrition orchard can have a composition of fruit trees in the range of bananas, avocado pears, pigeonpeas, of course a pigeon is a pulse. They can also have oranges. Of course oranges might take some time to produce but with grafting we can have some oranges that can take a few years to multiply and bear fruit. Zidana	What about pumpkins, are they also part of the nutrition orchard? Nq?umayo 	Of course a pumpkin also its there because it takes about three months to come up with a pumpkin and because of its fast multiplication rate and fast way of bearing fruit it is also part of the nutrition orchard. And again a pumpkin on its own besides acting as a fruit it has got a lot of purposes. It can be used in different ways. You can come up with a flour from the seeds and use them when cooking relish. The young pumpkins you can chop them into pieces when they are fresh, dry them and come up with another relish altogether that is commonly consumed. And these are also very, very nutritious because you get a lot of vitamins out of it which are also good for people suffering from HIV/AIDS. Zidana	What are the requirements for raising this famous nutrition orchard that is saying without spending too much money? Nq?umayo 	Of course you do not need to spend a lot of money if any to raise a nutrition orchard. All you require is the seeds which can be got locally shared from friends like in the village setting. Friends can just give you the seeds and you plant. Another thing you will need is a piece of land that is close to a source of water if it is during dry season and this piece of land should be also closer to the household setting of these people suffering from HIV/AIDS. We do not necessarily need them to travel long distances to get to the orchard let alone to work on the orchard. They need to be near and the water source should be near so that they can easily water these orchards without spending a lot of energy to carry the water to the orchard. Zidana	Who specifically takes care of the orchard in the family? Nq?umayo 	It is the responsibility of every family member to look after the orchard. Zidana	Now how can one maximise production in the nutrition orchard to suffice the family that is affected and infected with HIV/AIDS? Nq?umayo 	The basic thing is one application of manure. The second thing is to plant the plants according to the proper specification as pertaining to distance from one planting station to the other. The other thing is to use proper seeds, high quality seeds, if possible use hybrid seeds so that you have maximum output out of it. You know in the orchard particularly when it is grown during dry season it can be also another source of food for animals so we need to place a fence surrounding that orchard, and people can use a ?live? fence. For example the Moringa Oleifera tree. This can be used and this tree is a multipurpose tree. All those things together if they are followed together with the proper pest control and pest management you have a lot of production out of this orchard, more than the family can use and excess can be sold and the family can have money to buy other basic requirements for people suffering from HIV/AIDS.

40|$|Water {{rights in}} the Sahara Desert? CUE: What {{does it mean to}} have the right to water? Can a {{statement}} on water rights in a constitution achieve anything? And is it meaningful to tell people living in a dry area that they have a right to, for example, 20 litres of water per day, when that water may simply not exist? Virginia Roaf works for WaterAid, an international NGO that aims to improve the access of poor people to water and sanitation. Mike Davison went to the WaterAid office in London, and started by asking how useful she thought it was to give someone a right to water. IN: 		?The question of the right? OUT:		?coming from the local communities? DUR?N	 5 ? 08 BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Virginia Roaf of WaterAid describing some of the key issues raised by the right to water. Transcript Roaf	The question of the right to water is actually not as simple as it sounds. Everyone would agree that the right to water is a good right, it should be in the UN Declaration of Human Rights. But you also have to look at what is meant by the right to water, how much water, for whom, how clean is that water going to be? One of the problems of introducing a right to water is setting the standards that go with that. For example they might decide that everyone has a right to 20 litres per person per day. Now that?s obviously not going to be accessible to those people living in villages in rural areas, in the middle of the Sahara Desert for example, because that water is just not accessible; there isn?t that water in the ground. So setting a right to water which has unrealistic standards, you may actually find that the right to water works against the needs of the poorest. Maybe I can explain this best by looking at the right to housing. In South Africa the right to housing is enshrined in the constitution but along with that right to housing is also a long list of standards that are required to be met by that housing. For example they are to do with what the walls are to be made of, what the roof is to be made of. Now that?s obviously unaffordable to the poor who are presently living in shacks and in over crowded conditions. So while it?s a very good thing for the right to housing to be enshrined in the constitution it?s actually not accessible. Davison	So having that right to housing you would say is meaningless? Roaf	I think often it can be meaningless unless you?ve got a government that?s committed to creating the framework or the policies that will actually be able to deliver that housing. Davison	And if we were to carry that on to the example of the village in the Sahara Desert having a right to water, would you regard it in the same way? Roaf	Yes, I would say that rather than setting the standards for the right to water here in Britain or through the UN, I think it?s important to include local communities from poor areas, from developing countries, to ensure that the standards are not inaccessible. Davison	Do you think that if a country adds a statement on the right to water to its constitution, that is likely to help the poorer people who currently don?t have access to water? Roaf	I think that in some cases that will strengthen the poor community?s hand. I think it depends on whether the poor community is well organised and whether they know that they have the right to water. I think however that generally these rights that stand in the constitution become just words on a piece of paper and that they are actually more likely to protect the rights of the middle income people or the people in power than they are to protect the rights of the poor. Davison	Can <b>you</b> <b>explain</b> <b>what</b> you mean by that? Roaf	In Dhaka in Bangladesh a vast proportion of the population live in illegal settlements which they don?t have the rights to. It could be because it?s along the river bank or it?s on pavements or it?s on land which is ear-marked for other purposes, and the government is not willing to give land rights. There?s a community in an area called Tejganj where the people are living on a pavement adjacent to the factory where they are working. And they?ve been living there for maybe 25 or 30 years without access to adequate water and sanitation and the reason for that is the government is not prepared to provide water and sanitation to that community because they lack land title. So what WaterAid has done is actually to work with the community and they have negotiated with the local council, for the local council to give the community a 5 year, a short term lease, which will then allow the municipal supplier to actually provide water and sanitation. Interestingly this has caused a problem with the middle income community which lives opposite. The middle class community has decided that this is a threat to them and persuaded the local municipality to evict the community. Within a week the community were back living in that area because they had nowhere else to go. So they are actually now living in that area again and they are still obviously working in the factory. Davison	So that suggests that often when you get water rights you may well have a situation of conflict between two different groups? Roaf	There?s always going to be conflict over resources which are limited. The water supply in Dhaka probably reaches maybe 25 % of the population but obviously that?s going to be going to the richer parts of that community. And so if the middle class community see that the water is now being accessed by poorer communities obviously there?s going to be less water to go around. Davison	To me water rights would seem to be quite a western concept. To what extent do you think that the communities that WaterAid is working with feel that they have a right to water? Roaf	I think that the people living in Dhaka in Bangladesh through the work that they?ve been doing in accessing their right to land has actually introduced ideas of rights of water to those communities. Davison	So the increasing awareness of water rights has come through increasing awareness and interest in land rights? Roaf	I would say that there is more interest now in water rights, yes, because there?s been interest in land rights and the demand is coming from the local communities. End of tape.
