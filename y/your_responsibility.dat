500|$|It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was <b>your</b> <b>responsibility,</b> but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into {{a pool of blood}} and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into her palms. In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound.|$|E
500|$|... "GodEatGod" [...] is {{the first}} song on the record, and follows Adam as he meditates in the desert. [...] "The Love Song" [...] was {{described}} by Manson as an ode to Celebritarianism, and its title originated from his observation that [...] "Love Song" [...] {{is one of the}} most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: [...] "I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where you shoot them is <b>your</b> <b>responsibility</b> as parents." [...] The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American bumper sticker: [...] "Do you love your God, gun, government?" [...] Kerrang! described [...] "The Fight Song" [...] as a [...] "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about [...] "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally , he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." ...|$|E

500|$|M.I.A. {{called the}} new project [...] "schizophrenic", and spoke of the Internet {{inspiration}} that {{could be found in}} the songs and the artwork. She also said that the album centred on her [...] "not being able to leave [...] for 18 months" [...] and feeling [...] "disconnected". She summed up the album's main theme as information politics. During the recording of the album, she spoke of the combined effects that news corporations and Google have on news and data collection, while stressing the need for alternative news sources that she felt her son's generation would need to ascertain truth. Maya was made to be [...] "so uncomfortably weird and wrong that people begin to exercise their critical-thinking muscles". M.I.A. said [...] "You can Google 'Sri Lanka' and it doesn't come up that all these people have been murdered or bombed, it's 'Come to Sri Lanka on vacation, there are beautiful beaches' ... you're not gonna get the truth till you hit like, page 56, and it's my and <b>your</b> <b>responsibility</b> to pass on the information that it's not easy anymore". Following these comments, M.I.A. received death threats directed at her and her son, which she also cited as an influence on the songs on the album. She summed up the album as a mixture of [...] "babies, death, destruction and powerlessness". The singer revealed that going into recording the album, she had still not accepted that she was a musician, saying [...] "I'm still in denial, listening to too much Destiny's Child". With Maya, she stated [...] "I was happy being the retarded cousin of rap... Now I'm the retarded cousin of singing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Denouncing the UDA, {{the trial}} judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, [...] "What appears before me today {{under the name}} of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising {{organisation}} of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation". During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court [...] "trial". Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, [...] "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. When you heard what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; <b>your</b> <b>responsibility</b> was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character." [...] The Northern Irish press dubbed Elizabeth Douglas [...] "the Sandy Row executioner".|$|E
