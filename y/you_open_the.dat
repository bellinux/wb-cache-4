5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E
500|$|After the election, Pastorius and Holloway {{announced}} plans for a lawsuit challenging the abolition of their offices. Pastorius claimed the abolition subverted democracy, saying [...] "f you permit an office to be abolished after the process of election has begun, <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> door to rigged elections." [...] The men took their oaths of office in January 1954 for the terms to {{which they had been}} elected, but did not pursue the lawsuits and relinquished the offices the next day.|$|E
500|$|On April 11, 2013, Jay-Z {{released}} {{the first song}} from the album titled [...] "Open Letter". The song {{was a response to}} the critics of his fifth wedding anniversary that took place in Cuba. This was due to the current United States embargo against Cuba, which required them needing a permit to visit the country. The song was produced by Swizz Beatz, and was included on the album as a bonus track. On July 10, 2013, Third Man Records announced on their website that they had entered a deal to release Magna Carta Holy Grail on vinyl, also confirming that [...] "Open Letter" [...] would be included as a vinyl-only bonus track and that there would be [...] "something [...] very special planned for the vinyl edition." [...] However, the 'vinyl-only' appearance of [...] "Open Letter" [...] has been shown to not apply to all market areas. Third Man Records is set to issue [...] "Open Letter" [...] {{in the form of a}} vinyl single designed as a playable letter. In an interview with Hot 97, Jay-Z went into detail about the single's release, saying: [...] "It's in a letter. You can play the letter. It's amazing... <b>You</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> letter, and you can actually play the card." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{producers}} {{considered the}} revival a merger of What's My Line? and its 1950s spinoff, I've Got a Secret, {{which resulted in}} noticeable changes from the original. As with Secret, contestants frequently demonstrated their skill or product after the game. (Bruner, and later Blyden, would preface the demonstrations by asking Lloyd Gross, who directed most of the editions, [...] "Lloyd, would <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> curtains, please?") Dollar signs for [...] "no" [...] answers were replaced by sequential numbers. Mystery guest rounds were no longer scored and simply ended with a correct guess or when time ran out. A new game was added, called [...] "Who's Who?" [...] In it, four audience members, selected before the show, stood on stage with four occupations indicated on cards and panelists would attempt to place the correct occupations with the contestants.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{developed}} a cult following partially {{due to the}} large number of in-jokes it contains, most of which are aimed at [...] "nerds". In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his [...] "nerdiest joke". These included mathematical jokes— such as [...] "Loew's -plex" [...] (aleph-null-plex) movie theater,— as well as various forms of science humor— for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming [...] "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On {{the front seat of the}} car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until <b>you</b> <b>open</b> <b>the</b> box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA"). The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction. These are most often to Star Trek— many soundbites are used in homage— but also include the reference to the origin of the word robot made in the name of the robot-dominated planet Chapek 9, and the black rectangular monolith labeled [...] "Out of Order" [...] in orbit around Jupiter (a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey series). Bender and Fry sometimes watch a television show called The Scary Door, a humorous parody of The Twilight Zone.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's {{the second}} mate's watch, {{and he is}} off with them," [...] said Mr. Burdette. [...] "I expect he's {{at the bottom of}} it. He's a mighty wary fellow. Just as like as not he spread the report that we were going on a {{filibustering}} expedition to Cuba, and the ground for it, in my opinion, is those cases of arms <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> other day!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door of {{the house}} in Russell Square for me and calmly took back your notes which I had been to fetch. That was one time, at any rate.

6000|$|... "And {{what are}} eyes against enchantments? <b>The</b> moment <b>you</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door, the spell was cast over them again.
