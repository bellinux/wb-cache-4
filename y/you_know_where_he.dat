6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> has been?" [...] asked Columbine. Some strange feeling {{prompted}} that. There was {{a mystery}} here. Wilson's agitation seemed strange and deep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Hurd answered. [...] "Look here! You've been in {{communication}} {{with the man who}} came here and murdered my father. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is." ...|$|E
5000|$|Former Governor Treen of Mandeville {{recalled}} Rayburn as {{a legislator}} {{who was always}} reliable: [...] "I remember {{that he was very}} straightforward - dependable. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was, and <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was going." ...|$|R
6000|$|Tomlinson nodded. [...] "That's quite right," [...] he said. [...] "It's kind of unfortunate Sewell isn't here. <b>You</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now Mr. Robinson {{will tell}} us everything," [...] said Mrs. Poppins. [...] "It's about Johnson, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>Where</b> has <b>he</b> gone to, Mr. Robinson?" [...] But Robinson professed {{that he did not}} know.|$|R
6000|$|He tried again--I declare it positively, {{he tried}} again. [...] "You'll excuse me, sir? I've never seen his {{portfolio}} before. Am I right if I think <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> keeps it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. I had {{intended}} to ask if you knew anything about him when {{the beginning of this}} carnage drove him and everything else out of my mind. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} {{perfectly}} easy for you," [...] he answered, [...] "to go there, especially {{with your father}} {{out of the way}} upstairs. I presume that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> keeps his important papers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you must}} tell your friends here that <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, nor {{when he will}} return, and let them advise {{together}} as to what can be done. You must tell the Hallecks--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!--About Mr. Hinkle. I a'n't agoin' to {{have you}} lead him on, and then say <b>you</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was goin'. I can't keep runnin' away everywhe'e, fo' you, the way I done at Woodlake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What, Saxon!' I cried. 'Do <b>you</b> indeed <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is? For God's sake speak low, for {{it would}} mean a {{commission}} and five hundred good pounds {{to any one of}} these soldiers could he lay hands upon him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steady your mind, miss! {{and take}} your friend {{home as soon as}} you can. He hasn't got Mrs. Rook's hard brain; he's in a state of nervous prostration, which may end badly. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lives?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "was {{over six}} feet, and broad! It was not he. It {{may have been}} some one whom he sent, but it was not he. Guy, have you heard from him? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{released}} to-day," [...] she explained. [...] "Well, listen, Carl; I've {{got to see}} the Lizard. I've simply got to see him to-night. I was being shadowed, but I got away from them. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall do what I choose," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "and I shall let <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I'm master; else you {{may turn out}} and find an estate to drop into somewhere else. Go out and tell Winthrop {{not to go to}} Cox's, but wait for me. And tell 'em to get my horse saddled. And stop: look out and get that hack o' Dunsey's sold, and hand me the money, will you? He'll keep no more hacks at my expense. And if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he's</b> sneaking--I daresay <b>you</b> do--you may tell him to spare himself the journey o' coming back home. Let him turn ostler, and keep himself. He shan't hang on me any more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I just {{happened}} to be up in Farmer Brown's old orchard this morning, so I thought I'd pay Johnny Chuck a call," [...] said Sammy, and chuckled as he saw Reddy's ears prick up. [...] "By the way, <b>he</b> thinks <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lives now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] {{said the}} princess, [...] "I {{perceive}} that your Majesty wishes to make game of me, but I {{can assure you}} that I will never marry anyone except the charming young man whom I saw last night. <b>You</b> must <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, so pray send for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! Stannard's a highbrow Englishman," [...] said Deering, {{but somehow}} Jimmy thought his remark ironical. [...] "Well, you urged, and since Stannard is not rich, he agreed? Perhaps the strange thing is, {{he was able}} to lend you a pretty good sum. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> gets the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a great}} {{regard for}} Count Sabatini," [...] he declared, [...] "a great regard, {{but there are some}} of his friends--very many of them, in fact--whose {{presence}} here I could dispense with. That man is one of them. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> was a few nights ago, Miss Lalonde?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The first carloads of {{rails and}} ties {{for the new}} road were ready for dispatching, and it would pass close by my possessions; while, after we had {{recovered}} from our excitement, he said: [...] "I have been searching for a Corporal Cotton, and heard he might be here. Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Jimmy {{replied in}} a {{thoughtful}} voice. [...] "He stays with his job, {{and puts it}} over, but he doesn't talk. Unless he's chopping and you hear his ax, <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is. He steals about. In fact, the fellow puzzles me. What's his proper business?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Fat Pig premiered Off-Broadway at the Lucille Lortel Theatre in an MCC Theater {{production}} on November 23, 2004 in previews, officially on December 15. Directed by Jo Bonney, the cast was as follows: Ashlie Atkinson (Helen), Andrew McCarthy (Carter), Jeremy Piven (Tom), Keri Russell (Jeannie) (in her stage debut This production {{was hailed as}} a provocative comedy that made the audience think. David Amsden said in New York Magazine, [...] "You emerge from his plays either praising him for the metaphoric {{slap in the face}} or simply wishing <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> lived, so <b>you</b> can hunt down the bastard and deliver a literal slap of your own. The guy is doing something right, in short.... His cruel wit and chronicles of immoral moralizers have made him, arguably, the most legitimately provocative and polarizing playwright at work today." ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{my colleagues}} asked me soon after John died, 2 ̆ 2 How could someone live to be eighty-nine years old {{and yet there is}} no one who had a bad word to say about him? 2 ̆ 2 This is an {{intriguing}} question. It is not because John Pickering did not have strongly held views about things. Anyone who ever tangled with John in crafting a brief knew how tenacious he was. John was direct and candid and <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> stood on any matter. It is not because John was easygoing. When he saw something that he wanted changed, he did not take no for an answer. He was relentless and tireless. It is not because he was not demanding. Working for John was hard work. He set high standards for himself and he expected you to work at the same level...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least, if {{the feeling}} of resentment {{remained}} in my own bosom, {{it would be the}} last I should intrude upon you, Miss Gray," [...] answered Hartley. [...] "But it is for you, and for you alone, that I am watchful.--This person--this gentleman whom you mean to intrust with your happiness--do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is--and in what service?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The King!' exclaimed Diane. 'M. l'Abbe, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is now? In {{the balcony}} {{overlooking}} the river, {{taking aim at}} the fugitives! Take care! Even your soutane would not save you if M. d'O and his crew heard you. But I must pray you to aid me with this poor child! I dread that her wild cries should be heard.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You mean some rascal in Paris that I believe persecutes Doña Rita. Listen, Mademoiselle Therese, if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{hangs out}} {{you had better}} let him have word to be careful. I believe he, too, is mixed up in the Carlist intrigue. Don’t {{you know that your}} sister can get him shut up any day or get him {{expelled}} by the police?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "San Francisco. He's an ugly brute, I admit. Half-witted, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> Can't {{remember}} <b>where</b> <b>he</b> came from. But I'm used to him, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> We both are. How does he strike you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I say {{keep it a}} secret"--she hesitated--"I don't {{mean that}} I object to your letting Mr. Kearney, if <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, {{understand}} that we are going back to Devil's Ford." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} true," [...] said the Duke; [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>where</b> MacCallummore travels <b>he</b> pays all; {{it is our}} Highland {{privilege}} to take from all what we want, and to give to all what they want." ...|$|R
6000|$|Una fled. She ran to a wash-room, {{locked the}} door, leaned panting against it, as though detectives were {{pursuing}} her. She was safe for a moment. They might miss her, {{but she was}} insulated from demands of, [...] "Where's Ross, Miss Golden? Well, why don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] from telephone calls, and from memoes whose polite [...] "please" [...] was a gloved threat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know where}} 'down yonder' is," [...] Catherine replied, [...] "but you {{have him in}} your power somewhere. He left his rooms last Thursday at about a quarter past six, to take that packet to the Foreign Office, or to make {{arrangements}} for its being received there. He never reached the Foreign Office. He hasn't been heard of since. Some of <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is. The Bishop and I {{want to go and}} find him at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless you, I don't mind him," [...] said Peg, {{from whom}} the {{unexpected}} {{seemed to be}} the thing to expect. [...] "I like a lad of spurrit. And so your father run away, did he, Peter? He used to be a beau of mine--he seen me home three times from singing school when we was young. Some folks said he did it for a dare. There's such a lot of jealousy in the world, ain't there? Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Seymour," [...] my {{brother-in-law}} said impressively, [...] "there {{is no time}} to be lost. I must write this evening to Sir David--I mean to My Lord. Do <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is stopping at present?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Two weeks later, Exosphere was [...] "dominant" [...] in the Golden Rose, winning {{his first}} Group 1 event by 2 lengths. Trainer John OShea said, [...] "Hes some colt. Wait until he grows into his frame. He is by this great sire Lonhro {{and he is}} in for a great season. A horse like Exosphere has great {{international}} appeal and <b>you</b> never <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> {{is going to end}} up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I've got {{to explain}} every little thing, I might jest as well run this case all by myself. Findin' a man when <b>you</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> is, {{is the first}} thing a detective has to learn, an' you'd better put in a good part of your time studyin' it up. Now I'm goin' to see how much money I can raise, an' 'long 'bout five o'clock you can count on my sneakin' out of town." ...|$|R
