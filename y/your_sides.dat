In their review of the PlayStation version, Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly commented that the PlayStation mouse is required for full enjoyment, but highly praised the voice acting, humour, and graphics. Scary Larry of GamePro, in contrast to EW and EGM, said the standard joypad [...] "works just as well" [...] as the PlayStation Mouse. He praised the humorous graphics, extensive voice acting, and script which [...] "will leave <b>your</b> <b>sides</b> aching from laughter", but found the gameplay too simplistic and lacking in challenge. He recommended it for players who were open to less serious gaming. IGN called Discworld challenging and long, but criticised the long loading times. The reviewer of [...] described the game as [...] "very beautiful" [...] and said that the PlayStation version has more colours than the PC version, but disliked the difficulty {{and the size of the}} save game files.|$|E

Can you, then, consent to be the only sufferers by this revolution, and, retiring from the field, grow old in poverty, wretchedness and contempt? Can you consent to wade through the vile mire of despondency, and owe the miserable remnant of that life to charity, which has hitherto been spent in honor? ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No, no--d--n it, no,' replied Nanty; 'the devil a {{crumb of}} butter was ever churned that would stick upon my bread. There was no order among us--he that was captain to-day, was swabber to-morrow; {{and as for}} plunder--they say old Avery, {{and one or two}} close hunks, made money; but in my time, all went as it came; and reason good, for if a fellow had saved five dollars, his throat would have been cut in his hammock. And then it was a cruel, bloody work.--Pah,--we'll say no more about it. I broke with them at last, for what they did on board of a bit of a snow--no matter what it was bad enough, since it frightened me--I took French leave, and came in upon the proclamation, so I am free of all that business. And here I sit, the skipper of the JUMPING JENNY--a {{nutshell}} of a thing, but goes through the water like a dolphin. If it were not for yon hypocritical scoundrel at Annan, who has the best end of the profit, and takes none of the risk, I should be well enough--as well as I want to be. Here is no lack of my best friend,'--touching his case-bottle;--'but, to tell you a secret, he and I have got so used to each other, I begin to think he is like a professed joker, that makes <b>your</b> <b>sides</b> sore with laughing if you see him but now and then; but if you take up house with him, he can only make your head stupid.

60|$|I saw I hadn't got {{the hang}} of the steering, and so couldn't rightly tell where I {{was going to bring}} up when I started. I went afoot the rest of the day, and let my wings hang. Early next morning I went to a private place to have some practice. I got up on a pretty high rock, and got a good start, and went {{swooping}} down, aiming for a bush a little over three hundred yards off; but I couldn't seem to calculate for the wind, which was about two points abaft my beam. I could see I was going considerable to looard of the bush, so I worked my starboard wing slow and went ahead strong on the port one, but it wouldn't answer; I could see I was going to broach to, so I slowed down on both, and lit. I went back to the rock and took another chance at it. I aimed two or three points to starboard of the bush--yes, more than that--enough so as to make it nearly a head-wind. I done well enough, but made pretty poor time. I could see, plain enough, that on a head-wind, wings was a mistake. I could see that a body could sail pretty close to the wind, but he couldn't go in the wind's eye. I could see that if I wanted to go a-visiting any distance from home, and the wind was ahead, I might have to wait days, maybe, for a change; and I could see, too, that these things could not be any use at all in a gale; if you tried to run before the wind, you would make a mess of it, for there isn't anyway to shorten sail--like reefing, you know--you have to take it ALL in--shut your feathers down flat to <b>your</b> <b>sides.</b> That would LAND you, of course. You could lay to, with your head to the wind--that is the best you could do, and right hard work you'd find it, too. If you tried any other game, you would founder, sure.|$|E
