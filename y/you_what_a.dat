500|$|Following its release, Anbe Sivam has {{attained}} cult {{status in}} Tamil cinema and receives re-runs on television channels. Baradwaj Rangan wrote that Anbe Sivam was [...] "leagues {{ahead of the}} average Tamilwhy, even Indianfilm", though he felt that [...] "the masses were unwilling to accept the experimental nature of the film", while talking about the film's box office failure. During his acceptance speech after winning the Vijay Award for Best Director in 2010 for Naan Kadavul (2009), director Bala revealed that a scene in Anbe Sivam where Kamal says to Madhavan, [...] "when we love others unconditionally without any expectation, we become Gods", inspired him to make his film. Bala also made a reference to Anbe Sivam in his 2003 film, Pithamagan, in a scene where Suriya's character goes for a screening of the film with his friends. A dialogue told by Kamal to Madhavan, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> tsunami is? Periya alai illa…malai." [...] (It's not just a big wave…it's a mountain) also attained popularity.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine received [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] negatively {{and used the}} word [...] "drippy" [...] to describe it. Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, [...] "she reminds <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was one of the}} songs on Fearless that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift [...] "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, [...] "And indeed, we think we got a little fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [...] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," [...] despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] to a [...] "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".|$|E

[...] "...We couldn't pass up the opportunity to tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> groovy all around car it is even if it can't smoke the quarter-mile in 13 seconds. And what car in '73 can." [...] "It's not overpowering but it's enough - and so comfortable that the editor bought the car." [...] "The Laguna {{is the type of}} car you want to own for fast, comfortable transportation in quiet luxury." ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 1940 he {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in {{exchange}} for two rookie players. However, Smukler decided to leave football and join the United States Army. He said, “I got $3,000 a year for playing football professionally. It was great during the season. Everybody shook your hand, slapped you on the back, and told <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> swell fellow you were. But the rest of the time, I couldn’t get a job.” Between football seasons Smukler could only make money doing piecework as a glove cutter. “It was enough to discourage any man, and I kept thinking about what I was going to do when I couldn’t play football anymore. I sat down and figured it out and then decided my best bet was the Army.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although poor {{ticket sales}} forced the {{cancellation}} of the Adelaide gig, the remaining four concerts all went ahead. [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave a reservedly positive review of the opening Sydney date on 23 March (which it rated three stars out of five), noting [...] "In a set plus two encores (the first cheered for; the second not really but played anyway) comprising 30 songs, {{it was kind of}} the equivalent of throwing a lot of make-up at the mirror and seeing what stuck. [...] There were more excursions than expected into the patchy punk-rock of late-1970s Adam and the Ants and, with only guitars to provide melody, the early-1980s, solo-era Goody Two Shoes didn't work as well as it should have – even sampled brass would have helped there. [...] But when things came together you could see why Ant still inspires such dedication in the faithful. The likes of Ants Invasion, with its piercing, menacing lead-guitar line, and the sleazy, swaggering glam of Physical showed that there were enduring gems among the album tracks and B-sides, while hits such as Stand and Deliver, Antmusic (sweetly dedicated to Molly Meldrum) and Prince Charming reminded <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> deliciously odd pop star he truly was.". Ant also made further Australian TV appearances including a return to Adam Hills in Gordon Street Tonight recorded on 26 March for transmission on 28 March, including live performances of Stand and Deliver and new album track Vince Taylor with his full band.|$|E
