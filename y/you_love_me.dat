5|$|In 1968 Franco-Caribbean writer Aimé Césaire {{published}} Une Tempête, {{a radical}} {{adaptation of the}} play based on its colonial and postcolonial interpretations, in which Caliban is a black rebel and Ariel is mixed-race. The figure of Caliban influenced numerous works of African literature in the 1970s, including pieces by Taban Lo Liyong in Uganda, Lemuel Johnson in Sierra Leone, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o in Kenya, and David Wallace of Zambia's Do <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Me,</b> Master?. A similar phenomenon occurred in late 20th-century Canada, where several writers produced works inspired by Miranda, including The Diviners by Margaret Laurence, Prospero's Daughter by Constance Beresford-Howe and The Measure of Miranda by Sarah Murphy. Other writers have feminised Ariel (as in Marina Warner's novel Indigo) or Caliban (as in Suniti Namjoshi's sequence of poems Snapshots of Caliban).|$|E

Paul Shaffer, who did the write-up, wrote that the girl-group sound, {{originated}} by them, was [...] "everything to [...] "; he also described their impromptu performance of [...] "Soldier Boy" [...] as inspiring.

500|$|According to Neil McCormick of The Sydney Morning Herald, {{he writes}} that the lyrics [...] "I don't {{want to be a}} soldier", is a way that Martin can conjure John Lennon into the song's melody.

500|$|Musically, {{it is one}} of Coldplay's {{more diverse}} pieces, {{featuring}} many different time signatures.

500|$|Steve Huey of AllMusic {{notes that}} the Shirelles defined [...] "the {{so-called}} girl group sound with their soft, sweet harmonies and yearning innocence", with their songs predating Motown in their widespread crossing of racial demographics, both in the US and in Britain. He also {{notes that the}}y spawned [...] "legions of imitators", and laid a blueprint for future female pop stars to follow. Turner writes that the Shirelles [...] "launched [...] genre", noting that their early work already included [...] "the essence" [...] of the genre; Alwyn Zak expands on the statement, noting that the influx of female groups started after the success of [...] "Will <b>You</b> <b>Love</b> <b>Me</b> Tomorrow".|$|E
