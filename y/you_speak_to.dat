500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, when <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When we tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to.</b> If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

2500|$|After an {{increase}} in public opposition to the proposed artwork in September 2010, an additional meeting was organized on October 19 at the Madame Walker Theatre. It {{was at this point}} that the discussion became more controversial in nature and began to attract attention from arts critics on a national level. Wilson explained that promoting discourse in a large city like Indianapolis is much different than in a museum, which is a more finite environment. In earlier community talks in 2009 and early 2010, Wilson and the CICF had had little success in creating an ongoing dialogue. It wasn't until the discussion around the artwork took a more controversial turn that a larger portion of the city began to take notice. Wilson explained, [...] "With a city, you realize—or I have come to realize—that as many groups as <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> there are other groups. You can't ever reach everyone. So I’m just really thrilled that there’s engagement and talk about art." ...|$|E
2500|$|Connolly and {{his older}} sister, Florence (named for their {{maternal}} grandmother, and eighteen months his senior), were cared for by two aunts, Margaret and Mona Connolly, his father's sisters, in their cramped tenement in Stewartville Street, Partick. [...] "My aunts constantly told me I was stupid, which still affects me today pretty badly. It’s just a belief that I’m not quite as good as anyone else. It gets worse as you get older. I’m a happy man now but I still have the scars of that." [...] Regarding his sister, Connolly has called her his [...] "great defender". [...] "To this day, he explained in 2009, [...] "Guys say, 'God, your sister... We didn't dare beat you up – your sister was a nightmare'. She used to get after them." [...] In the mid-1960s, Flo was on holiday in Dunoon {{with her husband and}} two children. [...] "My mother said, 'I saw Florence walking along, and I followed her.'" [...] "I said, 'Did <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> her?' 'Oh, no, I didn't,' she said. I thought, 'Oh, my god. It's like being a ghost while you're still alive.' Walking behind your own child. Having a look. I couldn't bear that." ...|$|E

2500|$|So I went {{to lunch}} with [...] George Kennan and Erwin Panofsky {{and the great}} Plato scholar Harold Cherniss. Afterwards Cherniss invited me to his {{beautiful}} office and, as we started chatting, Oppenheimer {{came into the room}} and sat on the table behind us. This {{is one of the most}} cruel, brilliant tricks: it makes you master of the situation, and the people who can't see you as <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> them are completely helpless. Oppenheimer's mastery of these histrionic moves was incredible. Cherniss was showing me how he was editing a passage of Plato with a lacuna, and trying to fill it. When Oppenheimer asked me what I would do with such a passage, I began stumbling, and he said, “Well that's very stupid. A great text should have blanks.” There I happily lost my temper: “Of all the pompous clichés,” I said. “First of all, that's a quote from Mallarmé, as you, sir, must know. Secondly, it's the kind of paradox you could play with till the cows come home. But when you're asked to do an edition of a Plato text for us ordinary human beings, I am most grateful if the blanks are filled.” Oppenheimer fought back superbly. He said, “No, precisely in philosophy you should know more than in poetry. It is the implicit missing that stimulates the argument.” ...|$|E
