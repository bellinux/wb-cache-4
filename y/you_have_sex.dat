500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay".
