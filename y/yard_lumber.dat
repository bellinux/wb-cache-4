50|$|Lumber yards sell {{products}} made at lumber mills, where customers pick up products {{at the yard}} themselves or request that an order be built and delivered {{to them by the}} lumber <b>yard.</b> <b>Lumber</b> yards may also sell wood-plastic composites, such as Trex, any other type of construction material or supplies, and general hardware store items. Lumber yards are the primary resources for contractors and homeowners when construction material is needed. Home Depot stores also have lumber sections, but this may not be considered a lumber yard, although it serves the same purpose. Lumber yards use forklift trucks to move the large heavy units of lumber around the yard. Saws may also be available to cut boards to a desired length for customers.|$|E
50|$|Known {{locally as}} “the church {{with the red}} doors,” St. John’s was {{initially}} established as a mission church in 1876 by circuit riders. The church’s cornerstone was laid in 1882.

Brown, with the bricks made at his own <b>yard,</b> <b>lumber</b> from his sawmill, and the excavation and finishing work completed by his employees.

George De Normandie Gillespie, first Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Western Michigan, consecrated the church on January 10, 1884. In 1996, the church building underwent extensive restoration and renovations, much of which was completed by parishioners.|$|E

In some cities, such as Phoenix, Arizona, city fire protection and prevention codes for <b>lumber</b> <b>yards</b> exist.|$|R

Because a {{straddle carrier}} is open at both front and rear, it can transport lumber much longer than the carrier itself, over 30 m in length.|$|R

50|$|In the 19th century, logging was {{the main}} {{economic}} activity justifying {{the development of this}} area. <b>Yards</b> <b>lumbering</b> settled as logging concessions on public lands, granted by the Government of Quebec.

In favor of ice on rivers and winter roads improvised in forest, they could achieve their territories cutting and hauling wood to rivers.|$|R

50|$|Holmesburg is a {{neighborhood}} in the Northeast section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Holmesburg was named for the descendants of John Holme (1632-1704) who immigrated to Philadelphia in the 1680s and had no known relation to Surveyor General Thomas Holme. John Holme's descendants acquired land in Lower Dublin, {{north and south of}} Frankford Avenue and west of the Pennypack Creek. At the turn of the 19th century they began selling numerous small parcels of their holdings in what became a real estate boom. Also at this time, John Holme, the great grandson of the first John Holme, renamed his <b>lumber</b> <b>yard</b> the Holmesburg <b>Lumber</b> <b>Yard.</b> This renaming coupled with the multitude of Holme family real estate transactions identified this area as 'Holmesburg', the title surviving more than two hundred years later.|$|R

Thirteen drug stores were in operation, and the town had two daily newspapers. Nearly everyone used kerosene lamps, and a few were placed on posts on Main Street. There was no city water works, so all depended on shallow wells, which were strongly alkaline. Passenger trains of two and three sections arrived daily, loaded with people, most of whom got off at Garden City.|$|R
