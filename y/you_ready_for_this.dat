The IAC’s inspection cycle is pretty rapid in cosmological terms but even its resources are limited. As a result, it only makes it round to any given planet roughly once every 250 years. Very often all that is required, after this (relative) blink of an eyelid, is a brief spot-check for, on many planets over so short a time, nothing of significance has changed.
