Higginson's essay, {{in which he}} urged aspiring writers to [...] "charge <b>your</b> <b>style</b> with life", contained practical advice for those wishing to break into print. Dickinson's decision to contact Higginson suggests that by 1862 she was contemplating publication and {{that it may have}} become increasingly difficult to write poetry without an audience.

2500|$|This led to {{the famous}} quote [...] "Maurice, you must change <b>your</b> <b>style</b> of bowling immediately". From then on Tate {{developed}} as a tireless fast-medium bowler {{and the founder of}} modern seam bowling. Though not exceptionally fast through the air, Tate gave the illusion of gaining speed off the pitch. His easy, rhythmic action and solid build allowed him to do a great amount of bowling – his bowling of 9567 deliveries in 1925 is unparalleled among bowlers of medium pace or above, this when he was still opening the batting for Sussex in many matches.|$|E

Burnley stated that background vocals were worked on the most in regard to producing, elaborating on That Metal Show, [...] "Because, guitars are guitars, you know, I mean, what are you gonna do, you can tune them and all these things, but singing is a totally different animal so that's where {{we spent a lot}} of time.

What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, <b>your</b> <b>style,</b> your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
