50|$|Actor-Lab is {{a program}} that visualizes the Lego Mindstorms {{internal}} logic through visual flowcharts. The ideas underlying actor-lab are derived from the event-driven, message-passing computer languages {{that began with the}} actor based languages devised by Hewit. Actor-lab requires constant communication with the RCX brick via the infra-red link. This means that you have to mount the RCX vertically for models that move about, and hold the tower in some form of gantry crane. Actor-lab shows you in real-time what is happening on the RCX, including simulation of motors, sensors, lights, and sounds. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> also add controls {{at the bottom of the}} screen to give you real-time control of your program/model. There is a similar program from Lego called Robolab. In Robolab, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> actually <b>download</b> programs to the Lego RCX.|$|R
