50|$|In the past, the <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> (V. flavoviridis) and the Noronha vireo (V. gracilirostris) {{have been}} {{considered}} as subspecies of the red-eyed vireo.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> is 14-14.7 cm {{in length}} and weighs 18.5 g. It has olive-green upperparts and a dusky-edged gray crown. There is a dark line from the bill to the red-brown eyes, and a white supercilium. The underparts are white with yellow breast sides and flanks. Young birds are duller with brown eyes, a brown tint to the back, and less yellow on the underparts. The adult <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> differs from the red-eyed vireo in its much yellower underparts, lack of a black border to the duller gray crown, yellower upperparts and {{different}} eye color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Yellow-green</b> <b>vireos</b> feed on insects {{gleaned from}} tree foliage, favoring {{caterpillars}} and beetles. They also eat small fruits, including mistletoe berries, and, in winter quarters, those of Cymbopetalum mayanum (Annonaceae) and gumbo-limbo (Bursera simaruba).|$|R
50|$|The lesser {{greenlet}} has a nasal neeah-neeah-neeah-neeah {{call and}} the song is a whistled chi chi cher cher cher cher chiri cher which cheri, slower and more melodious {{than that of the}} <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> has a nasal nyaaah call, and {{the song}} is a {{repetitive}} veree veer viree, fee’er vireo viree, shorter and faster {{than that of the}} red-eyed vireo. This species rarely sings on its wintering grounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{resident}} species {{occur in}} pairs or family groups that maintain territories all year (except Hutton's vireo, which joins mixed feeding flocks). Most of the migrants defend winter territories against conspecifics. The exceptions are the complex comprising the red-eyed vireo, the <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo,</b> the black-whiskered vireo, and the Yucatan vireo, which winter in small wandering flocks.|$|E
5000|$|... 91 (21%) of Monteverde's {{bird species}} are long {{distance}} migratory birds, which reproduce in North America and pass through Monteverde during their migration or spend {{the winter in}} the area. Three of these species, the swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), the piratic flycatcher (Legatus leucophaius), and the <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> (Vireo flavoviridis), reproduce in Monteverde and migrate to South America during their non-reproductive phase.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-green</b> <b>vireo</b> (Vireo flavoviridis) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird. It breeds {{from southern}} Texas (occasionally the Rio Grande Valley) in the United States and the western and eastern mountain ranges of northern Mexico (the Sierra Madre Occidental and Sierra Madre Oriental—also the Cordillera Neovolcanica) south to central Panama. It is migratory, wintering in the northern and eastern Andes and the western Amazon Basin.|$|E
40|$|A {{specimen}} of the <b>Yellow-green</b> <b>Vireo,</b> Vireo flavoviridis, shot at Long Pine, Brown County, {{has just been}} received by the Curator of the Museum of the University of Nebraska. This {{is the first one}} reported in this State. It is a rare Vireo for the entire United States having been reported, as far as the author can learn, from Texas, California, and Canada only...|$|E
40|$|Shade-grown coffee has {{received}} much attention for providing bird habitat in tropical regions. Within shade coffee production, canopy management can vary greatly, and this variation may produce {{changes in the}} availability of food resources for forest-associated birds. To evaluate food availability and habitat quality in two farms with different shade management styles, bird foraging behavior was analyzed in terms of prey attack rates and foraging substrates utilized. These behaviors were examined in two species, the <b>Yellow-green</b> <b>Vireo</b> (Vireo flavoviridis) and the White-winged Tanager (Spermagra leucoptera). Measurements of individual body condition, including fat reserves, mass, and blood hematocrit levels were compared to provide an additional index of habitat quality. Significant differences were encountered between farm types both in the variety of shade trees used as foraging substrates {{and the rate of}} prey attack, indicating a decreased availability of food resources for birds foraging in the low shade coffee farm. A confounding factor in comparing these farms is that in addition to differences in the amount of shade cover, there is a vast difference in the diversity of trees present. To control for this, foraging behaviors were also compared within common shade tree genera between farms, which led to similar results as those found in the aggregate data. These results suggest that the shade management style [...] both shade tree diversity and amount of shade cover [...] affects the availability of food for forest-associated birds, and this likely contributes to the high avian diversity observed in high shade coffee farms. i...|$|E
