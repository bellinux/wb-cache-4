One of the possibilities of the improvement of fattening efficiency is a proper choice of decisions concerning {{the course of a}} fattening process. Making the optimal decisions can be supported by means of dynamic programming (DP) models, using the hierarchic Markov process (HMP) technique. The models developed in the presented study optimize decisions with respect to time of the termination of fattening process in various production approaches including: breed, scale of production and intensity of <b>fattening.</b> Key words: <b>young</b> <b>bulls,</b> <b>fattening,</b> economic optimization, dynamic programming models, hierarchic Markov process I.

40|$|Session 5 : Modeling / systems biologyThe INRA {{feeding system}} aims at {{simulating}} <b>young</b> <b>bull’s</b> growth and body composition {{in response to}} dietary changes during the finishing period. Presently, tissue deposition is modified by net energy intake in relation to age and breed, without considering the relative proportion of energy nutrients. But at fixed NE density, rations based on concentrate or maize silage support fatter gains (Garcia et al., 2008), which justifies better characterization of diet composition in prediction models. Our objective is to simulate the absorbed energy nutrient fluxes, their time variation and relative proportions, {{as well as their}} effects on lipids and proteins of carcass and visceral depots of finishing bulls. A dynamic model of growing cattle (Hoch and Agabriel, 2004) provides the framework and helps target variables of interest to reveal these effects.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of body weight (BW) at slaughter and fattening intensity on carcass fatness and meat fatty acid profile in <b>young</b> Holstein- Friesian <b>bulls.</b> One-hundred <b>bulls</b> <b>fattened</b> on two levels of intensity a semi-intensive (SI) and an intensive (I) were used. Fattening was carried out to BW of 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 kg. Live ultrasound measurements were performed to determine back fat thickness. Carcass dressing percentage, carcass conformation and fatness, intramuscular fat content of m. longissimus dorsi and fatty acid profile (by gas chromatography) were determined after slaughter. Intensively <b>fattened</b> <b>bulls</b> were characterised by a greater carcass dressing percentage – by 1. 17 % on average, greater carcass conformation scores, greater external fat thickness and a greater intramuscular fat content than <b>bulls</b> SI <b>fattened.</b> Fat from intensively <b>fattened</b> <b>bulls</b> contained higher levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) – by 0. 96 / 100 g on average. Semi-intensive fattening contributed to a decrease in the n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio and to a significant increase in the concentrations of C 18 : 2 and C 20 : 4 fatty acids.

40|$|The {{reform of}} European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003 has {{resulted}} in substantial changes to the attribution of subsidies to dairy farmers. Moreover, dairy farmers are in also facing an unprecedented situation on the markets with the soaring prices of agricultural raw materials: they sell their products at a higher price (milk, meat and cereals), but must also cope with the increasing prices of concentrates. In this paper 1, we discuss cross effects, on the productive strategy of French dairy farms, of the Luxemburg Agreement and the prices variations. A model based on mathematical programming has been privileged to determine how dairy farmers might re-evaluate their systems to identify optimal production plan. While respecting the principle of agent rationality (maximization of profit), the model incorporates the economic risk related to the volatility of the inputs and outputs prices. Thus the model maximises the expected utility of the income while taking into account a set of constraints: regulatory, structural, zootechnical, agronomic and environmental. The model is applied to four types of dairy farms {{to cope with the}} diversity of production systems in the west of France (“grazier” type, “semi intensive” type, “milk + cereals” type and “milk + young bulls” type). The model is used to produce quantitative estimations and support reflection through the simulation of the setting up of the Single payment scheme. The sensitivity of the results is discussed by taking into account several options of prices for cereals and livestock products. These may have a strong influence on the structure of the diet and, therefore, on the level of intensification of the forage area. The results show that the implementation of the CAP reform encourages farmers to substitute a part of corn silage by grass in the diet. However, the rising price of agricultural production encourages, on the contrary, farmers to intensify their system in order to free up land for growing cereals. We also observe that a decrease of the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> <b>fattening</b> activity to develop cereal crops is also economically profitable. dairy farm, single payment, price variation, Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|Cattle meat {{production}} in Sardinia is based mainly on suckler-cows system. Such system, {{based on the}} selling of calves to the fatness centers and characterized by a limited use of resources out of farm suffered a severe crisis {{by the introduction of}} bluetongue emergencies in Sardinia, which determined restrictive measures for animal movements. Hence the farms have been forced to fatten calves, changing the production system and increasing the costs. The use of pasture in the fattening of animals could reduce feeding costs and improve the nutritional composition of meat. For that reason 3 studies were carried out, in order to evaluate if grazing can represent a chance for Sardinian beef system,. The main results were: Pasture-fed animals showed daily live gain and dressing percentage similar to other breeds, more specialized than Sardinian breeds for {{meat production}}, obtained in similar conditions. Sardinian cattle showed an high capacity in exploiting the Mediterranean pastures, thanks to its selective grazing. Pasture-fed animals have shown specific characteristics of meat as an higher content of n- 3 PUFA, beneficial for the human health; that improves both nutritional characteristics and consumer perception of the meat produced by Sardinian <b>young</b> <b>bulls.</b> Overall, <b>fattening</b> of Sardinian <b>bulls</b> based on pasture, with certain levels of supplementation, is a system that can allow to obtain high quality meat with lower costs...|$|R

ResultsThe 90 % highest posterior density (HPD 90) intervals for heritabilities of final weight (FW), average daily gain (ADG) and scrotal circumference (SC) ranged from 0. 41 to 0. 49, 0. 23 to 0. 30 and 0. 47 to 0. 57, respectively, for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture, from 0. 45 to 0. 60, 0. 20 to 0. 32 and 0. 56 to 0. 70, respectively, for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> in feedlots, from 0. 29 to 0. 33, 0. 14 to 0. 18 and 0. 35 to 0. 45, respectively, for commercial animals on pasture, and from 0. 24 to 0. 44, 0. 13 to 0. 24 and 0. 35 to 0. 57 respectively, for commercial animals in feedlots. The HPD 90 intervals for genetic correlations of FW, ADG and SC in performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture (feedlots) with FW, ADG and SC in commercial animals on pasture (feedlots) ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 96 (0. 83 to 0. 94), 0. 78 to 0. 90 (0. 40 to 0. 79) and from 0. 92 to 0. 97 (0. 50 to 0. 83), respectively. Age at first calving was genetically related to ADG (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 48 to − 0. 06) and SC (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 41 to − 0. 05) for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> on pasture, however it {{was not related to}} ADG (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 29 to 0. 10) and SC (HPD 90 interval = − 0. 35 to 0. 13) for performance-tested <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> in feedlots.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse three {{commercial}} beef categories of the ‘Serrana de Teruel breed’ to define the appropriate commercial option. Twenty ‘Serrana de Teruel’ male calves at 9 months were assigned to the commercial beef categories (<b>young</b> <b>bulls,</b> bulls and steers), slaughtered at 12, 22 and 22 months of age, respectively. The in vivo ultrasound backfat thickness was greater than the dorsal fat thickness, and the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers had a similar fat thickness, that was greater than the bulls in both areas. The slaughter weight and cold carcass weight were significantly different between the commercial categories. However, the differences were not sufficient to modify the dressing percentage, carcass conformation and fatness degree between the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and bulls. The maximum stress of the muscle at 7 d of ageing was lower in the steers than in the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and bulls. In general, the lightness of the meat in the bulls was lower than that in the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers. The subcutaneous fat of the bull carcasses had a vivid colour and stored more carotenoids than that of the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and steers. Hence, bulls produced heavier and better conformed carcasses with more edible meat and less fat than the other categories. However, steers are recommended to produce large carcasses with more trim and cover fat than the other categories.

Slaughter performances of 156 226 Montbeliarde, 160 361 Normande and 8691 Simmental <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> were analyzed with a multitrait animal model. In the three breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight (0. 12 to 0. 19 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 04) and carcass conformation (0. 21 to 0. 26 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 04) and slightly lower for age at slaughter (0. 08 to 0. 17 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 03). For all three breeds, genetic correlations between carcass weight and carcass conformation were moderate and favorable (0. 30 to 0. 52 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 13). They were strong and favorable (- 0. 49 to - 0. 71 +/- 0. 05 to 0. 15) between carcass weight and age at slaughter.

Heavier <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> tend to be better conformed and slaughtered earlier. Genetic correlations between corresponding <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> and veal production traits were moderate and favorable (0. 32 to 0. 70 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 09), implying that selecting sires for veal calf production leads to select sires producing better <b>young</b> <b>bulls.</b> Genetic correlations between <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> carcass weight and cow size were moderately favorable (0. 22 to 0. 45 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 10). <b>Young</b> <b>bull</b> carcass conformation had moderate and favorable genetic correlations (0. 11 to 0. 24 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 10) with cow width but moderate and unfavorable genetic correlations (- 0. 21 to - 0. 36 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 08) with cow height.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to estimate the allele and genotype frequencies of the BLAD, DUMPS and κ-CSN genes in Holstein <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> of the national AI station of Iran. It is shown that the genetic mutation responsible for BLAD in Holstein cattle was absent in all <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> entering to the national dairy cattle progeny test. Of the 37 <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> genotyped for CD 18 / Hae III gene mutation, 36 were normal homozygote (AA), 1 was heterozygote for the disease (AB) and no affected homozygote genotype (BB) were found. The frequency of the normal and BLAD mutant allele were 0. 99 and 0. 01, respectively. The analyzed results showed that the BLAD carrier prevalence in Iranian Holstein <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> was approximately 2. 8 %. The genotype frequencies in κ-CSN/ Hinf I locus were 0. 70 for homozygote (AA) and 0. 30 for heterozygote (AB) animals while the frequency of the A allele was 0. 85. In the present study it is shown that the genetic mutation responsible for DUMPS was absent in all of the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> analyzed from national AI station. It can be concluded that due to negative economical impact of the DUMPS and BLAD mutation on dairy cattle industry and their recessive mode of inheritance, attention has to be paid to any case of a <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> entering to the testing program having in his origin any known carriers. Such a bull should be tested and if positive eliminated from the active population. <b>Young</b> <b>bulls</b> (under progeny testing program) should also be screened for both mutated alleles if in their progeny a high incidence of mortality is observed. This strategy would prevent the introduction of these mutated alleles in the Iranian endogenous cattle breeds...|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} a client of Animal Sciences Group, {{different}} varieties of veal were analyzed by both instrumental and sensory analyses. The sensory evaluation was performed with a sensory analytical panel {{in the period of}} 13 th of May and 31 st of May, 2005. The three varieties of veal were: <b>young</b> <b>bull,</b> pink veal and white veal. The sensory descriptive analyses show that the three groups <b>Young</b> <b>bulls,</b> pink veal and white veal, differ significantly in red colour for the raw meat as well as the baked meat. The taste of the white veal group is of lower intensity for the attributes ‘blood’ and ‘watery’ than for the <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> and the pink veal. The <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> baked meat is juicier at the end of chewing compared with white veal. For the other texture attributes there are {{no significant differences between the}} three product groups. A possible explanation of low texture differences between groups can be that the individual samples show much variation on these attributes...|$|R

40|$|Simulation {{calculations}} are {{a suitable}} tool {{to test the}} impact of breeding policy {{in the framework of}} selection programmes. Based on simulations it is possible to construct a mathematical model of the population included in the process of breeding and to test the influence of breeding arrangements. It is also important to test the estimated breeding effect when conclusions can be drawn from a potential inconsistency of expected values with the actual state achieved in practice during implementation of breeding programmes that will be aimed at higher effectiveness of breeding work. An important breeding policy is the dimension of the use of tested and proved bulls in a herd. By optimisation calculations Fewson (1987) proved a suitability of wider use of <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> for breed-ing. Lohuis et al. (1992) determined the prob-ability of animal survival and expected returns when <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> were used in progeny testing. Weigel et al. (1995) reported similar results when they determined genetic gain and effectiveness of <b>young</b> <b>bull</b> selection for their use in breeding. Meuwissen and Goddard (1997) constructed an algorithm to determine an optimum volume of information from the offspring under progeny testing of <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> with available estimations of breeding value on the basis of pedigree infor-mation.

40|$|Assessment of carcass {{physical}} {{composition and}} physicochemical characteristics of meat from Nellore males distributed randomly into three treatments: males castrated at 13 {{months of age}} at puberty (n= 26); castrated at 18 months of age, 15 days before confinement (n= 26); and <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> (n= 25). For the evaluation of meat chemical characteristics, we used samples of 12 animals taken at random from each treatment. The experimental design was completely randomized. Animals were slaughtered at 22 months of age after 100 days of confinement. The carcasses of <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> showed higher contents of muscle (66. 46 %) and bone (16. 03 %), and lower fat content (17. 66 %), in relation to that of steers castrated at 13 (62. 83, 15. 28, and 22. 11 %, respectively) or 18 months (63. 99, 15. 29, and 21. 53 %, respectively), which did not differ amongst themselves. The meat of <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> was darker (3. 07 points) than the meat from those castrated at 13 months of age (3. 43 points), while the meat from those castrated at 18 months displayed an intermediate color (3. 29 points), not differing from the others. <b>Young</b> <b>bulls</b> yielded meat with lower content of intramuscular fat (3. 18 points) and lipids (3. 81 %) in relation to those castrated at 13 (4. 58 points and 6. 77 %, respectively) or 18 months (4. 52 points and 5. 66 %, respectively). Protein content was higher (P 0. 05) {{by the age of}} castration, with <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> having lower values in relation to the castrated males.

40|$|The growth {{performance}} and serum concentration of triiodothyronine (T 3) of 15 Holstein <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> {{with an initial}} mean live weight of 200 ± 25 kg was studied {{in response to a}} dietary rumen-protected fat (RPF) supplementation [3 or 5 % of dry matter (DM) ] during hot, humid climate (in Guilan, Iran, during summer season) in four sequential 21 -d periods. The growth {{performance and}} serum T 3 concentration were measured {{at the end of each}} period. Results showed that there were no differences in the daily DM intake among the treatments in all experimental periods. During all 21 -d periods and overall, the bulls fed RPF-containing diet gained significantly more weight than those receiving control diet. The <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> fed diets containing 5 % RPF gained more weight than those receiving 3 % RPF-containing diets. The lowest weight gain was observed for <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> fed the control diet. The highest (P< 0. 05) feed to gain (f:g) ratios were observed for <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> fed control diet and the lowest f:g ratios were observed for those fed 5 % RPF-containing diet. Serum T 3 concentration in the <b>young</b> <b>bulls</b> fed 5 % RPF-containing diet was significantly higher than those fed 3 % RPF or control diet in all experimental periods and overall. The variations in response to dietary RPF supplements among treatments could be related to lower metabolic heat production of RPFs rather than proteins and carbohydrates, especially in hot, humid conditions...|$|R
