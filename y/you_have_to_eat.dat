To quote the words of my charming young {{companion}} here, Monsieur Guy Poynton, whom you may possibly remember"--Monsieur Albert bowed--"we are on the bust! I {{do not know the}} precise significance of the phrase any more than I suppose you do, but it means amongst other things a desire for the best <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> and to drink.

There are some first-rate musical comedies and light operas on the roofs and in the outdoor gardens. And if you hunt up the right places and stick to soft drinks, you can keep about as cool here as you can in the country. Hang it! {{when you come to}} think of it, there's nothing much to the country, anyhow. You get tired and sunburned and lonesome, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> any old thing that the cook dishes up to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks, Carley. That'll help a lot," [...] he said, gayly, but {{his eyes}} shone with earnest, glad light. [...] "I hoped I'd {{surprise}} you. I've found out here that I {{want to do things}} well. The West stirs something in a man. It must be an unwritten law. You stand or fall by your own hands. Back East you know meals are just occasions--to hurry through--to dress for--to meet somebody--to eat because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat.</b> But out here they are different. I don't know how. In the city, producers, merchants, waiters serve you for money. The meal is a transaction. It has no significance. It is money that keeps you from starvation. But in the West money doesn't mean much. You must work to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{bound to}} admit that conversations and amusements languished during that day. I was aware that Mame was getting a too {{prolonged}} one-sided view of things again, but I {{had no way to}} change it. Personally, I was wrapped up in the desire to eat. I had hallucinations of hash and visions of ham, and I kept saying to myself all the time, 'What'll <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> Jeff?--what'll you order now, old man, when the waiter comes?' I picks out to myself all sorts of favourites from the bill of fare, and imagines them coming. I guess it's that way with all hungry men. They can't get their cogitations trained on anything but something to eat. It shows that the little table with the broken-legged caster and the imitation Worcester sauce and the napkin covering up the coffee stains is the paramount issue, after all, instead of the question of immortality or peace between nations.|$|E
60|$|When we gave {{a dinner}} at home, we had gravy soup, turbot and lobster-sauce, haunch of mutton, boiled fowls and tongue, lukewarm oyster-patties and sticky curry for side-dishes; wild duck, cabinet-pudding, jelly, cream and tartlets. All {{excellent}} things, except when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> them continually. We lived upon them {{entirely in the}} season. Every one of our hospitable friends gave us a return dinner, which was a perfect copy of ours--just as ours was a perfect copy of theirs, last year. They boiled what we boiled, and we roasted what they roasted. We none of us ever changed the succession of the courses--or made more or less of them--or altered {{the position of the}} fowls opposite the mistress and the haunch opposite the master. My stomach used to quail within me, in those times, when the tureen was taken off and the inevitable gravy-soup smell renewed its daily acquaintance with my nostrils, and warned me of the persistent eatable formalities that were certain to follow. I suppose that honest people, who have known what it is to get no dinner (being a Rogue, I have myself never wanted for one), have gone through some very acute suffering under that privation. It may be some consolation to them to know that, next to absolute starvation, the same company-dinner, every day, is one of the hardest trials that assail human endurance. I date my first serious determination to throw over the medical profession at the earliest convenient opportunity, from the second season's series of dinners at which my aspirations, as a rising physician, unavoidably and regularly condemned me to be present.|$|E

5000|$|Normal {{functioning}} of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because, {{in addition to being}} weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal, although less toxic than other heavy metals, such as arsenic and mercury. It is weakly radioactive but is 'persistently' so because of its long half-life. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry states that: [...] "to be exposed to radiation from uranium, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat,</b> drink, or breathe it, or get it on your skin." [...] If DU particles do enter an individual, the type of danger presented—toxic vs. radiological—and the organ most likely to be affected depend on the solubility of the particles.|$|E
50|$|In Super Mega Worm, {{the player}} moves the worm around {{under the ground}} and makes it blast out through the surface and land on humans, animals and man made {{machines}} destroying them. To keep the worm above ground, player can land on objects such as cars, tanks and helicopters bounce off of them up into the air. It is possible for players to bounce off many objects in a row building up combo's resulting in a higher score. For every object destroyed a multiplier is gained that will help in increasing the player's score. The worm's health decreases as the game goes on, in order to combat this the player can replenish it by eating animals that roam above ground. In order for the player to progress {{to the next level}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> a certain number of humans which increases with every level. As the player progresses through the levels, they can obtain power ups that will assist them in completing their objective, this also has the effect of enlarging the worm. The power-ups that the player gains access to consist of speed boosts, a fiery projectiles that is shot from the worms mouth and an Electromagnetic Pulse that shut downs any machines in the area around the worm.The player can control the worm in three different ways. The first via the use of a slider, second by tilting the iPhone and lastly by using the D-Pad that was added in via a Patch.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the month}} of October, the park gets {{transformed}} for its annual Halloween festival, Fright Fest. This transformation includes the addition of Halloween decorations to its Crackaxle Canyon, Main Street, South End, and Rockville areas, making them Haunt Zones with roaming characters to give the areas the themes of a ghost town, a demon area, a graveyard and an Area 51 complex, respectively. In addition, several shows and attractions are added, including Mayhem Mission and The Trick-o-Treat Trail for kids, Dead Legends Live on Main St., Haunting Illusions, Wheel of Fright, and three up-charged [...] "haunts". Dead Legends Live has all past singers together and parody their songs about being dead. [...] "Illusions of Terror" [...] is a magic show in the Rockville Theater featuring illusionist David Garrity. The Wheel of Fright is a wheel and whatever you spin it to land on <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> or do. Such things to eat are cockroaches or worms. Prizes include season passes or exit passes. The five premium haunts are called Wicked Woods, Total Darkness, The Aftermath: Zombies Revenge, Slasher Circus 3D, and Midnight Mansion. Wicked Woods is in the picnic groves wooded area comprising a trail with people popping out at you and chasing you. Total Darkness is in the picnic grove {{and it is a}} walk through in a pitch black area, filled with frights. Slasher Circus 3D is in the picnic grove and is right beside Total Darkness, however this attraction is full of different lights and colors with a clown theme throughout. Midnight Mansion takes place on the ride Houdini. They transform the whole ride building into a haunted mansion. The Aftermath: Zombies Revenge is similar to Wicked Woods, but themed to the zombie apocalypse. In early 2009, Six Flags New England received an award within the chain for the best Fright Fest of 2008.|$|E
