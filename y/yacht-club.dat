60|$|The sailing here is just splendid, and, one morning, {{we thought}} we'd hire a boat for {{ourselves}} and go out fishing somewhere. So {{we went down to}} the <b>yacht-club</b> wharf to see about the boat that belonged to old Menendez--Rectus's Minorcan. There were lots of sail-boats there as well as row-boats, but we hunted up the craft we were after, and, by good luck, found Menendez in her, bailing her out.|$|E

The man is Austerly, of the Crown-land offices, and English, as you can see--one of the men with a family pull on somebody in authority in the Old Country. I believe he was a <b>yacht-club</b> commodore at home. The delicate girl's his daughter. Not enough blood in her--phthisis, too, I think--and it's quite likely she has been recommended a trip at sea. Miss Merril is, I understand, a friend of hers, and she evidently knows something of yachting too." ...|$|E
6000|$|October 11th.--We {{all left}} London on Sunday morning, between ten and eleven, from the Waterloo station, and arrived in Southampton about two, without meeting with {{anything}} very remarkable on the way. We put up at Chapple's Castle Hotel, {{which is one}} of the class styled [...] "commercial," [...] and, though respectable, not such a one as the nobility and gentry usually frequent. I saw little difference in the accommodation, except that young women attended us instead of men,--a pleasant change. It was a showery day, but J----- and I walked out to see the shore and the town and the docks, and, if possible, the ship in which S----- was to sail. The most noteworthy object was the remains of an old castle, near the water-side; the square, gray, weed grown, weird keep of which shows some modern chimney-pots above its battlements, while remaining portions of the fortress are made to seem as one of the walls for coal-depots, and perhaps for small dwellings. The English characteristically patch new things into old things in this manner, materially, legally, constitutionally, and morally. Walking along the pier, we observed some pieces of ordnance, one of which was a large brass cannon of Henry VIII.'s time, about twelve feet long, and very finely made. The bay of Southampton presents a pleasant prospect, and I believe it is the great rendezvous of the <b>yacht-club.</b> Old and young seafaring people were strolling about, and lounging at corners, just as they do on Sunday afternoons in the minor seaports of America.|$|E
