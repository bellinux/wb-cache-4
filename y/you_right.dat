500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] is {{a feminist}} call-to-arms, {{complete}} with muscular brass playing and soulful voice. Here Madonna is the anti-materialism girl, exhorting her female audiences to respect themselves. That means having {{a man who}} loves your head and your heart. If he doesn't treat <b>you</b> <b>right</b> (and here's the revolutionary rhetoric) you're better off on your own. Like a female preacher, Madonna emphasizes each word of the chorus, invoking God {{and the power of}} orgasm. In parts Cosmo-woman, girl-talk, and swinging dance track, it presages the deliciously declarative stance of [...] "Vogue" [...] and shows Madonna moving from introspective to survivalist mode.|$|E

[...] "Because the camera places <b>you</b> <b>right</b> on the field, {{all of the}} hits carry even more weight than if you were zoomed farther back, but the {{positive}} aspects are overshadowed by an inability to see the entire field," [...] said GameSpot's review of Backbreaker, while GameZone added that [...] "Backbreaker uses a tight third-person view that brings the player closer to the action. The results are visually interesting, but the mechanics are mismanaged. While the game strives to be as simple and as straightforward as possible, the camera often gets in the way." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} verse, Beyoncé {{continues}} to dismiss her former lover as she sings, [...] "So sad, you're hurt / boo hoo ...", over a tinkling piano riff and bass drums. She then chants the ascendant chorus, which this time features soaring strings and an uplifting aggressive piano accompaniment. Nadine Cheung of AOL Radio noted that though Beyoncé rips through the verses, she sings the chorus and bridge with restraint; on the latter, she affirms {{that she has}} moved on in life. The song ends as Beyoncé repeatedly sings, [...] "What goes around comes back around / I bet it sucks to be <b>you</b> <b>right</b> now".|$|E
500|$|A pop and R ballad, the {{subjects}} of [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] are revenge and karma. Not wanting to feel broken-hearted, the female protagonist sings that she feels happy to have left her lover, who did not recognize {{the potential for a}} happy life with her. Some critics viewed it as a sequel to Beyoncé's 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] as the two songs are thematically similar. However, some lyrics, including [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "sucks to be <b>you</b> <b>right</b> now", were criticized.

During an interview with MTV News in June, Lee talked about the song saying, [...] " [...] the song that I think is the first single is the song that wraps it all up.

According to Scott Shetler of PopCrush, [...] "Run the World" [...] contains an optimistic message and upbeat melody.

500|$|Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is {{established}} in the first portion of the film as a [...] "vaguely arrogant", but apparently successful, director who endures one humiliation after another.

After being stripped of creative control of his film, he is cuckolded by the pool cleaner (played by Billy Ray Cyrus), and thrown {{out of his own}} opulent house above Hollywood. After he checks into a seedy motel and pays with cash, the manager arrives to tell him that his credit is no good. Witnessed by Diane, Adam is pompous and self-important. He is the only character whose personality does not seem to change completely from {{the first part of the}} film to the second. One analysis of Adam's character contends that because he capitulated and chose Camilla Rhodes for his film, that is the end of Betty's cheerfulness and ability to help Rita, placing the blame for her tragedy on the representatives of studio power.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} the {{interlude}} is spare and largely revolves around Rihanna chanting, [...] "cake cake cake cake cake cake."

The lyric [...] "I know you wanna bite this/ It's so enticing/ Nothing else like this, I'ma make you my bitch/ And it's not even my birthday/ But you wanna put your name on it" [...] is a metaphor referring to a vagina.
