500|$|Reviewers {{have criticized}} the game for its high and unforgiving {{difficulty}} level especially late in the game, {{and it has been}} considered an example of [...] "Nintendo Hard" [...] video games. A review from 1UP.com referred to the latter levels as an [...] "unfair display of intentional cheapness". In his review of the Virtual Console version, GameSpot's Alex Navarro said [...] "the game will beat you to a pulp" [...] and that it [...] "assaults <b>you</b> <b>time</b> and time again with its punishing difficulty, insidiously placed enemies, and rage-inducing boss fights". According to his review, the game starts easy, but the difficulty starts to increase halfway through the second Act and continues through the sixth Act; Navarro describes the sixth Act's difficulty as being [...] "one of the bottom levels of gaming hell". IGN said that this game {{was one of the most}} difficult video games of all time, setting the trend for the rest of the series; however, they pointed out that its difficulty and graphics are [...] "defining characteristics [...] have carried over through the years into modern day [...] Gaiden sequels". ScrewAttack listed the game as the seventh hardest title in the NES library.|$|E

The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, {{and what is the}} purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height that you wish the mountain to be. If you wish to take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), <b>you</b> <b>time</b> the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode. The bombs these planes have are timed to go one mile (1.6 km) down and bring up a mountain one mile (1.6 km) high, but it will destroy everything within a 50-square-mile (130 km²) radius.

However, it seems the affair is over until Kat receives the gift of a watch, with a note saying [...] "Miss <b>you.</b> <b>Time</b> we got together again x". Kat's lover tries to convince her to meet him at the bedsit, but when she arrives, she erases his message of love from the mirror, and bins the key. However, he then pays for Alfie to go on a trip to Germany to buy Christmas supplies, texting Kat that he now has her to himself. She then receives a candle from him, with a note saying to light it in an upstairs window so he knows when to visit. She throws it away, but Jean inadvertently lights another one.

2500|$|... 20 Y.O. is {{composed}} by eleven songs, an introduction, three interludes and an outro. It starts off with Jackson stating [...] "There's {{something to be}} said for not saying anything. I've covered a lot in my 20 years. And I've uncovered a lot" [...] in its intro. The opening song, second single [...] "So Excited" [...] featuring rapper Khia, is a hip hop track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song [...] "Rockit". In the song, Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, [...] "If you like it then I’ll do it/I’ll go head to toe" [...] and [...] "I'm-a keep your body thumping, baby". [...] "Show Me" [...] follows, with Jackson spelling its title throughout the song. The fourth song, [...] "Get It Out Me", is a dance song which was noted to feature Jackson's vocals sounding like her brother Michael's ones. [...] The following song is [...] "Do It 2 Me". It marks a return to Jackson's conversational style; in the song, She is searching for her lover: [...] "My first and only call is to <b>you,</b> <b>time</b> after time, babe, throughout my life". Its music is punctuated by handclaps and by low swoops of a string section. Sixth song [...] "This Body" [...] lyrically is about men who have appreciation with Jackson's appearances in magazines. She addresses her fans in the line [...] "Just had to buy me, had to try me, oooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine". The song brings sinuous and dark beats incorporating a rhythmic pattern of heavy breathing and the sound of a jet taking off, which was noted to be a metaphor.|$|E
