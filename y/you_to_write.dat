It is a book that begs <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> in the margins, and highlight relevant quotes because it's filled with stories, insights, shocking statistics, inspiring anecdotes and refreshing critiques. It's small, it's smart and it's jammed with information and ideas that inspire hope and motivate action." [...] Similarly, reviewing for The Guardian, Stuart Christie wrote, [...] "This is a book to be savoured and referred to every so often, even if just to recharge one's moral batteries." [...] In The Globe and Mail, Stan Persky wrote, [...] "What I like about Klein's reflections on the nascent movement that she both participates in and analyzes is that she indulges in minimal rhetorical rah-rah. Nor does she fudge the shortcomings and screwups of the fledgling activists." ...|$|E

The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|Soft & Cuddly was {{developed}} for The Power house by John George Jones. Jones had previously developed Go to Hell for Triple Six. Go to Hell was published in 1985 and featured [...] "...revolting, crude and downright vile images." [...] When interviewed by Sinclair User, in the October 1987 issue, the programmer was asked [...] "Whatever possessed <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a game like Soft and Cuddly...". To this Jones responded, [...] "I didn't write the game because I'm a horrible person, I wrote it to amuse myself." [...] Jones also stated [...] "I love the reaction people give, I can't stand 'nice' inoffensive things...". The original version of the game was more gruesome; the babies were being torn apart rather than stretched and [...] "...the sheep was {{bouncing up and down}} on a corpse." [...] When asked how long he would retain interest in computers, Jones stated that he had already lost interest. Soft & Cuddly was released by The Power house during September 1987 in the United Kingdom. The game was later released in Spain during the first quarter of 1988. The game featured in a competition printed in the November 1987 issue of Sinclair User. The first prize was a day in the company of The Power House's staff including a trip to the London Dungeon. Other prize winners received a copy of Soft & Cuddly or a poster of the game's inlay artwork.|$|E

Matinee with Bob and Ray was {{originally}} a 15-minute show, soon expanding to half an hour. (When explaining why Bob was billed first, Goulding claimed {{that it was}} because [...] "Matinee with Bob and Ray" [...] sounded better than [...] "Matinob with Ray and Bob".)

Lewis replied: [...] "I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> and tell me. There's no use just asking me to write more.

2500|$|Muawiyah {{worked as}} a scribe for Muhammad.

Muawiya knocked on the door and he gave him permission to enter, which he did. He had a pen behind his ear which he had not used. The Prophet said, 'What is this on your ear?' He said, 'A pen which I have made ready for Allah and His Messenger.' The Prophet said. 'May Allah repay you well on behalf of your Prophet! By Allah, I will only ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> down revelation from heaven." [...] According to Ibn Kathir in his book Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Ibn Abbas said that Abu Sufyan asked Muhammad if he could make his son Muawiyah a scribe which Muhammad granted. Therefore, Muawiyah became his scribe.|$|E
2500|$|According to Schafer, {{he came up}} {{with the}} idea for Full Throttle while {{listening}} to a traveller's tales about time spent in an Alaskan biker bar. As he listened, it occurred to him that [...] "bikers are kind of like pirates — like another culture that people don't have a window into most of the time, but [...] has its own rules", and might provide a neat alternative to a fantasy setting. So he began his research into biker culture, reading Hunter S. Thompson's [...] The game originally would have featured an interactive sequence where Ben undergoes a peyote-induced hallucinogenic trip. This was eventually cut from the game, because the developers couldn't get it to [...] "work out" [...] with the publisher. The concept eventually became the basis of Psychonauts. Schafer recalls the reaction from the management at LucasArts as being one of [...] "'We can't believe we paid <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> this.'" [...] "They hated it" [...] he stated. In an interview with Gamasutra, Shafer stated that the biker aesthetics of the game were an appeal to fantasy. He stated the team was depending [...] "on the [...] secret desire to be a biker: big, tough, cool. Riding a huge hog..." [...] On the game's setting he noted that often it was mistaken for a post apocalyptic world, however he clarified that the setting was simply an alternate world which was more desolate than our own. [...] "It was never meant to be post-war or anything like that." ...|$|E
