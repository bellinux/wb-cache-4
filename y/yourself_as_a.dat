25|$|Langer impresses {{me because}} he has proven himself as a {{consistent}} batsmen {{over the past few}} years. I've always believed that it takes 3-4 years to prove <b>yourself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Shield batsman, and Langer has achieved that. He is more of a grafting batsman than any of his rivals and that should definitely count in his favour, given the current state of Australian batting. He probably doesn't have as much natural ability as some others around, but he has proved that he can make best use of what he has got. He's prepared to work hard, and has tightened his game a lot since he came into first class cricket. His ability to get his head down and his tight defence will both be strong assets in England.|$|E

"You do {{not need}} to ask {{permission}} from anyone to be a journalist," [...] explains the Periodical Publishers Association; [...] "however, it is sometimes useful to be able to identify <b>yourself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> journalist when needed." [...] To this end, journalistic agencies issue press cards to their reporters, editorialists, writers, and photographers. [...] These do not have the legal merits of government-issued cards, and they will not replace event-specific passes; the card only serves as proof of its bearer's status as a legitimate newsperson according to the issuing organization. [...] As such, card-carriers may be better able to obtain interviews, acquire information from law-enforcement, or gain access to exclusive venues.|$|E

A SASO policy manifesto produced in July 1971 defined this ideology as [...] "an attitude of mind, a way of life. The basic tenet of Black Consciousness is that the Blackman must reject all value systems that seek {{to make him a}} foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity." [...] Black Consciousness centred on psychological empowerment, through combating the feelings of inferiority that most black South Africans exhibited. Biko believed that, as part of the struggle against apartheid and white-minority rule, blacks should affirm their own humanity by regarding themselves as worthy of freedom and its attendant responsibilities. It applied the term [...] "black" [...] not only to Bantu-speaking Africans, but also to Indians and Coloureds. SASO adopted this term over [...] "non-white" [...] because its leadership felt that defining themselves in opposition to white people was not a positive self-description. Biko promoted the slogan [...] "black is beautiful", explaining that this meant [...] "Man, you are okay as you are. Begin to look upon <b>yourself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Cung Le, {{a famous}} Mixed Martial Arts fighter, “In the old days, {{if you wanted}} to {{announce}} <b>yourself</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> boxer in a new village, you built a lei tai, stood on it, and invited all comers to try and knock you off.” Some fighters issued their challenge {{in the form of a}} hand written letter to the person they wished to face. This form of challenge was illustrated in the movie Fearless, when Jet Li's character challenges another warrior to a fight. The book Ultimate Sparring: Principles & Practices comments, [...] "martial artists conducted ‘Challenge matches’ [...] to test each other's skills, because of a personal dispute, or to prove one martial system’s superiority over another system." [...] Either fighter lost the match and his credibility if he fell, was forced off or was knocked to the floor of the stage. As a result, no one would want to learn boxing from him. The winner of the bout became the [...] "owner of the platform" [...] and remained on stage unless he was forced off himself. If there were no more challengers, he became the champion and or established the dominance of his style in that area. Another way was to defeat an already established master on the lei tai and then take over his school.|$|E
