500|$|Watts {{left the}} group after working on just three songs on 1988's Don't Blow <b>Your</b> <b>Top</b> {{to start his}} own project, Pig. [...] After working the Hamburg {{underground}} music scene and releasing albums on European labels, the band began its long-standing relationship with Wax Trax! Records when Don't Blow <b>Your</b> <b>Top</b> was licensed to the label for US distribution. The album was produced by Adrian Sherwood, and was described by AllMusic critic Dave Thompson as [...] " [...] the producer as much as the band".|$|E
500|$|As of July 2007, KMFDM {{had sold}} {{approximately}} two million records worldwide. Critics {{have been widely}} positive of KMFDM, though less enthusiastic about the band's earliest work. What Do You Know, Deutschland? was called [...] "less energetic" [...] and Don't Blow <b>Your</b> <b>Top</b> was called [...] "a little flimsy" [...] in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries, respectively. UAIOE, when the band's sound began to develop, was called [...] "more assured" [...] by Hinds and [...] "more representative of KMFDM's true motives" [...] by Thompson, who added that KMFDM's guitar-heavy sound inspired Ministry's own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} critical acclaim from music critics, with many citing it as {{a highlight of}} the album. Paul Lester from BBC felt that the song was [...] "generic machine RnB". Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with [...] "Monster" [...] are a [...] "delightfully dirty retro workout ..... to make for one surprisingly effective pop cocktail." [...] Scott Plagenhoef from Pitchfork Media felt that Gaga had morphed into Madonna on the song. Nick Levine from Digital Spy commented that [...] "'Dance in the Dark' {{is the sort of}} song that, well, makes you want to dance with <b>your</b> <b>top</b> off in a grotty German bondage basement." [...] Edna Gunderson from USA Today called the song [...] "campy".|$|E

500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't Blow <b>Your</b> <b>Top</b> was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was {{the exception rather than the}} rule. Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E
500|$|Former KMFDM member Raymond Watts, {{last seen}} {{contributing}} vocals, programming, and production to 1988's Don't Blow <b>Your</b> <b>Top</b> before starting his own band, Pig, called Konietzko {{and asked if}} he would be interested in working on a small musical collaboration. [...] Konietzko agreed, and Watts flew to Seattle, where the pair, along with Schulz, worked on an EP entitled Sin Sex & Salvation. [...] Konietzko said of the trio's working together, [...] "It was the breath of fresh air I had been hoping and waiting for. [...] This short project took my mind off the problems with the KMFDM album and gave me a welcome change of perspective." [...] Watts then stayed on with the group to begin work on Nihil, which featured a core group of Konietzko, Schulz, Watts, and Esch, along with some input from steel guitar specialist Durante and drummer Bill Rieflin.|$|E
500|$|Metallica's Lars Ulrich, who, {{along with}} bandmate James Hetfield {{inducted}} Black Sabbath into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006, said [...] "Black Sabbath is {{and always will}} be synonymous with heavy metal", while Hetfield said [...] "Sabbath got me started on all that evil-sounding shit, and it's stuck with me. Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are <b>your</b> <b>top</b> five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E

500|$|Editor Rob Crossley {{said that}} for the first time, Rockstar created an [...] "utterly beautiful" [...] open world.

They wrote of the story's absurd drama and the open world's vastness, and did not [...] "regret a single second" [...] spent playing the game. In November, Edge named it the fifth best game of its generation and commented that [...] "no other game studio is even daring to attempt an open world game in its tradition because there is simply no possibility of measuring up to [...] standards." [...] In 2015, the publication rated it the second greatest video game of all time. The game ranked high on several best game lists determined by the public; it featured eighth on Empires [...] "100 Greatest Video Games Of All Time" [...] list, and fifth on Good Games [...] "Top 100 Games" [...] list, as voted by the magazine and programme's respective audiences.
