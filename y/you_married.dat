500|$|In {{the fifth}} episode, the anti-German {{sentiment}} in Britain {{during the war}} is repeatedly referenced. General Melchett orders Blackadder {{to find out what}} is behind the leak in top-secret battle plans and immediately, though erroneously, pins it on a [...] "German spy" [...] (who is later discovered to be inadvertently one of their own). Blackadder takes the chance to [...] "interrogate" [...] Captain Darling, who vehemently denies being a spy and says that he is [...] "as British as Queen Victoria", to which Blackadder sarcastically replies [...] "So your father is German, you're half German and <b>you</b> <b>married</b> a German?". Blackadder's retort references the fact that Victoria {{was a member of the}} House of Hanover and that her husband was a prince from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1917, Victoria's grandson King George V changed the royal house name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor in an effort to appease British nationalist feelings.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Leslie {{successfully}} relaunches the Pawnee harvest festival, {{she struggles}} {{to find any}} new ideas for future parks project. She becomes so stressed that Ron, in the episode [...] "Camping," [...] locks her {{in a room and}} refuses to let her out until she gets some sleep. She awakens the next day refreshed and full of ideas. Ron attends Andy and April's wedding in [...] "Andy and April's Fancy Party," [...] where he has the first dance with April. When Leslie grows concerned they are rushing into their marriage, Ron insists it is not her place to say what works for them, and offers the advice: [...] "Leslie I got married twice, both times I was a lot older than those two and both marriages ended in divorce...and a burning effigy. Who's to say what works? You find somebody you like, and you roll the dice, its all anyone can do." [...] At which point Leslie Knope replies [...] "Wait, weren't <b>you</b> <b>married</b> 3 times?" [...] To which Ron replies [...] "My God you're right. I get to burn another effigy." [...] In [...] "Eagleton," [...] Leslie discovers Ron's birthday, which he previously kept secret, and he fearfully suspects Leslie is planning an extravagant party for him. However, her surprise party for Ron is instead a quiet, private one more appropriate for Ron's personality: an evening alone with a steak, scotch, and copies of his favorite movies.|$|E
