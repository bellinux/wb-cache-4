Once, {{when he and}} Montefiore started talking at the same time, Scott carried on speaking with the amiable excuse : 'You can remember what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> longer than I can'.|$|E
500|$|Released in {{the wake}} of his passing, the song became synonymous with the myth of Hank Williams as a haunted, lonely figure who {{expressed}} pain with an authenticity that became the standard for country music. [...] The name of the song was used as the title of Hank Williams' 1964 biopic. [...] "Your Cheatin' Heart", as well as other songs by Williams were performed on the movie, with George Hamilton dubbing the soundtrack album recorded by Williams' son, Hank Williams, Jr. [...] In the 2003 documentary series Lost Highway, country music historian Ronnie Pugh comments, [...] "It's Hank's anthem, it's his musical last will and testament. [...] It's searing, it's powerful, it's gripping. [...] If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this is his last and best work, I wouldn't argue with that." [...] AllMusic described the track as the [...] "signature song" [...] of Hank Williams, and an [...] "unofficial anthem" [...] of country music. Rolling Stone called it [...] "one of the greatest country standards of all time", ranking it at number 217 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song ranked at number 5 in Country Music Television's 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music in 2003, ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{painting}} was {{an end in}} itself it would enter into the category of the minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a language—and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture—the End, it is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916) ...|$|E

We had all pews full as many Glendale Church of Christ members came {{to support}} both John Dale and our Revival. His topic was [...] "Jubilee--What We Can Do Here in Murray/Calloway County?" [...] Rev. Dole [...] commented, [...] "I {{appreciate}} this opportunity. Ray had told me, 'Just come, {{do whatever you}} want to do, say whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I trust you. You are not on trial.' I appreciate that. You are very warm and welcoming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charlie Rose interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 {{soon after}} the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The {{highlights}} are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, [...] "What then is central to what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about race?" [...] Butler's response was, [...] "Do I {{want to say something}} central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" [...] This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the two}} quotes {{appearing}} on the Stone of Hope and attributed to King, [...] "I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness", is a paraphrased version of King's actual words, which were: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And {{all of the other}} shallow things will not matter." [...] The Washington Posts Rachel Manteuffel noticed the change and publicized it in an August 25, 2011 column, arguing that the revised quote misrepresented both King himself and the meaning of the 1968 sermon from which it was taken, in which King imagined the sort of eulogy he might receive.|$|E

[...] by stating: [...] "I had a chance to make something beautiful with this film and I don't want to give in to the gossip". She also said, [...] "I know what went on. We had an amazing experience making the movie. I don't want to tarnish it by entering into nastiness .... I'm really proud of everyone's work on the movie and of my experience. And I'll have that forever. So it's nice for me to always know about that, {{no matter what kind of}} nastiness or gossip is going around."

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the fourteen quotations on the Inscription Wall, {{each side of the}} Stone of Hope includes an additional statement attributed to King. The first, from the [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, is [...] "Out of the Mountain of Despair, a Stone of Hope"—the quotation that serves {{as the basis for the}} monument's design. The words on the other side of the stone used to read, [...] "I Was a Drum Major for Justice, Peace, and Righteousness", which is a paraphrased version of a longer quote by King: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter." [...] The memorial's use of the paraphrased version of the quote was criticized, and was removed in August 2013.|$|E
