I keep six indoors, and if someone rings about an infestation and asks us to go ratting, they will know and are out of the door in a millisecond. If <b>you</b> <b>train</b> them, they'll retrieve. They'll do anything to please you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cole's game {{incorporates}} an attacking {{approach to}} his play, which supports his teams' forward play. As a youth, he [...] "always liked scoring goals and attacking", but grew {{to love the}} role of defending, as being a left-back was the only opportunity of breaking into the seniors. Prior to his inclusion in the Arsenal first team, Cole studied the conduct of fellow defender Nigel Winterburn to improve his play; Winterburn concurrently offered pointers to improve his positioning. He modelled his game on Brazilian Roberto Carlos: [...] "He's got natural talent, but I think if <b>you</b> <b>train</b> hard enough you can be nearly as good as that." ...|$|E

"You {{know as well}} as I do, Hugh, {{how this}} thing is being manipulated," [...] he {{declared}} at Tom's one Sunday evening; [...] "there was nothing the matter with the Ribblevale Steel Company--it was as right as rain before Leonard Dickinson and Grierson and Scherer and that crowd <b>you</b> <b>train</b> with began to talk it down at the Club. Oh, they're very compassionate. I've heard 'em. Dickinson, privately, doesn't think much of Ribblevale paper, and Pugh" [...] (the president of the Ribblevale) [...] "seems worried and looks badly.

Do not be so foolish, my love--what I ask is better than you can desire for your boy; for the house of my father, the Duke de la Tremouille, was the most famous school of chivalry in France; nor have I degenerated from him, or suffered any relaxation in that noble discipline which trained young gentlemen to do honour to their race.

5000|$|According to Haggerty, his dual {{profession}} {{of being a}} character actor and dog trainer caused some confusion among his dog school clients and his friends in the film industry. When he would show up on a film set with or without dogs to train and act with {{them in front of}} the camera, people and fellow actors would recognize him and would say to him: [...] "Oh, I didn't know you were an actor. I thought <b>you</b> <b>trained</b> dogs". At his dog training school, clients would recognize him from his film and TV commercial appearances and say to him: [...] "Oh, I didn't know <b>you</b> <b>trained</b> dogs. I thought you were an actor." [...] Since he was known as 'Captain Haggerty' at his dog school, and then known as Arthur Haggerty on film sets, he decided to legally change his name to Captain Haggerty in order to combine both of his professions so that people would know who he really was on and off camera.|$|R

To look at your face one would have inferred that carrying the weight of your body up a rope hand over hand was a very commonplace accomplishment--as easy as rolling off a log. And you needn't tell me, Miss Lackland, that you didn't make faces {{the first time you}} tried to climb a rope. But, like any circus athlete, <b>you</b> <b>trained</b> yourself out of the face-making period. <b>You</b> <b>trained</b> your face to hide your feelings, to hide the exhausting effort your muscles were making. It was, to quote Mr. Tudor, a subtler exhibition of physical prowess. And that is all our English reserve is--a mere matter of training. Certainly we are proud inside of the things we do and have done, proud as Lucifer--yes, and prouder. But we have grown up, and no longer talk about such things." ...|$|R

Increase or diminish the pains and penalties? My nephew, Philip's boy, Philip Christian, was explaining to me the other day that if you boil water in an open bowl it just boils away, and that if you boil it in a corked bottle it bangs everything to pieces, and you have, he says, 'to look out.' But I feel that's a bad image. Boiling-water isn't frantically jealous, and men and women are. But still suppose, suppose you trained people not to make such an awful fuss about things.
