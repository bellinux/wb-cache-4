He intensively studied the technique of Usain Bolt to improve his own times, seeing Bolt as the new generation's Maurice Greene. Though he was still banned from Euromeetings-organised events, he set a new personal best of 6.52s in the 60m at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix, then became the UK Indoor Champion, equalling Mike Rodgers' world leading time of 6.51s. At the 2009 European Indoor Championships he broke Ronald Pognon's European 60m record with a 6.42s run in the semi-finals, then {{won the gold medal}} with a time of 6.46s in the final. British head coach van Commenee stated that Chambers had undergone vigorous testing and that his performance sent [...] "a message that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> and break European records in the proper way." ...|$|E

500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003. Two goals {{in the space of}} three minutes, scored by Svensson and Tessem was enough to take the team into the quarter-finals. Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam was pleased with the win and said {{following}} the match: [...] "When you get to this stage in the competition you have to believe <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> it." [...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to go inside the goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E

2500|$|FIFA President Sepp Blatter {{took the}} unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the {{decisions}} that went against them, saying: [...] "Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico.

[...] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: [...] "We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting." [...] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.|$|E

Judges, Ian Dickson and Mark Holden, were impressed by Gauci's latter performance, with Dickson commenting [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>win</b> this competition". Fellow judge, Marcia Hines, warned that such a comment had been [...] "the kiss of death" [...] for contestants in the past. Gauci advanced to the next round, and continued to impress the judges, resulting in her selection in the top 24. Her performance of [...] "Hurt" [...] by Christina Aguilera did not gain enough public votes to proceed to the top 12. However, she was selected by the judges to perform in the wildcard, an episode from which four contestants would be chosen to complete the top12.
