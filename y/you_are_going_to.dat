Colorado {{needs to}} be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it can usually {{be turned into a}} song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end.|$|E

Porrello felt uncomfortable approaching Hensleigh, but did so anyway. Porrello said to him: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> kill a cop", it is [...] "going to change {{the tone of the}} story".

500|$|At {{the height}} of Akhmatova's fame, in 1918, she {{divorced}} her husband and that same year, though many of her friends considered it a mistake, Akhmatova married prominent Assyriologist and poet Vladimir Shilejko. She later said “I felt so filthy. I {{thought it would be}} like a cleansing, like going to a convent, knowing <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lose your freedom.” [...] She began affairs with [...] theatre director Mikhail Zimmerman and composer Arthur Lourié, who set many of her poems to music.|$|E
500|$|The song {{contains}} a [...] "rolling" [...] synth bassline and [...] "truncated" [...] percussion, {{that according to}} Zuel, comes across as both [...] "alluring and ever-so-slightly sinister". It contains [...] "slow breaks", that according to Jamil Ahmad of musicOMH, [...] "wrap this record round you like walking into an exclusive club with a million dollar sound system – you know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have one of those}} nights".

On the day of departure he received a note from a client, which read [...] "You tell me <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Germany. Don't go, we shall be at war within forty-eight hours". Hastings heeded this warning, and remained in England – war was declared between Britain and Germany less than two days later. Hastings himself volunteered to serve in the armed forces, but was rejected as medically unfit.|$|E

He boarded with a host family and worked in a wool store to pay his expenses. But his initiation into Guthrie's training program was difficult.

500|$|Waller {{earned the}} {{personal}} admiration of Admiral Cunningham, who {{described him as}} [...] "one of the finest types of Australian naval officers... greatly loved and admired by everyone". On the occasion of a visit to Alexandria by Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies, Cunningham escorted him to Stuart and declared: [...] "And now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> meet {{one of the greatest}} captains who ever sailed the seas—his name is Waller".

These were both men made by Fate for those ever-recurring Saint Crispin's Days of human affairs".|$|E
