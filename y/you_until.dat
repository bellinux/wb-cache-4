2500|$|Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a {{synchronizer}} {{to measure}} young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. [...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was {{until they got}} in the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and was knocked out in the third round, said: [...] "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But {{in a little while}} I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me.

He was also the leader of the Squadrone Volante, the free thinking [...] "Flying Squad" [...] movement within the Catholic Church. Christina and Azzolino were so close that the pope asked him to shorten his visits to her palace; but they remained lifelong friends. In a letter on 26 January 1676 to Azzolino Christina writes (in French) that she would never offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offense, but this [...] "does not prevent me from loving <b>you</b> <b>until</b> death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave."
