500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E

500|$|Fuller was {{an early}} proponent of {{feminism}} and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical [...] "feminine" [...] roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> what office women should fill, I reply—any... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women {{to be careful about}} marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, [...] "I wish woman to live, first for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: [...] "There is no wholly masculine man... no purely feminine" [...] but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the Minerva) and the [...] "lyrical" [...] or [...] "Femality" [...] side (the Muse). She admired the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, who believed men and women shared [...] "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as Charles Fourier, who placed [...] "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including [...] "Mrs. Sigourney" [...] and [...] "Mrs. Stowe", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as [...] "Margaret".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{initially}} mixed {{reception at}} the time, Borneo has undergone significant critical reappraisal in later years, and is now {{considered one of the}} best seasons of the entire series. Host Jeff Probst consistently ranks it as his favorite, equating it to a [...] "first girlfriend." [...] Entertainment Weekly columnist Dalton Ross ranks Borneo as tied for first with , saying [...] "...Borneo now seems dated and tame by comparison, but it's the biggest game changer in the past 20 years of television...If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> which is the most important season, well, obviously it's Borneo." [...] Borneo is also ranked as the greatest season of the series by Examiner.com and Zap2it, and is ranked second behind [...] by The Wire. Survivor fan site [...] "Survivor Oz" [...] has consistently ranked Borneo in the top 10 in every one of its annual polls ranking all seasons of the series; it was 5th in 2012, 6th in 2013, and 8th in 2014. Another prominent Survivor fan site, [...] "The Purple Rock Podcast," [...] ranked Borneo as the 10th best season in 2015. Fifteen years later, in the CBS Watch official issue commemorating the 15th anniversary and 30th season of Survivor, Borneo was ranked as the 7th-greatest season of the series by a viewer poll. In another poll in the same magazine, Hatch's win {{at the end of the}} season was voted by viewers as the #5 most memorable moment in the series. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club noted that the 5th episode, [...] "Pulling Your Own Weight", was one of the season's most influential segments. In this episode, the Tagi alliance led by Hatch secretly worked together to vote Dirk off the island, surprising many of the remaining contestants who were shocked to discover there was an alliance. Murray noted that while this sentiment towards alliances at the time seemed controversial and against the spirit of the show, it formed the basis for most future Survivor series and reality television in general, and highlighted the lengths that players on reality television shows would go to form such collusions while deceiving others as to ultimately win the game.|$|E

500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E
