But to wish <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> morning, in {{the pretty}} {{blue and white}} room where I had the {{pleasure}} to sit and read with you The Hermit, a poem which is such a favourite with me that I have read it twice this summer. Oh! What a blessing to keep good company! Very likely I {{should not have been}} acquainted with either poet or poem was it not for you.|$|E

Gilbert said, [...] "I cannot give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason for our... piece being laid in Japan.

500|$|A devout Northern Baptist, Rockefeller {{would read}} the Bible daily, attend prayer {{meetings}} {{twice a week}} and even led his own Bible study with his wife. Burton Folsom Jr. has noted, he sometimes gave {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to Christian groups, while, at the same time, he was trying to borrow over a million dollar to expand his business. His philosophy of giving was founded upon biblical principles. He truly believed in the biblical principle found in Luke 6:38, [...] "Give, and it will be given to <b>you.</b> <b>A</b> <b>good</b> measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|In October 2010, Jackman {{confirmed}} that Aronofsky would direct the film. Jackman commented that with Aronofsky directing, Wolverine 2 {{will not be}} [...] "usual" [...] stating, [...] "This is, hopefully for me, {{going to be out}} of the box. It's going to be the best one, I hope... Well, I would say that, but I really do feel that, and I feel this is going to be very different. This is Wolverine. This is not Popeye. He's kind of dark... But, you know, this is a change of pace. Chris McQuarrie, who wrote The Usual Suspects, has written the script, so that'll give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> clue. [...] going to make it fantastic. There's going to be some meat on the bones. There will be something to think about as you leave the theater, for sure". The film was scheduled to begin principal photography in March 2011 in New York City before the production moves to Japan for the bulk of shooting.|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis had in mind when he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{story was}} dramatised in more-or-less this {{form in the}} 1999 film Topsy-Turvy. However, even though the 1885–87 Japanese {{exhibition}} in Knightsbridge had not opened when Gilbert conceived of The Mikado, European trade with Japan had increased in recent decades, and an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s. This made the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert told a journalist, [...] "I cannot give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> reason for our ... piece being laid in Japan. It ... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think {{that the idea of}} a chief magistrate, who is ... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1940, British writer George Orwell {{reviewed}} a then-recently published uncensored {{translation of}} Mein Kampf for The New English Weekly. Orwell {{suggested that the}} force of Hitler's personality shone through the often [...] "clumsy" [...] writing, capturing the magnetic allure of Hitler for many Germans. In essence, Orwell notes, Hitler offers only visions of endless struggle and conflict {{in the creation of}} [...] "a horrible brainless empire" [...] that [...] "stretch to Afghanistan or thereabouts". He wrote, [...] "Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people 'I offer <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time,' Hitler has said to them, 'I offer you struggle, danger, and death,' and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet." [...] Orwell's review was written {{in the aftermath of the}} 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, when Hitler made peace with Russia after more than a decade of vitriolic rhetoric and threats between the two nations; with the pact in place, Orwell believed, England was now facing a risk of Nazi attack and the UK must not underestimate the appeal of Hitler's ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now you have this character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
