5|$|A year later, the Red Sox {{entered the}} final {{series of the}} season at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> needing only one win over the Yankees {{to advance to the}} World Series. The Red Sox found {{themselves}} up by one game with two games left against the Yankees at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium.</b> The Sox lost 5–3 {{on the last day of}} the season after falling 5–4 the previous day, resulting in the Yankees winning their 16th American League pennant. The Yankees went on to defeat the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1949 World Series for their 12th World Championship.|$|E

5|$|A year later, David Cone, {{one of the}} {{key players}} in the then-most recent Yankee dynasty, started for the Red Sox against the Yankees at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> to the sound of a {{standing}} ovation despite playing for the arch-rival Red Sox. It marked Cone's first return to <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> since leaving the team. Cone would later take part in another notable game later that year when he went up against newly acquired Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina. Mussina had come within one strike of pitching a perfect game against the Red Sox at Fenway Park. Carl Everett's 9th-inning two-out, two-strike single was the only baserunner allowed by Mussina in a 1–0 Yankee win. Coincidentally, David Cone was the last Yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game, in 1999.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 season {{opened up}} at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium.</b> The Yankees {{defeated}} the Red Sox, which was PA announcer Bob Sheppard first game. Sheppard {{would go on}} to serve PA duties at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> for another 56 years. On September 28 of that year, Yankees pitcher Allie Reynolds pitched a no-hitter against the Red Sox. A year later, Red Sox outfielder Jimmy Piersall and Yankees second baseman Billy Martin exchanged insults before a game in Boston, and ended up fighting in the tunnel under the stands. The fight was eventually broken up by Yankees coaches Bill Dickey and Oscar Melillo, and Boston starting pitcher Ellis Kinder. Piersall changed out of his bloody shirt and promptly fought with teammate Maury McDermott. The Red Sox won 5–2 with Piersall sitting the game out.|$|E

Over 48,000 fans came into <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> on October 9 {{to see if the}} Yankees could win their second World Series in {{franchise}} history. The game's pitching matchup was between Grover Cleveland Alexander and Bob Shawkey, both of whom had made appearances in previous games in the series. Shawkey had come in as relief in Games 2 and 3, while Alexander had pitched a complete game against the Yankees in the Cardinals' Game2 victory. In the 1926 season, Shawkey had made most of his pitching appearances in relief, and had been an occasional starter on the Yankees rotation. He started 10 of his 29 total pitching appearances and posted an 8–7 record with a 3.62 earned run average.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{lost the}} World Series in , while the Red Sox loss came in 1986. Both times, the teams lost after being up 2–0 in their {{respective}} World Series, and both losses happened in New York (The Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series at Shea Stadium). For the Yankees, the loss in 1981 {{marked the beginning of}} the team's demise and downfall in the 1980s and early 1990s. Despite the lack of championships, the rivalry between the teams did have some memorable highlights. Yankee left-hander Dave Righetti threw a no-hitter against the Red Sox at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium.</b> One of the game's greatest hitters, Wade Boggs, struck out to end the game. This was the first no-hitter thrown by a left-hander at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> and the first no-hitter by a Yankee since Don Larsen's perfect game against Subway Series rival Brooklyn Dodgers in Game five of the 1956 World Series and the first regular no-hitter by a Yankee since 1951.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{returned}} to the playoffs the following season, as the wild card. They lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 ALCS; which included an 8-0 shutout in <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> by former Phillie ace Cliff Lee; it was Lee's seventh straight postseason win which included three victories against the Yankees (two as a Phillie in the 2009 World Series, and in 2010 during the ALCS).|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} played a three-game interleague series at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> in May 2009, with the Phillies winning {{two of the}} three games.

5|$|Wismer {{sought a}} place for his team to play, but was only able to secure the {{decrepit}} Polo Grounds, which had been without a major tenant since {{the departure of the}} New York Giants baseball team in 1957.

5|$|Years {{later in}} 1967, Red Sox pitcher Billy Rohr came {{within a single}} strike of a no-hitter at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium.</b> Elston Howard hit a two-out, two-strike single in the ninth to break the no-hit bid. Rohr {{completed}} the one-hitter, but ultimately finished his career with only two wins, both coming against the Yankees. Later that year, Red Sox third baseman Joe Foy hit a grand slam during {{the first game of}} a two-game series. In the second game, Yankee pitcher Thad Tillotson threw two brushback pitches at Foy before beaning him in the batting helmet. In the next inning, Red Sox pitcher Jim Lonborg beaned Tillotson. Both pitchers yelled at each other, and then a brawl ensued. During the fight, Red Sox outfielder Reggie Smith picked up and body-slammed Tillotson to the ground. Just two months later, both teams were involved in the longest game ever played (by innings) at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium.</b> New York recorded a 20-inning, 4–3 victory over Boston. Earlier that year on August 3, the Yankees traded Howard, the first African-American player in franchise history, to the Red Sox to help bolster their team during the pennant race. When Howard returned to <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> in a Red Sox uniform, the Yankee fans gave him a standing ovation. Boston would be led by Hall of Famer Carl Yastrzemski's historic season winning the batting triple crown, leading the Red Sox to the pennant in what was a dream year for the Sox. Howard's contribution would be instrumental in the 1967 World Series, but he and Yastrzemski would lose to Bob Gibson and the St. Louis Cardinals four games to three.|$|E
5|$|As {{the complex}} was being built, and their current home at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> was being renovated, {{they would be}} without a home for three years. Their final full season at <b>Yankee</b> <b>Stadium</b> was 1972. After playing their first two games there in 1973, the Giants played {{the rest of their}} home games in 1973, as well as all of their home games in 1974, at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut. This was done out of a desire to have their own home field, as opposed to having to share Shea Stadium with the Jets. However, between access problems, {{neighborhood}} issues, the fact that the Yale Bowl was not ideally suited for pro football (the stadium did not have lights, nor does it have lights today), the age of the stadium (it was built in 1914) and the lack of modern amenities, the Giants reconsidered their decision and ultimately agreed to share Shea Stadium with the Jets for the 1975 season. The Giants left Yale Bowl after losing all seven home games played at Yale in the 1974 season and compiling a home record of 1–11 over that two-year stretch.|$|E

5000|$|In Game 5, Larsen, {{working in}} an unusual [...] "no-windup" [...] style, pitched the only postseason perfect game, and the only postseason no-hitter until 2010.
