6000|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I have {{to thank}} you this time for a very good letter, and will {{announce}} for the future, though I cannot now begin to put in practice, good intentions for our correspondence. I will try {{to return to the}} old system and write from time to time during the month; but truly you did not much encourage me to continue! However, that is all by- past. I do not know that there is much in your letter that calls for answer. <b>Your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> ST. IVES were practically answered in my last; so were your wails about the edition, AMATEUR EMIGRANT, etc. By {{the end of the year}} ST. I. will be practically finished, whatever it be worth, and that I know not. When shall I receive proofs of the MAGNUM OPUS? or shall I receive them at all? ...|$|E

It is now a quarter to ten--late enough, by Jingo! We'll get into one of those confounded taxis, and drive to Doctor Newington's. I'll see him. You shall stay in the cab; and if I can get his permission, we'll go and have a talk with old Rad--or rather I'll talk first and you shall pretend that our joint visit is only a coincidence. As a matter of fact he knew all about the murder before he got ill, and he won't think it at all unnatural that I have obtained special medical permission to question him myself on the subject. Then you must work in <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Luke as best you can afterward. Is that agreed now?" ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{wanted to}} respond to <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>about</b> replica plating and who really invented it.

I do know that Esther in all likelihood was responsible for getting the technique to actually work. She emphasized to me how important it was to use a particular kind of Italian velvet (or was it velveteen actually), so in my own mind I believe she was the key person in taking the idea to actual practice.|$|R

Their beliefs are centered on two basic propositions: (1) God is good. (2) God is available; in fact, God is in you. The pamphlet {{goes on to say}} that:About a year after the Fillmores started the magazine Modern Thought, they had the inspiration that if God is what they thought - the principle of love and intelligence, the source of all good - God is wherever needed. It was not necessary for people {{to be in the same}} room with them in order for them to unite in thought and prayer.|$|E

50|$|With all due respect, {{the fact}} is, we had four dead Americans!

It is our job to figure out what {{happened}} and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, Senator. Now, honestly, I will do my best to answer <b>your</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> this, but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information. The Community has a process, I understand, going with the other committees to explain how these talking points came out. But you know, to be clear, it is, from my perspective, less important today looking backwards as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice, and then maybe we’ll figure out what was going on in the meantime.|$|E

According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies."

[...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz.

5000|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{released}} in 2000 and offered a way to retrieve the items without the need to acquire Banjo-Kazooie. The player would attain them by destroying in-game Banjo-Kazooie Game Paks. These eggs could then be brought to Heggy the hen to hatch. There were three eggs in total (i.e. the pink, yellow, and blue eggs), {{one of which was}} already with the hen, but which Kazooie had to hatch herself. The ice key, however, was to be used to obtain an item locked in an ice vault, containing a Mega Glowbo, which could turn Kazooie into a dragon.
