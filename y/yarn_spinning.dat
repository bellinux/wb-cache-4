25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer <b>yarn</b> <b>spinning.</b> It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a lifter plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E

[...] Musicians and dancers also entertain visitors. [...] Re-enactors demonstrate pottery, <b>yarn</b> <b>spinning,</b> and other medieval craft. [...] These enthusiasts come from foreign countries, such as Belarus and Hungary. [...] The German Mittelalter rock band Schelmish has performed several times at the festival. [...] Short bouts of simulated duels are performed in the camp and a jousting tournament was also featured. [...] The festival has attracted visitors from as far as New Zealand and the west coast of the United States; the local tabloid quoted an estimate of 25,000visitors to the festival in 2003.|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{range of}} {{carefully}} selected wool and cashmere yarns {{as well as their}} blends were used {{to examine the effects of}} fiber curvature and blend ratio on yarn hairiness. The results indicate that <b>yarns</b> <b>spun</b> from wool fibers with a higher curvature have lower yarn hairiness than <b>yarns</b> <b>spun</b> from similar wool of a lower curvature. For blend yarns made from wool and cashmere of similar diameter, yarn hairiness increases with the increase in the cashmere content in the yarn. This is probably due to the presence of increased proportion of the shorter cashmere fibers in the surface regions of the yarn, leading to increased yarn hairiness. A modified hairiness composition model is used to explain these results and the likely origin of leading and trailing hairs. This model highlights the importance of yarn surface composition on yarn hairiness. <br /...|$|R

5000|$|Spun yarn {{is made by}} {{twisting}} staple fibres {{together to}} make a cohesive thread, or [...] "single." [...] Twisting fibres into yarn in the process called spinning can be dated back to the Upper Paleolithic, and <b>yarn</b> <b>spinning</b> was one of the very first processes to be industrialized. Spun yarns may contain a single type of fibre, or be a blend of various types. Combining synthetic fibres (which can have high strength, lustre, and fire retardant qualities) with natural fibres (which have good water absorbency and skin comforting qualities) is very common. The most widely used blends are cotton-polyester and wool-acrylic fibre blends. Blends of different natural fibres are common too, especially with more expensive fibres such as alpaca, angora and cashmere.|$|E
