5|$|A dandy, Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești himself led {{a life of}} luxury, {{marked by}} excess, and had by then become a drug addict. He was a proud {{homosexual}} (or bisexual), which did not prevent him from keeping as his concubine a <b>younger</b> <b>woman,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} Domnica ("Little Lady") or Mica ("Little One"). Born Alexandra Colanoski, she was born in 1894 to Romanian Poles from Bessarabia, and, according to memoirist Constantin Beldie, had previously been a prostitute at a nightclub.|$|E

Oscar thinks that Robert may be seeing another man besides him and convinces Angela that they should spy on Robert at his yoga class. They hide outside of the class and watch as Robert spends time with a <b>younger</b> <b>woman</b> who later {{turns out to have}} a boyfriend. Oscar then notices Robert spending most of the yoga practice with a young man, which he finds suspicious. After the class, Robert phones Oscar, and his phone goes off. Oscar panics and silences the phone, and Angela immediately realizes why.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the <b>younger</b> <b>woman</b> lacks the experience to properly judge when it is appropriate to disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E

Ryder then played a nun of a secret society loosely connected to the Roman Catholic Church and determined to prevent Armageddon in Lost Souls (2000), which was a commercial failure. Ryder refused to do commercial promotion for the film. Later in 2000, {{she was one of}} several celebrities who made small cameo appearances in Zoolander (released in 2001).

5|$|Kubrick {{was born}} in the Lying-In Hospital at 307 Second Avenue in Manhattan, New York City, to a Jewish family. He was the first of two {{children}} of Jacob Leonard Kubrick (May 21, 1902– October 19, 1985), known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (née Perveler; October 28, 1903– April 23, 1985), known as Gert. His sister, Barbara Mary Kubrick, {{was born in}} May 1934. Jack Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish Jewish, Austrian Jewish, and Romanian Jewish origin, was a doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick's mother, the child of Austrian Jewish immigrants. Kubrick's great-grandfather, Hersh Kubrick (also spelled Kubrik or Kubrike), arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship on December 27, 1899, at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children, one of whom was Stanley's grandfather Elias, {{to start a new life}} with a <b>younger</b> <b>woman.</b> Elias Kubrick followed in 1902. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in the Bronx. Although his parents had been married in a Jewish ceremony, Kubrick did not have a religious upbringing, and would later profess an atheistic view of the universe. By the district standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy, his father earning a good income as a physician.|$|E
5|$|Pinfold is very {{protective}} of his privacy, but uncharacteristically agrees {{to be interviewed}} on BBC radio. The main inquisitor is a man named Angel, whose voice and manner disconcert Pinfold, who believes he detects a veiled malicious intent. In the weeks that follow, Pinfold broods on the incident. He finds his memory beginning to play tricks on him. The encroaching winter depresses him further; he decides to escape by taking a cruise, and secures passage on the SS Caliban, bound for Ceylon. As the voyage proceeds, Pinfold finds that he hears sounds and conversations {{from other parts of}} the ship which he believes are somehow being transmitted into his cabin. Amid an increasingly bizarre series of overheard incidents, he hears remarks which become progressively more insulting, and then directly threatening towards himself. The main tormentors are a man and a woman, whose vicious words are balanced by those of an affectionate <b>younger</b> <b>woman,</b> Margaret. He is convinced that the man is the BBC interviewer Angel, using his technical knowledge to broadcast the voices. Pinfold spends sleepless nights, awaiting a threatened beating, a kidnapping attempt and a seductive visit from Margaret.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{the determinants of}} institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> in Nepal. DESIGN: Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data sets 2011 were analysed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using a subset of 1662 ever-married <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (aged 15 - 24 years). OUTCOME MEASURE: Place of delivery. RESULTS: The rate of institutional delivery among <b>young</b> married <b>women</b> was 46 %, which {{is higher than the}} national average (35 %) among all women of reproductive age. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had more than four antenatal care (ANC) visits were {{three times more likely to}} deliver in a health institution compared with women who had no antenatal care visit (OR: 3. 05; 95 % CI: 2. 40 to 3. 87). The probability of delivering in an institution was 69 % higher among <b>young</b> urban <b>women</b> than among <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who lived in rural areas. <b>Young</b> <b>women</b> who had secondary or above secondary level education were 1. 63 times more likely to choose institutional delivery than <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who had no formal education (OR: 1. 626; 95 % CI: 1. 171 to 2. 258). Lower use of a health institution for delivery was also observed among poor <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Results showed that wealthy <b>young</b> <b>women</b> were 2. 12 times more likely to deliver their child in an institution compared with poor <b>young</b> <b>women</b> (OR: 2. 107; 95 % CI: 1. 53 to 2. 898). Other factors such as the age of the <b>young</b> <b>woman,</b> religion, ethnicity, and ecological zone were also associated with institutional delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal health programs should be designed to encourage <b>young</b> <b>women</b> to receive adequate ANC (at least four visits). Moreover, health programs should target poor, less educated, rural, <b>young</b> <b>women</b> who live in mountain regions, are of Janajati ethnicity and have at least one child as such women are less likely to choose institutional delivery in Nepal...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{discussions of}} young women's {{relationship}} to feminism rest on assumptions that position both <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism in particular ways. Feminism is constructed as irrelevant to <b>young</b> <b>women,</b> and/or <b>young</b> <b>women</b> are represented as antagonistic or apathetic towards feminism, {{at least in}} contemporary western societies. Such representations position <b>young</b> <b>women</b> and feminism as distinct and separate entities, each with their own internal cohesion, so that diversity between <b>young</b> <b>women</b> [...] and between feminisms [...] is overlooked. These assumptions comprise the discursive arena in which discussion of the possible meanings and relevance of feminism for <b>young</b> <b>women</b> takes place.
