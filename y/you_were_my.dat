500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> earth'".|$|E

Your mama has {{to feel this}} record, your daddy has to feel this record, {{everybody}} has to feel this record. That's what good writers do." [...] Of its appeal Garrett {{said that it would}} have the effect of [...] "Yeah!", and called the song an [...] "explosive record". Garrett went on to say, [...] "I definitely feel it's what Usher's been wanting to say. But at the same time, it's {{what a lot of people}} wanted to say, they just didn't know what to say." [...] Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News said that [...] "Usher pulls back the curtain, revealing that a rumored rift between him and his mother was very real", and the song could be heard as an [...] "postmortem" [...] on his marriage, through the lines, [...] "For you I gave my heart and turned my back against the world/ 'Cause <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> girl, girl, girl, I done damn near lost my mama, I done been through so much drama/ I done turned into the man I never thought I'd be/ I'm ready to sign them papers." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

2500|$|This mysteriousness {{attached}} with the supernatural not only captures {{the audience and}} Antony, but also, draws all other characters' focus. As a center of conversation when not present in the scene, Cleopatra is continually a central point, therefore demanding {{the control of the}} stage. As an object of sexual desire, she is attached to the Roman need to conquer. Her mix of sexual prowess with the political power is a threat to Roman politics. She retains her heavy involvement in the military aspect of her rule, especially when she asserts herself as [...] "the president of [...] kingdom will/ Appear there for a man." [...] Where the dominating power lies is up for interpretation, yet there are several mentions of the power exchange in their relationship in the text. Antony remarks on Cleopatra's power over him multiple times throughout the play, the most obvious being attached to sexual innuendo: [...] "You did know / How much <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> conqueror, and that / My sword, made weak by my affection, would / Obey it on all cause." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 20 December, T. V. Soong {{arrived in}} Xi'an, and Soong Mei-ling arrived two days later, {{in order to}} {{negotiate}} Chiang's release. At first, Chiang was opposed to negotiating with a CCP delegate, but withdrew his opposition {{when it became clear}} that his life and freedom were largely dependent on Communist goodwill towards him. On 24 December, Chiang received Zhou for a meeting, the first time that the two had seen each other since Zhou had left Whampoa over ten years earlier. Zhou began the conversation by saying: [...] "In the ten years since we have met, you seem to have aged very little." [...] Chiang nodded and said: [...] "Enlai, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> subordinate. You should do what I say." [...] Zhou replied that, if Chiang would halt the civil war and resist the Japanese instead, the Red Army would willingly accept Chiang's command. By the end of this meeting, Chiang promised to end the civil war, to resist the Japanese together, and to invite Zhou to Nanjing for further talks.|$|E
2500|$|Arghezi {{later wrote}} that his {{relationship}} with Urmuz was difficult, especially since the grefier panicked that the establishment would discover his other career: [...] "he feared that the Cassation Court would better detect him as Urmuz than under his own name". The memoirist refers to Demetrescu-Buzău's perfectionism and unease, enhanced in the week before publication: [...] "He would {{wake up in the}} middle of the night and would send a very urgent letter, asking me if the comma after a 'that' should be moved before. I found him wandering around my house at night, shy, restless, fainthearted or in a hopeful trance, that something of substance may or may not be found in his prose, that perhaps there's an error, asking me to publish it, and then again to destroy it; to publish it together with a eulogistic note, and then again to curse him. He bribed [...] to change phrases and words that I had to put back into place, as previous editorial interventions were for sure better than his." [...] The letters they exchanged show that the grefier was not enthusiastic about even seeing his texts and his pseudonym in print, to which Arghezi was replying: [...] "from among the few we'll be cooperating with, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>my</b> first choice".|$|E
2500|$|... "Everything to Me", the album's fourth {{track and}} {{official}} first single, reunited Monica with producer Missy Elliott {{and saw the}} pair basically reprising the formula of previous successes such as [...] "So Gone" [...] (2003) and [...] "A Dozen Roses (You Remind Me)" [...] (2006). A musical ode to all things good in life, written by singer Jazmine Sullivan, the retro ballad contains a prominent sample of the Deniece Williams' 1981 recording [...] "Silly." [...] Released to rave reviews among critics, who noted it the album's [...] "standout track — as solid as a brick house; great singing, great lyrics, great production, just a great all-around song," [...] "Everything to Me" [...] became the singer's most-successful release in years. Elliott also contributed [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Were</b> <b>My</b> Man", {{one of the few}} up tempo songs on Still Standing, which Monica described as the song, who was most out of her character. Originally titled [...] "Betcha", the track samples Evelyn [...] "Champagne" [...] King's 1982 record [...] "Betcha She Don't Love You", featuring heavy elements of 1980's music, and garnered a mixed response by critics, whose reviews of the song alternated between [...] "blemish," [...] "brainless," [...] and [...] "funky". [...] "Mirror", the sixth track produced by Jim Jonsin, was recorded late into the production of the album. A song about self-acceptance, Monica noted the composition one of her personal standouts on the album: [...] "Its basically about being able to look at yourself in the mirror and be completely happy with the person that you are," [...] she said. [...] "Having no shame or feeling pain again, and I am at that place in my life." ...|$|E
