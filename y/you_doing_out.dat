2500|$|Hope {{started by}} saying [...] "Why, Groucho Marx! (applause) Groucho, what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> {{here in the}} desert?" [...] Groucho retorted, [...] "Huh, desert, I've {{been sitting in the}} {{dressing}} room for forty minutes! Some desert alright..." [...] Groucho continued to ignore the script, and although Hope was a formidable ad-libber in his own right, he could not begin to keep up with Groucho, who lengthened the scene well beyond its allotted time slot with a veritable onslaught of improvised wisecracks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I go to Denver {{once in a}} while, and I saw St. Louis once; but I {{was only}} a yearling, and don't {{remember}} much about it. What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here, if it's a fair question?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that chair!' {{broke out}} Gertrude. 'O, Ethel, <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>out</b> of malice prepense make me vow {{it should be}} for Mrs. Thomas May.' ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR OLIVER. Why, man, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>out</b> of Bed with a Small Sword {{through your}} Body, and a Bullet lodg'd in your Thorax? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Blessed {{little bit}} of shell that found a {{temporary}} shelter in my arm!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "All the same, I feel just as <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Out</b> there, for all your graciousness, you were something sacred, something far away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{you on the}} street," [...] replied Britt, without {{change of}} expression, [...] "so I looked over the {{register}} {{to find out who}} you were. I'm mighty glad to meet up with you. I know you very well by reputation, and Weissmann is an old acquaintance of our family's. What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? Visiting the Lamberts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{your own}} mistress," [...] she {{interrupted}} suavely, [...] "but you see that's just what I'm not. And the key! why, it's just envy that's gnawing at the roots. I've never, {{never in my}} life seen anything so queer." [...] She suddenly raised her strange eyes on me. [...] "What were <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> there?" ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{soon the}} Rabbit noticed Alice, {{as she went}} hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, 'Why, Mary Ann, what ARE <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the {{direction}} it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.|$|E
6000|$|... "Straight, now, little sister. Own up. Don't you {{get more}} fun out of hearing Raymond Hitchcock sing than <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>out</b> {{of a bunch of}} fiddles and flutes {{fighting}} out a piece by Vaugner like they was Kilkenny cats? 'Fess up, now; don't {{you get more}} downright amusement?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Desmond grinned. [...] "Told {{her what}} you were going back for--and she didn't believe a word of it? As a matter of fact, you could hardly expect her to. Still, you needn't be unduly anxious. It wouldn't matter very much what <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>out</b> there. She might be horrified when she heard of it, but she wouldn't let you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Soon {{the rabbit}} noticed Alice, {{as she stood}} looking curiously about her, and at once said in a quick angry tone, [...] "why, Mary Ann! what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? Go home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch them here, as quick as you can run, do you hear?" [...] and Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once, without saying a word, in the {{direction}} which the rabbit had pointed out.|$|E
6000|$|... "They say {{you have}} become a {{publisher}} with an American partner, a sort of Harmsworth and Nelson and Times Book Club and Hooper and Jackson all rolled into one. That seems so extraordinary to me that for that alone I should have had to write to you. I {{want to know the}} truth of that. I never see any advertisement of Stratton & Co. or get any inkling of what it is you publish. Are you the power behind the respectable Murgatroyd and the honest Milvain? I know them both and neither has the slightest appearance of being animated by you. And equally perplexing is your being mixed up with an American like that man Gidding in Peace Conferences and Social Reform Congresses and so forth. It's so--Carnegieish. There I'm surer because I've seen your name in reports of meetings and I've read your last two papers in the Fortnightly. I can't imagine you of all people, with your touch of reserve, launching into movements and rubbing shoulders with faddists. What does it mean, Stephen? I had expected to find you coming back into English politics--speaking and writing on the lines of your old beginning, taking up that work you dropped--it's six years now ago. I've been accumulating disappointment for two years. Mr. Arthur, you see, on our side,"--this you will remember was in 1909--"still steers our devious party courses, and the Tariff Reformers have still to capture us. Weston Massinghay was comparing them the other night, at a dinner at the Clynes', to a crowded piratical galley trying to get alongside a good seaman in rough weather. He was very funny about Leo Maxse in the poop, white and shrieking with passion and the motion, and all the capitalists armed to the teeth and hiding snug in the hold until the grappling-irons were fixed.... Why haven't you come into the game? I'd hoped it if only for the sake of meeting you again. What are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> beyond there? ...|$|E

5000|$|Ormond was {{involved}} in a notable piece of sledging; when, in a Test match against Australia in 2001, Mark Waugh asked him, [...] "Mate, what are <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> <b>out</b> here? There's no way you're good enough to play for England." [...] Ormond replied [...] "Maybe not, but at least I'm the best player in my own family", a reference to Waugh's brother Steve, who was the captain of the Australian team.|$|E
6000|$|... "How <b>did</b> <b>you</b> make <b>out?</b> How're the boys! What {{became of}} Bill Smithers? Is Del Bishop still with Pierce? Did he sell my dogs? How did Sulphur Bottom show up? You're looking fine. What steamer <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come <b>out</b> on?" ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{they went}} away, Jesus {{began to speak}} to the crowds {{concerning}} John: [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> go <b>out</b> into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?

6000|$|No. I will not. This suits.... Don't {{come with}} me; [...] There's more for <b>you</b> to <b>do</b> <b>out</b> here as yet. [Cheerful shouts.] [...] A-ha! 'Tis THIS way I have wished to die! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll have to cook our own dinner," [...] remarked Dick. [...] "Tom, since <b>you</b> <b>did</b> us <b>out</b> of our meal at {{the hotel}} I reckon {{you are the one}} to fall in for this work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, young fellow, I don't {{care what}} <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>out</b> of office-hours, but I've seen those {{sketches}} of yours and they're on office-paper, and Mr. Goodworthy tells me you're slack. <b>You</b> won't <b>do</b> any {{good as a}} chartered accountant unless you look alive.

[...] he looked for the termination of his phrase, but could not find exactly what he wanted, so finished rather tamely, [...] "in which {{you have to look}} alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{shall be}} long," [...] murmured Ermine, a vivid colour {{flashing}} forth upon her cheek, and leading the question from herself.
