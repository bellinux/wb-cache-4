40|$|Transcription begins] Wednesday, 12 / 6 / 44 8 : 45 p. m. My dearest one— I {{really had}} an {{exhausting}} day today. The school {{is located at}} 2936 Mayfield, {{a few doors down}} from Superior Rd. on the so. side of the street. Enclosed you will find a letter sent out to pupils who formerly attended this school 2 ̆ 6 it gives you an idea of how we operate. Well, the house is filthy 2 ̆ 6 the tenants haven’t moved out as yet, so my housekeeper (colored woman) 2 ̆ 6 cook (white Slovak woman) 2 ̆ 6 myself [sic] decided to work around them. We have to sterilize everything. Why the basement has broken beer bottles, dirty rags 2 ̆ 6 papers—it’s disgusting. Then, I had a conference with Mrs. Miller about what staple foods to buy, a conference with Mr. Burchfield about the bookkeeping 2 ̆ 6 then I saw Miss Highley at the warehouse 2 ̆ 6 obtained some supplies. Luckily [sic] that I had a car—I just can’t see myself “lugging” stuff on the street car! Then, when I came home from 7 - 8 : 30, I filled out form blanks 2 ̆ 6 requisitions. Gosh, I was so exhausted that when Sanf called I couldn’t get off the bed to talk to him! Oh yes—at 5 p. m. today I dropped around to see your folks before going home. They didn’t seem to think my job was “much”—couldn’t see why I was tired, so I left hurriedly, before I’d [sic] explode. No matter what I told them—my job was a “cinch” 2 ̆ 6 I can assure you, it’s anything but that! Last night after I took my bath I had a funny experience. I felt myself fainting (I tried to overcome it 2 ̆ 6 couldn’t). After a few minutes I was able to pull myself into bed 2 ̆ 6 then, I remembered—after a loss of blood, don’t take a hot bath! Rec’d your letters (air mail) of 11 / 14 2 ̆ 6 11 / 23 2 ̆ 6 V-mails from 11 / 24 2 ̆ 6 11 ? 26. Funny how mail gets “screwed up!” Heard from Edelsberg today. Nothing new. Rec’d a very “touching” letter from Sister Helen. She, also, sent you a package. Now, darling, why in the world should I bother sending you packages when everyone else does? By the way, her letter “stank!” Do you receive the 3 -cent letters I send you containing clippings 2 ̆ 6 old letters I’ve rec’d from friends? Sanf does nothing much outside of his work to amount to any importance! Frankly, he is a “copy cat. ” I went to donate blood—now he thinks he’ll go. I really think he lacks “the go” outside of working for money that we have! Spoke to Amy tonite—plan to meet her Sunday 2 ̆ 6 also a teacher I worked with, Mrs. Swaim—we’ll go to [a] show and dinner! What’s Haygood’s wife’s address? I’ll drop her a line! <b>You</b> <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>thing</b> to thank B’nai B’rith for their package. Honey, your tired wife must sign off—she’s dead tired; but throughout her busy day you are uppermost in her heart 2 ̆ 6 mind. I love you— Edith [Transcription ends...|$|E
