60|$|Before sunrise I was out. Soon the jumping {{flight and}} cheery good-morning of a downy {{woodpecker}} {{led me to}} an old field with scattered evergreen clumps. There is no better time for a quiet peep at the birds than the morning after a snow-storm, and no better place than the evergreens.
