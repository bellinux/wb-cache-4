60|$|MISS GILPIN. Miss Carmody, may I {{speak to}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> please.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, I want {{to speak}} to <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Do come over.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is amusing himself. But, Ughtred, I came {{to talk to}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> They tell me {{that you}} are going back to the front directly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{a little}} wrath I hid my face from <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> but with {{everlasting}} kindness will I {{have mercy on}} thee, saith the Lord, thy Redeemer." ...|$|R
60|$|SHE. And do <b>you</b> think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> he'd stand it, {{like that}} half-baked clergyman in the play? He'd just kill you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless what?" [...] said Christie sharply. [...] "Jessie, <b>you</b> don't <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> mean to {{say that}} you could {{possibly}} conceive of anything else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laurence," [...] he said, {{taking hold}} of his countryman's arm with a decided grasp, [...] "I {{want to speak to}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> if you please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} I must {{ask you first}} of all before I stay with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Must I put it into words?" ...|$|E
60|$|Madame de Florac. My husband always {{likes that}} I should {{be present at}} his dinner. Pardon me, young people, that I have been away from <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Pellissier," [...] he said, [...] "I {{came here}} this {{afternoon}} hoping particularly to see <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> before <b>you</b> signed that contract." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{misunderstood}} me if <b>you</b> imagine <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I {{came here}} {{to ask you to}} make up the amount of your husband's defalcations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Effenden Pascha," [...] he said, [...] "will <b>you</b> wait <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>A</b> {{dispatch}} {{has arrived}} concerning which the King will {{desire to see}} you at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By all means," [...] Sir Edward affirmed. [...] "I cannot conceive, Inspector, {{what you}} have in your mind which could have led <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to suspect the contrary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir?" [...] said Mr. Bucket. [...] "Then {{you will}} be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> while I go and have half a word with him?" ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--I {{was unable}} to keep my {{appointment}} to meet <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two in passing through Casterbridge the other day. My plans were altered by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true. But {{when you}} found this letter of yours on your place at breakfast, did <b>you</b> seem <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> to see Madame Blumenthal sitting opposite?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is impossible, Herr Freudenberg," [...] Monsieur DÃ©cheles said, [...] "to {{misunderstand}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>moment.</b> Your hand is too {{clear and}} your methods too sagacious." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nonsense! You talk as if {{the whole}} thing weren't {{perfectly}} monstrous. Surely <b>you</b> don't <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> suppose that your brother-in-law won't be able to explain everything away? ...|$|R
60|$|HER HUSBAND. Nothing, except anxiety for my {{welfare and}} yours. [She steals a terrified look at Henry]. By, the way, Apjohn, I should like {{a word with}} you this evening, if Aurora can spare <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Lady Bracknell. Pray {{allow me}} to detain <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> This matter {{may prove to be}} one of vital {{importance}} to Lord Bracknell and myself. Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect, remotely connected with education? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And why not?' said Proserpine. 'I {{have no idea}} of ever leaving <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Why not for me {{as well as for the}} Fates and the Furies? Am I not Queen? I {{have no idea of}} such nonsense!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "I am selfish, indeed! I {{should not}} have kept <b>you</b> here <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>You</b> had better go and lie down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> please?" [...] she said. [...] "I {{am afraid}} I {{must have seemed}} ungracious. After all, I ought to be very {{grateful}} to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But do <b>you</b> think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I {{would permit}} you, or anyone else, {{to pull the}} left wing from a yellow butterfly?" [...] demanded the Tin Woodman sternly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You counted rightly then,' he retorted. 'I will not, {{to please}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> make {{both of us}} unhappy for our lives; and since I cannot marry you, we have only been too long away, and must go home at once.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must see}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> alone, before I go," [...] {{she said to}} him that evening in the drawing-room. [...] "I go very early on Thursday morning. When can I speak to you? You are never up early, I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I am afraid!" [...] she murmured. [...] "I wish I {{had taken}} my chance. I {{ought not to}} have {{burdened}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> with my affairs. I have given {{you the right to}} ask me questions which I cannot answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{speak to}} <b>you</b> privately <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> Captain Hogan?" [...] he inquired {{in such a}} tone of importance--imperiousness, almost--that the Irishman was {{impressed}} by it. He scented disclosure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop, stop,' he said, laying {{his hand}} gently on her shoulder: 'not <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> I beg of <b>you,</b> not <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Not till you've at least {{told me what}} is your trouble.' ...|$|R
60|$|Merriman. Yes, Miss. He {{seemed very}} much disappointed. I {{mentioned}} {{that you and}} Miss Prism were in the garden. He said he was anxious to speak to <b>you</b> privately <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You counted rightly, then," [...] he retorted. [...] "I will not, {{to please}} <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> make {{both of us}} unhappy for our lives; and since I cannot marry you, we have only been too long away, and must go home at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fair {{and honored}} lord," [...] {{he said to}} the King, [...] "again I pray <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of patience. It is your word and only yours which can tell us what is just and right. To whom were you graciously pleased to commit your royal person?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I implore you, Lady Pippinworth," [...] Tommy said, in much distress, [...] "not {{to think}} me capable of that. If I moved <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> I am far from boasting of it; {{it makes me}} only the more anxious {{to do what is}} best for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is enough." [...] As Carrie checked {{him with}} a lifted hand, a sparkle came into her eyes. [...] "Do <b>you</b> suppose <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that I would listen to {{anything}} further?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He cried out: [...] "No, no, no. Don't do that, sir. <b>You</b> mustn't <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> give up facing {{that old}} ruffian. If you do {{he will get}} the upper hand of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure {{we could}} do it if we put our {{shoulders}} to the wheel. I don't believe, <b>you</b> know, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that he murdered him. It was done by Lizzie Eustace's Jew." ...|$|R
