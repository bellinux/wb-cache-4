6000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1857, I planted six seeds sent {{to me from the}} Patent Office, and labelled, I think, [...] "Poitrine jaune grosse," [...] large <b>yellow</b> <b>squash.</b> Two came up, and one bore a squash which weighed 123-1/2 pounds, the other bore four, {{weighing}} together 186-1/4 pounds. Who would have believed that there was 310 pounds of poitrine jaune grosse in that corner of my garden? These seeds were the bait I used to catch it, my ferrets which I sent into its burrow, my brace of terriers which unearthed it. A little mysterious hoeing and manuring was all the abra cadabra presto-change, that I used, and lo! true to the label, they found for me 310 pounds of poitrine jaune grosse there, where it never was known to be, nor was before. These talismen had perchance sprung from America at first, and returned to it with unabated force. The big squash took a premium at your fair that fall, and I understood that the man who bought it, intended to sell the seeds for ten cents a piece. (Were they not cheap at that?) But I have more hounds of the same breed. I learn that one which I despatched to a distant town, true to its instinct, points to the large <b>yellow</b> <b>squash</b> there, too, where no hound ever found it before, as its ancestors did here and in France.|$|E

50|$|Straightneck squash (one {{of several}} {{cultivated}} Cucurbita pepo) {{is a type}} of summer squash that is usually yellow-colored. It is also known as <b>yellow</b> summer <b>squash,</b> though that nomenclature is not wholly accurate. The crookneck squash looks similar but has a crooked neck. It has mildly sweet and watery flesh, and thin tender skins that can be left on the fruit for many types of recipes. It was almost certainly domesticated in the eastern United States, although other variants of the same species (zucchini and pumpkin) were domesticated in Mesoamerica. This squash grows on vined plants reaching 60-90 cm in height that thrive in mild weather. It is well known as an item in American cooking where it is fried, microwaved, steamed, boiled, or baked. It is often used in recipes interchangeably with zucchini. A good <b>yellow</b> summer <b>squash</b> will be small and firm with tender skin free of blemishes and bruising. It is available all year long in some regions, but is at its peak from early through late summer. One similar inedible C. pepo variety is C. pepo var. ovifera.|$|R

The parchment is removed so that the vegetables may then roast, acquiring additional flavor through caramelization. To serve, the piperade is formed into a small mound, and the rounds arranged in a fanned-out pattern to cover the piperade base. A balsamic vinaigrette is drizzled on the plate, which may be garnished.|$|E

50|$|The Cayman Islands are a {{group of}} islands {{situated}} in the Caribbean Sea just between Cuba and Honduras. After being colonized first by Jamaica then by British, Cayman Islands remained under British dependency since 1962. Traditional Cayman Islands cuisine is very tied to Jamaican cuisine and they also kept British influences in their cooking, but you can as well find a large variety of international dishes with a local twist. As for traditional dishes the main ingredients are coconut, plantain, cassava, yams, rice and peas. Jamaican cuisine enriched Cayman’s cuisine by offering a large variety of spices such as jerk, curry and other exotic seasonings. The humid soil provides a large variety of exotic fruits and vegetables such as <b>yellow</b> <b>squash,</b> avocados, callaloo (Caribbean spinach), cassava, calabash, spring onions, pineapples, tomatoes, peas, chili, peppers a great range of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits, bananas and plantains, sweet potatoes, yams and mangoes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Hoop house {{plasticulture}} {{has been}} promoted as a production technology that allows fruit and vegetable crops to be grown in the cool season months in early spring and late fall. At this time little information regarding the economics of hoop house plasticulture is available. Two fruit and vegetable production systems were developed for growing conditions in south-central Oklahoma. The first system has a spinach crop followed by field tomato, and the second system has annually produced strawberry followed by <b>yellow</b> and zucchini <b>squash.</b> Crop production data were collected in a three-year randomized and replicated experiment. The objectives were (1) to determine the expected cost of production for each crop and systems, (2) to determine the breakeven price for each crop in each system, and (3) to determine how robust breakeven prices are {{to a number of}} yield, expense and marketing scenarios. The expected total cost of production were $ 1, 968 and $ 1, 652 per house for spinach and tomato crops, respectively, and $ 2, 749, $ 359 and $ 353 per house for <b>yellow</b> and zucchini <b>squash</b> crops, respectively. Breakeven prices for spinach and tomato were $ 3. 32 and $ 0. 83 per pound, respectively, and $ 6. 16, $ 0. 92, and $ 1. 40 per pound for strawberry and <b>yellow</b> and zucchini <b>squash,</b> respectively. Breakeven prices for spinach and strawberry crops were most sensitive to assumptions about quantity of marketable yield sold and/or quantity of yield consumed by grower household. breakeven prices, economics, fruits and vegetables, hoop houses, plasticulture, Agribusiness, Farm Management, Labor and Human Capital, Marketing, Production Economics,...|$|R

5000|$|At 6 am {{the next}} day, the {{neighbour}} became concerned that Price's car {{was still in}} the driveway and when Price did not arrive at work, his employer sent a worker to see what was wrong. Both the neighbour and worker tried knocking on Price's bedroom window to wake him, but after noticing blood on the front door, alerted the police, who arrived at 8 am. Breaking down the back door, police found his body with Knight comatose from taking a large number of pills. She had stabbed Price with a butcher's knife while he was sleeping. According to the blood evidence, he awoke and tried to turn the light on before attempting to escape while Knight chased him through the house, he managed to open the front door and get outside but either stumbled back inside, or was dragged back into the hallway, where he finally died after bleeding out. Later, Knight went into Aberdeen and withdrew $1,000 from Price's ATM account. Price's autopsy revealed that he had been stabbed at least 37 times, in both the front and back of his body, with many of the wounds extending into vital organs. Several hours after Price had died, Knight skinned him and hung the skin from a meat hook on the architrave of a door to the lounge room. She then decapitated him and cooked parts of his body, serving up the meat with baked potato, pumpkin, beetroot, courgette, cabbage, <b>yellow</b> <b>squash</b> and gravy in two settings at the dinner table, along with notes beside each plate, each having the name of one of Price's children on it; she was preparing to serve his body parts to his children. A third meal was thrown on the back lawn for unknown reasons and it is speculated Knight had attempted to eat it but could not and this has been put forward in support of her claim that she has no memory of the crime. Price's head was found in a pot with vegetables. The pot was still warm, estimated to be at between 40 and 50 C, indicating that the cooking had taken place in the early morning. Sometime later, Knight arranged the body with the left arm draped over an empty 1.25-litre soft drink bottle with the legs crossed.

This thesis was done {{in an effort to}} identify and characterize the begomoviruses responsible for the tomato diseases and to understand their relationships. The cropping system used by small-holding farmers comprises essentially five crops: maize and bean as consumption crops, and tomato, pepper and cucurbits as cash crops. These crops are grown in the three different growing seasons all the year around. Except maize, all the other crops are hosts for begomoviruses and whiteflies. In this study, begomovirus sequences detected with universal and virus specific primers were cloned, sequenced and used for phylogenetic analysis.

The study consisted of three treatments, replicated thrice and arranged in CRD as follows: I-Fresh Sargassum sp. (control), II-Dried pellets, and III-Fresh Extruded pellets. The dried and fresh extruded pellets were mainly of Sargassum sp. with 6. 0 % binder (corn starch and gelatin). No significant variations were observed in the somatic growth of T. gratilla among the different feeding treatments.
