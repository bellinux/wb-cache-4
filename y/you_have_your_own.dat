He reconsidered, however, and believes that Baccarin brings a seriousness and [...] "commanding presence" [...] to the part. Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the face of what people want to see...

[...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting. She explained: [...] "My direction is to play her as honestly as possible, so I'm playing her as a human with a secret. I'm playing a young 17-year-old who is possibly in love." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around 222, {{at the age}} of 24, Sun Huan was {{commissioned}} as General of the Household Who Pacifies the East (安東中郎將) and ordered to join Sun Quan's general Lu Xun at the Battle of Xiaoting against Liu Bei, who launched a campaign against Sun Quan to retake Jing Province. During the preliminary stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack Liu Bei's vanguard force at Yidao (夷道) but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. When the other officers urged Lu Xun to help Sun Huan, Lu declined, saying that Sun Huan was capable of holding his ground and that the siege would automatically be lifted later. Sun Quan's forces eventually inflicted a devastating defeat on Liu Bei's forces at the Battle of Xiaoting. As Lu Xun predicted, the siege on Yidao was lifted, after which Sun Huan led troops to block Liu Bei's retreat route, but Liu managed to escape by travelling across the mountainous areas. Liu Bei later remarked, [...] "(Sun) Huan was still a child when I visited Jing, but now he is forcing me to this extent!" [...] After the battle, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and he told the latter, [...] "Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me.
