500|$|From 1942 onwards, Hergé began {{redrawing}} and colouring {{his earlier}} Tintin adventures for Casterman, but {{chose not to}} do so for Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, considering its story too crude. Embarrassed by it, he labeled it a [...] "transgression of [...] youth". Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier believed that another factor in his decision might have been the story's virulently anti-Marxist theme, which would have been unpopular amidst growing West European sympathies for Marxism following the Second World War. In an article discussing Hergé's work which was published in the magazine Jeune Afrique ("Young Africa") in 1962, it was noted that despite the fact that fans of his work visited the Bibliothèque Nationale to read the copy of Land of the Soviets that was held there, it [...] "will never (and with good cause) be republished". In 1961, Hergé wrote a letter to Casterman suggesting that the original version of the story be republished in a volume containing a publisher's warning about its content. Louis-Robert Casterman replied with a letter in which he stated that while the subject had been discussed within the company, [...] "There are more hesitant or decidedly negative opinions than there are enthusiastic ones. Whatever the case, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> assured that the matter is being actively considered".|$|E

On August 19 or 20, more leaflets were dropped on the camp. Signed by Major-General George Wootten, General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated [...] "I know that you will realise that on account of your location, {{it will be difficult to}} get aid to you immediately, but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for you as soon as possible".|$|E
2500|$|After an {{agreement}} brokered by the United States, the Soviets agreed to leave Iran, and sovereignty was {{restored to the}} Shah in 1947. The Shah ordered an invasion of the Republic of Mahabad shortly afterwards, {{the leaders of the}} republic including Qazi Muhammad were arrested and executed. Qazi Muhammad was hanged on 31 March 1947. At the behest of Archie Roosevelt, Jr., who argued that Qazi had been forced to work with the Soviets out of expediency, U.S. ambassador to Iran George V. Allen urged the Shah not to execute Qazi or his brother, only to be reassured: [...] "Are you afraid I'm going to have them shot? If so, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> your mind. I am not."

Once there, they closed down the Kurdish {{printing}} press, banned {{the teaching of}} Kurdish language, and burned all Kurdish books that they could find. Finally, on March 31, 1947, Qazi Muhammad was hanged in Mahabad on counts of treason. At the behest of Archie Roosevelt, Jr., who argued that Qazi {{had been forced to}} work with the Soviets out of expediency, U.S. ambassador to Iran George V.

"While {{the use of}} drones is {{intentionally}} {{not bound}} by international treaties or constitutional limits, we simultaneously understand the urgent need to develop and enforce new ethical frameworks as drone use becomes more commonplace {{as a tool of}} U.S. foreign policy. Through an active collaboration between N.E.D.H.I., the brave pilots and operators of the U.S. drone program, and the American public, we believe that we can find the political and moral solutions needed to both protect the security of the United States while also satisfying the concerns of the broader global community.The Do Not Kill Registry, our first public program, has started us on that path towards new solutions and will help give people around the world the peace of mind urgently needed during these times of escalating drone conflict. While what the future holds for the U.S. drone program remains uncertain, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>rest</b> safely knowing that we will continue to diligently review and monitor the national drone kill list in order to ensure proper cautionary measures are taken while also continuing {{to take advantage of the}} military effectiveness of targeted drone strikes on militants around the world." ...|$|E
