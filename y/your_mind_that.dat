500|$|A {{week before}} the final, Liverpool played Portsmouth in the 2005–06 Premier League – it was their last match before the final, and they won 3–1. The win was Liverpool's ninth {{straight}} in the competition and meant they finished the season in third place. One area of concern was the fitness of midfielder Xabi Alonso, who injured his ankle in the match and was a doubt for the final. They were also without striker Robbie Fowler, who was cup-tied after playing for Manchester City earlier in the competition. Captain Steven Gerrard {{was determined not to}} let complacency affect Liverpool; [...] "We have beaten fantastic sides like Manchester United and Chelsea to get to the final, but it is always on <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> after going on such a successful run you might not get over that last hurdle." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I had to speak with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope in the back of <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the trial}} Justice Michael Moldaver asked retired OPP officer Harry [...] "Hank" [...] Sayeau (who {{assisted}} Inspector Harold Graham) why the police never considered a sexual psychopath might {{be responsible for}} Lynne's rape and murder before they narrowed their focus on a fourteen-year-old: [...] "Did the thought ever cross <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that,</b> for someone to strangle her then sexually assault her, {{you might want to}} be looking for someone who is more of a pervert, more of a sexual psychopath?" [...] "I don't recall that", said the eighty-four-year-old Harry Sayeau.|$|E

If your thoughts incline ever so little towards 'fuming', you will say 'fuming-furious'; if they turn, by even a hair's breadth, towards 'furious', you will say 'furious-fuming'; {{but if you have}} the rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will say 'frumious'." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 2008, Ali Khamenei backed President Ahmadinejad's {{economic}} policy {{and said the}} West was struggling with more economic difficulties than Iran, with a [...] "crisis" [...] spreading from the United States to Europe, and inflation was a widespread problem. The Iranian leader said that the ongoing economic crisis which has crippled {{the world has been}} unprecedented in the past 60 years. [...] "This crisis has forced the UN to declare state of emergency for food shortages around the globe but foreign radios have focused on Iran to imply that the current price hikes and inflation in the country are the results of carelessness on the part of Iranian officials which of course is not true", he said. Khamenei emphasized that no one has the right to blame the Iranian government for Iran's economic problems. He also advised people and the government to be content and avoid waste in order to solve economic problems. [...] "I advise you to keep in <b>your</b> <b>mind</b> <b>that</b> this great nation is never afraid of economic sanctions", he added.|$|E

[...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E
