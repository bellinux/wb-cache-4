5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a <b>year.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> gestation period of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E
5|$|Author Marilyn Cannaday has {{suggested}} that Doc Savage, the pulp hero from the 1930s and 1940s, was {{based in part on}} Savage's life, or at least his name.

5|$|Gibraltar {{remained}} in Moorish hands until 1462 but was disputed between the Nasrids of Granada and Marinids of Fez. In 1374 the latter handed the peninsula to the former, apparently in payment for Granadan military support in suppressing rebellions in Morocco. Gibraltar's garrison rebelled against the Nasrids in 1410 but a Granadan army retook the place the following <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> brief siege. Gibraltar was subsequently {{used by the}} Granadans as the base for raids into Christian territory, prompting Enrique de Guzmán, second Count of Niebla, to lay siege in 1436. The attempt ended in disaster; the attack was repelled with heavy casualties and Enrique himself was drowned while trying to escape by sea. His body was recovered by the Moors, decapitated and hung {{on the walls of}} Gibraltar for the next twenty-two years.|$|E

Brodie had loan spells with Morecambe and Grimsby Town over 2012–13, and after being {{released}} by Crawley joined Gateshead. He was loaned out to Hereford United and Southport, joining the latter permanently in 2014. Having been Southport's top scorer with 14 goals in 2014–15, Brodie joined Aldershot Town but finished 2015–16 with Stockport County. He returned to York in 2016, but was released the following <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> loan spell with Macclesfield Town. This was followed by short spells with Boston United and Southport. He earned two caps for the England national C team from 2008 to 2009.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1933 Adolf Hitler {{started a}} {{campaign}} of discrimination and intimidation against Jews, depriving them of their property and citizenship. Lasker and his wife Martha, who were both Jewish, were forced to leave Germany in the same <b>year.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> short stay in England, in 1935 they were invited {{to live in the}} USSR by Nikolai Krylenko, the Commissar of Justice who was responsible for the Moscow show trials and, in his other capacity as Sports Minister, was an enthusiastic supporter of chess. In the USSR, Lasker renounced his German citizenship and received Soviet citizenship. He took permanent residence in Moscow, and was given a post at Moscow's Institute for Mathematics and a post of trainer of the USSR national team.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{prerogative}} of the monarch to summon and prorogue Parliament. Each parliamentary session {{begins with the}} monarch's summons. The new parliamentary session is marked by the State Opening of Parliament, during which the Sovereign reads the Speech from the throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords, outlining the Government's legislative agenda. Prorogation usually occurs about one <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> session begins, and formally concludes the session. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, and {{is followed by a}} general election for all seats in the House of Commons. A general election is normally held five years after the previous one under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, but can be held sooner if the Prime Minister loses a motion of confidence, or if two-thirds {{of the members of the}} House of Commons vote to hold an early election.|$|E

5|$|Nocturnal and solitary, the marbled {{electric}} ray can often be found lying the sea floor buried except for its eyes and spiracles. This slow-moving predator feeds almost exclusively on small bony fishes, which it ambushes from the bottom and subdues with strong electric bursts. It defends itself by turning towards the threat, swimming in a loop, or curling up with its underside facing outward, while emitting electric shocks to drive off the prospective predator. Its paired electric organs are capable of producing 70–80 volts of electricity. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Mating takes place from November to January, and females bear litters of 3–32 pups every other <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> gestation period of 9–12 months. The newborn ray is immediately capable of using electricity to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Ohio had {{completed}} the stretch of highway between I-70 to just before the SR7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions of highway {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that <b>year.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{started his}} career with Leeds United's youth system, but aged 15 joined Reading in their youth system. In 1999, he signed a {{professional}} contract, before joining Third Division club York City in 2001. In the 2001–02 season, Smith did not establish himself as a first-team regular, but in 2002–03 became a fans' favourite. However, 2003–04 saw York relegated to the Conference National, and after being released by the club he spent a season with Stafford Rangers in the Conference North. In 2005, Smith joined their divisional rivals Worcester City, and in 2006–07 was named the club's Player of the <b>Year.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> third season at Worcester, {{in which he was}} captain, the club was re-allocated to play in the Conference South.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray exhibits aplacental viviparity, in which the developing embryos are nourished initially by yolk, which is later supplemented by nutrient-rich histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Adult females have two functional ovaries and uteruses; the inner lining of the uterus bears a series of parallel lengthwise folds. The reproductive cycle for females is probably biennial, while males are capable of mating every year. Mating occurs from November to January, and the young are born the following <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> gestation period of 9–12 months. The litter size ranges from 3 to 32, increasing {{with the size of}} the female.|$|E
