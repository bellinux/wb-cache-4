2500|$|On July 14, 2004, the Iranian {{government}} rejected {{requests for}} Canadian government observers {{to attend the}} trial, despite promises and assurances by the Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi and judiciary officials to the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham. The same day, Graham recalled the ambassador at Tehran, Philip MacKinnon. MacKinnon, together with the Dutch ambassador (representing the European Union) and diplomats from the British and French embassies, were later allowed to attend the July 17 trial, though not the July 18 one. Judge Farahani was quoted on July 18 as saying that [...] "(he) made a mistake yesterday. The bar is {{to show the world}} that Iran won't bow under pressure." [...] Hamid Reza Assefi, the spokesman for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said [...] "We hadn't permitted an observer from the beginning. But <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> the reason for the ban from the court, {{there may have been a}} shortage of seats." [...] Assefi also said that since Iran does not recognize dual nationality and Kazemi was an Iranian citizen who entered the country under an Iranian passport, never having requested her citizenship to be removed, that the case was clearly an internal affair.|$|E

6000|$|Geoffrey was gratified--for {{the speaker}} was famous in his profession--and he showed his feeling as he answered: [...] "I {{consider}} myself fortunate that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder {{then that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> {{me to come}} forward again after what I did about the Irish land question," [...] said Phineas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! that's {{more than}} I can tell you. If I were <b>you,</b> I <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> him. The {{governor}} is a plain man, and likes plain business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, don't swear," [...] {{interrupted}} Richard. [...] "If {{you were}} so hard up <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> me for help. I would have given you something." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{poor woman}} sat silent and amazed, {{but after a}} moment the {{daughter}} answered him. [...] "My mother, sir, would rather that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> her no questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} {{you talked to}} me about the roses. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> your uncle to tell you all about politics. He knows far more than I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My {{advice is}} not worth taking,' said Ernest. 'I'm a regular duffer at {{painting}} and sketching. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> Lord Connemara. He knows all about art {{and that sort of}} thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, [...] "I didn't; but," [...] he added, gravely and deliberately, [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> {{me such a}} question." ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother answered: [...] "The lightest {{touch is}} {{sufficient}} to convulse her, professor. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> permission of the 'control,' then {{it would not have}} shocked her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, fair sir, {{as to who}} Maitre Pierre is, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> the {{question}} of himself; and for the gentleman who ordered breakfast to be made ready, may God keep us from his closer acquaintance!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wouldn't look pretty. I don't suppose he'll come, and I'm sure I don't {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> him. Dear me, I'm certain he'll know that I wrote it. What will he think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{rather not}} speak of it. It can't do any good. I don't know why <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> me whether I intend to go there any more, but as you have, I have {{answered}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Fort, the world's {{judgment}} {{of these things}} is not mine; but since you ask me. I will tell you frankly. My cousin Leila has a claim on you. It is her <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> to marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An' right there," [...] said Tom Platt, {{experienced}} in discipline and etiquette--"right there, I take it, Disko, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> ha' <b>asked</b> {{him to stop}} ef the conversation wuz likely, in your jedgment, to be anyways--what it shouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There again now," [...] replied his companion, [...] "you go {{down the}} wind like a wild haggard, that minds neither lure nor beck--that is a {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> in as low a tone as I shall answer it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that again. Well," [...] {{answered}} Isaline boldly, [...] "because I do {{not love}} him, and I love somebody else. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> not <b>ask</b> {{a young lady}} about these matters. In Switzerland, we {{do not think it}} comme il faut." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{answering}} look {{gave her}} no comfort; far from it, but he said, [...] "I see no must about it, but that's {{for you to}} judge; perhaps <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> your father's leave to go so far from home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is Mac's pardon <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask,</b> not mine, for you haven't hurt me, and I shouldn't {{wonder if}} you had him a great deal, with all that light and racket, and talk about things that only worry him." ...|$|E
60|$|S-r-a:--No, it isn't {{polite to}} cry all the time. As to whether <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> {{a young man}} in, {{it all depends on}} whether he went home with you of his own accord or was sent by some elderly relative.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{ignorant of}} all {{concerning}} Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> rather <b>ask</b> {{the name of}} the governess--the nature of the event which requires her appearance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not of}} me that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> that question. In {{a moment}} you shall see Peter Ivanovitch himself, and the subject will come up naturally. He will be curious to know what has delayed you so long in this garden." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{strange that}} <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have <b>asked</b> me this to-night, Fan! All day I have been {{thinking}} of home, and had {{made up my mind}} to say something to you about it--something I wish to do, but I had not yet found courage to speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have gone}} over the ground myself. It {{could be done in}} even less time. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> a few of our friends to that war game, Baron. How they would smile! You read the {{newspapers}} of the country?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nonsense," [...] said Phoebe {{a little}} impatiently, [...] "for {{us to talk}} about a picture which you have never seen. You mistake it for some other. A crime, indeed! Since you are a friend of my cousin Hepzibah's, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> her to show you the picture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{have no fear}} of, Wulf, else I {{should not}} have offered you the hand of my daughter. I will bring my wife and Guy in. I have offered you the hand of Agnes, but it is right that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> her mother's consent, {{although}} beforehand assured of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you will}} know him. According to that, no girl would ever get married. Is it not a great thing that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be <b>asked</b> to assume and to enjoy the rank which has belonged to your mother, but which {{she has never been}} able to enjoy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Noma," [...] he said, [...] "if I {{believed}} {{that there was any}} danger for <b>you,</b> <b>should</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to suffer this thing?--I, who love you more even than you love power, more than my life, more than anything that is or ever can be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought not}} to try," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield; [...] "it {{would be a shame}} for her to go away and leave her uncle. You have one young lady, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>ask</b> for both. Olive must marry, and the captain must go and live with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A most industrious and meritorious young man; {{he deserves}} every honour that may happen to him," [...] says the old soldier. [...] "Rosa, my dear, {{it is time}} that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> Mr. Ridley to dinner, and Mr. Smee, {{and some of those}} gentlemen. We will drive this {{afternoon}} and see your portrait." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{the clearest}} {{of us all}} in {{practical}} matters," [...] said Ethel, preventing what she feared would be disparaging. [...] "I don't mean only that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> him about this Parliament matter alone; but I am sure you would be happier and more settled if you talked things over with him before--before you go to church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{desire to}} work them no harm. Then, if I were {{to fall in}} with your humour, would you let them go in safety?--I mean my father and the Se√±or Brome and my cousin Betty, whom, if you were as honest as you pretend to be, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>ask</b> to bide with you as your wife, and not myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] quoth she after a {{breathing}} space, {{and her voice}} was gentle, her tone innocent beyond compare. [...] "Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> him?" [...] Ruth frowned, perplexed and thoughtful, and now Diana turned to her with the lively eye of one into whose mind has leapt a sudden inspiration. [...] "Ruth!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Why, indeed, <b>should</b> <b>you</b> not <b>ask</b> him to forgo this duel?" ...|$|R
60|$|Aca. Why <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> me that? Those must be mine, though I {{have such}} excess; Divided griefs increase, and not grow less.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Walter, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not <b>ask</b> me that question, {{just coming}} from France. There we hold {{that the best}} token, in our poverty, that we are cavaliers and gentlemen, is to be courteous to all, high and low. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> see our young King's frank bright courtesy; and as to the little King Louis, he is the very pink of civility to every old poissarde in the streets." ...|$|R
