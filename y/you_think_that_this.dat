500|$|Darwin's book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on {{his theory}} of atoll {{formation}} was published in May 1842 after {{more than three years}} of work, and he then wrote his first [...] "pencil sketch" [...] of {{his theory of}} natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to hear how <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin {{became a}} close friend of the {{botanist}} Joseph Dalton Hooker, and on 11 January 1844 wrote to with melodramatic humour that he was [...] "almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a [...] "tendency to progression" [...] “adaptations from the slow willing of animals" [...] ,—but the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his—though the means of change are wholly so— I think I have found out (here's presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends." [...] Hooker's reply was cautious but friendly, saying that [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species.

60|$|And do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was an {{exceptional}} case? The {{sign of a}} Philistine age is the cry of immorality against art, and this cry was raised by the Athenian people against every great poet and thinker of their day - AEschylus, Euripides, Socrates. It was the same with Florence in the thirteenth century. Good handicrafts are due to guilds, not to the people. The moment the guilds lost their power and the people rushed in, beauty and honesty of work died.|$|E

Ireland, Sir, pays a great deal more than Scotland, and is perhaps as much and as effectually united to England as Scotland is. But if Scotland, instead of paying little, had paid nothing at all, we should be gainers, not losers, by acquiring the hearty coöperation of an active, intelligent people towards the increase of the common stock, instead of our being employed in watching and counteracting them, and their being employed in watching and counteracting us, with the peevish and churlish jealousy of rivals and enemies on both sides.|$|E
