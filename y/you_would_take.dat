500|$|In a {{collection}} of Renaissance metalwork Benvenuto Cellini (1500–71) represents the ultimate attribution, as his genuine works as a goldsmith are rarer than paintings by Giorgione. [...] In his 1902 catalogue Charles Hercules Read mentions {{that many of the}} pendants had been attributed to Cellini, but refrains from endorsing the attributions. [...] A small silver hand-bell (WB.95) had belonged to Horace Walpole, who praised it extravagantly in a letter as [...] "the uniquest thing in the world, a silver bell for an inkstand made by Benvenuto Cellini. It makes one believe all the extravagant encomiums he bestows on himself; indeed so does his Perseus. Well, my bell is in the finest taste, and is swarmed by caterpillars, lizards, grasshoppers, flies, and masques, that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> it for one of the plagues of Egypt. They are all in altissimo, nay in out-issimo relievo and yet almost invisible but with a glass. Such foliage, such fruitage!" [...] However Baron Ferdinand had realized that it was more likely to be by Wenzel Jamnitzer, goldsmith to the Emperor Rudolf II, to whom it is still attributed. [...] Another piece no longer attributed to Cellini is a large bronze door-knocker, with a figure of Neptune, 40cm high, and weighing over 11 kilos.|$|E

For example, Margaret King cross-dressed in teh early nineteenth century to attend medical school, as none would accept female students. While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the Middle Ages and early modern era, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{question}} of the relationship between beliefs and knowledge, Armstrong defends a [...] "weak acceptance" [...] of the belief condition, namely that if a person can be said to know some thing p, he or she believes p. In a paper for the Aristotelian Society, Armstrong rejects a series of linguistic arguments for a rejection of the belief condition which argue that one can have knowledge without having belief because a common usage of the word 'belief' is to imply lack of knowledge—Armstrong gives the example of if you asked a man on a railway station whether the train has just left and he said [...] "I believe it has", <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> from this that he does not know that it has.|$|E
