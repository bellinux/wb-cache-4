5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s Enron's stock was trading for $80–90 per share, and few seemed to concern {{themselves}} with the opacity of the company's financial disclosures. In mid-July 2001, Enron reported revenues of $50.1 billion, almost triple <b>year-to-date,</b> and beating analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share. Despite this, Enron's profit margin had stayed at a modest average of about 2.1%, and its share price had decreased by more than 30% since the same quarter of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{activity}} totaled to 11 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane {{within the}} 2007 Pacific hurricane season; {{all three of}} these values fall below the 1971–2006 long-term average of 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. The main contributing factor to below-average activity was much above-average wind shear across the Pacific basin. Overall energy output was reflected with an Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index of 52 units, well below the 1981–2010 average of 113.3 units, and at the time the second-lowest value observed since reliable records began in 1971. In May2007, two tropical storms – Alvin and Barbara – developed, marking at the time the third such instance of more than one tropical storm developing within the month since official records began in 1949. In June2007, only one tropical depression developed in the East Pacific basin, making 2007 one of only four years in which a tropical storm did not form in the month. By the following month, in terms of ACE, 2007 was considered the third quietest <b>year-to-date</b> since the satellite era began in 1966; in September, the season fell to the second quietest <b>year-to-date.</b> Below-average activity continued {{for the remainder of the}} year.|$|E

Registrations {{during the first}} six months of 2016 recorded the highest-volume half-year ever for plug-in electric car registrations. During the first three quarters of 2016 a total of 29,185 plug-in electric vehicles were registered, of which, 28,035 cars were eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant. Registrations consisted of 8,107 all-electric cars, up 16.6% year-on-year, and 21,078 plug-in hybrids, up 46.3% year-on-year. During this period, sales of plug-in hybrids oversold pure electric cars, with the latter more than doubling sales of battery electric models. During the first nine months of 2016 the plug-in car segment's market share reached 1.36% of new car sales. While overall new car registrations <b>year-to-date</b> increased 2.6% from the same period in 2015, total plug-in car registrations during the first nine months of 2016 increased 36.6% from a year earlier. The Outlander P-HEV continued to lead sales of the plug-in electric segment in 2016 with 9,486 units delivered. The Leaf remained as the top selling all-electric car with 4,463 units registered.|$|E

25|$|Set in {{the fictional}} town of Oakdale, Illinois, the show debuted on April 2, 1956, at 1:30 pm EST. Prior to that date, all serials had been 15 minutes in length. As the World Turns and The Edge of Night, which premiered {{on the same}} day at 4:30 pm EST, were the first two to be 30 minutes in length from their premiere. At first, viewers were {{indifferent}} to the new half-hour serial, but ratings picked up in its second year, eventually reaching the top spot in the daytime Nielsen ratings by fall 1958. In 1959, the show started a streak of weekly ratings wins that was not interrupted for over 12 years. The show switched to color on August 21, 1967, and expanded from a half-hour in length to one hour starting on December 1, 1975, when The Edge of Night moved to ABC. In the <b>year-to-date</b> ratings, As the World Turns was the most-watched daytime drama from 1958 until 1978, with ten million viewers tuning in each day. At its height, core actors such as Helen Wagner, Don MacLaughlin, Don Hastings, and Eileen Fulton became nationally known. Three of these actors – Wagner, Hastings, and Fulton – are also the three longest serving actors in the history of American soap operas.|$|E

In June, the National Weather Service {{recorded}} [...] of precipitation at the Fairbanks International Airport—the most in that month since June 1994, and [...] above average. By July 27, 1.47inches of rain {{had fallen in}} July. This was slightly below the average for the month at that time (1.49inches), but the <b>year-to-date</b> rainfall total was still one and two-thirds inches above normal. The next day, July 28, 1.14inches of rain fell in Fairbanks, setting a single-day Fairbanks rainfall total for that date, with heavier amounts measured east of the town. Scattered locations between Salcha and Delta Junction received up to fourinches of precipitation. On the 29th, another 0.77inches of rain fell in Fairbanks—another record for the date—and again, locations outside of the town received greater amounts. Just 0.14inches of rain fell on the 30th, but on the 31st, 0.6inches fell. This amount was not a record for the date, but it brought the overall rainfall total in Fairbanks {{for the month of}} July to 4.12inches—more than double the normal average of [...] of rain. At Eielson Air Force Base, which lies to the southwest of Fairbanks, 7.30inches of rain were recorded as having fallen in July, making it the rainiest July ever recorded and the second-rainiest month ever recorded at the base. Though more rain fell on August 1 and afterward, the Tanana, Salcha, and Chena rivers had already crested.|$|E
500|$|Activision stated on January 21, 2008 that North American {{sales from}} all of the Guitar Hero {{franchise}} have exceeded one billion dollars with over 16 million units sold, excluding downloadable content. Over 20 million songs have been sold as downloadable content as of July 2008, and 34 million by May 2009. As of October 9, 2008, the series has sold 23 million units with sales of US$1.6 billion, and as of May 2009 has earned US$2 billion at retail. Activision claims that Guitar Hero is the third largest video game franchise after the Mario and Madden NFL series, and is present in over 15 million households. Guitar Hero: World Tour along with other music games such as Rock Band 2 have surged the video game market in 2008; NPD Group reports cited that music video games made up 19% of the overall software industry sales in July 2008, and 16% through November 2008, and contributing to a 32% <b>year-to-date</b> sector growth through July 2008. [...] Total sales of music games doubled in 2008, with total sales of US$1.9 billion. Guitar Hero represented about half of that figure, with a total of $992M of retail sales in 2008, and was the highest selling brand of the year. At the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show, Activision CEO Mike Griffith stated that Guitar Hero III is the first video game to exceed one billion dollars in total sales. Activision reported that the Guitar Hero franchise had 55% of the United States and European markets during the first quarter of 2009. Analysts expect 2009 to be a critical year to determine the future direction of music games, whether the sector will continue to grow or will remain stagnant. Early analysis {{of the first half of}} 2009 showed that sales of both Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchise games were down by half from the same period in 2008, likely due to fewer purchases of the more expensive game bundles that include one or more controllers, as well as large discounts on the prices of older games. Viacom, parent company of MTV Games, reported a 32% drop in 2009 second quarter profits, partially driven by weak sales of Rock Band amid the poor economy of the period.|$|E

2500|$|Toronto {{recorded}} {{its largest}} number of homicides in 1991 with 89, a rate of 3.9 per 100,000. In 2005, Toronto media coined the term [...] "Year of the Gun", because of {{a record number of}} gun-related homicides, 52, out of 80 homicides in total. The total number of homicides dropped to 70 in 2006, that year, nearly 2,000 people in Toronto were victims of a violent gun-related crime, about one-quarter of the national total. 84 homicides were committed in 2007, roughly half of which involved guns. Gang-related incidents have also been on the rise; between the years of 1997 and 2005, over 300 gang-related homicides have occurred. As a result, the Ontario government developed an anti-gun strategy. In 2011, Toronto's murder rate plummeted to 45 murders—nearly a 26% drop from the previous year. The 45 homicides were the lowest number the city has recorded since 1986. While subsequent years did see a return to higher rates, the nearly flat line of 56 homicides in 2012 and 57 in both 2013 and 2014 continued to be a significant improvement over the previous decade; and the <b>year-to-date</b> figure of 47 murders at November 23, 2015 continued that overall trend of improvement.|$|E
2500|$|By the fall, WHFV was in dire straits. Beginning Labor Day 1974, {{it became}} {{little more than}} a {{pass-through}} for NBC, as nearly all syndicated programs besides news and Donahue were removed from the schedule. The station filled out its schedule during non-network hours with a daily 4:30 pm movie, an unusually timed 7 pm local newscast, and one low-rent syndicated show in the 7:30 pm slot. Realizing the station was on the brink, Television Fredericksburg began advertising nationally for a buyer and had to resort to short-term loans to continue operations, but was not bringing in the money to pay them back and slipped into default. The Free-Lance Star reported that the station had been sued for more than $1 million owed to five local banks, two equipment lessors, and the IRS, in addition to reporting operating losses of $207,000 <b>year-to-date</b> in October 1974. One potential sale to Fairfax County businessman Charles Henry Smith, Jr. fell through in September. Smith expressed his opinion that the operation could turn a profit in several years, and its fatal mistake was going on the air without accounting for this; it clearly did not have enough cash on hand to survive even a year of losses.|$|E
