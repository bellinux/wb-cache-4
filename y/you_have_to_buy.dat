60|$|Arriving at Paddington, Mike {{stood on}} the platform, waiting for his box {{to emerge from the}} luggage-van, with mixed {{feelings}} of gloom and excitement. The gloom was in the larger quantities, perhaps, but the excitement was there, too. It {{was the first time in}} his life that he had been entirely dependent on himself. He had crossed the Rubicon. The occasion was too serious for him to feel the same helplessly furious feeling with which he had embarked on life at Sedleigh. It was possible to look on Sedleigh with quite a personal enmity. London was too big to be angry with. It took no notice of him. It did not care whether he was glad to be there or sorry, and there was no means of making it care. That is the peculiarity of London. There is a sort of cold unfriendliness about it. A city like New York makes the new arrival feel at home in half an hour; but London is a specialist in what Psmith in his letter had called the Distant Stare. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> London's good-will.|$|E

The green economy will include insurance so that if your environmental property is damaged you will be compensated. We need a citizens tribunal for the environment».|$|E
