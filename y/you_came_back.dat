500|$|There {{are many}} themes {{found in this}} book; some that are {{recurring}} are roles in society, religion, relationships, and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities. Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate {{as a result of}} relationships, and how these are connected with their roles in society. [...] Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros's previous work as well as [...] "in Woman Hollering Creek (1991), the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships. Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos, sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment, but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity." [...] An example of this is Cleófilas, who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States. [...] The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life {{was going to be a}} fairy tale. [...] Instead, with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera. [...] Another example of this is found in the final section of this book, entitled [...] "There Was A Man, There Was A Woman", where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination. [...] The two female protagonists in [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] and [...] "Eyes of Zapata" [...] use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover. [...] However, in doing so, they face the problems of objectification and oppression; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters' identities. [...] In the end, the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity. For example, Inés, in [...] "Eyes of Zapata", talks about the role she plays as lover, not a wife: [...] "You married her, that woman from Villa de Ayala, true. But see, <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> to me. You always come back. In between and beyond the others. That's my magic. You come back to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robert Long {{was arrested}} on November 16, 1984, and charged with the sexual battery and {{kidnapping}} of Lisa McVey. Long signed a formal Miranda waiver, and consented to questioning. After the detectives procured a confession for the McVey case, their questioning focused {{on a series of}} unsolved sexual battery homicides pending in the area. As the detectives began to question Long about the murders, he replied, [...] "I'd rather not answer that." [...] The detectives continued the interrogation, and handed Long photographs of the various murder victims. At this point, Long stated, [...] "The complexion of things sure have changed since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>back</b> into the room. I think I might need an attorney." [...] No attorney was provided, and Long eventually confessed to eight murders in Hillsborough County, and one murder in Pasco County.|$|E
