5|$|<b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack was {{developed}} by Chicago-based company Jellyvision. The <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack (YDKJ) series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack: The Ride. Though Jellyvision offered some web-based <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only realize <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in business-to-business communication including for tax software from H Block and interviews for Equifax.|$|E

5|$|I find {{it quite}} nerve-racking {{performing}}, actually. Because {{when you write}} songs, <b>you</b> <b>don't</b> really think about performing in a video. I think it's quite fun. Lots of colour and dancing, and it's about doing something that's {{in keeping with the}} song, actually.|$|E

5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. <b>You</b> <b>don't</b> want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, <b>you</b> <b>don't</b> know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

60|$|Ah, but <b>you</b> <b>didn't</b> watch sharply enough! <b>You</b> <b>didn't</b> see, as he circled past, that cunning side {{gleam of}} his yellow eyes, which {{understood}} your attitude perfectly.

5|$|<b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack is a 2011 {{video game}} of the party genre {{released}} by various home consoles and handhelds based on the series of <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack games. The game was developed by Jellyvision Games and published by THQ, and was released in North America on February 8, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS platforms. It is the first title in the series released by Jellyvision after an eight-year hiatus, taking advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles. A single player iOS port was released about two months later, but was later pulled {{in anticipation of a}} more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game.|$|E

5|$|An initial {{version of}} this version of <b>You</b> <b>Don't</b> Know Jack was {{released}} for iOS systems in April 2011.
