Ryan White and his family {{strongly}} rejected the language of [...] "innocent victim" [...] because the phrase was often used to imply that gays with AIDS were [...] "guilty". Ryan's mother told The New York Times, Ryan always said, 'I'm {{just like everyone else}} with AIDS, no matter how I got it.' And he would never have lived as long as he did without the gay community. The people we knew in New York made sure we knew about the latest treatments way before we would have known in Indiana. I hear mothers today say they're not gonna work with no gay community on anything. Well, if it comes to your son's life, you better start changing your heart and <b>your</b> <b>attitude</b> around.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Sinatra {{came out}} of his {{short-lived}} retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on Billboard and number 12 in the UK. The television special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974, despite previously vowing to perform there again [...] He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a [...] "massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australia". In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists there– who were aggressively pursuing his every move and pushing for a press conference– as [...] "bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers". After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for [...] "fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press". In the end, Sinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged a final concert which was televised to the nation, and Sinatra was given the opportunity to say [...] "I love <b>your</b> <b>attitude,</b> I love your booze" [...] to the Australian people. In October 1974 he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title The Main Event– Live. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.|$|E

2500|$|On the October 7, 2008 {{episode of}} Making the Band, Combs {{stated that he}} did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, after {{continued}} debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day {{was no longer in}} the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a TRL (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and Aundrea Fimbres, who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart. O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other. The season finale, which took place Tuesday, October 14, 2008, confirmed the departure of O'Day and Woods. Combs removed Woods due to feeling that she was unhappy with the group and that she had gotten [...] "caught up in the wrath" [...] of close friend O'Day. In the live section of the episode, Combs explained that the reason he let O'Day go was that she was not the same person he signed, that the fame had changed her (as had been expressed on the August 28, 2008 episode). [...] "I got love for Aubrey," [...] he said. [...] "I don't have any beef with her. I just want to work with the young lady that I signed, not the person that fame has made her." [...] He later stated that he would be open to working with Woods again. When O'Day came on to reply, just moments after deciding not to leave the studio, she first addressed the perception some people, especially bloggers, have of her. [...] "I would rather be hated every damn day of my life for being real than loved for being something I'm not," [...] she stated. Combs, who spoke to the group and the audience via satellite, relayed to O'Day, [...] "Check this out, baby girl... See, <b>your</b> <b>attitude</b> is gonna have you in a dark and lonely place. ... What you need to do, {{at the end of the}} day, is humble yourself." [...] Woods did not appear on the live episode due to prior obligations.|$|E
