40|$|Let G = (V,E) be a graph and T be a {{spanning}} tree of G. We {{consider the following}} strategy in advancing in G from a vertex x towards a target vertex y: from a current vertex z (initially, z = x), unless z = <b>y,</b> <b>go</b> to a neighbor of z in G that is closest to y in T (breaking ties arbitrarily). In this strategy, each vertex has full knowledge of its neighborhood in G and can use the distances in T to navigate in G. Thus, additionally to standard local information (the neighborhood NG(v)), the only global information that is available to each vertex v is the topology of the {{spanning tree}} T (in fact, v can know {{only a very small}} piece of information about T and still be able to infer from it the necessary tree-distances). For each source vertex x and target vertex y, this way, a path, called a greedy routing path, is produced. Denote by gG,T (x, y) the length of a longest greedy routing path that can be produced for x and y using this strategy and T. We say that a spanning tree T of a graph G is an additive r-carcass for G if gG,T (x, y) ≤ dG(x, y) +r for each ordered pair x, y ∈ V. In this paper, we investigate the problem, given a graph family F, whether a small integer r exists such that any graph G ∈ F admits an additive r-carcass. We show that rectilinear p × q grids, hypercubes, distance-hereditary graphs, dually chordal graphs (and, therefore, strongly chordal graphs and interval graphs), all admit additive 0 -carcasses. Furthermore, every chordal graph G admits an additive (ω(G) + 1) -carcass (where ω(G) {{is the size of a}} maximum clique of G), each 3 -sun-free chordal graph admits an additive 2 -carcass, each chordal bipartite graph admits an additive 4 -carcass.

Proximal composition, iron content, Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER), Apparent Protein Digestibility in vivo (DA), acceptability percentage and sensorial qualities was determined. lt was tested two levels of cookies fortification: 5 % (G 5) y 8 % (G 8) and a control group of unfortified cookies (G 0) The dehydration yield was 150 grams of SBSA by liter of blood. {{it was found that}} the SBSA has a high content of protein (83, 71 g/ 100 g) and iron (385, 20 mg/ 100 g). The results of microbiologic analysis of the cookies showed that they were adequate for human consumption. The G 8 cookie had the highest protein content (13, 07 g/ 100 g), fóllowed by the G 5 cookie (10, 99 g/ 100 g), and at last GO cookie (8, 72 g/ 100 g); similar tendency was observed for iron content: G 8 (24, 04 mg/ 100 g), GS (20, 96 mgílOOg) <b>y</b> <b>GO</b> (8, 32 mg/ 100 g). The DA of G 5 (88, 0 %) and G 8 (88, 7 %) cookies were statistically similar and smaller than the DA of casein (94, 2 %). The PER of cookie G 8 (1, 43) was statistically higher than G 5 cookie (1, 27), both fortified cookies had a lower PER than casein (3, 10). In the sensorial test, it was found significant differences between the averages of the flavor score (GO= 3, 62, G 5 = 3, 18 y G 8 = 3, 08) and general appreciation (GO= 3, 60, G 5 = 3, 02 y G 8 = 2, 56); in contrast, there was not significant differences between the averages of the odor score (GO= 3, 34, G 5 = 3, 18 y G 8 = 3, 08). The GO was the cookie with. the highest acceptability percent (40 /o), continued by the G 5 cookie (35 % and in the last place the G 8 cookie (25 %). it was concluded that fortification of cookies with bovine whole blood spray﷓dried (SBSA) increases notably the protein and iron content. The cookies fortified with SBSA present high protein digestibility and his values of PER are similar to that of other baked cookies. Of two levels of fortification tested in the present work (5 % and 8 %), the most suitable level of fortification would be that of 5 % (G 5), since these cookies show major acceptability and major score of flavor and general appreciatiún that the cookies fortified to 8 % (G 8). El presente estudio se realizo con el objetivo de evaluar la calidad nutricional de galletas fortificadas con sangre bovina secada por atomización (SBSA). Se determinó la composición proximal, contenido de hierro, índice de Eficiencia Proteica (PER), Digestibilidad Proteica Aparente in vivo (DA), porcentaje de aceptabilidad y las características sensoriales. Se ensayaron 2 niveles de fortificación: 5 % (G 5) y 8 % (G 8) y un grupo control de galletas no fortificadas (GO). El rendimiento de la deshidratación fue de 150 gramos de SBSA por litro de sangre. Se hallo que la SBSA tiene un alto contenido proteico (83, 71 g/ 100 g) y de hierro (385, 20 mg/ 100 g). Los resultados del análisis microbiológico indicaron que las galletas fortificadas estuvieron aptas para el consumo humano. La galleta G 8 tuvo el mas alto contenido proteico (13, 07 g/ 100 g) le siguió la galleta G 5 (10, 99 g/ 100 g) y en último lugar la galleta GO(8, 72 g/ 100 g); similar tendencia se observó para el contenido de hierro: GS (24, 04 mg/ 100 g), G 5 (20, 96 mg/ 100 g) <b>y</b> <b>GO</b> (8, 32 mg/ 100 g). La DA de las galletas G 5 (88, 0 %) y G 8 (88, 7 %) fueron estadísticamente similares y menores que la DA de la caseína (94, 2 %). El PER de la galleta G 8 (1, 43) fue estadísticamente mayor que el de la galleta G 5 (1, 27); ambas galletas fortificadas tuvieron menor PER que la caseína (3, 10). En la prueba sensorial, se hallo diferencias significativas entre los promedios de las calificaciones de sabor (GO= 3, 62, G 5 = 3, 18 y G 8 = 3, 08) y apreciación general (GO= 3, 60, G 5 = 3, 02 y GS= 2, 56); en cambio, no hubo diferencias significativas entre los promedios de las calificaciones de olor (GO= 3, 34, G 5 = 3, 18 y GS= 3, 08). La galleta GO tuvo la mayor aceptabilidad (40 %), le siguió la galleta G 5 (35 %) y en último lugar la galleta G 8 (25 %). Se concluye que La fortificación de galletas con Sangre Bovina Secada por Atomización (SBSA) incrementa notablemente el contenido proteico y de hierro. Las galletas fortificadas con SBSA presentan elevada digestibilidad proteica y sus valores de PER son similares al de otras galletas horneadas. De los dos niveles de fortificación ensayados en el presente trabajo (5 % y 8 %), el nivel mas adecuado de fortificación sería el de 5 % (G 5), ya que estas galletas muestran mayor aceptabilidad y mayores calificaciones de sabor y apreciación general que las galletas fortificadas al 8 % (G 8) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the system [Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4] [(Y Ta) 0. 03 Ti 0. 94]O 3, as {{produced}} using two different sintering temperatures. It was shown by others that for a sample sintered at 1550 °C the material is a relaxor, whereas for the same composition produced with sintering temperature of 1600 °C the sample is a normal ferroelectric. We have employed analysis of x-ray diffraction peak broadening, Ti K edge x-ray near edge spectroscopy, and extended x-ray absorption edge fine structure spectroscopy of Ta and Y sites in our study. We find that the 1550 °C sinter sample has over double the lattice strain as does the 1600 °C sample. For the lower temperature sinter material, both Ta and <b>Y</b> <b>go</b> to sites substitutional for Ti in the lattice, with a significant expansion (contraction) of the local perovskite structure about Y/Ta dopants. Thus, with only three percent B site addition of Y and Ta dopants, there is a strain associated relaxor behavior produced in a bulk sample. For the higher temperature sinter specimen, there is a marked change in the average Y environment relative to the lower temperature sinter sample. ^ We also {{have studied the}} structural transformations around both V and Cr atoms in (V 1 -xCrx) 2 O 3 across its metal-insulator transition (MIT) have been studied by extended x-ray absorption fine-structure technique. Our new results for Cr {{made possible by the}} use of a novel x-ray analyzer that we developed reveal the substitutional mechanism of Cr doping. We find that this system has a buckled structure with short Cr-V and long V-V bonds. This system of bonds is disordered around the average trigonal lattice ascertained by x-ray diffraction. Such local distortions can result in a long range strain field that sets in around dilute Cr atoms in microscopic regions. We suggest that such locally strained regions should be insulating even at small x. The possibility of local insulating regions within a metallic phase, first suggested by Rice and Brinkman in 1972, remains unaccounted for in modern MIT theories. ^ Also for the bulk single crystals, the glancing emergent angle method was used to minimize fluorescence distortion in V K-edge fluorescence XAFS. These data were compared to transmission results on finely ground powders. The powder XAFS is expected to be closely reproduced by weighting the c perpendicular to E data twice, the c parallel to E once, and dividing by three. For V-O and V-V distances, excellent agreement was obtained between the averaged single crystal and transmission powder data. Surprisingly, the amplitude of the weighed average glancing emergent angle data was in all cases greater, not less, than the amplitude of the corresponding powder data. ...|$|E
