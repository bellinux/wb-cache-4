He promoted the Rolling Stones as the nasty counterpoints to the Beatles by having the band pose unsmiling {{on the cover of}} their first album. He also encouraged the press to use provocative headlines such as [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> daughter marry a Rolling Stone?", although Wyman says [...] "Our reputation and image as the Bad Boys came later, completely there, accidentally.... never did engineer it. He simply exploited it exhaustively". In a 1972 interview, Wyman stated [...] "We were the first pop group to break away from the whole Cliff Richard thing where the bands did little dance steps, wore identical uniforms and had snappy patter." ...|$|E

Chris Martins of The A.V. Club praised the album as [...] "one {{of the most}} musical and inventive to fly the electronica banner in years," [...] and a [...] "hybridized work that challenges others to follow its dazzling blueprint". Robert Christgau, writing for MSN Music, wrote that [...] "part of its delight is how naturally the disparate parts fit together, but another part is how they add up to phantasmagoria if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> attention wander (and don't be a tight-ass—you should)". William Rauscher of Resident Advisor noted that the album's [...] "sheer amount of diversity" [...] makes it a [...] "much more challenging affair" [...] than its predecessor, Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the stark prohibitions and warnings against adultery, marital relations were expected and considered a right. A newly married soldier in Israel {{did not have to}} go to war for a year, so that he could bring happiness to his bride. Proverbs encourages the enjoyment of sexual relations within marriage: [...] "Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with <b>you.</b> <b>Let</b> <b>your</b> fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth...Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray." ...|$|E

2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil only yesterday sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if <b>you</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
