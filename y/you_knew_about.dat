Additionally, the band's {{official}} website had linked to the group's website. The full band was shown in a documentary for Alive & Well declaring their support before a performance. Links and references to Alive & Well have since been removed and no further mentions or shows of support have been made.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risely rated [...] "The Almost People" [...] 8 out of 10, {{noting that}} [...] "As a {{traditional}} two-parter, Matthew Graham wrote a tight and coherent {{but not entirely}} scintillating script that managed to 'flesh' out the themes of morality and humanity {{with a couple of}} interesting touches". Though he called the cliffhanger a [...] "perfectly pitched WTF moment", he too believed that it [...] "detracts from the episode as a whole". Richard Edwards of SFX was more critical of the episode, giving it three out of five stars. He stated he did not feel any [...] "genuine threat" [...] and considered the Gangers to be [...] "uninteresting" [...] and [...] "predictable". However, he did praise Smith's performance and the cliffhanger. Digital Spy listed the cliffhanger among five best of Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, explaining, [...] "it changes everything you thought <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the latest series, and it's damn creepy".|$|E
500|$|Other critics {{indicated}} befuddlement as to U2's purpose. The Asbury Park Press {{wrote that}} the long string of Achtung Baby song presentations that opened the show made one forget about the band's past, and that [...] "almost everything <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> U2 {{a couple years ago}} is, in fact, wrong now". The Star-Ledger said that the band shortchanged its music with its video presentations and that especially during the opening sequence, [...] "one was only aware of the music as a soundtrack to the real 'show'". [...] It concluded by saying that the group had lost the sense of mystery and yearning that made it great and that they had succumbed to the style of music videos. Jon Pareles of The New York Times acknowledged that U2 was trying to break its former earnest image and that they were a [...] "vastly improved band" [...] for being [...] "trendy" [...] and [...] "funny"; yet, he commented, [...] "U2 wants to have its artifice and its sincerity at the same time—no easy thing—and it hasn't yet made the breakthrough that will unite them." ...|$|E

500|$|Following , Crystal Dynamics {{was split}} into two teams; the first {{beginning}} work on the next sequential pillar of the Tomb Raider franchise, while the second focusing on the newly created spin-off Lara Croft series (debuting with Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light in 2010). Following pre-announcement media hype while the game's title was under embargo, in November 2010, Square Enix filed for trademark of the slogan for the new Tomb Raider game; [...] "A Survivor is Born". On 6 December 2010, Square Enix announced Tomb Raider had been in production for nearly 2 years; [...] "Square Enix Ltd. is excited today to announce Tomb Raider, the new game from Redwood City based studio Crystal Dynamics". Studio head Darrell Gallagher said, [...] "Forget everything <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> Tomb Raider, this is an origins story that creates Lara Croft and takes her on a character defining journey like no other". Game Informer website and magazine ran a world exclusive cover reveal in its January 2011 issue, as well as exclusive coverage of emerging details directly from Crystal Dynamics from 12 December 2010. Tomb Raider was the first game in the series to receive a M rating in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Broken Morning (2003) {{was based}} on Chiori Miyagawa's {{interviews}} with Texas death row inmates. She interviewed not only inmates, but also the guards, family members, and victims surrounding the Huntsville State Prison. It premiered at the HERE Arts Center. Nytheater.com praised the work, “Broken Morning is compelling storytelling of the highest order; it will cause you to ask questions, to challenge your assumptions, and to reconsider what you thought <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> fundamental social issues.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a 3.5 out of 4, saying [...] "It's {{entertaining}} as hell" [...] {{and it provides}} [...] "nearly non-stop action". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a 3 out of 4, saying that [...] "the suspense is killer". [...] Henry Barnes of The Guardian considered World War Z an [...] "attempt at large-scale seriousness" [...] in the zombie genre, {{which resulted in a}} [...] "punchy, if conventional action thriller." [...] Writing for Variety, Scott Foundas thought the film to be a [...] "surprisingly smart, gripping and imaginative addition to the zombie-movie canon", which shows [...] "few visible signs of the massive rewrites, reshoots and other post-production patchwork." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter opined that [...] "Brad Pitt delivers a capable performance in an immersive apocalyptic spectacle about a global zombie uprising." [...] A. O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] " [...] does not try to extend the boundaries of commercial entertainment but does what it can to find interesting ways to pass the time within them." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times remarked, [...] "World War Z plays a bit like a series of separate films and the juncture where the new final act was grafted onto the proceedings is unmistakable, but unless <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the film's troubled past, you'd never guess it existed." ...|$|E

Sobber was very bitter, {{and he wanted to}} know all about what had been done with the treasure. He claims that he and his uncle, who is dead, were robbed of the boxes. Evidently Sobber and the lawyer had talked the matter over carefully, for the latter intimated that Sobber might settle the case if the Stanhopes and the Lanings would give him seventy-five per cent. of the fortune. Mr. Laning did not wish to go to law, and told Sobber he might be willing to settle for a small amount, say two or three {{thousand}} dollars.
