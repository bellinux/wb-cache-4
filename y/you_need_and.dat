Shelina Zahra Janmohamed, {{the author}} and Vice President of brand {{consultancy}} Ogilvy Noor, has warned that the rise of contemporary Islamic fashion as exemplified by the ḥijāb risks being overwhelmed by the '”consumerism and objectification” of the mainstream fashion industry: “Muslim fashion is teetering between asserting a Muslim woman's right to be beautiful and well-turned out, and buying more stuff than <b>you</b> <b>need,</b> <b>and</b> being judged by your clothes – {{both of which are}} the opposite of Islamic values.” ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} a gradual {{increase}} in brain volume as the ancestors of modern humans progressed along the human timeline of evolution (see Homininae), starting from about 600cm3 in Homo habilis up to 1736cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Thus, in general there is a correlation between brain volume and intelligence. However, modern Homo sapiens have a smaller brain volume (brain size 1250cm3) than neanderthals; women have a brain volume slightly smaller than men, and the Flores hominids (Homo floresiensis), nicknamed [...] "hobbits", had a cranial capacity of about [...] 380cm3, {{about a third of}} the Homo erectus average and considered small for a chimpanzee. It is proposed that they evolved from H. erectus as a case of insular dwarfism. In spite of their threefold smaller brain there is evidence that H. floresiensis used fire and made stone tools as sophisticated as those of their proposed ancestor, H. erectus. Iain Davidson summarizes the opposite evolutionary constraints on human brain size as [...] "As large as <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>and</b> as small as you can".|$|E
