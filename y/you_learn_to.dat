500|$|Lyrically, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye" [...] talks the {{strength}} {{that comes in}} letting go, and it was considered [...] "a sort of sonic sister to 'Frozen'", since both deal with themes of a heart closed towards love. This is emphasized in the lyrics, [...] "Your heart is not open so I must go" [...] as well as [...] "Freedom comes when <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> let go, Creation comes when <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> say no".

Nowels described the lyrics as [...] "stunning" [...] and commended its confessional nature. He also described the track as a [...] "meditation" [...] and [...] "a beautiful poem". Australian music critic and friend of Madonna, Molly Meldrum, claimed the lyrics were about the singer's former husband Sean Penn.

An editor for iTunes claimed the song's lyrics to be sultry. She stated that of the 16 tracks, [...] "Cuando" [...] means the most to her because it is an Rbolero track which would remind men to value women.|$|E

2500|$|Fitzmorris was a Democratic {{member of}} the New Orleans City Council from 1954 to 1966. In his first term, his colleagues {{included}} his subsequent opponent for mayor, Victor Schiro, and A. Brown Moore, a World War II decorated veteran who ran for lieutenant governor in 1956. Fitzmorris represented District 6 from 1954 to 1962 and was the councilman at-large from 1962 to 1966. In the election of 1965, Fitzmorris challenged incumbent Mayor Schiro in the Democratic primary and appeared {{to have a strong}} chance of success. One of the other candidates, Gerald J.

Fifty people died, and thousands of homes were destroyed. The mere challenger, Councilman Fitzmorris, was by virtue of his position nearly outside the loop. [...] "But such is politics, and after it's over <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> laugh it off, which I did," [...] Fitzmorris said, of Hurricane Betsy and the dashing of his mayoral hopes.|$|E
