[...] "Certain guys would have played Ferris and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Where's my wallet?'" [...] Hughes said. [...] "I had to have that look; that charm had to come through. Jimmy Stewart could have played Ferris at 15...I needed Matthew."

500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by many critics, though some {{were not as}} happy with it. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave it an [...] "A" [...] grade, and wrote that what he [...] "liked most of all" [...] was it being [...] "remarkably clear-eyed about {{who these people are}} and what they're capable of". Crystal Bell of Huffington Post described it as [...] "heartfelt, comical and, yes, absolutely ridiculous", and The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg called it a [...] "tearful and touching finale". Though she acknowledged exceptions, Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone characterized the episode as a [...] "nonstop sapfest of too many tears and not enough nostalgia", while Entertainment Weekly Erin Strecker said it had [...] "the perfect amount of flashbacks and revelations" [...] and described it as [...] "a season finale that sure felt like a series finale". Rae Votta of Billboard wrote that [...] "there simply isn't enough time to settle the fates of so many seniors in a mere hour", a sentiment also expressed by Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson, who thought the episode might have [...] "felt a little more logical if it was given a full two hours to breathe". Hankinson also said it left him with [...] "mostly questions" [...] but also [...] "some fury". TV Guide two reviewers were both enthusiastic: Kate Stanhope described is as a [...] "perfect mix of the kids' past, present and future", and Damian Holbrook wrote that the [...] "class of 2012 went out on a high note with a season finale so solid, emotional and entertaining, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> you were watching one of the show's first 13 episodes".|$|E
2500|$|An {{issue that}} affects all the {{international}} {{partners in the}} F-35 involves access to the computer software codes for the aircraft. The F-35 relies heavily on software for operation of radar, weapons, flight controls and also maintenance. The US military has stated that [...] "no country involved {{in the development of}} the jets will have access to the software codes" [...] and has indicated that all software upgrades will be done in the US. The US government acknowledges that Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway and Turkey have all expressed dissatisfaction with that unilateral US decision. The UK specifically indicated they might cancel its entire order of F-35s without access to the coding, without which the nation will be unable to maintain its own aircraft. Allen Sens, a defence analyst at the University of British Columbia stated in November 2009: [...] "What has happened is really quite unusual because we're talking about some of America's very close allies. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> they could build in some maintenance codes that could be accessible to their allies." [...] Sens indicated that the decision could be as a result of concerns about software security and also pressure from Congress to protect jobs in the US.|$|E
