"SIR:– Among {{the members}} of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> formal way their {{appreciation}} of the great zeal, ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session. As chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the Judiciary Committee of the House, the duties incumbent upon you have been exceeding [...] important and exacting, both in committee room and {{on the floor of the}} House. In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous, industrious, painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only of your fellow members but of the people of the state at large. Permit us, therefore, to tender to you some expression of our appreciation of the benefit of the State derived from your earnest labors to say that we all feel that you have fully deserved not only our commendation but a right to the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens throughout the State of West Virginia." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{television}} series Mystery Science Theater 3000, while watching The Screaming Skull, Tom Servo quips [...] "Can I interest <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> defenestration?" [...] {{as the main}} character's husband leads her towards a window.|$|E
2500|$|... "Here Stevens {{sought after}} a massive breadth of effect. There is {{something}} of grandeur and repose in the two figures which reminds <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> degree {{of the work of}} Michelangelo. it is of no use stopping to inquire whether such a use of the human figure is legitimate. In this particular case the answer comes at once – that it has succeeded" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have escaped}} divers dangers by wit--thy wit--but I have bethought {{me that it}} were but {{prudence}} if I bore a weapon, too. Thine might fail <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> pinch." ...|$|R
60|$|How dar'st thou {{interrupt}} my softer hours? By heaven, I'll ram <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> knotted oak, Where {{thou shalt}} sigh, and groan to whistling winds, Upon the lonely plain. Or I'll confine <b>thee</b> deep <b>in</b> the red sea, groveling on the sands, Ten thousand billows rolling o'er thy head.|$|R
6000|$|... "I take thee at thy word, honest sir," [...] said Essper. [...] "By the Creed! I liked thy {{appearance}} {{from the}} first; nor wilt thou find me unwilling, when my voice {{has taken its}} supper, to join <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> pious hymn or holy canticle. And now for the beds!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2009, Don Ritchie, {{a former}} Second World War Naval veteran and retired {{insurance}} agent, {{was awarded a}} Medal of the Order of Australia for preventing suicides at The Gap. From 1964, Ritchie saved 164 people from jumping from the cliffs by crossing the road from his property and engaging them in conversation, often beginning with the words, [...] "Can I help <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way?" [...] Afterwards Ritchie would invite them {{back to his home}} for a cup of tea and a chat. Some would return years later to thank him for his efforts in talking them out of their decision. Ritchie, who was nicknamed the [...] "Angel of The Gap", died in May 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Dick's wealth {{allowed him}} to provide his own funding, and gave him an {{independence}} the other photographers lacked. [...] Stryker attempted to provide some guidance {{for the kind of}} photographs he was looking for, writing to Dick, [...] "It is terribly important that <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way try to show the town against this background of waste piles and coal tipples. In other words, it is a coal town and your pictures must tell it." [...] Instead, many of Dick's photographs are interiors, bars, and images of ordinary life. [...] Critic Collen McDannel has pointed out that, particularly in regard to his treatment of religion, Dick's work is different from most of the FSA file. [...] Because of his composition of images of the poor surrounded by religious items and by ordinary household objects (objects not in themselves indicating poverty), Dick's photographs are less politically clear than those of the other FSA photographers. [...] His composition [...] "transgresses common assumptions about men and religion and therefore appears to be less 'documentary.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} her study, Carlotta {{gave each}} new {{initiate}} witch certain implements: symbolic gifts of Mother Goddesses who are worshipped by Wiccans. From Athena, Ipsita received a black cloak, which conferred majesty and regality on her. Among other gifts given to her were a crystal skull of Kali and a silver bowl from Venus to be filled with water and used in particular rituals. However, she did not receive a certain glowing amber ball of Hecate, which confers vision and is used for toning up the electro-magnetic system of the body. Carlotta told her, [...] "If you have been and are a true Wiccan, the ball will come to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> part of your life." [...] That year, Chakraverti was involved in a relationship with singer Elvis Presley, whom she met in Graceland, through a mutual friend. In 1975, Chakraverti's family decided to come back to India. She lived for a few years in Delhi, before coming back to their home in Kolkata in 1978. There, while teaching at South Point High School, she met Jayanta Roy through some mutual friends and became romantically involved with him. Roy is an erstwhile love-child of the king of Orissa, an Indian state. Chakraverti and Roy got married and had a daughter Deepta Roy Chakraverti.|$|E
6000|$|Hear Genius hear thy children's cry! [...] Not always should'st thou love to brood [...] Stern o'er {{the desert}} {{solitude}} Where seas of sand toss their hot surges high; [...] Nor Genius should the midnight song Detain <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> milder mood [...] The palmy plains among Where Gambia to the torches light Flows radiant thro' the awaken'd night.|$|R

6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said, [...] "if there's {{anything}} {{significant in}} the fact that you gave me that reason last. He failed <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> call <b>in</b> <b>some</b> servants?" [...] {{the doctor}} went on. [...] "I should like the body carried into his lordship's bedroom at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can {{see from}} your face you have {{something}} to say; so we'll have it all to ourselves. <b>You</b> are <b>in</b> <b>some</b> trouble? What'll <b>you</b> drink?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You cannot, if {{you stand}} there at the back door, doing nothing else; but, if <b>you</b> engage <b>in</b> <b>some</b> other employment, <b>you</b> will soon forget all about it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You'd {{better not}} come in here," [...] she said, {{blushing}} slightly; [...] "although I want to take <b>you</b> <b>in</b> to <b>some</b> of the people. I {{think it will be}} a lesson to them." ...|$|R
