[...] "When I heard how massive and epic Enema was for the first time, my mind was blown. It definitely {{made me want to}} be a better songwriter and make bigger-sounding records," [...] said Ryan Key of Yellowcard. In the article, the magazine credits the album with [...] "single-handedly changed the face of mainstream rock." [...] Property of Zack also gave the album a fifteenth anniversary feature, commenting, [...] "Enema of the State has become the single most important album in our overarching community since its release in 1999. It is more important, to this current generation and the one preceding it, than Dookie, or Smash, or whatever <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on that pedestal — and it will likely never give up that spot {{at the top of the}} standings." ...|$|E
500|$|Philippe {{was able}} to get an {{emergency}} loan of $250,000 from a Lebanese company, but this did not go very far to completing the work on the project. [...] He got some help in redrawing his budget and a larger loan of $500,000 from a large Paris bank through J. Jay Frankel, a financier on Wall Street. [...] Philippe's investors believed that the re-budgeting and additional loan would complete {{at least half of the}} resort and allow it to open for business, but Philippe continued to make expensive changes in the project such as adding more windows to all of the suites. [...] When it was evident that the project was once again in financial trouble, one of the investors in the property offered Philippe a loan for an additional $750,000, provided that the project would now result in a more modest resort. [...] Philippe was highly insulted and told the investor offering the additional funding, [...] "I have created a Cadillac. [...] <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into it a Chevrolet engine." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic's K. Ross Hoffman {{described}} the song as a [...] "highlight" [...] from its parent album Trip the Light Fantastic (2007). Nick Levine of Digital Spy remarked that, in [...] "Today the Sun's on Us", Ellis-Bextor incorporated a [...] "guitar pop balladeer" [...] and her vocals are [...] "limited". Writing for Playlouder, Jeremy Allen positively compared the song to {{the works of}} Theaudience, a band of which Ellis-Bextor was part of. Writing for musicOMH, Ben Hogwood observed that it was [...] "pleasant enough", despite recognising {{that it was a}} [...] "grower". He stated, [...] "Also lacking is a big chorus (...) The principal thing it does, however, is make <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on one of her sassier [...] ". The staff of Popjustice listed it as the eighth greatest 2007 single, and opined that the track was [...] "brilliant". This Is Fake DIY writer Stuart McCaighy characterised the song as [...] "warm, layered and soothing with a summery sheen". Emily Mackay from Yahoo! Music likened [...] "Today the Sun's on Us" [...] to [...] "The Cardigans on a bad day" [...] and to the [...] "naffer moments of Pink or Kelly Clarkson." [...] Mackay also found Ellis-Bextor's voice too light to support the track.|$|E

500|$|While {{reviews of}} the film were mostly {{positive}} (receiving an 83% rating on film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes), Mulholland Drive was not without its detractors. Rex Reed of The New York Observer {{said that it was}} the worst film he had seen in 2001, calling it [...] "a load of moronic and incoherent garbage." [...] In New York, Peter Rainer observed, [...] "Although I like it more than some of his other dreamtime freakfests, it's still a pretty moribund ride... Lynch needs to renew himself with an influx of the deep feeling he has for people, for outcasts, and lay off the cretins and hobgoblins and zombies for a while." [...] In The Washington Post, Desson Howe called it [...] "an extended mood opera, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an arty label on incoherence." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety found much to praise—"Lynch cranks up the levels of bizarre humor, dramatic incident and genuine mystery with a succession of memorable scenes, some of which rank with his best"—but also noted, [...] "the film jumps off the solid ground of relative narrative coherence into Lynchian fantasyland... for the final 45minutes, Lynch is in mind-twisting mode that presents a form of alternate reality with no apparent meaning or logical connection to what came before. Although such tactics are familiar from Twin Peaks and elsewhere, the sudden switcheroo to head games is disappointing because, up to this point, Lynch had so wonderfully succeeded in creating genuine involvement." [...] James Berardinelli also criticized it, saying: [...] "Lynch cheats his audience, pulling the rug out from under us. He throws everything into the mix with the lone goal of confusing us. Nothing makes any sense because it's not supposed to make any sense. There's no purpose or logic to events. Lynch is playing a big practical joke on us." [...] Film theorist Ray Carney notes, [...] "You wouldn't need all the emotional back-flips and narrative trap doors if you had anything to say. You wouldn't need doppelgangers and shadow-figures if your characters had souls." ...|$|E

"Not {{to protect}} himself, but to protect her," [...] Peck said, also {{noting that the}} {{decision}} to publish it was made not long after the death of Alice Lee, who had long handled Harper Lee's affairs. [...] "You just don't know how that decision was made... If he had to, he would have flown down to talk to her. I have no doubt." [...] Later in the article, which was posted in The Wall Street Journal, he said, “To me, it was an unedited draft. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> that early version out there or do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in the University of Alabama archives for scholars to look at?” ...|$|E

[...] "As a hunter, I know that a good hunter never aims his gun at a dead carcass. You only point it at something <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on the wall as a trophy." ...|$|E

2500|$|From April to August 2011, RT ran {{a half-hour}} primetime show Adam vs. the Man, hosted by former Iraq War Marine veteran and {{high-profile}} anti-war activist Adam Kokesh. David Weigel writes that Kokesh defended RT's [...] "propaganda" [...] function, saying [...] "We're {{putting out the}} truth {{that no one else}} wants to say. I mean, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it in the worst possible abstract, it's the Russian government, which is a competing protection racket against the other governments of the world, going against the United States and calling them on their bullshit." [...] The conservative media watchdog Accuracy in Media criticized Kokesh's appearance on RT, writing RT uses Americans like Kokesh to make propaganda points.|$|E
2500|$|Anime News Network's Casey Brienza commends the English {{edition of}} the manga for being [...] "amusing and sexy. Good if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> your {{critical}} sensibilities into neutral with something trashy" [...] however she criticises the manga with the comment [...] "its creative horizons are that of a bodice ripper. Don't expect the next modern manga masterpiece." [...] Katherine Dacey, writing for The Manga Critic, criticises Misao for not defending herself even as [...] "demons slash her throat, poison her, push her off rooftops, and slam her against walls." [...] Dacey comments that [...] "younger readers may find [...] sexy, but older readers will see {{him for what he}} is: a wolf in knight’s clothing, posing as Misao’s savior while manipulating her for his own selfish interests." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Jeffries from Allmusic noted Diddy's [...] "unfiltered self" [...] and [...] "unique attitude", stating [...] "This hook-filled, vibrant {{effort is}} that rare heartbreak album that can speak on a lovelorn level {{and then put}} a little strut back in your step." [...] Matt Sayles from The Boston Globe complimented its concept and praised the mixture of R vocals from Dirty Money and the guest {{features}} from the range of A-list friends, particularly Grace Jones stating that [...] "There’s no telling why she turns up but she sounds right {{at home on the}} thumping club anthem. [...] cameo is just one more pleasant surprise on an album full of them." [...] Brandon Soderberg from The Village Voice was also impressed with the artistic creation. He said [...] "Once you hear Pariss mish-mash (Diddy’s word) of sounds, all that producer-genius experimentalism makes some sense. Every song is full of swift change-ups and jarring musical detours; Diddy often interrupts these jagged dance tracks to emote... It’s lots of fun, and though confessional in parts, it’s overall far from the self-serious, petulant complaint-raps of say, Drake or Kanye. Paris looks back to dance music as soulful catharsis and emotionalism, not the cold thump that’s taken over as of late." [...] Nitsuh Abebe from New York magazine said [...] "Last Train to Paris {{is one of the first}} records that's really made me feel like [...] sounds clever. [...] makes what seems to me to be an aesthetic error, which is that if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> sleek, rainy-sounding synths everywhere ... this album hits its mood right, though — gray skies, Eurorail, and drama — it's excellent stuff. The hectic format fades away, and the music actually becomes the hypnotic cruise it aspires to be." ...|$|E
