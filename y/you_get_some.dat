500|$|... "The Moth" [...] {{aired on}} November 3, 2004. The episode was {{directed}} by Jack Bender and written by Jennifer Johnson and Paul Dini. The church scene with Charlie and Liam at the church in Manchester was actually filmed on Honolulu, where the scenes on the Island are filmed. Monaghan says that he feels Charlie's black hoodie {{is a sort of}} [...] "security blanket" [...] that he hides underneath and uses it when he feels [...] "lost." [...] The [...] "heroin" [...] that Charlie is supposedly snorting is actually brown sugar. Monaghan revealed this in an interview with Stuff magazine in October 2005, saying, [...] " [...] brown sugar. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> really sweet boogers. You have {{to be careful not to}} snort too much of it, but it's happened a few times. You just find dessert up your nose couple of hours later." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E
2500|$|Huhne {{was an avid}} {{supporter}} of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson {{as chairman of the}} Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009. Nutt had criticised the government's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug rather than keeping it as a class C. Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was [...] "disgraceful" [...] and commented: [...] "what is the point of having independent scientific advice if as soon as <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?". Attacking the government, he said that if {{they did not want to}} take expert scientific advice they might as well have a [...] "committee of tabloid newspaper editors to advise on drugs policy". Cannabis had been re-classified as a class C drug in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett, only for Jacqui Smith to reverse the ruling in 2008, a decision taken despite official advisers recommending against it.|$|E

2500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Lennie James as Morgan Jones in a brief uncredited post-end credits cameo. It marked his third appearance in the show, after the pilot, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and the season three episode [...] "Clear". Gimple explained {{in an interview with}} The Hollywood Reporter that Morgan's appearance was the [...] "beginning of something" [...] for the character, but would not state further; he instead said, [...] "Looking at him, how he's dressed, how he's acting — it's not a 42-minute episode there — but <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>some</b> hints about where he's at. I would look at that carefully." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, he also noted that Morgan was [...] "definitely dressed better than the last time we saw him. He looks pretty well put together. You know, he’s not talking to himself. I would say that, just laying eyes on him, it looks like a different Morgan." [...] Kirkman stated that Morgan was possibly following Rick's trail, as Rick left him a map in [...] "Clear". He also said that the post-credits scene was used not only to surprise the audience, but to also [...] " [...] story of this episode...into its own contiguous piece." ...|$|E
