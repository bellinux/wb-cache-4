500|$|Hubbard was {{commissioned}} as a Lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Naval Reserve on July 19, 1941. His military service forms a major element of his public persona as portrayed by Scientologists. The Church of Scientology presents {{him as a}} [...] "much-decorated war hero who commanded a corvette and during hostilities was crippled and wounded". Scientology publications say {{he served as a}} [...] "Commodore of Corvette squadrons" [...] in [...] "all five theaters of World War II" [...] and was awarded [...] "twenty-one medals and palms" [...] for his service. He was [...] "severely wounded and was taken crippled and blinded" [...] to a military hospital, where he [...] "worked his way back to fitness, strength and full perception in less than two years, using only what he knew and could determine about Man and his relationship to the universe". He said that he had seen combat repeatedly, telling A. E. van Vogt that he had once sailed his ship [...] "right into the harbor of a Japanese occupied island in the Dutch East Indies. His attitude was that if <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>your</b> flag down the Japanese would not know one boat from another, so he tied up at the dock, went ashore and wandered around by himself for three days." ...|$|E
