40|$|Background  While {{existing}} {{research has shown}} higher prevalence of depression among incarcerated youths compared with non-incarcerated youths, none has studied incarceration {{as a cause of}} depression. Aims/hypothesis  This study suggests that incarceration, in particular placement of <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> adult incarceration, is a factor in developing depression. Method  A records based comparison of depression among <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> different types of incarceration with non-incarcerated youths, controlling for other predictors of depression, namely offence type, family poverty, parents' history of incarceration and demographic profile. Results  <b>Youths</b> <b>in</b> adult placements {{were significantly more likely to}} be depressed than <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> juvenile placements and community-based youths. Conclusion and implications  The findings suggest that there are mental health implications against incarcerating <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> adult prisons, a concern that current juvenile justice might not have considered adequately.

5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden infant death syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his <b>youth</b> <b>in</b> Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he stopped playing football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although studies reveal {{substantial}} {{mental health}} treatment needs among <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> the juvenile justice system, far less is known about young offenders transferred to adult criminal court. This statewide study examined the mental health needs of young offenders who committed serious crimes and were transferred to adult court and subsequently incarcerated in a prison for adults. METHODS: Sixty-four boys aged 16 and 17 years who were incarcerated in the Texas adult correctional system completed the Massachusetts Youth Screening Instrument-Version 2 (MAYSI- 2), a mental health screening measure widely used in the juvenile justice system. Scores from the <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> adult prison were {{compared with those of}} a matched sample of <b>youths</b> <b>in</b> juvenile correctional facilities, drawn from the MAYSI- 2 normative data. RESULTS: <b>Youths</b> <b>in</b> adult prison reported substantial symptoms of mental health problems. Most youths surveyed (51...|$|R
