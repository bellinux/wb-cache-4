Social Work qualified staff who are also experienced in employment law and industrial relations {{provide the kind of}} representation <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from a trade union in the event of grievance, discipline or conduct matters specifically in respect of professional conduct or practice. However, this service depended on the good will of employers to allow the representatives to be present at these meetings, as only trade unions have the legal right and entitlement of representation in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a system for {{checking}} for copying errors, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA (for example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of your 32 ancestors contributed to your mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> that ~3% of your autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet you would have a ~97% chance to have no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA).|$|E

[...] In a positive review, August Brown of The Los Angeles Times jokingly said the song was [...] "almost as good as having shorts in every color." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of [...] "Birthday", criticizing the song's lyrics, as well as calling the song's panting and moaning [...] "overwrought" [...] and [...] "excessive".

We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

[...] Blair was impressed about how Torchwood and Doctor Who crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it [...] "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband Rhys, Ianto watching The Paul O'Grady Show, and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission.

500|$|As a bowler, Verity {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} almost medium pace, faster than usual for a spinner. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, a cricket writer and journalist, wrote [...] "He is a scholarly bowler... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can't explain." [...] His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply. His most effective delivery [...] curved through the air, pitched on middle and leg stump and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge {{the ball into the}} slips. On [...] rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times. However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated. In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets. Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.|$|E

In Macon, the group stayed at friend Twiggs Lyndon's apartment on 309 College Street, which {{became known as}} the communal home of the band and crew, nicknamed the Hippie Crash Pad.

[...] Living meagerly, they found a friend in [...] "Mama Louise" [...] Hudson, cook and proprietor of the H Soul Food Restaurant, who ran a tab when they were short of funds, early on made good with proceeds from Duane's recording sessions on the side. The band's image was radical in the just barely integrated Macon: [...] "A lot of the white folk around here did not approve of them long-haired boys, or of them always having a black guy with them," [...] said Hudson. The band performed locally, as well as 80 miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day.|$|E

The Salt Lake Tribune in its list of the Top 10 series of 2011 ranked Friday Night Lights No. 1 explaining [...] "For five seasons, Friday Night Lights was both the simplest and most complex show on TV.

Writing for music website Idolator, Bradley Stern called the video a [...] "squeaky-clean visual," [...] and praised its bright and colorful imagery, while Daily Express writer Stefan Kyriazis called it [...] "red hot". Mike Pell of MTV UK wrote that the clip continued the bubbly, bright themes of Trainor's [...] "All About That Bass" [...] video, and that the singer's sequinned kitty top resembled one [...] Katy Perry wore for the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. Yahoo! writer Lyndsey Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it [...] "seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from [...] "All About That Bass" [...] "definitely made a statement". Hughes described the video's dance routine as [...] "fierce"; she called it [...] "a super-meta technicolor dance party".

[...] Nonetheless, Sepinwall enjoyed the story between Liz and Drew in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] writing that it was a [...] "better effort" [...] than shown in the previous episode, [...] "Generalissimo".

Entertainment Weekly contributor Annie Barrett wrote that she liked the way the episode handled the Valentine's Day theme, however, was not complimentary towards the way Tina Fey and Hamm were featured in [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] with her observing, [...] "the future for TV's most promisingly delicious couple... might not be so sweet." [...] Before the airing of the episode, Barrett very much liked the pairing of the two characters. Kevin D.
