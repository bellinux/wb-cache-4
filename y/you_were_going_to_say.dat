60|$|PARAMORE (impatiently). Oh, go on, go on: {{finish what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
60|$|WILLIE. Didn't you, though?--Come, speak up, {{let us have}} it. The {{more the}} merrier. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something.|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. Always in my pocket, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I {{know you}} are; {{but you are}} always {{thinking}} away from me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Bernard, laughing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coarse and flattering, I collapse. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> titillate my vanity, I succumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards. Do <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite well off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have a new}} sensation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I {{must have}} heard your criticisms in the train. You were very lenient, I thought." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. G. Always in my pocket, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> I {{know you}} are; {{but you are}} always {{thinking}} away from me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, proceed; you've {{interrupted}} yourself {{twice in}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Perhaps it'll come {{out if you}} try it a third time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something," [...] {{retorted}} Miss Tipping, scathingly, [...] "and {{you might}} as well talk about that as anything else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I Miss Wylie?" [...] demanded Agatha, relentlessly {{continuing}} the torture. [...] "Am I very--whatever <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> Am I? am I? am I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{her escape}} from Germany, I suppose <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> You see, I {{know all about}} it. There was no Prince Shan in Berlin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the {{meantime}} I’m {{living on the}} Wheelers," [...] said the girl, pressing her lips together; [...] "that was what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> wasn’t it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} how you see things. I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> you would marry me!" [...] Benyon rejoined, standing there still, though the dray had passed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Nugent; [...] "but that isn't what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> You {{need not}} worry about me; I shall not do {{anything}} that would displease you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
50|$|Groucho: <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{convicted of}} murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>you</b> leave here. You can ask me--what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|Capt. G. You don't know half my accomplishments yet. Wait till we are {{settled in}} the Plains, and I'll show you how I bark at my troop. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> darling? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what proof have I? Was {{that what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say?</b> None. But I had the {{information}} from the man himself. He told me in the train that night going to London.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is. They {{have put}} a new clock in the tower, worth about sixty pounds. I believe they {{collected}} {{a hundred and fifty}} for the purpose. But <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> settle {{yourself}} in some Christian sort of place, Liz? I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{do it before}} now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have them at once. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luke, old friend," [...] Ned said earnestly, {{putting his}} hand on the cropper's shoulder, [...] "don't be angry with Polly, she has done me a great service. I have learned the truth, and know what you meant now by a life for a life. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself for me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take upon yourself a crime which you never committed to clear me. You went to York to declare yourself the murderer of Mulready, in case I had <b>been</b> found guilty. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate to America to send home a written confession." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thank you,' {{returned}} her visitor, pressing her hand hastily. 'I am much obliged to you. You do me justice, I assure you. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> that I, {{who know the}} story of John Carker's life--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> pretty girl," [...] said Miss Cringle, with calm self-abnegation, [...] "don’t mind me, say it. The captain {{knows what}} he’s about. He {{told me you}} were a milksop; he said you were a good young man and a teetotaller." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] Jocelyn Thew interrupted, {{smoothly}} {{but with}} a dangerous glitter in his eyes, [...] "please don't go on. I have an idea that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something offensive. Better not. Your sister came to no real harm. She never ran any real risk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of doing? I told the general what service you had rendered me, and he asked me what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do. I told him that, as yet, I did not know whether <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay here, or go back again." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{play tennis}} this afternoon.|$|R
3000|$|... “Now {{that you}} know how to {{accelerate}} and brake, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to imagine that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in traffic!” (Trainer 8) [...]...|$|R
