500|$|Other {{significant}} obstacles for {{law enforcement}} were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, [...] "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., {{the judge in the}} DaRonch trial. [...] "He [...] really a changeling." [...] Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.|$|E

In 1991 Van Zandt produced a successful album, Spirit of Love, for Nigerian superstar and raggae icon, Majek Fashek.

That is, unlike the insight of the first rank, which can be easily disturbed, the second rank has greater constancy in the face of distractions. However, seeing the absolute within the relative does not extend to one's behavior towards others. Hakuin describes that at this point one [...] "is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas." ...|$|E

You remember, in your first studies of color from Nature, you were to leave the {{passages}} of light which were too bright to be imitated, as white paper. But, in completing the picture, it becomes necessary to put color into them; and then the other colors must be made darker, in some fixed relation to them.

60|$|The mirrors, however, and the {{reflections}} in them, produced the most singular illusions, and were {{a source of}} continual interest to Rollo's mind, as he lay upon the sofa surrounded by them. There were {{so many of these}} mirrors that the saloon, and all that pertained to it, were reflected a great many times, and thus produced the most wonderful effects. Long passages were seen running off in all directions, and cabin beyond cabin, in an endless perspective. So bright and distinct, too, were {{the reflections}}, that it was difficult to tell whether what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> was real, or only an imaged reflection of it. Sometimes Rollo would see, apparently at a great distance, a man walking along among carved columns in some remote passage way, and then, in an instant, the man would pass directly by his sofa. He had been near all the time, and it was only some third or fourth reflection of him that Rollo had seen.|$|E

D'you know, he was a boy in a grocer's shop and took parcels to people's houses in a basket? That interested me awfully, because I always say it doesn't matter how you're born if you've got the right stuff in you.
