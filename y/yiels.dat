However, the procedure will fail if it generates equations which cannot be oriented into rules (i. e. the system is not noetherian), or if it generates infinitely many rules (i. e. the system is not confluent).

40|$|International audienceA {{near-field}} ultrasonic tomography method providing {{high resolution}} imaging for soft {{tissue in the}} reflection mode is recalled. When the Born approximation is valid, the main limitation of this method is that it requires an incident pulse with infinite bandwidth, whereas the incident pulses used in practice have a limited bandwidth, which makes quantitative reconstruction impossible. The reconstructed image is qualitative {{in the sense that}} it is a band-pass filtered reconstruction of the impedance distribution. An optimisation method based on the use of the geometrical information provided by the tomographic reconstruction is developed to obtain the quantitative information required. The object was approximated locally by an equivalent canonical body, on the basis of the previous global estimation. The inversion procedure is then carried out using the minimization of a cost function, which is the average over frequency of the difference between the measured field scattered by the object and the estimated field scattered by the equivalent canonical body. Assuming the object to be homogeneous by regions, the last step consists in assigning the estimated local impedance value to the region of interest.

In this report, the EF concept {{has been applied to}} four different countries, i. e. Benin, Bhutan, Costa Rica and the Netherlands in 1980, 1987 and 1994. The results of the assessment are discussed and the experiences are used to discuss the current potential and limitations of the EF as a sustainable development indicator. The originally defined methodology has been slightly adapted: 1) the report focuses on individual components of the EF (land and carbon dioxide emissions) instead of focuses on the aggregated EF and 2) the land use calculations are based on local <b>yiels</b> instead of global average yields. Although per capita and total land use highly differ among the four countries, available data suggests increasing land use in all four countries while per capita land use decreases. The EF for carbon dioxide emissions increases for all four countries both per capita and in absolute terms. Differences in productivity, aggregation (of different resources) and multi-functional land use {{have been shown to be}} important obstacles in EF application - depending on the assessment objective. However, despite the obstacles, the study concludes that the EF has been successful in providing an interesting basis for discussion on environmental effects of consumption patterns - including those outside the national borders - and on equity concerning resource use...|$|E
40|$|Swamp {{land has}} {{can be used}} as a paddy field that will be {{potential}} as a rice source However, this land has some limiting factors such as low fertility. On the other hand, continous used of inorganic fertilizer to improve soil fertility will also have some disadvantages. Therefore, an alternative method as fertilizers complement is needed. Biofertilizer is potential to be developed. Previous research had succeeded to explore and selected some bacteria from rice tissues grown on swamp land. That research had found two bacteria Consortium were named as Growth Promoting Endophytic Bacterial Consortium (GPEBC). The aims of this research were (1) to evaluate the effect of a GPEBC population density and a level of N fertilizer on plant N absorption, and rice yield in the swamp soil, and (2) to find out the optimal population density of GPEBC and optimal dosage of N fertilizer on plant N absorption and rice yields in the swamp soil. The research used a factorial completely randomized design with 3 factors and 3 replicates. The first factor was a kind of GPEBC which consisted of Consortium A and consortium B. The second factors was population density of GPEBC which consisted of 0 CFU mL- 1, 107 cfu mL- 1, 109 cfu mL- 1, and 1011 cfu mL- 1. The third factor was N-fertilizer dosages which consisted of 50 % of plant nitrogen necessity (equivalent to 57. 50 kg N ha- 1), 75 % of plant nitrogen necessity (equivalent to 86. 25 kg N ha- 1), and 100 % of plant N necessity (equivalent to 115 kg N ha- 1). The research showed that GPEBC of the Consortium B had a better effect on rice <b>yiels</b> than Consortium A. The population density of 107 cfu mL- 1 of GPEBC increased the growth and the yield of rice grown on swamp soil.

40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} in order to study lactation curves. However, the lactation curves are often not well adjusted since several factors affect milk production. The usual model used to describe a lactation curve is Wood’s Model, which generally uses a logarithmic transformation of an incomplete gamma curve to obtain least squares estimates of three constants: a - a scaling factor associated with average daily yield; b - associated with prepeak curvature; and c associated with post-peak curvature (Wood, 1976). Some disadvantages of Wood’s model are strongly connected with the overestimation of milk production {{at the beginning of}} lactation, with underestimation of the lactation peak: the self correlated residuals and highly correlated parameter estimates (Scott et al, 1996). Fleischmann’s Method is usually used to estimate total milk production. This method generally overestimates actual yields up to peak lactation as well as yield during the period following the last measurement, but underestimates yields for other periods (Norman et al, 1999). The total milk yield estimate according to this method, considers a constant daily milk production between two records and equal to the mean of these two records, which does not describe the true variation of milk secretion during lactation. The mentioned disadvantages led us to consider the milk curve concept as a graphical representation of milk production described by mathematical models. In our work we considered a new approach using polynomial regression, one for each group. Polynomial curves were adjusted to daily milk records for each group and the respective hypo-graphic area was calculated to estimate total yields. An ANOVA to the comparison of these total <b>yiels</b> was carried out and the Scheffémultiple comparison method was applied. This approach greatly increases the power of the test, enabling work with smaller experiments, the reason for this increase being the replacement of classical replicates by time replicates, leading to a great increase in the degrees of freedom. Another advantage of this method is the use of a continuous process instead of an obligatory discrete process conversion. Differences between protein supplements and stocking rate were found using an adaptation of Scheffé's method. We concluded that a lower stocking rate and high protein content in supplement enable higher milk production...|$|E
