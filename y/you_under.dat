500|$|He {{moved to}} Madras in 1955 to study {{aerospace}} engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam {{was working on}} a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, [...] "I was putting <b>you</b> <b>under</b> stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.|$|E

According to Granata {{it was the first}} concept album of his to make a [...] "single persuasive statement", with an extended program and [...] "melancholy mood". Sinatra embarked on his first tour of Australia the same year. Another collaboration with Riddle resulted in the development of Songs for Swingin' Lovers!, sometimes seen as one of his best albums, which was released in March 1956. It features a recording of [...] "I've Got <b>You</b> <b>Under</b> My Skin" [...] by Cole Porter, something which Sinatra paid meticulous care to, taking a reported 22 takes to perfect.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{sings in}} the first verse: [...] "There are too many options/There is no consolation/I have lost my illusions/What I want is an explanation." [...] According to Rolling Stone, {{although}} not explicitly stated, the lines confirm Madonna's belief that American culture will not [...] "give her an explanation", so she had rejected American values, and along with them her own values. She repeats the line [...] "I got <b>you</b> <b>under</b> my skin" [...] while a male voice acts as the backing for the track. The song ends with Madonna singing the words [...] "feel good" [...] a capella. [...] The lyrics of the song deals with questions, solutions, resurrections, confusions and other broad topics of a neo-philosophical nature. Edna Gundersen of USA Today compared its composition and Madonna's performance with a love letter. The Advocate called it [...] "a plaintive love letter to her husband".|$|E

500|$|Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{wrote that}} Rihanna {{appeared}} to be channelling Swedish singer-songwriter and rapper Neneh Cherry on [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] in a [...] "pseudo-melodic" [...] impersonation. Caramanica continued to praise the song and called it a [...] "triumph", writing that the singer [...] " [...] out come-ons {{as if she were}} lapping up milk". Despite raising concerns for younger audiences with regard to the song's overt sexual lyrics, a reviewer for Flavour magazine praised Mr. Bangladesh's production on [...] "Cockiness (Love It). Pip Ellwood of Entertainment-Focus noted that [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", along with [...] "Birthday Cake", [...] "leave <b>you</b> <b>under</b> no misunderstanding that Rihanna is as sexual as she’s ever been throughout her career." [...] Arwa Haider of Metro wrote that the song is [...] "predictably filthy".

500|$|Some of the cantatas {{composed}} by Bach {{in his second}} year were chorale cantatas, a format he chose for services between the first Sunday after Trinity and Palm Sunday. For Easter he had returned to cantatas on more varied texts. Nine of the cantatas for the period between Easter and Pentecost are based on texts of Christiana Mariana von Ziegler, including this cantata. Bach later assigned it to his third annual cycle. Ziegler begins the cantata with the same quotation from the gospel as an unknown poet one year earlier in , the prediction of persecution of Christians. [...] "They will put <b>you</b> <b>under</b> banishment, but the time will come, when, whoever kills you will think that he does God a service by it" [...] (...) [...] She continues stressing the lack of fear possible for a follower who relies on [...] "" [...] (the protective arm of Jesus).

500|$|... "Birthday Cake" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Jayson Lipshutz of Billboard praised the interlude, writing [...] "We're all for birthday-themed naughtiness in pop music form, but only 78 seconds of 'Birthday Cake' {{is just not}} enough of a celebration!" [...] Lipshutz continued to compare the song's lyrical message to Jeremih's [...] "Birthday Sex". Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy was complimentary of [...] "Birthday Cake", writing, [...] "The only misstep on the album – not because it's not amazing (it is!), but because it's only 78 seconds long. 'Birthday Cake' is more decadent Rihanna filth, this time courtesy of sensual R The-Dream. Have any Rihanna Navy members made an hour-long mix yet?

[...] Pip Ellwood of Entertainment-Focus noted that [...] "Birthday Cake", along with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", [...] "leave <b>you</b> <b>under</b> no misunderstanding that Rihanna is as sexual as she's ever been throughout her career." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "Birthday Cake", along with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)", were the most provocative songs on the album, describing them as [...] "I-like-it-rough tracks", but criticized them for being album fillers designed to get the listener out of the bedroom and on to the dance floor.|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{scheduled}} over a 12-day period on Granada's sets and on location around Manchester, following {{a week of}} rehearsals. It was shot entirely on film stock. For the climax involving the rose, Nesbitt was required to be nearly naked on an open set, save for a small pouch that was not visible on screen. There was a risk that production could be shut down if residents of the street they were filming on complained to the police, so the production manager ensured that Nesbitt was covered up {{when he was not}} being filmed. Filming the five-minute scene took about two hours. The song [...] "Female of the Species" [...] by Space was used throughout the programme; the instrumental version plays over the opening credits and the full lyrical version is heard during a first-act montage. The track was chosen by Langan after she heard it on The Chart Show. The rest of the incidental music and the main end credits theme was composed by The Other Two. Adam's song was originally scripted to be Nilsson's [...] "Without You" [...] but the rights to the song were too expensive. The song was substituted with [...] "I've Got <b>You</b> <b>Under</b> My Skin".|$|E
500|$|Among {{the songs}} {{performed}} by Mouse Rat in [...] "Galentine's Day" [...] were [...] "The Way You Look Tonight", originally performed by Fred Astaire in the 1936 film, Swing Time.

Andy and his band also performs [...] "I Only Have Eyes for You" [...] and [...] "I've Got <b>You</b> <b>Under</b> My Skin". Leslie said reuniting Marlene and Frank would be like reuniting Romeo and Juliet, the protagonists of the William Shakespeare play of the same name, or reuniting actress Jennifer Aniston and actor Brad Pitt. She also warns to the camera for Aniston to [...] "stay away from John Mayer", the musician who previously dated Aniston. In the days prior to the original broadcast of [...] "Galentine's Day", Mayer publicly apologized {{for a number of}} explicit sexual and racial comments he had made in the past months, which prompted news outlets to praise Parks and Recreation for the timeliness of their Mayer joke. Ironically, in May 2011, Jennifer Aniston started dating Justin Theroux, who guest starred in the episode, and they later married. Frank made a reference to a recurring gag from Arrested Development when, after being rejected, he announced to Marlene, [...] "take one last look...because you'll never see this body again." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Michael Paoletta from Billboard described the song as a [...] "sparse number" [...] {{and said that}} it was a [...] "good fit" [...] for the radio. Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "lovely". Ian Youngs of BBC News commented that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] is one of the highlights from the album, with layers of dance beats and acoustic guitar that made it a more complete song. A writer for Daily Record described it as a [...] "stunningly beautiful ballad" [...] and considered it as one of the many highlights from American Life. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "dull" [...] and wrote that [...] "it was reinvented into a vibrant piece of guitar-driven pop-rock by Ray Carroll." [...] Ben Ratliff from Rolling Stone deduced that with lyrics like [...] "I got <b>you</b> <b>under</b> my skin", Madonna conveyed the theme of gaining transcendence through detachment, [...] "but finally American Life comes across as defeatist more than anything else". Dan Aquilante from New York Post was dismissive of the track, saying that although {{there was nothing wrong with}} the guitar-driven composition of the track, it was not different from the strings and orchestration of other tracks from American Life, like [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] or [...] "Easy Ride". Robert Hilburn, while reviewing American Life for The Press of Atlantic City, listed the track as one of the songs that could [...] "save" [...] the album from being a [...] "profound fail". Ross Raihala, writing for The Olympian listed the track as a standout on American Life, in contrast to the [...] "dreary, directionless dance numbers and plodding ballads" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|The next track [...] "I'm So Stupid" [...] {{features}} an introduction with a two-chord electric guitar {{which leads to}} a minor drum beat, with the guitar later changing to a three-chord. The composition throughout is generally minor, but at the 2:15 mark, different pitched synths change manically, and towards the end the synths become less prominent as the guitars become the main focus. Lyrically, the song expresses disillusionment with Madonna singing [...] "I used to live in a fuzzy dream" [...] and [...] "It was just greed", also proclaiming that once she was [...] "stupider than stupid" [...] before stating [...] "Everybody's stupid" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song. The fourth track [...] "Love Profusion" [...] starts with another acoustic guitar introduction, with rhythm being produced by a bass drum with synth-strings added later in the song. Vocally, the line [...] "I got <b>you</b> <b>under</b> my skin" [...] is repeated, while a male voice acts as the backing for the track as the final words, [...] "feel good", are performed with no backing instrumental. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is the fifth track, featuring vocoder treated vocals. The song is accompanied by bleeping synths and a heavy drum part. The title is repeated throughout the song as she references [...] "social disease" [...] which is also repeated. A recurring theme of American Life is the acoustic guitar introduction to the songs, and is yet again featured in the sixth track [...] "Nothing Fails". The guitar is accompanied by a [...] "light" [...] drum section and low-pitched vocals from Madonna. The song also features a cello in the first part, and a church choir in the second part. Lyrically, the song discusses a lover who is the one, and how their meeting was not just chance. A reference to the [...] "tree of life" [...] is made during the song as Madonna states [...] "I'm not religious" [...] but she wishes to pray.|$|E

In response to the ruling, SM Entertainment agreed to make a clean version but also had filed an injunction to overrule the commission's decision. The lyrics were changed from [...] "I got you" [...] to [...] "I chose you" [...] and [...] "I got <b>you</b> <b>under</b> my skin" [...] to [...] "I got <b>you</b> <b>under</b> my sky."
