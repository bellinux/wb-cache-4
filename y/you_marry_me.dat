Her only line in the film was asking [...] "Prisoners?", but she later {{appeared}} in the [...] "I Should Have Known Better" [...] segment. Boyd was in a serious relationship with photographer Eric Swayne during this time, and so declined a date proposal from Harrison. Several days later, after ending her relationship with Swayne, {{she went back to}} work on the film, and Harrison asked her out on a date for a second time; she said [...] "yes". The couple went to a private gentlemen's club called the Garrick Club, chaperoned by the Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein. According to Boyd {{one of the first things}} Harrison said to her on the film set was: [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>marry</b> <b>me?</b> Well, if you won't marry me, will you have dinner with me tonight?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{media has}} {{capitalized}} {{on the subject}} matter with television shows, viral videos, newspapers and magazine articles, and pundits that have sharply criticized women for [...] "waiting it out {{for a man with}} a bigger house or fancier car". The television series comedy Will <b>You</b> <b>Marry</b> <b>Me</b> and My Family, which premièred on CCTV-8, that revolves around the principal concept of sheng nu as a family frantically searches for a prospective spouse of the main character who is in her 30s. The series Old Women Should Get Married and [...] You Are the One (MediaCorp Channel 8) have been accredited with minting terms like [...] "the shengnu economy" [...] and further bringing the subject into public fascination and obsession.

The show between 2010-2013 was China's most viewed game show.|$|E

"I am your wife," [...] Blanche said, [...] "though {{heaven knows}} why <b>you</b> ever <b>married</b> <b>me.</b> The Duchess is, I suppose, the woman whom <b>you</b> would have <b>married</b> if <b>you</b> hadn't {{got into a}} mess with your politics.
