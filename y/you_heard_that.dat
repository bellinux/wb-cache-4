The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think {{that is going to be}} my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did you think when <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E
500|$|Leo Depuydt of Brown University {{found it}} ridiculous {{that in the}} Gospel of Jesus' Wife, the word [...] "my" [...] in the phrase [...] "my wife" [...] is written in bold, as if to stress the idea that Jesus was married. Depuydt {{also said that he}} had never seen bold writing used in a single Coptic text before. He wrote: “The effect is {{something}} like: ‘My wife. Get it? MY wife. <b>You</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> right.’ The papyrus fragment seems ripe for a Monty Python sketch…. If the forger had used italics in addition, one might be in danger of losing one’s composure.” Christian Askeland's linguistic analysis of the text shows that it is in a dialect which fell out of use well before AD 741. He concluded that the text must have been written on a fragment of medieval papyrus by a modern forger. Dr. Askeland also found it suspicious that the author of the fragment wrote the same letter in different ways. In addition, Askeland showed that the fragment is [...] "a match for a papyrus fragment that is clearly a forgery." [...] This second fragment, containing part of the Gospel of John, belongs to the same anonymous owner, and is now overwhelmingly considered a fake. This is because that fragment of the Gospel of John appeared to have been copied from every second line of an online translation of John's Gospel in an ancient Coptic dialect called Lycopolitan; also, the Lycopolitan language died out prior to the sixth century, and the John fragment was carbon-dated to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries. Askeland argues that the John fragment was written by the same person, in the same ink, and with the same instrument as the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. [...] Professor King felt that these concerns were legitimate, but that there was still a chance that the gospel was authentic. The Atlantic reported that despite Kings' reservations, the text was widely considered a fake. King later conceded, saying that evidence suggests that the Gospel of Jesus' Wife is a forgery.|$|E
2500|$|In Christianity, antichrist (...) {{is a term}} {{originated}} by the Apostle John, found {{solely in}} the First Epistle of John and Second Epistle of John, and almost unanimously lowercased in Bible translations, in accordance with its introductory appearance: [...] "Children, {{it is the last}} hour! As <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come." [...] The term antichrist is found in the New Testament five times in 1 John and 2 John, once in plural form and four times in the singular. The explanation of the word [...] "antichrist" [...] is given by the Apostle John shortly after, revealing how the name is chosen: Who is the liar but the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the one who denies the Father and the Son. According to the Early Church Father John Chrysostom, one such antichrist, commonly understood to rise in power in the last days and often associated with the [...] "king of the North" [...] in the Prophet Daniel's final vision and the [...] "Man of sin" [...] in Paul the Apostle's Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, ...|$|E
