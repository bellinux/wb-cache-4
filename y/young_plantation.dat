Eleven plantations, 1 - 8 years old, were selected for study and two native Eucalyptus forest sites in the same region were chosen for comparison. Sporocarps of 44 species of putative EM fungi were collected from the 13 sites. Of these, 30 species were found in blue gum plantations. The number of fungal species was highly positively correlated with plantation age and inversely correlated with soil pH. <b>Young</b> <b>plantations</b> (1 - 5 years) had 2 - 9 fungal species and were overwhelmingly dominated by species of Laccaria and Scleroderma.

The Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) was applied to study the effects of the Atriplex plantation on soil and landscape functions. The LFA landscape functional indicators (Landscape Organization Index, LOI; Patch Area Index, PAI; Number of Patches, NP; Patch Number Index, PNI) were measured along seventeen 50 -m-long transects, established to compare five "actions" (CR, Cropped; GR, Grazed; MA, Mature plantation; YA- 1, <b>Young</b> <b>plantation</b> with moderate biomass development; YA- 2, <b>Young</b> <b>plantation</b> with good biomass development).

40|$|Native forests {{throughout}} the world are disappearing at rate of approximately 13 million hectares a year. One of the ways forest managers are attempting to halt deforestation is by growing trees in plantations to provide wood products. Industrial tree plantations will occupy 10 - 20 % of the total forested land area {{in the world by}} 2024. Research into the suitability of plantations for wildlife has grown rapidly in the last fifteen years, but it has focused primarily on exotic plantations. Comparatively little work has focused on native tree plantations, which may better benefit biodiversity in forested landscapes if they act like forests. A literature review of existing work identified that age, size, level of management and the type of forest adjacent to plantations can all affect the diversity of faunal assemblages using native plantations, and that monocultures are generally species poor. This thesis extends the small existing body of work on managed native plantations by comparing faunal use of young and old native plantations with logged and old growth native forests in the North Coast Bioregion of sub-tropical south-eastern Australia. This thesis used trapping to identify whether birds, mammals, and herpetofauna used plantations differently from forests, and ecophysiology, landscape and community ecology theories to explain why they do so. Plantations collectively, differed from forests in vegetation structure and available microclimate at the ground level. The open canopy and lack of sub canopy complexity in <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations</b> resulted in higher insolation at the ground in plantations, which increased environmental temperature up to 200 C above that of old growth native forests in summer during the day. <b>Young</b> <b>plantations</b> particularly presented a challenging environment to potential colonizers sensitive to microclimate. Large daily fluctuations in temperature and irradiance, coupled with the residual effects of management-associated soil compaction may have explained the loss of forest organisms and the persistence of simple understorey in old plantations, despite 30 years of growth and more than six years since disturbance by fire or harvesting. Early maturity (spar) <b>plantations</b> differed from <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations</b> in having similarly simple understorey structure, but closed canopies, producing a cool thermal environment with low light penetration. Although spar plantations are a short-lived stage in the plantation cycle before the canopy is opened by subsequent harvesting, they could represent a valuable habitat resource for forest fauna that prefer cool thermal environments but are tolerant of simple structure. From a management perspective if this stage of plantation is promoted within the landscape mosaic at forest-plantation boundaries, it may provide forest species with additional habitat, and buffer forest from the microclimatic extremes experienced in <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations.</b> Despite large thermal and structural differences herpetofauna, birds and mammals were equally speciose in old growth and logged native forests and <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations.</b> Assemblage structure differed significantly, and plantations were dominated by generalists and woodland species. Small ground mammals were less abundant in <b>young</b> <b>plantations.</b> Thus while afforested plantations provided habitat where habitat was previously absent, in both <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations</b> the ecological resilience of communities may have been compromised by lower species richness. From a landscape perspective plantations offered habitat to declining woodland birds, and increased the functional range of woodland species in agricultural environments. Using small lizards as a model and conducting feeding and behavioral choice experiments, this thesis demonstrated that the thermal environment in <b>young</b> <b>plantations</b> was physiologically limiting to forest species. While temperatures optimal for digestive efficiency could be achieved, they required the species using this forest type to exhibit flexibility in both activity time and substrate choice. The forest species that did not possess this flexibility could not use <b>young</b> <b>plantations.</b> Those species that had the physiological capacity to exploit plantations were behaviourally constrained, and would only be likely to use <b>young</b> <b>plantations</b> if targeted understorey enrichment were provided. The low abundance of insectivorous ground fauna identified from <b>young</b> <b>plantations</b> in this research was not driven by a lack of invertebrate prey, which was equally available in <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations</b> and native forests. Low mammal abundance was likely to have been related to the simplicity of the plantation environment rather than a decline in forest matrix quality associated with cattle grazing. However for herpetofauna, grazing may have increased the permeability of the forest matrix, with a resultant influx of thermophilic species into plantations. Collectively the results of this research stress that: 1) young and old native plantations can support faunal assemblages as diverse as those in native forests, but for small mammals in particular, abundance in plantations is low; 2) cooler spar plantations have the potential to act as thermal stepping stone which may promote incursions of forest species into <b>plantation</b> mosaics; 3) <b>young</b> and old <b>plantations</b> can support an invertebrate prey base as diverse as that in adjacent native forests, with positive benefits on the species richness of insectivores; and 4) the role of grazing in the forest matrix requires further investigation in order to clarify its role in influencing species exchange between plantations and forests...|$|R
