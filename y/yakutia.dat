5|$|P. l. vereshchagini, the Beringian cave lion of <b>Yakutia</b> (Russia), Alaska (United States), and the Yukon Territory (Canada), {{has been}} {{considered}} a subspecies separate from P. l. spelaea on morphological grounds. However, mitochondrial DNA sequences obtained from cave lion fossils from Europe and Alaska were indistinguishable.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Akira Iritani, at the Kyoto University in Japan, {{plans to}} fully clone a mammoth by somatic cell nuclear transfer. He intends {{to take a}} cell nucleus from {{the remains of a}} mammoth found in <b>Yakutia,</b> Russia, and insert it into an African {{elephant}}'s egg cell that have had their DNA removed, to create an embryo and then implant the embryo into a female African elephant for surrogate mother. However, nobody has yet found a viable mammoth cell with intact DNA, and most scientists doubt that any living cell could have survived freezing in the tundra.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of undigested {{food in the}} stomach and seed pods still {{in the mouth of}} many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure are likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being swept away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in <b>Yakutia</b> in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been swept there by the current.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, {{after the}} fall of the Soviet Union, <b>Yakutia</b> was {{recognized}} in Moscow as the Sakha (<b>Yakutia)</b> Republic under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yakutia</b> is {{historically}} part of Russian Siberia, {{but since the}} formation of the Far Eastern Federal District in 2000, it is administratively part of the Russian Far East.|$|E
25|$|Future re-introduction {{is planned}} {{as part of}} the rewilding project at Pleistocene Park in the Kolyma river basin in {{northern}} <b>Yakutia</b> (Russia), providing the population of herbivores has reached a size warranting the introduction of large predators.|$|E

25|$|The northernmost {{swallowtail}} is the Siberian Apollo (Parnassius arcticus), {{found in}} the Arctic Circle in northeastern <b>Yakutia,</b> at altitudes of 1500 meters above sea level. In the Himalayas, various Apollo species such as Parnassius epaphus, have been found at altitudes of 6,000 meters above sea level.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{after the}} {{disintegration}} of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and <b>Yakutia</b> remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|Yakutsk Oblast in {{the early}} 19th century marked the easternmost {{territory}} of the Russian Empire, including such Far Eastern (Pacific) territories as were acquired, known as Okhotsk Okrug within Yakutsk Oblast. With the formation of Primorskaya Oblast in 1856, the Russian territories of the Pacific were detached from <b>Yakutia.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{seven years}} {{after the fall of}} the Soviet Union, the District as it is today was formed by the {{amalgamation}} of the previous Siberian and Transbaikal Military Districts, and on their merger gave up the vast Sakha Republic (or <b>Yakutia)</b> to the expanded Far Eastern Military District.|$|E
25|$|Tokarev's study, The Yakut {{social system}} in the 17th and 18th century (1945), inquired into the social and land {{ownership}} relations of the Sakha people of <b>Yakutia</b> from a Marxist historical perspective. He explored {{the question of whether}} the concept of private land ownership existed in Sakha society before the intervention of Russia.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of Russian nationalism in the mid-1950s. In <b>Yakutia</b> from the 1630s to 1917 (1957), published under his direction, the violence, murder, and enslavements are treated as isolated incidents in a generally peaceful movement of Russians into the territory. Leaders of the local people are often characterized as the instigators of the violence.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{there are}} six {{independent}} Turkic countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan; There are also several Turkic national subdivisions in the Russian Federation including Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Khakassia, Tuva, <b>Yakutia,</b> the Altai Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to Russian).|$|E
25|$|Many Protestants were apprehended under Communist rule of law, {{including}} imprisonment and execution. Vladimir Shelkov (1895–1980), {{the leader}} of the unregistered Seventh-day Adventist movement in the Soviet Union, spent almost all his life from 1931 on in prison; he died in <b>Yakutia</b> camp. Large numbers of Pentecostals were imprisoned, and many died there, including Ivan Voronaev, one of their leaders.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{political}} climate, Tokarev undertook valuable {{work in the}} late 1920s and the 1930s. He spent less time on Australia and Melanesia and {{more time on the}} people of Siberia and <b>Yakutia,</b> perhaps due to political pressure, although he was always interested in both subjects. He made his first field trip in September 1928 in Turkmenistan, and in 1930 visited the Altai Mountains.|$|E
25|$|Siberia, in {{particular}} <b>Yakutia,</b> is of paleontological significance, as it contains bodies of prehistoric animals from the Pleistocene Epoch, preserved in ice or permafrost. In 2015, the frozen bodies of Dina and Uyan the cave lion cubs were found. The region was also {{host to the}} bodies of Yuka and another Woolly mammoth from Oymyakon, a Woolly rhinoceros from the Kolyma River, and bison and horses from Yukagir.|$|E
25|$|The Berkakit–Tommot {{railroad}} {{is currently}} in operation. It links the Baikal Amur Mainline with the industrial centers in South <b>Yakutia.</b> Construction of the Amur Yakutsk Mainline continues northward; the railway was completed to Nizhny Bestyakh, {{across the river from}} Yakutsk, in 2013. Though this one track railroad from Tommot to Nizhny Bestyakh is under temporary operation (30% of its full capacity), the main customer - the Federal agency for railways declared that this railroad will be in full operation in fall of 2015. Also the private company is now constructing the transport and logistic center in Nizhny Bestyakh.|$|E
25|$|Elk Island National Park also {{remains a}} seed herd for {{repopulation}} efforts in other areas. Elk Island elk have been relocated to various parts North America, including Ontario and {{the foothills of}} the Rockies. Plains bison have been reintroduced to conservation areas scattered throughout their historic domain, for example American Prairie Reserve in eastern Montana, Grasslands National Park and the Old Man on His Back Prairie and Heritage Conservation Area in Saskatchewan, and in 2006, 30 wood bison were relocated to the Republic of Sakha (<b>Yakutia)</b> to begin repopulation efforts of the area historically inhabited by the now extinct steppe bison.|$|E
25|$|The republics {{include a}} wide variety of peoples, {{including}} northern Europeans, Tatars, Caucasus peoples, and indigenous Siberians. The largest federal subjects are in Siberia. Located in east-central Siberia, the Sakha Republic (<b>Yakutia)</b> is the largest federal subject in the country (and the largest country subdivision in the world), twice the size of Alaska. Second in size is Krasnoyarsk Krai, located west of Sakha in Siberia. Kaliningrad Oblast, which is a noncontiguous constituent entity of Russia, is the smallest oblast. The Republic of Ingushetia is both the smallest republic and the smallest federal subject of Russia except for the three federal cities. The two most populous federal subjects, Moscow Oblast (with Moscow) and Krasnodar Krai, are in European Russia.|$|E
25|$|Soviet-era sources (Great Soviet Encyclopedia and others) {{and modern}} Russian ones usually define Siberia as a region {{extending}} eastward from the Ural Mountains to the watershed between Pacific and Arctic drainage basins, and southward from the Arctic Ocean {{to the hills}} of north-central Kazakhstan and the national borders of both Mongolia and China. By this definition, Siberia includes the federal subjects of the Siberian Federal District, {{and some of the}} Ural Federal District, as well as Sakha (<b>Yakutia)</b> Republic, which {{is a part of the}} Far Eastern Federal District. Geographically, this definition includes subdivisions of several other subjects of Urals and Far Eastern federal districts, but they are not included administratively. This definition excludes Sverdlovsk Oblast and Chelyabinsk Oblast, both of which are included in some wider definitions of Siberia.|$|E
25|$|He {{was imprisoned}} another time for being {{involved}} in Ukrainian separatist movements and affiliated publications in 1972. This time Chornovil was given six years of imprisonment and three more years of exile. His term he spent in Mordva camps for political prisoners in the villages of Ozernoye and Barashevo. Half of his term Chornovil spent in a penalized isolation cell and a room of cell type (PKT). Chornovil renounced his Soviet citizenship and {{decided to move to}} Canada in 1975, but was not permitted to do so. He joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, which helped to monitor and enforce the 1975 Helsinki Accords. In 1978 by train Chornovil was exiled to the village of Chappandu (<b>Yakutia)</b> where he worked as a laborer at a local state farm (sovkhoz), later as a supplier in Nyurba. In 1978 he was admitted to the International PEN society.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} of Rakovsky's life between that moment and July 1932, {{the moment when he}} was allowed a medical leave. Towards the end of the same year, Trotsky was {{informed}} that he had attempted to flee the Soviet Union, and, in March 1933, it was announced that he had been deported to <b>Yakutia.</b> Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Istanbul. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Researcher Tova Yedlin proposed that the problem was caused by Gorky's distress over having recently separated from his mistress Moura Budberg, {{as well as to the}} writer's close surveillance by OGPU agents.|$|E
500|$|Today, most {{commercially viable}} diamond {{deposits}} are in Russia, Botswana, Australia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In 2005, Russia produced almost {{one-fifth of the}} global diamond output, reports the British Geological Survey. Australia has the richest diamantiferous pipe with production reaching peak levels of [...] {{per year in the}} 1990s. There are also commercial deposits being actively mined in the Northwest Territories of Canada, Siberia (mostly in <b>Yakutia</b> territory; for example, Mir pipe and Udachnaya pipe), Brazil, and in Northern and Western Australia.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, a well-preserved carcass was {{discovered}} near the Maxunuokha River in northern <b>Yakutia,</b> which was recovered during three excavations. This adult male specimen {{was called the}} [...] "Yukagir mammoth", and is estimated to have lived around 18,560 years ago, and to have been 282.9cm (9.2ft) tall at the shoulder, and weighed between 4 and 5 tonnes. It {{is one of the}} best preserved mammoths ever found due to the almost complete head, covered in skin, but without the trunk. Some postcranial remains were also found, some with soft tissue.|$|E

2500|$|Zashiversk ( [...] ; [...] ) was a town {{north of}} the arctic circle {{in what is now}} the Sakha Republic (formerly <b>Yakutia),</b> Russia. It was located on the right bank of the Indigirka River where the river makes a sharp bend around the town-site. It was founded in 1639. It served as a {{fortress}} town and then as an administrative center. In 1803 administrative functions were removed to Verkhoyansk. Subsequently the town suffered repeated epidemics of smallpox. It was completely depopulated by 1898 (one source says by 1863).|$|E
2500|$|... (I) Among {{the others}} Azerbaidzhans claim {{military}} casualties of 300,000, Bashkirs of about 300,000, Mordvas of 130,000 and Chuvashes of 106,470. But {{one of the}} most tragic figures comes from a Far Eastern republic of <b>Yakutia</b> and its small nation. 37,965 citizens, mostly Yakuts, or 60.74 per cent of 62,509 drafted have not returned home with 7,000 regarded missing. About 69,000 died of severe famine in the republic. This nation could not restore its population even under 1959 census. The record breaking estimates of 700,000 military casualties out of a total 1,25 million Turkmenian citizens (with slightly less than 60 per cent being Turkmens) are attributed to the late President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov. Historians do not regard them trustworthy.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1620 and 1624 a {{group of}} fur hunters led by Demid Pyanda left Turukhansk and {{explored}} some [...] of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in {{the proximity of the}} Vilyuy and Lena rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some [...] of its length, reaching as far as central <b>Yakutia.</b> He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the Angara River. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet Yakuts and Buryats. He built new boats and explored some [...] of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a Buryat name) and Upper Tunguska (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) {{are one and the same}} river.|$|E
2500|$|Dmitri Shepilov {{was born}} in Askhabad in (current capital of Turkmenistan) the Transcaspian Oblast of the Russian Empire in a working-class family of Russian ethnicity.

2500|$|He {{was arrested}} yet again for [...] "attempted rape" [...] in April 1980 {{and was sentenced}} to five years in prison, after which he carried out a 120-day-long hunger strike. He was {{released}} in 1983 following the protest of the Prosecutor of <b>Yakutia</b> not to allow return to Ukraine. In May 1985 Chornovil found job as a stoker at the Lviv Miskrembudtrest (City Maintenance Construction Trust) and at a specialized school. In the late 1980s he actively participated in the Ukrainian national movement becoming the first leader of the People's Movement of Ukraine (better known as Rukh). In 1988 there was a first attempt to create the [...] "Democratic Front in support of Perestroika" [...] in Lviv only to be dispersed by the Soviet OMON canine unit. Later he promoted several nationally oriented actions, one of them was the Human chain that took place on January 21, 1990 and commemorated the act of unification of the Ukrainian lands in 1919 (see Act Zluky).|$|E
