40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to derive <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> for beech. The {{material}} consists of 39 permanent sample plots in beech stands. The development of top height during the study was used as the basis for deriving height development curves. the aid of these, individual stands were referred to a certain height quality class, defined as the top height of the stand at a total age of 100 years.

Due to its favourite growing technological characteristics as well as its wood utilization possibilities the present area occupied by black locust stands amounts to 460 thousand hectares. Of its growing districts Nyírség (North-East Hungary) has a distinguished importance where the area of black locust stands is appr. 22 700 hectares. The Nyírség region can also be considered {{as one of the best}} black locust growing regions in the Carpathian basin. To determine their growth rate and yield as exact as possible a local numerical <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> has been constructed on the basis of surveys of the experimental plots established in pure, managed black locust stands. Material and Methods: The local black locust <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> was constructed from data gathered on 105 sampling plots with average area of 1 000 m 2. The total area of the experimental plots was 9. 295 ha.

40|$|Background and purpose: White poplar (Populus alba L.) and {{its most}} {{important}} natural hybrid, the grey poplar (Populus x canescens SM.) are native tree species in Hungary, covering 3. 2 % of the forested area. Thanks to their favourite silvicultural and growth characteristics {{as well as the}} wood utilization possibilities, their present area is increasing continuously. The most important task ahead of Hungarian poplar growers is to improve the quality and to increase the quantity of poplar stands for wood production. To determine their growth rate and yield as exactly as possible, a <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> has been constructed which is based on the currently applied silvicultural practice. Material and methods: Chapman – Richards function with three parameters was successfully used as a growth function for constructing the height growth model. The white poplar <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> was constructed from data gathered on 50 permanent and 40 temporary plots (cca. 500 - 1000 m 2). The age of the stands varied between 5 and 45 years. In the course of the stand surveys the key stand characteristics were measured, and then, on the basis of data collected, were calculated such major stand structure features as the average height, diameter (DBH), volume, basal area and stem number given separately for the main (remaining), secondary (removal) and total stands per hectare. Results and conclusion: The numerical (tabulated) <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> of normative nature presents data given to six yield classes (base age: 25 years) including the most important stand structural and yield features expressing in terms of main stand, removing stand (which can be removed in tending operations) and the total stand.

Even though both sets of tables were developed concurrently in the Institute for Growth and Yield at the Munich Forest Research Institute, a cursory examination suggests they are mutually incompatible, as they appear to use different values of form factor.

This difference is shown to be predictable from data contained in the <b>yield</b> <b>tables,</b> and a conversion equation is developed and tested.

The land base is {{a diverse}} mix of {{reserved}} and production native forests, hardwood and softwood plantations. Forestry Tasmania has a legislated requirement {{to make available}} a minimum of 300 000 m 3 of high quality eucalypt sawlogs per annum.

This paper discusses recent innovative advances in the implementation of plantation <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> at Forestry Tasmania. We show that there are significant advantages to generating <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> dynamically, particularly in relation to the strategic modelling of wood production. The traditional approach, using static <b>yield</b> <b>tables,</b> requires a separate table for each possible forest stratum and combination of silvicultural actions, which can lead to a proliferation of <b>tables.</b> Dynamic <b>yield</b> <b>tables,</b> on the other hand, allow unlimited freedom in choosing silvicultural actions and allocating forest strata yield within a single model. Thus they are a compact and efficient representation of the underlying biometric equations. Forestry Tasmania’s forest estate modelling tool is Remsoft’s Spatial Planning System, including Woodstock. This system provides a mechanism that allows the option of supplying growth equations in a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL), which is called when the system executes. Up to a thousand parameters can be passed between Woodstock and the DLL, and so almost unlimited sophistication can be embodied within the DLL. Woodstock is written in Delphi, and ideally the DLL should be written in the same language. Forestry Tasmania was in the situation, however, where it already had growth models coded in Visual Basic, and so was faced with the dilemma of rewriting the existing models into Delphi, or constructing an interface that allowed compatibility between the two languages. The latter option was chosen, and we can report that it has been successful...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. In forest {{landscape}} level analyses, forest {{information is}} commonly represented by separate polygons, defined by differences in species composition, stand structure, crown closure, and productivity. The simplest approach to projecting yield of stands {{over the land}} base {{is to create an}} aggregated <b>yield</b> <b>table,</b> weighted by area of each stand type (groups of polygons with similar attributes) as a means of projecting future volume per ha and other attributes. At the other end of complexity, each polygon is projected forward, using a particular management pathway where a record of each tree (and other elements) is maintained. Polygons may also be subdivided and/or recombined based on changes over time, and on features identified on other data sources (e. g., soils maps). As information needs increase, the trend has been toward the more complex approach to landscape level analysis. However, data are commonly limited, in terms of attributes, space, time, and management pathways represented. As a result, most resource managers rely on the very simple projection of forests in time, using an aggregated <b>yield</b> <b>table.</b> Others try to represent this spatial complexity via spatial mapping using polygons defined on aerial photography or other remotely sensed media.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 As part of {{the effort}} to {{evaluate}} TRIM (Timber Resource Inventory Model) for the next RPA National Assessment, a study was conducted using natural pine stands in North Carolina. TRIM has been used for regional timber supply studies in both the Pacific Northwest and the South (Southern Timber Supply Study). The model results are tools used for economic planning and policy making for regions in which timber is {{part of the}} economic base. TRIM uses <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> arrayed by age class in the inventory projection calculations. The application of <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> in TRIM can potentially alter the results of regional timber supply analysis. The objective of this study, is to investigate the TRIM growth mechanism and examine the effects of empirically derived yields on TRIM projections. In this process, different levels of data aggregation were compared and two other types of <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> were developed and evaluated. Model projections were based on growth and inventory estimates derived from two successive Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) inventories. Simulation runs took into account "approach to normality", acreage shifts, and timber removals over the range of age classes as described by field measurements. Results were evaluated based on their comparison to FIA field measurements. In most simulations, TRIM growth and inventory projections were substantially below the growth and inventory values calculated from the Flit data. The projections varied with the <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> used, but higher yields produced the most favorable results. For a North Carolina timber supply study, these results would indicate a sharp decline in the supply of natural pine which is the opposite of what was recorded in the field. This study suggests that empirical yield curves do not represent aggregate stand growth when stands have the characteristics found in North Carolina's natural pine...|$|R
40|$|To fully {{harvest the}} rich library of stellar {{elemental}} abundance data, we require reliable models that facilitate our interpretation of them. Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models are one example, {{and a key}} part is the selection of chemical yields from different nucleosynthetic enrichment channels, commonly asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, type Ia and core-collapse supernovae (SN Ia & CC-SN). We present a scoring system for <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> based {{on their ability to}} reproduce proto-solar abundances within a simple parametrisation of the GCE modelling software Chempy. This marginalises over five galactic parameters, describing simple stellar populations (SSP) and interstellar medium (ISM) physics. Two statistical scoring methods, based on Bayesian evidence and leave-one-out cross-validation, are applied to four CC-SN tables; (a) for all mutually available elements and (b) for the 9 most abundant elements. We find that the yields of West & Heger (2017, in prep.) and Chieffi & Limongi (2004) (C 04) are preferred for the two cases. For (b) the inferred best-fit parameters using C 04 are α_IMF=- 2. 45 ^+ 0. 15 _- 0. 11 for the IMF high-mass slope and N_Ia= 1. 29 ^+ 0. 45 _- 0. 31 × 10 ^- 3 M_^- 1 for the SN Ia normalisation. These are broadly consistent across tested <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> and elemental subsets, whilst not simply reproducing the priors. For (b) all <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> consistently over- (under-) predict Si (Mg) which can be mitigated by lowering CC-SN explosion energies. Additionally, we show that Chempy can dramatically improve abundance predictions of hydrodynamical simulations by plugging tailored best-fit SSP parameters into a Milky Way analogue from Gutcke & Springel (2017).

40|$|Estimates of litter {{production}} are {{a prerequisite}} for modeling soil carbon stocks and its changes at regional to national scale.

Next, simulated growth and timber volume was converted to tree compartment carbon stocks and biomass turnover. The study explicitly accounted for differences in site quality between stands. In addition we performed a Monte Carlo uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We exemplify the approach by calculating long-term means of past litter production for 10 species by using <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> that have been applied in Central Germany during the last century.

As {{a country with}} economy in transition and relatively young democracy, Bosnia-Herzegovina might be suitable for understanding the roots, actors and varieties of these conflicts. This paper deals with the most frequent forest-related conflicts, main actors involved as well as undertaken actions in order to manage them in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Material and Methods: The theoretical framework {{is based on the}} Conflict Management Progress Triangle consisting of three dimensions of conflict: substance, process and relations. As particular focus in this paper is given to conflicts between forestry and wood-processing industry, the primary parties in this study were public forestry companies and wood processing companies. For the purpose of this survey a special questionnaire has been designed. The survey population included the most important actors of forest and wood-processing industry as follows: ministries of forestry, nature protection and physical planning at all levels, managers/owners of wood-processing companies, managers of public forest companies and public forest administration, representatives of the most important environmental NGOs and professional associations, managers of protected areas and water management authorities, heads of forest research institutions, economy of chambers and international institutions.

In constructing the <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> it has been assumed {{that the development of}} top height, follows the derived curves. In constructing the tables the increment per cent in basal area has been calculated by means of a function obtained from regression analysis of the empirical data. Special account has been taken of the effect of undergrowth on the oak stands. The content of the fine soil fraction is of great interest. This factor. in combination with site index, has been tested as a variable in the regression analysis. In all functions it proved to be a powerful variable and led to greater precision in the deterinination of' the increment per cent in basal area. The tables show the average stand development for given site quality, here defined in terms of top height at an age of 100 years and content of the fine soil fraction, initial stand and thinning programme...|$|R
40|$|Volume {{growth was}} modeled for even-aged Emory oak stands. Data were {{collected}} from 84 temporary plots located in {{the proximity of the}} Huachuca Mountains of southeastern Arizona. At each plot, trees were measured for current volume using non-destructive sampling techniques. Variable-density <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> for Emory oak were developed from sample data collected on temporary plots. <b>Yield</b> <b>tables</b> are a system of equations used to estimate current yield and predict future yield. A system of equations consisting of two components was developed in this study. The first component predicts yield, the second predicts future yield by estimating changes in density. Basal area is the density measure used. By using basal area, current yield is obtained by determining present stand conditions. Future yield is estimated by adjusting basal area for future stand conditions. Estimated changes in basal area are placed back into the yield equation and solved, providing an estimate of future yield. Therefore, yield and future yield of Emory oak can be estimated by using basal area as the density variable. The variable-density equations are used to estimate the volume of unthinned or thinned stands of Emory oak...|$|R
40|$|We {{applied the}} Local <b>Yield</b> <b>Table</b> Construction System (LYCS), a {{computer}} program that estimates stand growth {{as a function of}} various density control strategies, to Cryptomeria plantations in Taiwan. Parameters of the growth model were estimated from permanent plot data on Cryptomeria stands stored in a database at the Experimental Forest of National Taiwan University. The diameter at breast height (DBH) and the number of trees measured in permanent plots were used as parameters to estimate the curve of the DBH growth rate, the effects of stand density on diameter growth, growth in terms of DBH, and diameter distribution. The estimated stand growth could be adapted to the observed values in the permanent plots. Based on these results, yield tables for various stand density control strategies can now be constructed for Cryptomeria stands in Taiwan...|$|E
40|$|In this study, it {{has been}} aimed to {{investigate}} increment and growth relations for volume and other volume increments of pure and undisturbed timberlines (2000 m above sea level) Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands at Ilgaz Mountain depend on site index and stand age. In this research; the pure, even aged or uneven-aged, undisturbed and naturally grown stand of Scotch pine stands were examined. For this purpose the sample plots of 4 forestline, 1 treeline and 1 dwarfish treeline were evaluated. The distribution of trees per hectare to the diameter classes, height-age, diameter-age, diameter-height, diameter-diameter increment, crown height- diameter and crown diameter-diameter were investigated. These characteristics which were derived from the measurements of sample plots were balanced with the most suitable models. The estimated values of model were compared with {{the values of the}} poor site (site class III in <b>yield</b> <b>table)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1989 The Timber Resource Inventory Model (TRIM) is a {{computer}} model used by the U. S. D. A. Forest Service in assessing {{the state of the}} Nation's forest resources and the forests' probable future conditions. TRIM is a <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> projection system designed and developed to model forest inventory changes over time in response to different levels of management and to removals from either large or small forested areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the sensitivity of regional timber availability projections to <b>yield</b> <b>table</b> assumptions and various silvicultural impacts. Yields were projected under various management assumptions. In addition, the yield projections themselves were tested by projecting yields with and without approach to normality. A literature survey was conducted to assess work previously done with changes in management assumptions, model sensitivity, and approach to normality (i. e., stocking adjustment). In the short run, the projections were constrained by current inventory, growth functions, and harvest levels. In the long run, projections were constrained by growth functions and harvest levels. Inventory projections for all species and combined ownership varied both in trend and in degree between runs in both the long and the short run. Growth trends for all species and combined ownership showed normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking adjustment paralleling each other in both the long and the short run. Growth for managed yields with stocking adjustment exceed the two previous management intensities in both the long and the short run. Empirical yields without stocking adjustment are far below normal yields with stocking adjustment and managed yields without stocking adjustment in the short run, but the three projections converge in the long run. It was shown that the difference between runs with and without stocking adjustment is appreciable in both the short and the long run. Limitations of TRIM include the fact that it is difficult to use for the uninitiated, harvest levels are set, and the stocking adjustment function is relatively inflexible...|$|E

30|$|For example, in Finland in {{the early}} 20 th century, {{silvicultural}} methods were outlined by leading forest authorities and researchers {{based on the premise}} that even-aged fully stocked stands represent the idealized ‘normal forest’. In reality the motivation to promote this simple even-aged conceptual model was that it was a prerequisite for constructing <b>yield</b> <b>tables</b> that would also fit the adopted site type classification system developed by Cajander (1926). However, it was later admitted that such idealized even-aged ‘normal forests’ forests were extremely difficult to find in naturally dynamic forests (Ilvessalo 1937).|$|R
