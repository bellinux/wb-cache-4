6000|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST (at once suspicious). Why impossible? (LADY MARY cannot answer, {{or perhaps}} {{she is too}} proud.) Do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it should be impossible, my man? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right, Shorty," [...] Wild Water forgave him. [...] "But let's {{get down}} to business. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> I want them eggs. I want 'em bad." ...|$|E
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Yes, sir. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>see</b> now <b>why</b> you're {{not so very}} popular, Mr. Gerald.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now <b>you</b> see--you <b>see</b> <b>why</b> I wanted witnesses. They {{are highly}} unscrupulous people. Oh, sar! sar! You must not hit holyman!' ...|$|R
60|$|GERALD. You want to {{know why}} the clerks didn't get their rise?--Because you {{interfered}} and attempted to bully about it, do <b>you</b> <b>see.</b> That's <b>why.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Jimmy nodded. [...] "On {{this side}} of the range; they'd reckon on our pushing south and expect to cut us off. Now <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Stannard's keen about getting down the glacier!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, do {{not look}} so! You appal me! Oh, what can the matter be? What is it <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>Why</b> do you stare so? Why do you work your fingers like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mine {{a yellow}} face? Stop till <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Dobbin. <b>Why,</b> {{he had the}} yellow fever three times; twice at Nassau, and once at St. Kitts." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} {{style of}} director Richard Fleischer received generally favorable reviews. [...] "It {{was only the}} second matchup for the director and Marvin and the actor gives a seething, unpredictable performance as the untrustworthy Harry Spikes. <b>You</b> can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> a trio of farmhands, well-played by his co-stars, would want to emulate him; <b>you</b> can also <b>see</b> <b>why</b> they come to resist the lethal charm of his coercion.", wrote one critic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it's {{impossible}} {{for your father}} to save Gerald by paying the money. It explains why he {{has been forced to}} ask help from Brand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> I won't be engaged? Pat Kerr is {{the best}} chum in the world, yet he finds even a {{possible}} engagement wildly humorous--like mothers-in-law or poets or falling on your ear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> me an' Mary don't get married," [...] he said. [...] "I'm {{some big}} Indian myself, an' I'll be everlastingly jiggerooed if I {{put up for}} a wigwam I can't be boss of." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh!' said Claude, laughing, 'a {{magazine}} is a store, {{and as many}} different things are stored in those books, they are called magazines. A powder {{magazine is}} a store of barrels of gunpowder. Now do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it was dangerous to light a fire?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not. Now Damon, do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> I lit my signal fire? You did {{not think}} I would have lit it if I had {{imagined}} you to have become the husband of this woman. It is insulting my pride to suppose that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't count {{too much}} on that," [...] said Boone. [...] "If you have no {{documentary}} evidence, even the actual owners might have difficulty in substantiating your claim.

2500|$|... "It (Ritalin) {{caused me}} to crank out songs at an {{incredible}} pace. 'I Saw the Light' took me all of 20minutes. <b>You</b> can <b>see</b> <b>why,</b> too, the rhymes are just moon/June/spoon kind of stuff..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you love}} me I beg, I implore, I beseech you {{in the name of}} that love--for your sake and my sake, to leave me. Oh, can <b>you</b> not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> must go?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Yazoo City,' says Doc Millikin: 'I've got {{a little}} saved up there. Two barrels full. It looks good to these Colombians. 'Twas Confederate money, every dollar of it. Now do <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> you'd better leave before they try to pass some of it on an expert?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aaaaaaah! <b>You</b> <b>see!</b> <b>Why,</b> my boy, I {{will not}} only stick, but for you, I shall do the nimble John Alden and win the lady fair. I will so bedizen your virile, though {{somewhat}} crassly practical gifts---- Why, women are my long suit. They fall for----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> I cannot {{come with}} Elvira. Not only do I not dare {{to meet my}} mother, but it might bring down upon her one whom she could not welcome.

6000|$|... "You can see," [...] Sherikov said finally, {{waving a}} chicken leg, [...] "that your {{appearance}} {{here has been}} very upsetting to our program. Now that you know more about us <b>you</b> can <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Commissioner Reinhart was so interested in destroying you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not in}} the unjust accusation," [...] he said to the girl, [...] "that my burden lies, but in the {{knowledge}} that from the moment I staked the first dollar of the firm's money I was a criminal--no matter whether I lost or won. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it is impossible for me to speak of love to her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. Another {{one that}} can't sleep o' nights. Why? Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>why?</b> Because, of course, she sees what's going on.

She knows how I feel, too, only she's too frightened even to look him in the face, let alone open her mouth. He would tell her to go hang herself." ...|$|E
