40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze TPL companies, and their {{collaboration}} with their customers from a TPL perspective. The paper intends to get a bigger understanding of their collaboration, advantages/disadvantages and how the collaboration can be improved. The foundation for the paper is obtained through questions that have been created from the chosen theories about supply chain, third part logistic (TPL) and lean production. We have had open interviews with five different conveyers where we have had our questions prepared and during the interviews asked new questions to get more distinct answers. When we subsequently analyzed the empirical material and by chosen theories we have been able to confirm that the collaboration between the TPL companies and their customers is more of a partnership character. A good relationship between the companies is an important starting point for both parties. But even more important for the logistic directed companies, where a god relationship with the biggest costumers is extremely important because it is with the bigger and recurrent costumers <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> The prices are not the most important aspect when you have a god relationship. The thing that confirms that the relationships are of an partnership character is among other things that they in some areas work with a common development work, which in the end promotes both parties and that the relationship between them is founded on a mutual give and take. Through our interviews we also have discovered that beside simple transports and warehouse services the collaborations consists of long term logistic solutions like for an example development of logistics and information technology. These are the criteria’s for the collaboration to be third part logistic Keywords: TPL (third part logistic), relationship, collaboration, partnershi...|$|E
