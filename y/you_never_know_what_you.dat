5000|$|The band began {{recording}} the album on January 3, 2013, almost exactly {{three years after}} they began {{recording the}}ir previous album Lawless Darkness, and took about four months to complete. The exact order of the songs was left open during the recording of the album. The band also decided to record in multiple studios rather than just one as they had done for previous albums because [...] "being in the studio for that long, working in various places, and traveling around {{like a bunch of}} fucking gypsies with equipment (laughs), it left its mark on the album." [...] Danielsson added that the recording process was [...] "emotionally very demanding and challenging", crediting this for [...] "that extra dimension of diversity and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> expect from it really.

[...] Already before the release of their self-titled album in June 2013, La Torre said that Condition Hüman will probably contain several songs that are heavier and longer than on Queensrÿche, though stressing that [...] "melody is key". Several of the demos from the writing sessions for Queensrÿche are indeed heavier, according to Dutch metal magazine Aardschok co-founder [...] "Metal Mike" [...] van Rijswijk, who had heard seventeen demos in August 2012, and after listening to Queensrÿche remarked: [...] "many of the fast-paced 'Queen of the Reich'-like tracks didn't make the album", in favor of the more mid-tempo songs that would have fitted well on Operation: Mindcrime or Empire.|$|E

40|$|Although widely beloved for its playfulness {{and comic}} sensibility, Chaucer’s poetry is also subtly {{shot through with}} dark moments that open into obscure and irresolvably {{haunting}} vistas, passages into which one might fall head-first and never reach the abyssal bottom, scenes and events where everything could possibly go horribly wrong or where everything that matters seems, if even momentarily, altogether and irretrievably lost. And then sometimes, things really do go wrong. Opting to dilate rather than cordon off this darkness, this volume assembles a variety of attempts to follow such moments into their folds of blackness and horror, to chart their endless sorrows and recursive gloom, and to take depth soundings in the darker recesses of the Chaucerian lakes {{in order to bring}} back palm- or bite-sized pieces (black jewels) of bitter Chaucer that could be shared with others... an “assortment,” if you will. Not that this collection finds only emptiness and non-meaning in these caves and lakes. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> will discover in the dark...|$|E
40|$|Hiring a new {{employee}} {{is like a}} box of chocolates: <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{are going to get}} ” [17,p. 10]. The days of applications and gut feelings alone are over. Interviewing exclusively is not good enough; for every question the interviewers asks there is a book out there which tells the job seeker how the question can best be answered. There are dozens of books on how to impress the interviewer which even include pat answers. These days you can not even pick up a magazine without running across an article about “How to play the inter-viewing game and win”. Job seekers are onto the interviewing game and are prepared, some have even been groomed for interviews. “Those applicants who are particularly adept at projecting a favourable impression in an interview, namely job-hoppers and sociopaths have an almost uncanny ability to tell interviewers exactly what they want to hear”[17, p. 11]. It is not that interviewing is not helpful, it is just {{that it is not the}} single best way. How often have you interviewed and hired someone who did not live up to their promises of knowledge, capability, and willingness. Because so many companies have downsized a greater emphasis has been put on finding and keeping the best people. The time and money spent reviewing resumes and applications, interviewing, training, and advertising will all have been wasted if the new employee does not work out or does not stay. “The cost of recruiting and hiring a new employee has risen 75 % in the past five years, and there are costs to firing too, says Craig Aberie...|$|E
