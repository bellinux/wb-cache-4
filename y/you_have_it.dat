500|$|Disraeli {{told the}} Queen, [...] "it is settled; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> madam!" [...] The public saw the venture as a daring British {{statement}} of its {{dominance of the}} seas. Sir Ian Malcolm described the Suez Canal share purchase as [...] "the greatest romance of Mr. Disraeli's romantic career". In the following decades, {{the security of the}} Suez Canal, as the pathway to India, became a major focus of British foreign policy. A later Foreign Secretary, Lord Curzon, described the canal in 1909 as [...] "the determining influence of every considerable movement of British power to the east and south of the Mediterranean".|$|E
500|$|Burshtein found {{creating}} a believable relationship between Yiftach Klein and Hadas Yaron {{to be one}} of the more challenging aspects of the production. She hoped to keep the relationship between Yochay and Shira enigmatic, with a strong undercurrent of tension, throughout the film. One method of doing so was ensuring that the actors never touched while filming. She explained, [...] "That's how we see the enigma—the power of wanting and then restraining. The restraining is the power. The passion cannot exist if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> all the time—the passion is only for something that you don't have. You have to work to keep the passion. Judaism is all about that." [...] Burshtein considered including a scene in which Shira and Yochay kissed about halfway through the movie but decided against it, believing that the energy would be lost.|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E

500|$|The King Supreme debuted with an {{advertising}} campaign {{created by the}} McCaffery Ratner Gottlieb & Lane agency and commercials produced by Aspect Ratio which featured blues legend B.B. King. The ads pushed the company's lunch and dinner periods as {{the best time to}} have the sandwich and had King doing a voice over in which he alternately talked or sang about the sandwiches. The advertisements featured 15- and 30-second television spots in which King is shown sitting on a crescent moon, playing his guitar Lucille while speaking about the products and singing the company's slogan. The 30-second ads were for both the King Supreme and the company's other copycat product, the Egg McMuffin clone called the Egg'Wich Muffin sandwich, while the 15-second ads were for each product individually. On the radio side, 30- and 60-second spots had King discussing the new sandwiches and singing their praise. The tag line for the ads was [...] "BK and BB let <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> your way," [...] a variation on the company's motto [...] "Have it your way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} evidently worked, as Rinder {{wrote an}} [...] "Apology and Announcement" [...] on June 4, 2005 {{in which he}} told Miscavige, [...] "I recognise very clearly how Treasonous I have been towards you and Scientology." [...] He subsequently commented that such written confessions [...] "read like North Korean POW writeups," [...] alluding to the way that Korean War POWs detained in North Korea were forced to go through brainwashing to renounce their [...] "reactionary imperialist" [...] mindset. He explained to the Tampa Bay Times why people did not simply {{walk out of the}} Hole: [...] "If you leave you are going to lose contact with your family and any friends who are Scientologists. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> pounded into you the whole time that the only reason someone leaves a group like that is because they are bad, that you have done something that force you to have to leave." [...] He noted people had invested a great deal of themselves in Scientology, that Sea Org members have [...] "made a commitment beyond even a single lifetime" [...] and that the prevailing attitude was that [...] "'I've lived through many lifetimes {{and there are lots of}} experiences that I've had that are far worse than this, so I can put up with this and I can stand it'." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>it</b> is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E

500|$|Bassist Jeff Ament {{wrote the}} lyrics for two {{songs on the}} album ("Gods' Dice" [...] and [...] "Nothing as It Seems"), and Gossard for three ("Thin Air," [...] "Of the Girl" [...] and [...] "Rival"). The album is lyrically darker than the band's {{previous}} album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty somber." [...] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album's lyrics by stating, [...] "I think what everyone's looking for, y'know, is freedom...That's part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I {{had a problem with}} being told what to do, and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} sees the band {{moving away from}} nu metal and {{focusing}} on a style categorized as groove metal. With strong elements of groove metal on the album, All Hope is Gone also features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Magazine Yell! wrote that All Hope is Gone [...] "expands on" [...] Slipknot's [...] "thrash metal guitar work and vocal melodies." [...] Prior to the album's release, Slipknot's members displayed interest in making All Hope Is Gone their heaviest album, which Joey Jordison affirmed saying, [...] "It's going to be heavier than , but just as weird and as experimental." [...] Corey Taylor reiterated this, describing All Hope Is Gone as a [...] "very dark" [...] combination of the band's two previous studio albums, Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In All Hope Is Gone, Slipknot expands on their use of traditional song structures, acoustics, and solos that they introduced on their previous album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The song [...] "Snuff" [...] is led by acoustic guitars and has been dubbed as Slipknot's [...] "attempt at a power ballad", though it remains [...] "dark and ominous". In an interview with Artistdirect, Shawn Crahan stated, [...] "Everyone can feel the pain that's in there. It's not forced upon you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> in there innately." [...] Slipknot also retained a metal edge reminiscent of their earlier work. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] goes from [...] "a cluster of cacophony" [...] to [...] "an onslaught of densely dark intricate riffs". Crahan compared it to the song [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut album, explaining, [...] "The technique and the style are very reminiscent of the old, brutal shit that we've done." [...] Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the [...] "swaggering, cock-rock groove and an anthemic chorus" [...] of [...] "Psychosocial" [...] gives Slipknot the potential {{to reach out to}} new fans [...] "without sacrificing a lick of intensity". Crahan stated he [...] "loves" [...] his parts of [...] "Psychosocial", in which the band incorporates snare drums, reminiscent of [...] "Before I Forget". He also cited [...] "This Cold Black" [...] as one of his favorite songs, saying that it has a [...] "driving tempo and a lot of attitude". The track [...] "Gehenna" [...] incorporates elements of Slipknot's slower, more cerebral edge reminiscent of [...] "Prosthetics" [...] and [...] "Purity" [...] from their debut album, and [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from Iowa. Crahan called it a [...] "trippy song", explaining, [...] "It's just somewhere we go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tampa Bay {{newspaper}} columnist Bob Driver wrote in 2006, [...] "Cochems' name {{is mostly a}} footnote in football history, despite his achievements as the forward-pass pioneer." [...] Driver concluded his column writing, [...] "So there <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it,</b> sports fans – a quickie history of the forward pass. Feel free to clip this column and keep it with you.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for The A.V. Club on January 4, 2006, Hayes was again asked about the episode. He said that he told the creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, [...] "Guys, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> all wrong. We're not like that. I know that’s your thing, but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know?" [...] He then told them {{to take a couple}} of Scientology courses to understand what they do.

2500|$|The song started {{slowly in}} the recording, with Medley singing [...] in a basso profondo voice. [...] Right before the second verse started Spector also wanted the tempo to stay the same but the beat would also be just a little behind where they are {{supposed}} to land to give the impression of the song slowing down. The recorded song was three ticks slower and a tone and a half lower than what Mann and Weil had written. [...] When Mann heard the finished record over the phone, he thought that it had been mistakenly played at 33 1/3 instead of 45 rpm and told Spector, [...] "Phil, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> on the wrong speed!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. When you speak with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, {{and when you have}} a word from me, so too <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> from him.” [...] Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, {{painting}} and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|... "For me {{the project}} and the passion for the game are very important. India needs a start. You need to progress. And for me, that was important. I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I {{wanted to be part}} of a new {{beginning}} for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them — but I'm ready and training hard. I like the pressure," [...] he said, making it clear that the USA and Qatar hardly excited him as much as India. Pirès is a regular at Arsenal's training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: [...] "He told me if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> in you and if you have the passion to go play in India, then do it.
