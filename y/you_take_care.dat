500|$|Dudley {{also managed}} several wrestlers, {{including}} Bobo Brazil. Prior to Brazil's matches, Dudley excited the crowds by waving a towel while {{running to the}} ring. Over time, Dudley's role with the company diminished and he ceased working for them; the company's operations were moved to Connecticut, and Turner's Arena was demolished. Shortly before McMahon's death in 1984, he told his son, Vincent K. McMahon, who had taken {{over control of the}} promotion (then known as the WWF), [...] "Whatever else you do, <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of James Dudley." [...] After Vincent J. McMahon's death, Dudley was put back on the company payroll at age 74 and subsequently received several gifts from Vincent K. McMahon to show appreciation for Dudley's contributions to the company. Dudley has been described as an [...] "important cog" [...] in the company, and McMahon once stated that [...] "had there been no James Dudley, the WWF possibly wouldn't exist as it does today". Dudley continued to feel a sense of loyalty to the McMahons and their promotion. Dudley was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame in 1994 by Vincent K. McMahon.|$|E

2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, but I say --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E

6000|$|Tessa {{hesitated a}} little, under a {{recurrence}} of that original dreamy wonder about Romola which had been expelled by chatting contact--"if you were a saint, <b>you</b> would <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of him, too, because <b>you</b> have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of me and Lillo." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Forgive me, if I speak hastily," [...] he said, with diffident gravity. [...] "Why {{have you}} {{resolved}} now on disclosing {{to me what}} <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to have me brought up in ignorance of? Why--since you seem angry that I should be glad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should be}} very much obliged,' said the panther; 'but be sure <b>you</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of them. They always cry {{all the time that}} I am away.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of that. All this {{is quite}} true, but it's beside the point. We are not disputing about what happened. What I want to know--for the third time--is what made you let the cat out of the bag? Why couldn't you keep quiet about it?" ...|$|R
