[...] "I realized that <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> as much as they'll let her have. She'll take it", he explained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Has Mrs. Bonner {{not told}} you?" [...] he said, with a shaking voice;--"there's some secret. <b>You</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the letter, Lady Clavering." ...|$|E
60|$|JULIA. I will not. I am {{not going}} home: I am going to stay here--here--until I have made <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up.|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. <b>You</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{the money}} to do it, which is the same thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> mean--have <b>you</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> or any one to {{understand}} that there was any likelihood of my consenting to such an absurd scheme?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Getting on very well. No motion. Not cold. Slight {{rheumatism}} in Sarah's shoulder. Wants to {{know which}} side of plasters <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> goes next skin, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} did <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the ring for if you donâ€™t want her?" [...] inquired the captain, eyeing him with genuine concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did {{you get my}} letter? Did <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the one I inclosed? Why didn't you answer?" [...] {{burst out}} Brice, after his first breathless greeting.|$|E
60|$|If Mary is {{not gone}} by this reaches <b>you,</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> my best compliments. She is a charming girl, and highly {{worthy of the}} noblest love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or else it was {{administered}} in the brandy <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her.</b> Only three people touched that brandy--you, Miss Tuppence, I myself, and one other--Mr. Julius Hersheimmer!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's a {{good deal}} sharper than <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> credit for being," [...] he replied. [...] "You Easterners never can learn to take {{diamonds}} in the rough." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the cost," [...] she said, {{with what}} was {{obviously}} enforced calm. [...] "Lydie d'Aumont did not <b>give</b> <b>you</b> that promise for nothing; <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> or promised her something in return. What was it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Parker smiled conceitedly, and said, [...] "I don't {{think she}} will raise any {{difficulty}} if <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> {{to understand that it}} is all over between US." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{shall not}} leave me!' cried the old man. 'I am {{strong enough to}} cry out to the neighbours, and I will, unless <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> up. Give her up to me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No she won't," [...] {{declared}} Ross, {{with intent}} to encourage her. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a free hand, I predict she'll make your place the wonder and boast of the county-side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'After the {{ceremony}} <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> three rings and a charm with a cross on it, {{and then put}} her in a cottage in the forest, thinking to hide the matter securely.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was a naughty old lady, Terence," [...] said Mrs. Bellmore, [...] "to tell such stories. Perhaps <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> {{too much}} supper. Your mother doesn't really take it seriously, does she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can guess}} {{what she told}} you. Did I not watch you yonder by the lake when <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a ring graved with the signs of Life and Everlastingness? The {{question}} is, will you pay the price?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hey! friend Brogard!" [...] {{said the}} man peremptorily, [...] "my lady friend would wish to rest here awhile. Could <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> the use of another room? She would wish to be alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> death-medicine?" [...] asked Noma of Hokosa, as {{he stood}} staring after her. [...] "Have you a hate to satisfy against the husband or the girl who is her rival?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There ain't {{anything}} {{either you}} or I can do. Youngsters have to yell jest about so much,--it makes 'em healthy,--an' she'll quiet down after a spell. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> somethin' to eat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only want}} <b>you</b> to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> some other present," [...] said Mrs. Peckover, {{in her most}} persuasive tones. [...] "You may think it all a whim of mine, if you like--I dare say I'm an old fool; but I don't want <b>you</b> to <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a Hair Bracelet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} {{the novelty of}} the emotion must have <b>given</b> <b>you</b> a thrill of real pleasure, Dorian," [...] {{interrupted}} Lord Henry. [...] "But I can finish your idyll for <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> good advice, and broke her heart. That {{was the beginning of}} your reformation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I need no proof, mother. Your {{words are}} enough,' said Raphael, as he clasped her hand between his own, {{and pressed it}} to his burning forehead. But the old woman hurried on 'See! See the black agate which <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> in your madness!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, really, {{you must}} stop this," [...] said May; [...] "I see that my cousin's colour is going with {{her efforts to}} {{understand}} you. Can't <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> something more amusing to think of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} {{distress}} yourself," [...] I said kindly. [...] "I daresay {{that it will}} all come right. You will see Isobel, I think, in Paris. If you do, will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> a message?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very. Did <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> {{one of the}} choruses or a bit of Agamemnon, as you {{did when}} you {{described}} it to me?" [...] asked Rose, keeping sober with difficulty as she recalled that serio-comic scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "Isabel {{tells me}} <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a little lecture the other day. I'm glad of it. We city folks need it {{once in a}} while. We get to {{thinking}} that country folks are necessarily fools and stupids by reason of our farce-comedies and our so-called comic weeklies." ...|$|R
5000|$|She {{calls herself}} a shinigami (the label that <b>You</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her),</b> and [...] "reaps" [...] people's nightmares. Shortly after meeting You, she stabs {{him with her}} scythe causing him to forget {{the name of the}} girl from the lookout. She resembles the girl that You met at the lookout.|$|R
6000|$|He {{could say}} no more, for her master was hurrying {{back into the}} room. Anger was the first emotion that possessed him, and he hardly gave an answer to Dr. May's {{question}} about Flora. [...] "Meta is with her! Where is that woman? Have <b>you</b> <b>given</b> <b>her</b> up to the police?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{you happen}} to pass my eldest sister's house, will <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> this letter?' said she. 'And if you should get tired on the road, just {{take it out of}} your pocket and rustle the paper.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Kate stoutly confronted him. [...] "Perhaps {{the fame}} <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> will destroy her. It {{sounds to me}} like notoriety rather than fame. This poor child has a right to herself, and I will help her assert it." ...|$|E
60|$|HIGGINS. Oh, pay her {{whatever}} is necessary: {{put it down}} in the housekeeping book. [Impatiently] What on earth will she want with money? She'll have her food and her clothes. She'll only drink if <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>her</b> money.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Miss Faulkner {{took your}} message?" [...] she said slowly. [...] "Don't deny it! No {{one else could}} have passed through our lines; and <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> a safe conduct through yours. Yes, I might have known it. And this was the {{creature}} they sent me for an ally and confidant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you {{had passed}} him off just {{as though he}} were a gnat from which you were to receive as little {{annoyance}} as possible, forgetting the influence he must have on those six unfortunate children. Don't you know that <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> that twenty pounds simply to be rid of a disagreeable subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, you've {{done so many}} kind {{things in}} your life, you don't {{remember}} the little errand girl from Madame Tifany's who stole a rose in your hall, and how <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> rubber boots and cake and flowers, and were so good to her she couldn't forget it if she lived to be a hundred." ...|$|R
