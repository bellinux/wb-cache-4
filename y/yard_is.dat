5|$|Most trains {{that serve}} the Bloor–Danforth line are stored at the Greenwood Subway Yard, which opened {{with the first}} segment of the line. Before the yard was built, the land was {{occupied}} by a quarry and a garbage dump. Due to its location next to the Canadian National Railway tracks, {{it was possible for}} trains to be delivered directly to the subway. The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. In addition to providing storage for subway trains, the Greenwood <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The Keele Subway <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> a small {{facility}} {{located between}} Keele station and Dundas West station.

Since June 18, 2017, the yard stores and services four trains overnight with the remaining yard capacity used to store work equipment.|$|E
5000|$|The Youngstown Gateway <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> a {{major hub}} {{location}} on the railroad, until the creation of Conrail. Gateway <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> opened in October 1957, to be a modern hump <b>yard.</b> The <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> approximately 200 acre stretching for a distance of just over 5 mi from Lowellville, Ohio to Center Street in Youngstown, Ohio. Gateway <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> made up of three principal yards, {{and an assortment of}} smaller, special purpose yards. The principal <b>yards</b> <b>were</b> arranged linearly, with the eastern limits of the Departure Yard in Lowellville. The Hump <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> located in Struthers {{in the center of the}} facility, and the Receiving <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> to the west. The special purpose <b>yards</b> <b>were</b> [...] "Diesel Servicing Facilities", [...] "Gorilla Park" [...] and [...] "Interchange" [...] yards. The [...] "Interchange" [...] <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> made up of six tracks, four were for interchange to and from the B&O Railroad and two of which were for general use. The other interchange with was with New York Central Railroad which was a direct interchange. The western <b>yard</b> limit <b>was</b> the end of track for the P&LE. Beyond the western end of the <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> the NYC mainline that continued to Ashtabula, Ohio. The <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> constructed when the P&LE was under the control of the New York Central Railroad. Conrail routing most of the traffic around P&LE facilities in the area. After the 1993 CSX take over of P&LE, Gateway <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> closed and most tracks have <b>been</b> removed. The <b>yard</b> tower still stands but has been heavily vandilized.

5000|$|For {{purposes}} of measuring cloth, the early <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{divided by the}} binary method into two, four, eight and sixteen parts. The two most common divisions were the fourth and sixteenth parts. The quarter of a <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> known as the [...] "quarter" [...] without further qualification, while the sixteenth of a <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> called a nail. The eighth of a <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> sometimes called a finger, but was more commonly referred to simply as an eighth of a yard, while the half-yard was called [...] "half a yard".|$|R
5|$|Although {{it has a}} Sandbach postcode, coarse {{fishing is}} {{available}} in the southeast of Bradwall Civil Parish at Field Farm Fisheries with five pools stocked with barbel, bream, carp, chub, crucian, rudd, roach and tench. The equestrian governing body, British Eventing, holds horse trials in eventing at Manor Farm each year. Plum Tree Farm Riding Centre is the local riding school.

5|$|The {{building}} to the north-west of Exeter Hill, which formerly housed the water-powered bark mill, is now an antiques warehouse {{and the remains of}} the leat and tail race can still be seen. This side of the site was also the location of the lime yard. The other half of the site, to the south-east of Exeter Hill, which was the location of the tan <b>yard,</b> <b>is</b> now the site of an Aldi supermarket.|$|E
5|$|A {{third track}} along {{much of the}} line north of 96th Street {{has been used in}} the past for peak {{direction}} express service, at least between 96th Street and 137th Street. This center track is currently used only during construction reroutes. There is another unused third track between Dyckman Street and Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street. Three yards have connections to the line. The 240th Street <b>Yard</b> <b>is</b> located between Van Cortlandt Park-242nd Street and 238th Street. This yard holds 21 layup tracks and can hold the entire rolling stock for the 1. The next yard, 207th Street Yard holds a few trains that are used during rush hours and cleans and overhauls some of the line's fleet. Finally, the 137th Street Yard has six tracks, which hold rush hour turn-around trains.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, the <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} by General Dynamics Corporation. J. William Jones, President of the company, {{stated that the}} <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> purchased {{in order to provide}} its Electric Boat division with increased flexibility. The <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> purchased for $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars), and Electric Boat managed the yard until its reorganization. Immediately, the <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> closed by Bethlehem Steel on 1 January 1964, and it was announced that thirteen hundred of the <b>yard's</b> employees would <b>be</b> retired or pensioned off immediately or within the next two years, leaving five hundred workers left. General Dynamics immediately invested $ (equivalent to $ in today's dollars) into various facilities in the yard, improving it in many ways.|$|R
50|$|After German reunification in 1989/90, {{freight traffic}} almost collapsed. Therefore, {{large parts of}} the {{marshalling}} <b>yard</b> <b>were</b> abandoned and the <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> completely closed in 1996. The Saxon Railway Museum is now housed in the former locomotive depot.|$|R
5|$|The {{tracks of}} this station {{continue}} {{south of the}} station, down to 25th Street, to allow trains to be stored south of the station during off-peak hours; the tail tracks are seven blocks long, enough to store two 11-car trains each, since the delivery of the R188 train cars was to add 66 more cars to the fleet of the 7 service. There are also two diamond crossovers, one north and one south of the station. The storage tracks at this location were constructed due to the Corona Yard in Queens lacking any space to hold any more trains, and expanding the <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> very difficult due to its location next to the Flushing River. A new storage yard elsewhere would be prohibitively expensive, as it would cost {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars.|$|E
5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) is the work of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular <b>yard,</b> <b>is</b> the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Montpelier {{came under the}} control of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels were reduced further, down to two booking clerks, four porters, a checker and a weighbridge operator by 1950. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. The goods yard at Montpelier closed on 18 November 1965, with the signal box following on 10 May 1967. Staff were completely withdrawn on 17 July 1967 with tickets issued by the train guard. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the northern track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the southern platform. The former goods <b>yard</b> <b>is</b> now a small industrial estate. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E
25|$|A {{portion of}} the Ivy City rail <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{electrified}} in 1934, {{reducing the amount of}} smoke coming from coal-fired locomotive engines. Even so, by the mid 1940s, the Ivy City rail <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> handling 200 coal-fed locomotives a day.|$|R
50|$|In its heyday, the Monon Railroad had two train {{yards in}} Monon. The main <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> 11 tracks wide with a {{capacity}} for 270 cars. The South <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> narrower, 5 tracks wide, but longer and had a 278-car capacity.|$|R
2500|$|After the war, the <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> {{faced with}} new opportunities. As the war greatly {{expanded}} the yard, the yard now had extra space. Thus, the Hingham <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> closed, and the yard diversified its interests. The yard constructed a [...] blast furnace, a wind tunnel, draglines, and steel for an aqueduct of the Boston's Metropolitan District Commission, a transformer for Boston Edison, among other things. The <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> faced with inflation, increasing material costs, and demands for higher wages.|$|R

50|$|The <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> soon overloaded. In 1907, {{the state}} railway {{considered}} enlarging the yard, but {{it found that}} {{the construction of a}} new <b>yard</b> elsewhere <b>was</b> required. As a result, the new Kornwestheim marshalling <b>yard</b> <b>was</b> opened on 29 July 1918. In the future, the two stations were distinguished by the suffixed abbreviations Rbf (Rangierbahnhof, marshalling yard) and Pbf (Personenbahnhof, passenger station).|$|R

50|$|The yard's {{function}} {{in relation to}} the Palace of Westminster was similar to that of an outer bailey in a castle. It was one of three yards in the palace: New Palace <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> the outer ward, a large open space which the general populace could access; the Green <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> the middle ward, where the royal administration and the great offices of state were located; and Old Palace <b>Yard</b> <b>was</b> the inner ward, where the royal apartments were located.|$|R
