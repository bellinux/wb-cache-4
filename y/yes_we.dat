25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then <b>yes,</b> <b>we</b> demand the impossible.|$|E

But there was more. This was being discussed {{as part of a}} five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran."

Although Dworkin publicly wrote [...] "I love John with my heart and soul" [...] and Stoltenberg described Dworkin as [...] "the love of my life", she continued to publicly identify herself as lesbian, and he as gay. Stoltenberg, recounting the perplexity that their relationship seemed to cause people in the press, summarized the relationship by saying, [...] "So I state only the simplest facts publicly: yes, Andrea and I live together and love each other and we are each other's life partner, and <b>yes</b> <b>we</b> are both out." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 2008, Radar Online {{reported}} that the Church of Scientology asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the DDoS attacks. An unnamed source told Radar that the Church of Scientology argued to law enforcement that the Internet attacks are a form of [...] "illegal interference with business." [...] Radar also {{reported that}} in statements to law enforcement the Church of Scientology emphasized {{its status as a}} religious organization in the United States in order to assert that the DDoS attacks can be classed as hate crimes. The day after the Church of Scientology complained to law enforcement about the DDoS attacks, one of the main Project Chanology sites was down, and a message on the site said that their site crashed due to attacks from Scientologists. In a statement issued to Wikinews, a Church of Scientology employee confirmed that actions of Anonymous had been reported to law enforcement: [...] "Activities of Anonymous have been reported to the Authorities and actions are being taken. Their activities are illegal and we do not approve of them. At the same time, our main work is to improve the environment, make people more able and spiritually aware. ... <b>yes,</b> <b>we</b> are taking action." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But <b>yes,</b> <b>we</b> are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E

[...] IGN in their [...] "Babes of Soulcalibur" [...] article noted that while her outfit pushed the line even by game standards, {{they had no}} actual complaint towards that aspect of the character. Team Xbox emphasized that while her appearance played a factor in her allure, her fighting skills and unique weapon were significant as well, adding that [...] "Ivy never disappoints in a swordfight". Leigh Alexander in an article for GameSetWatch noted that while characters such as Samus Aran served as [...] "bastions of dignity", characters such as Ivy filled {{an important role in}} video games too, stating [...] "t looks like Ivy’s back is set to snap – but she’s a game character; she’ll be fine. Why not just enjoy it?" [...] The Escapist noted that the character's behavior and sex appeal defined the character rather than serving as an extraneous aspect, stating [...] "Ivy's oversexed dominatrix demeanor perfectly compliments her confident, punishing move set." [...] UGO.com repeated the sentiment, noting in their [...] "Top 11 Girls of Gaming" [...] article [...] "Soul Calibur's mega-bombastic whip-wielding hottie isn't the only babe in the game, or even the best-endowed...but her combination of sultry moves and revealing outfits shoots her up the charts." [...] In an examination of feminist viewpoints regarding women in gaming, comedian and writer Liana Kerzner cited Ivy as an example of misperception of an empowered female character, noting that when compared to characters such as Wonder Woman the latter was considered a positive character for being [...] "empowered" [...] despite sharing similar exposing outfits and physical builds. She further went on to state that the character was interesting for having [...] "to fight her own flawed battle with no help from anyone", and that women passionate about gaming had more in common with the character: [...] "aggressive, intimidating, combative, and scrabbling through life by sheer will, armed with homemade weapons".|$|E
