60|$|His {{eyes were}} dark and very fine, and his {{delightful}} voice accompanied their visible language like music. He {{appeared to be}} exceedingly appreciative of whatever was passing among those who surrounded him, and especially of the vicissitudes in {{the consciousness of the}} person to whom he happened to be addressing himself at the moment. I felt that no effect upon my mind of what he uttered, no emotion, however transitory, in myself, escaped his notice, though not from any positive vigilance on his part, but because his faculty of observation was so penetrative and delicate; and to say the truth, it a little confused me to discern always a ripple on his mobile face, responsive to any slightest breeze that passed over the inner reservoir of my sentiments, and seemed thence to extend to a similar reservoir within himself. On matters of feeling, and within a certain depth, you might spare yourself the trouble of utterance, because he already knew what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and perhaps a little more than you would have spoken. His figure was full of gentle movement, though, somehow, without disturbing its quietude; and as he talked, he kept folding his hands nervously, and betokened in many ways a fine and immediate sensibility, quick to feel pleasure or pain, though scarcely capable, I should imagine, of a passionate experience in either direction. There was not am English trait in him from head to foot, morally, intellectually, or physically. Beef, ale, or stout, brandy or port-wine, entered not at all into his composition. In his earlier life, he appears to have given evidences of courage and sturdy principle, and of a tendency to fling himself into the rough struggle of humanity on the liberal side. It would be taking too much upon myself to affirm that this was merely a projection of his fancy world into the actual, and that he never could have hit a downright blow, and was altogether an unsuitable person to receive one. I beheld him not in his armor, but in his peacefulest robes. Nevertheless, drawing my conclusion merely from what I saw, it would have occurred to me that his main deficiency was a lack of grit. Though anything but a timid man, the combative and defensive elements were not prominently developed in his character, and could have been made available only when he put an unnatural force upon his instincts. It was on this account, and also because of the fineness of his nature generally, that the English appreciated him no better, and left this sweet and delicate poet poor, and with scanty laurels in his declining age.|$|E

5000|$|The Orthodox mission guides several {{villages and}} settlements, {{some of them}} are fully {{converted}} to Orthodoxy. One of them is the village Ambovandramanesi. It {{is one of the first}} villages visited by Father Nectarios. It has one of the strongest Orthodox communities. This is confirmed by a case which happened here. Once there came to the village two American Baptist missionaries. They sermonized for three days. Finally they promised to build a church, a school, and a hospital if everyone were converted. But the elder of the village speaking for all of the locals answered them: [...] "We could demand your departure at the very first day, but we listened to what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> Now, when you have finished your sermon, we ask you to leave our village and never come back. We don't need your churches, schools and hospitals as we are Orthodox Christians". The locals were not christened at the time and had not given a promise to build something.|$|E

Miss Dorothy Six 8 Brookside Ave. Pelham, 65 New York [Transcription begins]:UNITED STATESARMY AIR FORCES Monday 1830 My Darling, This {{place is}} getting better every day. Reveille was at seven this morning {{instead of the usual}} six, but that won’t last long when we start flying. Today we had sort of a {{physical}} exam to clear us for flying; height, weight, and other stuff. I got by as 5 ’ 11 ¾” by sort of kneeling on the scales, but I’ve lost about eight pounds since I’ve been at Stewart. Then we signed a few papers and had sack time {{for the rest of the}} morning so I’m catching up on my sleep, anyhow;—before the real grind starts. This afternoon they took some pictures for our W. D. A. G. O. forms, whatever they are. And then more sack time. Something must be wrong, I can’t understand it. This field is supposed to be the toughest school in the East, but so far it’s O. K. with me. The food’s not bad, but the barracks are dumpy as hell, nothing like Stewart. They’re all temporary buildings painted a sickly green. The whole field looks like a dump. We have rooms with three in each, so that’s not too bad. Gee hon, I got a letter from you today that you wrote on Teusday [sic] the 19 th. Gosh it was swell to hear from you darling. It made me very homesick, you talked about seeing me Friday or Saturday, and going Christmas shopping. Being up at Stewart just seems like a dream now. It sure was wonderful to be able to see you every weekend. But maybe, honey, in a few weeks it will be every day;—gosh that seems to [sic] good to be true. It was so hard to leave you Friday honey. You looked so swell that day, and were so sweet at the station. Remember you said that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> so much at the station but couldn’t. Well darling, what you said I’ll never forget, just—I love you. You’ve said it before I know hon, but the way you told me then was different. You’re wonderful darling 2 ̆ 6 I love you so much, I wish I could only tell you. A week ago tonight was Christmas; it doesn’t seem possible. We were at Nannie’s; remember? That was a wonderful week. Oh, by the way darling, Happy New Year. This was the first New Year’s Eve when I was in bed at 12 o’clock, I hope it will be the last. I guess you were in bed too though, if you were still in the hospital. I hope you were angel. Gosh it will be wonderful to be married won’t it hon? This place has a real sharp Cadet Club. A big place with modern furniture, indirect lighting and two huge fireplaces. I sure wished you were here when I was sitting in front of the fire with Tom today. You ought to hear us. All he talks about is Janet 2 ̆ 6 all I talk about is you. But you’re so wonderful to talk about it’s sort of a one sided conversation darling. I love you so, my darling. We’re due to graduate on March 11 th, that’s a Sunday. I won’t fly P- 40 ’s until after graduation, and we stay here for that and fly off an auxillary [sic] field. The last class got 10 days leave after graduation. I hope we get that much. I’ll be able to find out more about it when 44 -K graduates in February. I don’t know when we’ll start flying. We havn’t [sic] been issued any equipement [sic] yet. I think we get it tomorrow and start around Thursday or Friday. I get 70 hours here in the AT- 6, and then about 50 more transition in the P- 40 after graduation. I hope you’ll be able to come down here then. Our P. Grad. Course is about five weeks, and I can make arrangements for you before I leave for home and then you could come back down with me. Is that O. K. hon? That is, angel, if I graduate. I know I can make it though, if I try hard enough. It means so much more to me now, because of you, darling. This pen is swell hon, it’s just the kind of a point I like, not too fine and not too blunt. You’ve got excellent taste angel. Every time I use it someone remarks about it. It really is very stunning but look who gave it to me. I love you so. Say, this is getting to be quite a long letter for me. For Gosh sakes, I must be in love. Gee hon, I sure am. Every time I look at this pen I think of what you said about it being guaranteed for ever. I don’t think I’ll ever want my money back on that guarantee. But tell me hon, do you charge 35 ¢ for mailing and insurance? Well darling, I’m going to hit the sack. I love you darling and think of you always. We ought to have a certain time to think about each other. What about eleven o’clock (A. M.) I remember before I left you asked what I’d be doing at 11 Saturday. I thought about you then, and have every day at that hour. I don’t know why. That sounds kinda silly I guess but I’m a hell of a sentimentalist, and I’m awfully in love. I miss you darling. Take care of your sweet self and give my best to Ma ‘n’ Pa. I love you—always Judd P. S. —Enclosed is something for our collection of souvenires [sic]. This was where I had a Scotch in Savannah.
