It was the third-highest-earning film on its debut weekend, grossing about 27 million yuan. The film subsequently crossed the 50-million-yuan-gross mark on 13 January 2012.|$|E

5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, but unlike the former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. <b>You</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E
