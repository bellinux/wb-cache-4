500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy <b>yanks</b> <b>the</b> breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.|$|E

The rope feeds into a spring reel mechanism, called a [...] "trolley catcher" [...] or [...] "trolley retriever". The trolley catcher contains a detent, like that in an automotive shoulder safety belt, which [...] "catches" [...] the rope to prevent the trolley pole from flying upward if the pole is dewired. The similar looking retriever (see photo) adds a spring mechanism that <b>yanks</b> <b>the</b> pole downward if it should leave the wire, pulling it away from all overhead wire fittings. Catchers are commonly used on trams operating at lower speeds, as in a city, whilst retrievers are used on suburban and interurban lines to limit damage to the overhead at speed.|$|E
