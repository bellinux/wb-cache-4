We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

500|$|Milius {{said the}} actors were chosen because their {{appearances}} and personae fitted their roles. [...] He wanted actors {{who would not}} have any preconceived notions to project into their roles. Although Milius had reservations when he witnessed the first few takes of the novices at work, he put faith in them improving their skills {{on the job and}} altered the script to fit their abilities. Schwarzenegger had studied for weeks in 1980 under Robert Easton, a voice coach for several Hollywood stars, to improve his speech. His first line in the film was a paraphrasing of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan's speech about the good things in life and the actor delivered it with a heavy Austrian accent; critics later described what they heard as [...] "to crush your enemiessee dem [...] driven before <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> hear the lamentations of dair vimen [...] ". Subsequently, Schwarzenegger underwent intensive speech training with Milius. [...] Each of his later longer speeches was rehearsed at least 40 times. Lopez's lines were also an issue; although Milius was satisfied with Lopez's work, the surfer's lines were redubbed by stage actor Sab Shimono for the final cut. [...] A source close to the production said this was done because Lopez failed to [...] " [...] a certain quality to his voice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E
