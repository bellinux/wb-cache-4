Well, upon my word, I don't blame you; you might have gone farther and fared worse. These sort of things never come singly, it seems.

It's time <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>married,</b> both of you, for it is not right for man to live alone, or woman either. I have done it all my life, and that is the conclusion I have come to after thinking the matter over for somewhere about fifty years. Yes, you have my consent and my blessing too, and you will have something more one day before so very long. Take her, John, take her. I have led a rough life, but I have seen somewhat of women for all that, and I tell you {{that there is not a}} sweeter or a prettier girl in South Africa than Bessie Croft, and in wanting to marry her you have shown your sense. God bless you both, my dears; and now, Bessie, come and give your old uncle a kiss. I hope that you won't let John quite drive me out of your head, that's all, for you see, my dear, having no children of my own, I have managed to grow very fond of you in the last twelve years or so." ...|$|E
5000|$|Peoria, Illinois, has {{developed}} quite an unusual reputation over the years—such that {{a kind of}} folklore has grown around the name. The famous catch-phrase about [...] "playing in Peoria" [...] has origins buried in vaudeville or burlesque. Don Marine, professor of theatre at Illinois Central College (East Peoria), commented:If one were to choose {{the city in the}} United States most victimized in jokes and anecdotes by theatrical personalities, the selection of Peoria, Illinois, would be a popular, if not likely choice. Two of the more popular quips are: [...] "Say, I hear <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>married.</b> How did that ever happen?" [...] "I was playing a split-bill in Peoria—and it rained!" [...] and [...] "Have you ever played Peoria?" [...] "Peoria? Oh, yes—I spent four years there one night!" [...] The widespread appeal of this verbal maligning by comics, actors and other performers suggests Peoria as a paramount example of the dull, banal, and provincial theatrical road stop. But the popularity of the [...] "put down" [...] suggests as well that the city possesses a theatrical heritage of considerable longevity.|$|E

5000|$|While suturing a patient's wound, Mark loses {{control of}} his faculties and is {{temporarily}} unable to speak. After a CT scan and a biopsy, he is diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, glioblastoma multiforme, that {{is thought to be}} inoperable. Embarrassed, Greene briefly tries to hide his condition, but his cover is blown when he has a seizure while arguing with Carter. With little time, Mark seeks a second opinion from an eminent New York City neurosurgeon, Dr. Burke. Mark is told that the tumor is near a critical section of his brain but hasn't [...] "invaded" [...] it yet and they can perform an operation on New Year's Eve 2000. Mark's surgery is performed by Burke and things appear to be positive, although it takes him a while to return to his old self. A year or so later, however, Mark finds out his tumor has returned, and Dr. Burke both confirms this and says he cannot operate again because the tumor regrowth is now in part of his brain where an operation would render Mark completely vegetative. While chemo treatment will only allow Mark to live for another 5-6 months, Burke points out: [...] "You should have been dead a year ago, Mark. <b>You</b> <b>got</b> <b>married,</b> saw your daughter be born - I'd say that was time well spent." ...|$|E

6000|$|He grudged {{the time}} lost between Piccadilly and his old haunt at the Slaughters', whither he drove faithfully. Long {{years had passed}} since he saw it last, since he and George, as young men, had enjoyed many a feast, and held many a revel there. He had now passed into the stage of old-fellow-hood. His hair was grizzled, and many a passion and feeling of his youth had grown grey in that interval. There, however, stood the old waiter at the door, in the same greasy black suit, with the same double chin and flaccid face, with the same huge bunch of seals at his fob, {{rattling}} his money in his pockets as before, and receiving the Major as if he had gone away only a week ago. [...] "Put the Major's things in twenty-three, that's his room," [...] John said, exhibiting not the least surprise.

No, it was Captain Humby of the thirty-third, as was quartered with the --th in Injee. Like any warm water? What do you come in a chay for--ain't the coach good enough?" [...] And with this, the faithful waiter, who knew and remembered every officer who used the house, and with whom ten years were but as yesterday, led the way up to Dobbin's old room, where stood the great moreen bed, and the shabby carpet, a thought more dingy, and all the old black furniture covered with faded chintz, just as the Major recollected them in his youth.|$|R
