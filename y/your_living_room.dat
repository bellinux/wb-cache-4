500|$|Flower was {{developed}} as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in <b>your</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> it leads you to somewhere else.

To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E

MTV has helped a lot of bands, but they've also helped rob a lot of groups of that special mystique. It's tough when you can see a great rock band on TV one second, then hit the clicker and be watching a soap opera or a sitcom the next. That's what rock and roll has become for some people.|$|E

The {{original}} <b>living</b> <b>room</b> space was laid out as two rooms with pocket doors joining them.

Perry Ellwood's <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to function with the newly added sunroom and south terrace as one large living and entertaining space. The terrace can be accessed through French doors from both the <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and sunroom. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was designed to reflect English country houses c. 1650, during the Stuart period. The room was designed by Roy Terwilliger, an interior designer with Marshall Field & Company in Chicago and May Ellwood's cousin. The <b>living</b> <b>room</b> features a [...] "pargework" [...] ceiling constructed of molded plaster and designed with a geometric theme.
