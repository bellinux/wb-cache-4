500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with the Grand Rapids Press, Dufek recalled growing up in Ann Arbor and meeting his father's Michigan teammates. [...] "Living in Ann Arbor, and seeing {{all the things that}} embody a great university, you learned that there were highly successful people in athletics, and it just made you want to feel a part of it. Then, as you got older, and you got more deeply involved in the game yourself, you just hoped that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to play in college -- and after watching all those games at Michigan Stadium, that maybe Michigan would take a chance on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "you've {{changed a}} lot in three months. I always thought that, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> there'd be no telling where you'd end up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before {{they are}} fried," [...] {{finished}} Tom, with a grin. [...] "You see, somebody might lift {{them from the}} henroost before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to cook them," [...] he went on soberly.|$|E
50|$|To be honest, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "But suppose <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to sell it}} to {{somebody}} at Rawlett's?" [...] continued Harkutt, with a precaution that seemed ironical.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to finish}} your nap," [...] Cummings whispered as, {{kneeling}} aft, {{he began to}} assist Poyor in propelling the craft.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} seen it, had you done it," [...] Lute said. [...] "But it was all done before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to do anything. It was not your hand, not even your {{unconscious}} hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Lizard, [...] "you {{certainly}} are the champion boob. There <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to cop off a nice bunch of coin on that fight and instead you kill {{it for yourself}} and everybody else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It wouldn't do, Steve. It isn't that I don't {{want to do}} it; but {{one must}} play to the rules. I can't explain what I mean. I can only say it's impossible. Let's think of a {{parallel}} case. When {{you were in the}} ring, there must have been times when <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of hitting your man low. Why didn't you do it? It would have jolted him, all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you lose, you {{and your}} friends will find the Butte pretty hot. But <b>you</b> feel <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> <b>a</b> {{fighting}} <b>chance,</b> and you mean to take it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no use of {{all this}} chinning, for I'm not a fool," [...] Jet cried, angrily. [...] "I shan't come out, nor will <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to rob me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "By {{the turn}} of this card, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> Â£4000 or more <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to go for the}} car!" [...] - Bruce Forsyth (to which the {{audience}} would always respond with [...] "wow/wowee!") ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your uncle told me," [...] {{the priest}} continued, [...] "that {{before he left}} England he took leave of you by stealth, in a place you were staying at by the sea-side. Tie had not the heart to quit his country and his friends forever without kissing you for the last time. He {{followed}} you in the dark, and caught you up in his arms, and left you again before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of discovering him. The next day he quitted England." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Floyd, don't be a fool. You've been on {{the border}} for ten years. You've packed a gun and you've used it. You've been with rustlers when they killed their men. You've been present at many fights. But you never {{in all that time}} saw a man like this ranger. You haven't got sense enough to see him right if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Neither have any of you. The only {{way to get rid of}} him is for the gang to draw on him, all at once. Then he's going to drop some of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sampson laughed contemptuously. [...] "George, don't make so much noise. And don't be a fool. You've been on {{the border}} for ten years. You've packed a gun and you've used it. You've been with Blome and Snecker when they killed their men. You've been present at many fights. But you never saw a man like Steele. You haven't got sense enough to see him right if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> Neither has Blome. The {{only way to get}} rid of Steele is for the gang to draw on him, all at once. And even then he's going to drop some of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's different. They stick you {{up there}} and some big stiff amuses himself {{pounding}} the stuffin's out of <b>you</b> before <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to learn. Hunka! Not any! But anyway--Listen {{to some of these}} others." ...|$|R
50|$|Suslick's Law of Threes:It {{always takes}} {{three times to}} do {{anything}} right. The first time you either overshoot or undershoot; the second time you either over-compensate or under-compensate; it's not until the third time that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to get it right.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{hang around}} {{until they get}} back and {{see to it that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to talk with her before she goes to her room," [...] {{returned}} Tom; and then, as some other people came up, the conversation had to come to an end.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{supposed}} I was goin' to {{set down}} same as I would at home, where we put the vittles on the table. W-wondered what I was goin' to eat--wahn't nothin' but {{a piece of bread}} on the table. S-sat there and watched 'em--nobody ate anything. Presently I found out that Binney's wife ran her house same as they run hotels. Pretty soon a couple of girls come in and put down some food and took it away again before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> A-after a while we had coffee, and when I set my cup on the table, I noticed Mis' Binney looked kind of cross and began whisperin' to the girls. One of 'em fetched a small plate and took my cup {{and set it on the}} plate. That was all right. I used the plate.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{it is not}} submission. Bear with me when I say it is {{rebellion}}, still deeper rebellion than ever. God says to you, `You {{have destroyed}} yourself but in me is your help.' He says, `Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow.' He says, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall be saved,' and assures you that `whoever will' may come to Him, {{and that no one}} who comes shall be cast out--yet {{in the face of all}} that you tell me that the love of God and the salvation of Christ are not for you! Ralph, my friend, you think that if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of living your life over again you would do better and so deserve salvation. That is exactly what God tells us we cannot do, and then He tells us that He Himself, in Jesus Christ, has provided salvation from sin for us, offers it as a free unmerited gift; and immediately we dive to the deepest depth of sin by deliberately refusing this deliverance from sin unless we can somehow manage to deserve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he was {{not afraid}}--that is, {{he was not}} afraid of the journey, though it lay all through those dreadful wild Champs Elysees. But when we arrived, he was afraid to come in--to come up here. Captain Lovelock is so modest, you know--in spite of all the success he had in America. He will tell you about the success he had in America; it quite makes up for the defeat of the British army in the Revolution. They were {{defeated}} in the Revolution, the British, were n't they? I always told him so, but he insists they were not. 'How do we come to be free, then?' I always ask him; 'I suppose you admit that we are free.' Then he becomes personal and says that I am free enough, certainly. But it 's the general fact I mean; I wish you would tell him about the general fact. I think he would believe you, because he knows you {{know a great deal about}} history and all that. I don't mean this evening, but some time when it is convenient. He did n't want to come in--he wanted to stay in the carriage and smoke a cigar; he thought you would n't like it, his coming with me the first time. But I told him he need n't mind that, for I would certainly explain. I would be very careful to let you know that I brought him only as a substitute. A substitute for whom? A substitute for my husband, of course. My dear Mrs. Vivian, of course I ought to bring you some pretty message from Gordon--that he is dying to come and see you, only that he had nineteen letters to write and that he could n't possibly stir from his fireside. I suppose a good wife ought to invent excuses for her husband--ought to throw herself into the breach; is n't that what they call it? But I am afraid I am not a good wife. Do you think I am a good wife, Mr. Longueville? You once stayed three months with us, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see. I don't ask you that seriously, because you never tell the truth. I always do; so I will say I am not a good wife. And then the breach is too big, and I am too little. Oh, I am too little, Mrs. Vivian; I know I am too little. I am the smallest woman living; Gordon can scarcely see me with a microscope, and I believe he has the most powerful one in America. He is going to get another here; that is one of the things he came abroad for; perhaps it will do better. I do tell the truth, don't I, Mrs. Vivian? I have that merit, if I have n't any other. You once told me so at Baden; you said you could say one thing for me, at any rate--that I did n't tell fibs. You were very nice to me at Baden," [...] Blanche went on, with her little intent smile, laying her hand in that of her hostess. [...] "You see, I have never forgotten it. So, to keep up my reputation, I must tell the truth about Gordon. He simply said he would n't come--voila! He gave no reason and he did n't send you any pretty message. He simply declined, and he went out somewhere else. So you see he is n't writing letters. I don't know where he can have gone; perhaps he has gone to the theatre. I know it is n't proper to go to the theatre on Sunday evening; but they say charity begins at home, and as Gordon's does n't begin at home, perhaps it does n't begin anywhere. I told him that if he would n't come with me I would come alone, and he said I might do as I chose--that he was not in a humor for making visits. I wanted to come to you very much; I had been thinking about it all day; and I am so fond of a visit like this in the evening, without being invited. Then I thought perhaps you had a salon--does n't every one in Paris have a salon? I tried to have a salon in New York, only Gordon said it would n't do. He said it was n't in our manners. Is this a salon to-night, Mrs. Vivian? Oh, do say it is; I should like so much to see Captain Lovelock in a salon! By good fortune he happened to have been dining with us; so I told him he must bring me here. I told you I would explain, Captain Lovelock," [...] she added, [...] "and I hope you think I have made it clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{were you}} I would make no such attempt. It will do no good. I {{do not think}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> of being acquitted,--not a chance; and then how much worse it will be for Hester when she finds herself still in your house!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{news for}} you," [...] he said, in his broken English. [...] "Your {{warships}} fight, bang, bang, bang! {{down by the}} water, at Aguadores and udder places. Think ships go up by Guantanamo Bay, maybe. If sailors land, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to join them--not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "THAT'S {{the last}} part of it I'd ever doubt," [...] replied the rider. [...] "It's settled, then. I'll camp here. I'll be well in a few days. Then I'll take Wildfire in hand. You will ride out {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance,</b> without bein' seen. An' the two of us will train the stallion to upset that race." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hall {{had been}} indelibly marked by his {{experience}} {{going through the}} Great Depression in Saskatchewan. One {{of his friends and}} fellow Saskatchewanian, Ramon Hnatyshyn, former Governor General of Canada, commented: [...] "They were tough times. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see real deprivation and the importance of helping your fellow citizen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wilhelmina confides to Marc that she's {{considering}} {{leaving the}} country with Connor. [...] "Mode is your life," [...] he tells her, and she insists it's her one chance at love. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to have all the}} money you ever needed and be with the person you loved {{for the rest of your}} life, would you do it?" [...] Marc doesn't know what to tell her.|$|E
5000|$|... {{came to us}} with an {{idea that}} was undeniably good. It {{was such a great}} premise for a series that it was just that feeling of the misery that you'd feel if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to be part of that}} and didn't take {{advantage}} of it. I'm really looking forward to that show. He's so obviously the real deal, and we're just really lucky and honored that he wanted to collaborate with us on it.|$|E
50|$|Some {{play with}} a new declarer and dealer each round instead of every seven rounds. This makes for more varied play, but {{requires}} precise recording of who has declared what and who has doubled whom. This is often more exciting, as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> {{to get back into}} the running late in the game, even if you are the first to deal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad he has come," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "It is {{much better}} to see a thing than merely to be told about it, and now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see for yourselves the {{differences}} between two cousins very closely related, Danny Meadow Mouse and Piney the Pine Mouse. What difference do you see, Happy Jack Squirrel?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{important}} to have Kapil Dev here, he's such a famous person in India...If you are well-known, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to change people's attitude... We need more such events. If people see disabled kids play, they start thinking: 'If they can play, they can do other things as well. Why can't they work? They don't have to be burden on family.' This is what we want." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} criticized for being too {{predictable}} and having a [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "unfunny" [...] sense of humor. Anders Wotzke from Cut Print Review called the film less funny than the 1993 Holocaust film Schindler's List.Stars from the film have acknowledged critical dislike of the film. During his Lifetime Achievement Award speech at the Golden Globes, Robert De Niro poked fun at the critical drubbing the film received, stating, [...] "I was very, very moved and gratified when you made the announcement this award two months ago, well before <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to review Little Fockers".|$|E

5000|$|After 36 years passed, a fight {{broke out}} between the Yadavas, at a festival, who killed each other. His elder brother, Balarama, then gave up his body using Yoga. Krishna retired into the forest and started meditating under a tree. The Mahabharata also narrates {{the story of a}} hunter who becomes an {{instrument}} for Krishna's departure from the world. The hunter Jara, mistook Krishna's partly visible left foot for that of a deer, and shot an arrow, wounding him mortally. After he realised the mistake, While still bleeding, Krishna told Jara, [...] "O Jara, you were Bali in your previous birth, killed by myself as Rama in Tretayuga. Here <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to even it and since all acts in this world are done as desired by me, you need not worry for this". Then Krishna, with his physical body ascended back to his eternal abode, Goloka vrindavan and this event marks departure of Krishna from the earth. The news was conveyed to Hastinapur and Dwaraka by eyewitnesses to this event. The place of this incident is believed to be Bhalka, near Somnath temple.|$|E

What are the alternatives to the set-theoretic foundation of mathematics? Besides, set theory seems to play a significant role in computer science; is there a good justification for that?
