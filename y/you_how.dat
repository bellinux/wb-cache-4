The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from <b>you</b> <b>how</b> the matter standeth, or how this evil should light upon me, considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E
25|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for residents to access other remote areas by foot. Most locals can tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> many days it would take to walk to most locations within the country. Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E

25|$|Moore's {{scenario}} remains untested. Addressing historical developments when DC reissued the work, he noted:Naïveté {{can also}} be detected in my supposition {{that it would take}} something as melodramatic as a near-miss nuclear conflict to nudge Britain towards fascism... The simple fact that much of the historical background of the story proceeds from a predicted Conservative defeat in the 1983 General Election should tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> reliable we were in our roles as Cassandras.|$|E
25|$|I can’t tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> pleased I was to {{see this}} place again. In a moment one goes over the years; every shrub, every turn, every peep of the house has a little history in it. The weather is {{delightful}} and the place looks beautiful. The trees are all so grown and there a thousand pretty sheltered spots, which near the sea in this season is very pleasant. The birds sing, the flowers blow, and make me for moments forget the world and all the villainy and tyranny going on in it.|$|E
25|$|They {{deprive the}} sinner of his life; I shall truly tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> this is done. The wicked (punishers) remind by (similar) {{punishment}} (their victims) of all sins they had committed {{in a former}} life. Being killed they are thrown into a hell which is full of boiling filth. There they stay eating filth, and they are eaten by vermin. And there is an always crowded, hot place, which men deserve for their great sins, and which is full of misery. (The punishers) put them in shackles, beat their bodies, and torment them (by perforating) their skulls with drills. They cut off the sinner's nose with a razor, they cut off both his ears and lips; they pull out his tongue a span's length and torment (him by piercing it) with sharp pikes. There the sinners dripping (with blood) whine day and night even as the dry leaves of a palm-tree (agitated by the wind). Their blood, matter, and flesh are dropping off while they are roasted, their bodies being besmeared with natron. Have you heard of the large, erected caldron of more than man's size, full of blood and matter, which is extremely heated by a fresh fire, in which blood and matter are boiling? The sinners are thrown into it and boiled there, while they utter horrid cries of 'Agony; they are made to drink molten lead and copper when they are thirsty, and they shriek still more horribly. Those evildoers who have here forfeited their souls' (happiness) {{for the sake of}} small (pleasures), and have been born in the lowest births during hundred thousands of million years will stay in this (hell). Their punishment will be adequate to their deeds. The wicked who have committed crimes will atone for them, deprived of all pleasant and lovely objects, by dwelling in the stinking crowded hell, a scene of pain, which is full of flesh.|$|E

500|$|The {{scandal has}} {{affected}} numerous people and organizations associated with Goldschmidt. Many {{people have been}} accused of knowing of the crime, but failing to act accordingly. Debby Kennedy, who worked for Goldschmidt while he was governor, recalled, [...] "I just can't tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> many rumors there were about him then." [...] Multnomah County Sheriff Bernie Giusto, who admitted knowing about the abuse, announced his early retirement in February 2008.|$|E

It's because Mitt Romney, who is telling people he's an opponent of same-sex marriage, forced the justices of the peace and others to perform same-sex marriage, all on his own, with no authorization or requirement from the court.

500|$|Peter, not cowardly {{enough to}} fear an old woman, nor superstitious {{enough to believe}} in her power, {{threaten}}s the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. [...] "He's showing <b>you</b> <b>how</b> he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," [...] exclaims the old lady, but he replies [...] "No, my dear!" [...] I'm showing <b>you</b> <b>how</b> the enemy fought us. This {{is the way they}} retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from his pencil sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to feel, tells <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E

The actress has commented that this [...] "tore [...] to pieces", and [...] "I can't begin to tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> much I regret his not being around".

500|$|Monteverdi {{was still}} not entirely free from his {{responsibilities}} for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: [...] "I, Claudio Monteverdi... come humbly... to set forth to <b>you</b> <b>how</b> Domenicato Aldegati... a bass, yesterday morning... {{at the time of}} the greatest concourse of people... spoke these exact words...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat... and I shit on him and whoever protects him....|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{characterize}} {{his books}} as unoriginal or derivative. A 2009 New York Times article {{said he is}} [...] "hardly the first writer {{to tap into the}} American longing for meaning and success". [...] Sara Nelson, the editor-in-chief of Publishers Weekly, said Tolle's writings have been successful due to surging public interest in books that tell <b>you</b> <b>how</b> to be happier, more peaceful and more successful.
