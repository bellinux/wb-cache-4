5000|$|In July 2013, a {{campaign}} and petition were launched by Marcus Binney of SAVE Britain's Heritage {{to seek the}} protection of the crumbling building. A letter sent to the current owners of the building, David and Simon Reuben, said:“This major example of British architecture must not be lost to the nation. For this reason we have invited our friends, supporters and those with an interest in the house to join us at a gathering outside the house.... You acquired the site when you became the owners of Northern Racing. At that time Piercefield House was on the market and you continued to allow offers to come forward. It is our understanding that a number of potential buyers came forward, but that you ignored their offers. In particular we know that an interested party in 2010, was ready, willing and able to restore it. He worked closely with an architect on a rescue plan for the building. However his offer was ignored. Unfortunately since then the buildings and land have been withdrawn from the market. Not only this, the main house has been separated from the land and parcelled off into an off-shore company. By separating the house from the land on which it stands you are alienating potential buyers and complicating the rescue of the house. Since you acquired ownership of the site seven years ago you have conducted some emergency stabilisation work to the house. These repairs are temporary holding measures: they are fast deteriorating and will soon need to be maintained, or replaced. Whilst effective in the short term the only real solution for the house is to find a sustainable solution. As a national charity that campaigns for the country’s heritage we ask you - what are your future plans for Piercefield House? As the owners of a listed building you have a responsibility to either care for it or to allow someone else to do so. We take note of the extensive educational and philanthropic work of the Reuben Foundation and ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to this appeal from leading charities, trusts, bodies and individuals involved in the care of Britain’s architectural heritage." ...|$|E

40|$|Editors Note: The {{following}} {{articles by}} Professor Mills and Ed LeClear, a Cornell graduate student, both address a very contentious issue currently in debate among real estate developers, planners, and governments: Smart Growth and Suburban Sprawl. In the Graduate Program in Real Estate at Cornell, every student Is tasked with completing two major project developments, {{one in the}} first year, {{and the other in}} the second. This years first year students planned a development on 858 acres in Pennsylvania. An undercurrent of discussion among the students was whether this relatively large property in a basically rural environment should be developed or if the development of it simply contributed to more sprawl. This question was made more poignant {{by the fact that the}} city of Philadelphia, was the only major city in the country to experience a decline in population during the 902 ̆ 7 s, as more and more individuals moved to the inner and outer suburbs consequently expanding suburban development boundaries.

In an interview with The Lighthouse Electronic Magazine in April 1996, he said:You know, the thing I like about Awesome God is that it's one of the worst-written songs that I ever wrote; it's just poorly crafted. But the thing is that sometimes, I think, that when you become too conscientious about being a songwriter, the message becomes a vehicle for the medium. This is a temptation that I think all songwriters have.

40|$|Just {{like the}} world {{financial}} system, but for different reasons, 21 st-century corporations need a new business model for their enterprise supply chains. The old conventions no longer work in this new world of volatile and increasingly unpredictable demand and supply. The enterprise needs to become more 'connected' to its own parts, {{as well as its}} partners up and down the chains it participates in. So too, we need to embrace new ways of looking at customers to gain deeper, more insightful impressions of what they are telling us about the way they want to buy our products and services. Finally, these signals need converting into corresponding action, driven by the people in the business, leaders and staff alike, who are aligned to their customers' wishes. This is the world of dynamic supply chain alignment where, increasingly, supply chains are the business. In the follow-up to his hugely successful Strategic Supply Chain Alignment, John Gattorna's Dynamic Supply Chain Alignment, explores how to create and sustain multiple supply chains with a level of flexibility and responsiveness that allow <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> to opportunities and threats; at the same time aligning with your suppliers, your partners and your customers. When more executives get to this stage of development the profits will flow more readily, and sustainability of performance will not be the same issue it is today.

40|$|ArticleThis is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. This email dialogue that we record and report here between Eugene Matusov and Rupert Wegerif, exemplifies Internet mediated dialogic education. When Eugene emailed Rupert with his initial (mis) understanding of Rupert's position about dialogic pedagogy Rupert felt really motivated to reply. Rupert was not simply motivated to refute Eugene and assert his correctness, although Rupert is sure such elements enter into every dialogue, but also to explore and to try to resolve the issues ignited by the talk in New Zealand. Through this extended dialogue Rupert's and Eugene's positions become more nuanced and focussed. Rupert brings out his concern with the long-term and collective nature of some dialogues claiming that the – "dialogue of humanity that education serves is bigger than the interests of particular students and particular teachers. …" – and so he argues that it is often reasonable to induct students into the dialogue so far so that they can participate fully. On the other hand, Eugene's view of dialogue seems more focussed on personal responsibility, particular individual desires, interests and positions, individual agency and answering the final ethical "damned questions" without an alibi-in-being. Rupert claims that dialogic education is education FOR dialogue and Eugene claims that dialogic education is education AS dialogue. Both believe in education THROUGH dialogue but education through dialogue is not in itself dialogic education. For Rupert dialogic education can include ‘scaffolding’ for full participation in dialogue as long as dialogue is the aim. For Eugene dialogic education has to be a genuine dialogue and this means that a curriculum goal cannot be specified in advance because learning in a dialogue is always emergent and unpredictable. Our dialogue-disagreement is a relational and discursive experiment to develop a new genre of academic critical dialogue. The dialogue itself called to us and motivated us and flowed through us. This dialogue is much bigger than us. It participates in a dialogue that humanity has been having about education for thousands of years.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the compliments and their responses uttered by the characters in the film entitled Letters to Juliet. This research was conducted to describe the topics of compliment, the functions of compliment and the responses of the compliment expressed by the characters in the film entitled Letters to Juliet. This {{research is}} a pragmatic study. This research belongs to descriptive qualitative method which uses total sampling technique. All of the conversations which contain the compliments and the compliment responses were taken as the data. Based on the data analysis, the conclusions are drawn as follows: There are two types topics of compliments used by the characters in the film entitled Letters to Juliet. They are the topic of appearance and the topic of ability. Each topic is divided into two types. The topic of appearance is divided into personal appearance and possession. The topic of ability is divided into two types. They are general ability and specific-act ability. There are seven functions of compliment proposed by Wolfson found in this research. They are the function of compliments to increase solidarity (6 data), to express admiration and/or approval (6 data), to express positive evaluation (3 data), as encouragement (2 data), to replace speech act formula (2 data), as sarcasm (1 datum), and to soften criticism (1 datum). In responding the compliment, the researcher uses Herbert’s classification of compliment responses to analyze the response of compliment employed by the characters in the film entitled Letters to Juliet. Most of the addressees in the film entitled Letters to Juliet respond the compliment by using the nonverbal acceptance. The nonverbal acceptance {{is in the form of}} smiling. In the form of verbal acceptance, the addressees used the words thank <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> the compliment. The other responses are comment acceptance, comment history, question, and no acknowledgment. Based on the conclusion above, the researcher hopes that there will be additional contribution to the study of the compliments and their responses. The other researches who are interested in pragmatic study especially focused on the compliments and their responses are suggested to do the same research to conduct additional input in revealing the compliments and the compliment responses...|$|E
