2500|$|Carleton is {{probably}} most famously {{known for a}} comment made to the incoming federal Australian Labor Party leader Bob Hawke in 1983: [...] "Mr. Hawke, could I ask you whether <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> embarrassed tonight at the blood that's on your hands?" [...] which was {{a reference to the}} alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticised Carleton for his [...] "damned impertinence".|$|E

60|$|Brown was {{the first}} to break the silence that followed. He asked me if I had any brandy on board. He said he felt he should like just a nip of brandy before going to bed. That is one of the chief charms of Jephson's stories: they always make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> want <b>a</b> <b>little</b> brandy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> really <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger?" [...] asked Kate, who, {{although}} more lively--even mischievous {{in a small}} way--than her sister, had been more deeply affected by the captain's long illness, and could not shake off {{the impression that he}} was going to die.|$|R
60|$|AMAH. He put {{his arms}} round <b>you</b> and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> such <b>a</b> <b>little</b> small thing, you hear his heart beat quick, quick against your heart. And he throw back your head and he kiss you. And you think you die, little flower.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear; Miss Baker was {{speaking}} to me about Mr Maguire. You needn't mind speaking out to me, Miss Mackenzie. I can understand all about it; and if I can be of any assistance, I shall be very happy. No doubt <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shy, but you needn't mind with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} does, sweetheart. In fact, she {{as good as}} {{suggested}} it. She thinks <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strange about it all, and that a long, quiet day alone with me would help you to realize matters. Accordingly, I am having a luncheon basket packed, and after breakfast we are going for a sail, just you and I. You see the sea is as calm as a duck pond this morning. Shall you like it, do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Early {{next morning}} Terence told Bull and Macwitty that he {{expected}} a dozen officers out to lunch with him. [...] "And I want you to lunch with me too. I know that Captain O'Grady and others have asked you several times {{to go in and}} dine at mess, and that you have not gone. I hope to-day you will meet them at luncheon. I can understand that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> uncomfortable at this first meeting with a lot of officers as officers yourselves; but, of course, you must do it sooner or later, and it would be much better doing so at once.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well, I don’t want to argue,” and Miss Clavier laughed. “You told me {{you were}} going to be married, but you didn’t tell me who to. Of course, I could find out, but <b>you</b> should <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easier when <b>you</b> hear that I haven’t tried to.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Wilson, {{what do you}} and Richards {{think of}} it?" [...] the Major went on, after he had braced himself up with a strong glass of brandy and water. [...] "I should imagine <b>you</b> both <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less skeptical than you did two hours ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Practice, my dear, is everything: {{this time}} <b>you</b> may <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward, but <b>you</b> {{will find you}} will dispose of your second lover without much difficulty, and you will give his congé to your third with as much ease, as though you were merely dismissing a disobedient kitchen-maid." ...|$|R
60|$|These {{reflections}} make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more cheerful, {{but only}} for a brief period; for the next moment you think what a fool you must be to imagine for an instant that anybody would be sorry at anything that might happen to you. Who would care two straws (whatever precise amount of care two straws may represent) whether you are blown up, or hung up, or married, or drowned? Nobody cares for you. You never have been properly appreciated, never met with your due deserts in any one particular. You review the whole of your past life, and it is painfully apparent that you have been ill-used from your cradle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have a cigarette, Mr. McFarlane," [...] said he, {{pushing his}} case across. [...] "I am sure that, with your symptoms, my friend Dr. Watson here would {{prescribe}} a sedative. The weather {{has been so}} very warm these last few days. Now, if <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more composed, I should be glad if you would sit down in that chair, and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are, {{and what it is}} that you want. You mentioned your name, as if I should recognize it, but I assure you that, beyond the obvious facts that you are a bachelor, a solicitor, a Freemason, and an asthmatic, I know nothing whatever about you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear friends, who {{are putting}} {{your hands to}} your foreheads, and saying to yourselves that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> confused, {{as if you had}} been waltzing until things began to whirl {{slightly}} round you, is it possible that you do not clearly apprehend the exact connection of all I have been saying, and its bearing on what is now to come? Listen, then. The number of these living elements in our bodies illustrates the incalculable multitude of our thoughts; the number of our thoughts accounts for those frequent coincidences spoken of; these coincidences in the world of thought illustrate those which we constantly observe in the world of outward events." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Did she?" [...] he answered. [...] "I {{sometimes}} wonder. Even now I fancy, if {{the official}} papers {{of every one}} of the nations lay side by side, with their own case stated from their own point of view, even <b>you</b> might <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> confused about that. Still, I am going to be very honest with you. I think myself that Germany wanted war." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the J. D. Salinger novel The Catcher in the Rye, protagonist Holden Caulfield says {{of fellow}} student Ackley, [...] "'Listen,' I said, 'do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> like playing <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Canasta?' He was a Canasta fiend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{somehow or}} other," [...] David continued, as he filled his own pipe and lit it, [...] "I found myself looking {{back through the}} years, and I {{wondered}} whether we hadn't both let one thing grow too big in our minds. Life doesn't vary much here. Things are very much as we left them, and it's all rather wonderful. I felt a little ashamed, as I came up through the park, {{of some of the}} things we've planned and sworn. Didn't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like that, uncle? Can you sit here and think of the past, and remember all that burden we carried, and not feel inclined to let it slip, or just a little of it slip, from our shoulders?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It is this {{literary}} temperament of your work, {{this beautiful}} quality of composition, and {{feeling of the}} presentation, grasping reality all the while, and controlling and playing with the detail, it is this in our chattering and slobbering day that gives me {{the sense of the}} ampler tread and deeper voice of the man--in fact of his speaking in his own voice at all, or moving with his own step. You will make my own country people touch as with reverence the hem of his garment; but I think that I most envy you your having such a method at all--your being able to see so many facts and yet to see them each, imaged and related and lighted, as a painter sees the objects, together, that are before his canvas. They become, I mean, so amusingly concrete and individual for you; but that is just the inscrutable luxury of your book; and you bring home further, to me, at least, who had never so fully felt it, what a difficult and precarious, and even might-not-have been, Revolution it was, altogether, as a Revolution. Wasn't it as nearly as possible not being that, whatever else it might have been? The Tail might in time have taken to wagging the dog if the Tail could only, as seemed so easy, have been left on! But I didn't mean to embark on these reflections. I only wanted really to make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> responsible for my being, through living with you this succession of placid country evenings, far from the London ravage, extravagantly agitated. But take your responsibility philosophically; recall me to the kind consideration of Lady Trevelyan, and believe me very constantly yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|But Mr Harford {{was very}} decent and never {{got into a}} wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had {{said that they had}} drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a {{monstrance}} to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said: ...|$|E

6000|$|COADE. I {{have not}} told them of it yet. The fact is, I {{am afraid that}} it might tire my wife too much. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> equal to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{exertion}} to-night, Coady, or is your foot troubling you? ...|$|R
5000|$|At the after-party at meatpacking {{district}} eatery Vento, the pic's baddie, Bill Murray, said, [...] "You can't {{help but}} feel that this film is speaking to you right now, when <b>you</b> really <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit lost, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> abandoned." [...] Added pic's Tim Robbins, who was joined by cast mates Martin Landau and Saoirse Ronan at the premiere: [...] "I just loved the script. It had such a good, optimistic spirit about it. It's fun to play against this bleak, dark world." ...|$|R
6000|$|Those {{poor people}} in brass, on pedestals, hectoring about Trafalgar Square and that neighborhood, don't you think many of them--apart even from the ridiculous execution--cut rather a ridiculous figure, {{and that we are}} too eager to set up our ordinaire heroism and talent for port? A Duke of Wellington or two I will grant, though even of these idols a {{moderate}} supply will be sufficient. Some years ago a famous and witty French critic was in London, with whom I walked the streets. I am ashamed to say that I informed him (being in hopes {{that he was about to}} write some papers regarding the manners and customs of this country) that all the statues he saw represented the Duke of Wellington. That on the arch opposite Apsley House? the Duke in a cloak, and cocked hat, on horseback. That behind Apsley House in an airy fig-leaf costume? the Duke again. That in Cockspur Street? the Duke with a pigtail--and so on. I showed him an army of Dukes. There are many bronze heroes who after a few years look already as foolish, awkward, and out of place as a man, say at Shoolbred's or Swan and Edgar's. For example, those three Grenadiers in Pall Mall, who have been up only a few months, don't you pity those unhappy household troops, who have to stand frowning and looking fierce there; and think they would like to step down and go to barracks? That they fought very bravely there is no doubt; but so did the Russians fight very bravely; and the French fight very bravely; and so did Colonel Jones and the 99th, and Colonel Brown and the 100th; and I say again that ordinaire should not give itself port airs, and that an honest ordinaire would blush to be found swaggering so. I am sure if you could consult the Duke of York, who is impaled on his column between the two clubs, and ask his late Royal Highness whether he thought he ought to remain there, he would say no. A brave, worthy man, not a braggart or boaster, to be put upon that heroic perch must be painful to him. Lord George Bentinck, I suppose, being in the midst of the family park in Cavendish Square, may conceive that he has a right to remain in his place. But look at William of Cumberland, with his hat cocked over his eye, prancing behind Lord George on his Roman-nosed charger; he, depend on it, would be for getting off his horse if he had the permission. He did not hesitate about trifles, as we know; but he was a very truth-telling and honorable soldier: and as for heroic rank and statuesque dignity, I would wager a dozen of '20 port against a bottle of pure and sound Bordeaux, at 18s. per dozen (bottles included), that he never would think of claiming any such absurd distinction. They have got a statue of Thomas Moore at Dublin, I hear. Is he on horseback? Some men should have, say, a fifty years' lease of glory. After a while some gentlemen now in brass should go to the melting furnace, and reappear in some other gentleman's shape. Lately I saw that Melville column rising over Edinburgh; come, good men and true, don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> awkward and uneasy when you walk under it? Who was this to stand in heroic places? and is yon the man whom Scotchmen most delight to honor? I must own deferentially that there is a tendency in North Britain to over-esteem its heroes. Scotch ale is very good and strong, but it is not stronger than all the other beer in the world, as some Scottish patriots would insist. When there has been a war, and stout old Sandy Sansculotte returns home from India or Crimea, what a bagpiping, shouting, hurraying, and self-glorification takes place round about him! You would fancy, to hear McOrator after dinner, that the Scotch had fought all the battles, killed all the Russians, Indian rebels, or what not. In Cupar-Fife, there's a little inn called the [...] "Battle of Waterloo," [...] and what do you think the sign is? (I sketch from memory, to be sure.)* [...] "The Battle of Waterloo" [...] is one broad Scotchman laying about him with a broadsword. Yes, yes, my dear Mac, you are wise, you are good, you are clever, you are handsome, you are brave, you are rich, &c.; but so is Jones over the border. Scotch salmon is good, but there are other good fish in the sea. I once heard a Scotchman lecture on poetry in London. Of course the pieces he selected were chiefly by Scottish authors, and Walter Scott was his favorite poet. I whispered to my neighbor, who was a Scotchman (by the way, the audience were almost all Scotch, and the room was All-Mac's--I beg your pardon, but I couldn't help it, I really couldn't help it)--"The professor has said the best poet was a Scotchman: I wager that he will say the worst poet was a Scotchman, too." [...] And sure enough that worst poet, when he made his appearance, was a Northern Briton.|$|E
