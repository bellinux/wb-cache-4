40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of farm-level crop <b>yield</b> probability density functions (PDF’s) are crucial for studying various crop insurance programs and production under risk and uncertainty. Unfortunately, farm-level crop <b>yield</b> PDF’s {{are difficult to}} estimate {{due to the lack}} of sufficient farm <b>yield</b> data. County <b>yield</b> data cover much longer time periods than farm <b>yield</b> data, but using county <b>yield</b> distributions to conjecture about farm <b>yield</b> distributions is dangerous. The theoretical reason is that county <b>yield</b> is the average of correlated farm <b>yields,</b> for which there is no recognizable probability density function (PDF). This paper investigates the relationship between farm and county <b>yield</b> distributions using both statistical theory and the Monte-Carlo simulation method. Results show that under suitable farm <b>yield</b> correlation and density structures, the shape of <b>yield</b> distribution at the farm level is similar to that at the county level. A method is then developed for estimating and simulating farm <b>yield</b> distributions based on county <b>yield</b> PDF estimates and information contained in farm <b>yield</b> data. Six candidate <b>yield</b> models: normal, beta, Weibull, inverse hyperbolic sine transformation, a mixture of normals, and kernel density estimators are applied to Branch County corn <b>yields</b> after detrending nonstationary <b>yield</b> data.
