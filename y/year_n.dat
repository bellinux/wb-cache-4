40|$|Manual dexterity and {{postural}} control develop throughout childhood, {{leading to}} changes in the synergistic relationships between head, hand and posture. But the postural developments that support complex manual task performance (i. e. beyond pointing and grasping) have not been examined in depth. We report two experiments in which we recorded head and posture data whilst participants simultaneously performed a visuomotor task. In Experiment 1, we explored the extent to which postural stability is affected by concurrently performing a visual and manual task whilst standing (a visual vs. manual-tracking task) in four age groups: 5 - 6 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 8), 8 - 9 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 10), 10 - 11 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 7) and 19 - 21 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 9). For visual tracking, the children's but not adult's postural movement increased relative to baseline with a larger effect for faster moving targets. In manual tracking, we found greater postural movement in children compared to adults. These data suggest predictive postural compensation mechanisms develop during childhood to improve stability whilst performing visuomotor tasks. Experiment 2 examined the extent to which posture is influenced by manual activity in three age groups of children [5 - 6 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 14), 7 - 8 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 25), and 9 - 10 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 24) ] when they were seated, given that many important tasks (e. g. handwriting) are learned and performed whilst seated. We found that postural stability varied in a principled manner as a function of task demands. Children exhibited increased stability when tracing a complex shape (which required less predictive postural adjustment) and decreased stability in an aiming task (which required movements that were more likely to perturb posture). These experiments shed light on the task-dependant relationships that exist between postural control mechanisms and the development of specific types of manual control...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} {{the effect of}} gender on age at onset of schizophrenia in a developing country METHODS: Medical records of 252 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan between 2002 and 2008 were reviewed using a structured questionnaire. Age at onset was defined as age at onset of psychotic symptoms, age at first contact with a health care provider and age at first hospitalization. Socio-demographic variables were reported using descriptive statistics and all measures of age at onset were compared across gender using t-test. RESULTS: There were 119 women and 133 men with mean age of 37. 6 +/- 12. 8 years. All three measures of age at onset of illness showed no difference between women and men. The mean age when first psychotic symptoms appeared in men was 24. 86 +/- 8. 83 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 128) while that in women was 26. 57 +/- 9. 96 <b>years</b> (<b>n</b> = 111), p = 0. 160.
