5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then <b>you</b> <b>so</b> desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that you should do as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|Confession of sins is made {{directly}} to God and not through man (except in asking for forgiveness {{from the victim}} of the sin). It is taught that sins are to be kept to oneself to seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives <b>you,</b> <b>so</b> they should also be asked for forgiveness.|$|E

A note from Lord Knollys to Beresford commended Evan-Thomas for good results in gunnery trials.|$|E

500|$|... "One of Us Must Know" [...] is a {{straightforward}} {{account of a}} burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: [...] "I didn't mean to treat <b>you</b> <b>so</b> bad. You don't {{have to take it}} so personal. I didn't mean to make <b>you</b> <b>so</b> sad. You just happened to be there, that's all." [...] "One of Us Must Know" [...] was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tony Phelan and Joan Rater, and {{directed}} by Donna Deitch. David Greenspan edited the episode and Danny Lux served as the music coordinator. The episode was broadcast with Dolby Digital sound, being aired in both standard and high-definition, and running for 43 minutes without commercials. Featured music included Ingrid Michaelson's [...] "Everybody" [...] and Amanda Blank's [...] "Something Bigger, Something Better", and the episode was named after the song, [...] "I Like <b>You</b> <b>So</b> Much Better When You're Naked", by Norwegian rock musician, Ida Maria. The episode saw Heigl briefly return after a five-episode hiatus to film the movie, Life as We Know It. [...] "I Like <b>You</b> <b>So</b> Much Better When You're Naked" [...] was also planned {{to be the last}} episode before her maternity leave, however, in March 2010, when she did not return to the Grey's Anatomy set after her maternity leave, Heigl marked this episode as her last.|$|E
