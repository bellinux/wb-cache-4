2500|$|Operation Citadel, {{the last}} major German {{offensive}} operation in the east, was {{an attempt by the}} German army to regain the initiative. The plans of the operation were known to the Soviet defenders, who spent months building up a defense in depth to sap the strength of the attacking panzer units. The operation violated two of the three tenets for successful tank operations that Guderian had laid out in Achtung – Panzer!, namely that terrain for the operation had to be chosen that was open, and not built up with heavy defenses. Secondly, and more importantly, the strike had to be delivered in a manner that took the defenders by surprise. In light of the obvious heavy defenses the Soviets had been preparing for the attack, the operation was a clear misuse of the Panzerwaffe. The result would be a significant weakening of German panzer forces, forces that Guderian had been trying to rebuild. In a conversation with Hitler on 14 May 1943, Guderian pointed out the futility of the operation, asking, [...] "My Führer, {{why do you want to}} attack in the East at all this year?" [...] Hitler responded, [...] "You are quite right. Whenever I think of this attack my stomach turns over."

3000|$|Stimuli were 173 {{full-body}} {{photographs of}} unique undergraduate females integrated into real-world scenes. The women’s photos {{were selected from}} a set of 3129 photos of women that were taken by the research team (see also Treat et al., under review). The models wore warm-weather clothing that varied in sexual provocativeness and {{they were asked to}} display a wide variety of affective cues across photographs, including rejection, friendliness, neutrality, sexual interest, and sadness. Thus, the women in the stimululs set varied along three psychological dimensions: sexual interest (extremely rejecting to extremely sexually interested), provocativeness of dress (conservative to provocative), and normative attractiveness. Nine undergraduate women provided normative ratings of the models’ sexual interest and provocativeness-of-dress. When judging sexual interest, raters were instructed “to focus only on <b>the</b> degree <b>to</b> which <b>the</b> woman is expressing sexual interest, and to ignore her clothing style, her attractiveness, <b>your</b> personal <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman or her clothing, etc.” When judging provocativeness of dress, raters were instructed to 'focus only on the sexual provocativeness of <b>the</b> clothing and <b>to</b> ignore characteristics of the model completely, including her affect, her attractiveness, how she looks in <b>the</b> clothing, <b>your</b> personal <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman or her clothing, etc.’ Thus provocativeness of dress throughout this manuscript refers to a subjective judgment about the woman's clothing by relevant raters, rather than to an inherent property of the woman or her clothing. Inter-rater reliability among the coders was high (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)[*]=[*] 0.97, 0.95). [...] Members of our larger research team with expertise in sexual perception also coded sexual interest and provocativeness of dress. The average ratings of undergraduate women and experts converged strongly (r[*]=[*] 0.97, 0.96, respectively). A large sample of undergraduate men rated the women’s attractiveness on a ten-point scale.|$|R

Since that time, in spite of many improvements and updates, librarians still prefer to use other resources. In an effort to facilitate open and honest discussion about the Primo discovery tool and to make recommendations to improve the functionality of the instrument, librarians at KU were asked to complete a survey that helped them compare Primo to their favorite database and to Google Scholar. The survey included a known item search, a prescribed topic search, and the opportunity for them to search for a topic in their subject expertise specialty. The librarians were asked the following questions about each resource they used: Looking at the first ten results, how many of them are relevant? Did you change your search strategy or use the facets in Primo or other methods of narrowing in on a topic to find more relevant results? What was <b>your</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> results in each resource? Was it obvious the results included books, articles, or other resources? Were the results easily accessible? In this session, KU librarians will share their survey instrument. They will discuss, in detail, the results of the survey and the comments made by librarians while completing the survey. They will also share the recommendations for improvements they made to IT staff who administer Primo. Audience members will be asked to share their experiences with discovery tools at their libraries...|$|E
