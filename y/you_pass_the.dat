Kesey believed that psychedelics were best used {{as a tool for}} transforming society as a whole, and believed that if a sufficient percentage of the population had the psychedelic experience then revolutionary social and political changes would occur. Therefore, they made LSD available to anyone interested in partaking - most famously through the [...] "electric kool-aid" [...] made available at a series of [...] "Acid Tests"; musical and multi-media events where participants were given [...] "acid", the street name for LSD. The tests were held at various venues in California, and were sometimes advertised with colorful crayoned signs asking [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> acid test?" [...] The first Acid Test was held in Palo Alto, California in November 1965. (LSD was legal in the United States until October 6, 1966.) The young psychedelic music band the Grateful Dead supplied the music during these events.|$|E
