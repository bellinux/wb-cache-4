And, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E
5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} be thinking about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

500|$|James Brown {{was a major}} {{contributor}} to social dance. He popularized several fad dances in the 1970s such as the Mashed Potato, the Boogaloo, and the Good Foot. His accompanying songs to these dances include [...] "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes", [...] "Do the Boogaloo", and [...] "Get on the Good Foot". The song [...] "Do the Boogaloo" [...] influenced Boogaloo Sam when he created the boogaloo dance style, and the Good Foot triggered the creation of breaking. In addition, James Brown also popularized the Funky Chicken, which was a major influence to Don Campbell when he created locking. In an interview with NPR, Lockers' member Adolpho [...] "Shabba Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "We're all children of James Brown...

500|$|On August 6, 1984, Gardner {{escaped from}} custody at the University of Utah Hospital after faking an illness by vomiting. He {{attacked}} transportation officer Don Leavitt and {{forced him to}} unlock his shackles by telling him: [...] "I guess <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> that doctor comes back, I'll have to kill you both." [...] In {{the course of the}} escape, Gardner struck Leavitt so hard that he needed wires to reconstruct his face. Gardner forced a medical student named Mike Lynch to take him from the premises on a motorcycle while pointing a gun into his back. On August 11, a letter carrier found Leavitt's firearm in a mailbox with a note from Gardner that said, [...] "Here's the gun and wallet taken from the guard at the hospital.

500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode just to make them move.' The guy asked what voltage they were using and Derek said it was about 20 volts, and the guy said, 'Oh, they've got terribly thick skins, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> you want them to move, you'll have to pump it up to 60.'" [...] Following an initial investigation of AP Films Studios, the allegations of mistreatment were not pursued further; the RSPCA officer later joined the crocodiles' handler in assisting with the filming.|$|E

500|$|In April 2011, before [...] was {{released}} in theaters, screenwriters Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely announced that Marvel had already hired the duo {{to work on the}} film's sequel. In September 2011, Chris Evans said that a sequel may not be released until 2014. In January 2012, Neal McDonough, who played Dum Dum Dugan in Captain America: The First Avenger, mentioned that a sequel would likely be filmed after the completion of , which would likely have been before the end of 2012. By March 2012, Marvel whittled down the possible directors for the sequel to three candidates: George Nolfi, F. Gary Gray, and brothers Anthony and Joseph Russo. Walt Disney Studios announced the planned release of the sequel to Captain America: The First Avenger on April 4, 2014. Disney stated, [...] "The second installment will pick-up where ... The Avengers leaves off, as Steve Rogers continues his affiliation with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world." [...] Markus later elaborated, [...] "I think S.H.I.E.L.D. is the water [...] swimming in. It's definitely a Captain America movie. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> the first movie was a movie about the US Army, then this is a movie about S.H.I.E.L.D... You will learn about S.H.I.E.L.D. You will learn about where it came from and where it's going and some of the cool things they have." [...] In April, F. Gary Gray withdrew his name from consideration, choosing instead to direct the N.W.A biographical film Straight Outta Compton.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Kerry King {{was asked}} if Slayer will release a {{follow-up}} to Repentless. He replied, [...] "We've got lots of leftover material from the last album, 'cause we wrote so much stuff, and we recorded a bunch of it too. If the lyrics don't change the song musically, those songs are done. So we are {{way ahead of the}} ballgame without even doing anything for the next record. And I've been working on stuff on my downtime. Like, I'll warm up and a riff will come to mind and I'll record it. I've gotten a handful of those on this run. So wheels are still turning. I haven't worked on anything lyrically yet except for what was done on the last record, so that's something I've gotta get on. But, yeah, Repentless isn't quite a year old yet." [...] King also stated that Slayer is not expected to enter the studio until at least 2018. In an October interview on Hatebreed frontman Jamey Jasta's podcast, King stated that he is [...] "completely open" [...] to having guitarist Gary Holt (who had no songwriting contributions on Repentless) involved in the songwriting process of the next Slayer album. He explained, [...] "I'm entirely open to having Gary work on something. I know he's gotta work on an Exodus record and I've got tons already for this one. But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>if</b> he's gonna stick around... I didn't want it on the last one, and I knew that. I'm completely open to having that conversation. I haven't talked to Tom about it, I haven't talked to Gary open about it, but I'm open. That's not saying it is or isn't gonna happen. But my ears are open." ...|$|E

If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track.
