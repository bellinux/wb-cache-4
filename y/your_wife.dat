5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder <b>Your</b> <b>Wife.</b> From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E

After Famous Players-Lasky pulled out of London in 1922, Hitchcock stayed as part of the studio staff. He was hired by a new firm run by Michael Balcon and others after being noticed at work on the short film Always Tell <b>Your</b> <b>Wife</b> in early 1923. In time Balcon's company took the name Gainsborough Pictures.|$|E

He was then sent to a loose form of house arrest in Huế and the train stopped at Vinh, Nghệ An, Vietnam. On the way, his wife said, “I am very happy. From now on, my only wish is that you will hold to your initial aspiration. Do whatever you like, and do not worry about <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> and children.” While Phan was living out his final years, his children and their families came to visit him, but never his wife. When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E

In the film, Terry-Thomas appeared again with Sykes, an experience Sykes later described as magical.

500|$|Grissom and {{his wife}} Betty (born 1927) had two sons: Scott (born in 1950) and Mark (born in 1953). He greatly valued being home with his family, stating that [...] "it sure helped to spend a quiet evening with <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> and {{children}} in your own living room". His wife Betty accommodated his hectic schedule by completing major chores and errands during the week so weekends would be free for family activities. Grissom refused to let work problems intrude on his time at home, and tried to complete technical reading or paperwork after the boys were asleep. Gus introduced his sons to hunting and fishing, two of his favorite pastimes.|$|E
500|$|In 1964 Terry-Thomas started {{filming the}} role of Charles Furbank in How to Murder <b>Your</b> <b>Wife,</b> a part which brought him £100,000, his largest fee up to that point. He {{said that it was}} his {{favourite}} to make, [...] "because I felt that I did a very good job". He enjoyed working with Jack Lemmon, the film's star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon's wedding. Throughout {{the rest of the year}} Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in Burke's Law, but also on What's My Line? and An Hour with Robert Goulet, both on CBS; he also released another record, Terry-Thomas Discovers America, a collection of songs and sketches, described by Billboard as [...] "a funny, funny comedy masterpiece".

500|$|New {{recurring}} {{characters were}} also introduced in season five. The character of Jillian Fisher, Brian's new dimwitted girlfriend, {{was introduced in}} the episode [...] "Whistle While <b>Your</b> <b>Wife</b> Works". She provided an ironic counterpoint to Brian's intellectualism. Her final character personality was designed to be a stereotypical blonde, [...] "a bulimic cheerleader," [...] and [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree." [...] Her voice would later play upon the bulimic cheerleader element, with actress Drew Barrymore providing the voice of Jillian in eight episodes, five of which would be in season five. Other guest stars who made multiple appearances as recurring characters from previous seasons were Carrie Fisher as Peter's boss, Angela, and Phyllis Diller as Peter's mother. Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane, also made an appearance as Olivia, the child actress, when her character was apparently killed by Stewie in the episode [...] "Chick Cancer".|$|E

Hetfield was opposed to the idea and said, [...] "When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica", and that a side project is [...] "like cheating on <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> in a way". Newsted said Hetfield had recorded vocals for a song used in the film , and appeared on two Corrosion of Conformity albums. Hetfield replied, [...] "My name isn't on those records.

500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E
