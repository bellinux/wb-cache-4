2500|$|Accounts on {{the quality}} of the black bear's fur vary. According to Natural History of the Mammalia of India and Ceylon, [...] "Their skins are always poor and mangy, and {{generally}} so greasy that they are very difficult to keep until you can make them over to the dresser", which is corroborated by The great and small game of India, Burma, and Tibet, which states [...] "... the skins are never of any particular value, and in autumn, owing to the masses of <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> that are accumulated beneath them, are absolutely useless." [...] The first part of volume II of Mammals of the Soviet Union on the other hand states that Asian black bears yield fur, meat and fat of greater quality than those of brown bears. In British India, grease was the only practical use for black bear carcasses. Bears living near villages were considered the most ideal, as they were almost invariably fatter than their forest dwelling counterparts.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} investigating the affect of self-image on brand preference. While previous research has found that self-image does affect brand preference, much of this research has focused on high value and high involvement products. There is a significant gap in the literature, identified by Jamal and Goode who state that: More work is needed to establish the significance of self-congruence on brand preferences… in the case of high frequency and low value brands. (2001, p. 490) The purpose of this study is to gain an insight into how consumers make choices when shopping for fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) and to identify whether self-image affects brand preference in this context. This study focuses specifically on <b>yellow</b> <b>fats,</b> a term used to refer to butter, margarine and spreads. A multi-method research design was used in the form of twenty-five qualitative individual depth interviews and twenty-one hours of in-store observations. Quantitative Likert scales were used to measure levels of self-image congruence based on Sirgy’s (1997) approach. The findings of this research have clearly identified that there is a link between self-image and brand preference in the context of <b>yellow</b> <b>fats.</b> This is significant as no research has previously identified a link between self-image and brand preference in this category. In addition to this, this research has two major contributions to literature: 1. It is the first to visually depict self-image congruence. 2. It has also identified two factors moderating self-image congruence that have not been referenced in any previous study in this area; recency of purchase and the notion of wanting to be the perfect female role model...|$|R
6000|$|There {{is in the}} {{interior}} of the turtle a quantity of <b>yellow</b> <b>fat,</b> which is said to be superior in delicacy to the fat of the goose, and from which is obtained a fine oil, highly prized as an article of commerce.

The axes of the Indians caused the shells to fly in splinters; the intestines were then torn out and handed to the Indian women, whose duty it was to remove from them the precious fat, after which the carcasses were left to the vultures and fisher-eagles, which flocked from afar to the scene of carnage with that unerring instinct which has so often been commented on by travellers, but which no one can understand.|$|E
6000|$|After breakfast, Mr. Williams and I {{started on}} an elephant, {{following}} the camp to Gyra, twelve miles distant. The docility {{of these animals}} is an old story, but it loses {{so much in the}} telling, that their gentleness, obedience, and sagacity seemed as strange to me as if I had never heard or read of these attributes. The swinging motion, under a hot sun, is very oppressive, but compensated for by being so high above the dust. The Mahout, or driver, guides by poking his great toes under either ear, enforcing obedience with an iron goad, with which he hammers the animal's head with quite as much force as would break a cocoa-nut, or drives it through his thick skin down to the quick.

40|$|Concentrations {{of total}} Aluminium (Al) and Iron (Fe) were {{determined}} in Lake Loskop {{over a period}} of four month in 2009 in samples of phytobenthos, phytoplankton, macroinvertebrates, amphibians and fish. The highest concentrations of Al and Fe were measured in the filamentous algae Spirogyra fluviatilis (Hillse) and Spirogyra adanata (Kütz), (Al = 18, 997. 5 mg kg- 1 dry weight; Fe = 22, 054. 2 mg kg- 1 dry weight) in the riverine zone of the lake with a near-neutral water average pH of 7. 3. However, a negative correlation exists between the Al and Fe concentrations measured in the filamentous algae in comparison to the corresponding concentrations of these elements in the water column of the riverine zone. The Al concentrations in the macroinvertebrate families collected ranged from 140. 6 to 385. 7 mg kg- 1 dry weight, with the highest values measured for Al and Fe in the family Gomphidae (385. 7 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 1, 710. 0 mg kg- 1 dry weight, respectively) in comparison to other macroinvertebrate families sampled. Al and Fe concentrations (2, 580 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 10, 697 mg kg- 1 dry weight) in the stomach contents of adult Oreochromis mossambicus fishes were much higher in comparison with adult Micropterus salmoides fishes (98. 5 mg kg- 1 dry weight and 439. 6 mg kg- 1 dry weight), respectively. In all cases of dissected fish species either white or <b>yellow</b> body <b>fat</b> was observed, thus in none of the samples both type of body fat occurred simultaneously The concentrations of total Al and Fe in the different organs of Oreochromis mossambicus was along a mean sequence of intestine > <b>yellow</b> body <b>fat</b> > brain > gills > liver > heart > white body fat, while the mean sequence of total Al and Fe in Micropterus salmoides was: intestine > gills > liver > heart > brain > white body fat. From the levels of Al detected in the <b>yellow</b> body <b>fat</b> of the studied fish species Oreochromis mossambicus, we suggest that this phenomenon {{may be related to the}} feeding habits of this species. Furthermore, the intake of certain species of phytobenthos by Oreochromis mossambicus could have played a role in the bioaccumulation of Al in the food chain and the possible development of pansteatitis in predators at higher trophic levels.

40|$|Abstract Background Sheep {{carcasses}} with <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> are sporadically {{observed at}} Norwegian slaughter houses. This phenomenon {{is known to}} be inherited as a recessive trait, and is caused by accumulation of carotenoids in adipose tissue. Two enzymes are known to be important in carotenoid degradation in mammals, and are therefore potential candidate genes for this trait. These are beta-carotene 15, 15 '-monooxygenase 1 (BCMO 1) and the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2). Results In the present study the coding region of the BCMO 1 and the BCO 2 gene were sequenced in <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals and compared to the corresponding sequences from control animals with white fat. In the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> individuals a nonsense mutation was found in BCO 2 nucleotide position 196 (c. 196 C>T), introducing a stop codon in amino acid position 66. The full length protein consists of 575 amino acids. In spite of a very low frequency of this mutation in the Norwegian AI-ram population, 16 out of 18 <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> lambs were found to be homozygous for this mutation. Conclusion In the present study a nonsense mutation (c. 196 C>T) in the beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO 2) gene is found to strongly associate with the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> phenotype in sheep. The existence of individuals lacking this mutation, but still demonstrating <b>yellow</b> <b>fat,</b> suggests that additional mutations may cause a similar phenotype in this population. The results demonstrate a quantitatively important role for BCO 2 in carotenoid degradation, which might indicate a broad enzyme specificity for carotenoids. Animals homozygous for the mutation are not reported to suffer from any negative health or development traits, pointing towards a minor role of BCO 2 in vitamin A formation. Genotyping AI rams for c. 196 C>T can now be actively used in selection against the <b>yellow</b> <b>fat</b> trait. </p...|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} influence of dairy breeds {{in the production of}} beef. First-cross beef-cross-dairy cows have shown potential as beef breeding cows due to their greater milk yield than straight-bred beef cows. There have been few studies examining the finishing characteristics of the progeny of such cows. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of breed-cross on growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes for progeny of beef and beef-cross-dairy cows grown in a New Zealand pastoral production system. This study also aimed to determine if there were differences in breed effects between heifers and steers. Growth, carcass characteristics and the meat quality were assessed for steers and heifers from beef and beef-cross-dairy cows. Heifers (n= 53) and steers (n= 50) were born to Angus (AA), Angus-cross-Friesian (AF), Angus-cross- KiwiCross (AK) and Angus-cross-Jersey (AJ) cows and sired by Charolais (C) bulls. Heifers and steers were grazed on pasture until slaughter at 574 and 784 days of age respectively. Live animal measurements were considered separately for heifers and steers. Carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes were compared among breed-crosses and between heifers and steers. The C-AA heifers (226. 8 ± 4. 7 kg) and steers (238. 8 ± 4. 6 kg) were lighter at weaning than the beef-cross-dairy breed heifers (C-AJ = 239. 9 ± 4. 6 kg, C-AK = 254. 7 ± 6. 3 kg, C-AF = 258. 9 ± 5. 7 kg) and steers (C-AJ = 256. 1 ± 4. 9 kg, C-AK = 257. 0 ± 7. 2 kg, C-AF = 267. 0 ± 5. 7 kg) (P 0. 05). The C-AA (53. 1 ± 0. 3 %) steers had a greater dressing-out percentage than C-AF (51. 9 ± 0. 4 %) and C-AJ (51. 5 ± 0. 3 %) steers (P 0. 05). Steers were longer, heavier, had a greater fat depth C and greater proportion of intramuscular fat than heifers (P 0. 05), except that C-AJ cattle had <b>yellower</b> <b>fat</b> than C-AA, and C-AA and C-AF cattle had redder fat than C-AK.
