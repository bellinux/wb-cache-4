6000|$|... "My dear Leonard," [...] she said, [...] "you are {{not very}} clever at hiding your feelings. When you {{came to see me}} the other day, do you imagine I {{believed}} for a single moment that you asked me to marry you simply because you cared? I think, Leonard, that it was because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid,</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of something coming into your life so big, so terrifying, that you were ready to clutch at the easiest chance of safety." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense! That <b>is</b> your mistake! <b>You</b> <b>are</b> too intellectual. <b>You</b> {{want to do}} {{everything}} with your mind. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of kisses. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of the warmth in your blood. It's just because all that side of your life hasn't fairly begun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do you mean,' said Gerald, {{with the}} punctiliousness {{of a man}} who has <b>been</b> drinking, 'that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of the sight of a black-beetle, or <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of a black-beetle biting you, or doing you some harm?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] our visitor said, [...] "I {{see that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> to confess {{yourself}} the popular failure as a critic which <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> that if <b>you</b> {{made a list}} of The Hundred Worst Books you would send the classes to buying them in the most expensive binding, and the masses to taking them out of all the public libraries." ...|$|R
50|$|If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> {{of being}} lonely, don't {{try to be}} right.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{world will}} {{say that you have}} {{restored}} Ongar Park because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> to keep it. Indeed, Lady Ongar, you had better let it remain as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My friend," [...] he murmured, [...] "you bluffed fairly well, but <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid.</b> Oh, how I {{smiled to}} see your fingers close round the butt of that revolver!" ...|$|E
5000|$|If it is {{your first}} time, {{especially}} if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of heights, go on the biggest, scariest roller coaster first. Once you get on you will really like it and <b>you</b> won't <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of any other roller coasters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it {{the accusations}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of? I <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> {{of nothing but}} that we should miss the passing of our lives together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, take me home," [...] groaned the Heap {{upon the}} floor--"take me home, Elizabeth! I daren't go alone. Beatrice will haunt me. My brain goes round and round.

6000|$|... "We {{know well}} enough why you didn't show yourself, Link," [...] broke in our hero. [...] "And {{we also know}} why you left Mr. Appleby's camp so suddenly. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of arrest." ...|$|E
60|$|You'll {{find him}} {{sleeping}} like a gentleman {{with all his}} luggage round him in a Second-class apartment. But don't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Dor. I warrant {{you will}} not want some naughty argument, or other, to satisfy yourself.--I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of betraying your friend? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] Adeline urged tremulously, [...] "sha'n't <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> {{to go to}} Boston alone? It'll be dark by {{the time}} you get there!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{followed}} {{me to see}} whether I was going to question Corp. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> {{he would tell me}} what really happened. You wanted to see him first to tell him what to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were afraid}} of my threat. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> that I might come to you. Well, it is probable, almost certain that I should have come. You have saved {{yourself}} from that, at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so I {{was to be}} {{kept waiting}} indefinitely because you two between <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of an old woman! However, I have not a word to say against her, and the matter is settled now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's better,' said Festus. 'Now I {{can talk}} to you. Come, my dear, will you open the door? Why should <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of me?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There," [...] she said, {{pinching}} Wiles mischievously, [...] "there! that's {{the woman}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of. Look at her. Look at that dress. Ah, Heavens! {{look at that}} shawl. Didn't I tell you she had no style?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort. Your {{eyes were}} bright--brighter than usual. You looked {{about in the}} room, as if {{you knew you were}} where you ought not to be, and as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of being found out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> I'd {{get after}} {{you about your}} crank notion of finding the old man's lode? As you haven't talked about it for some time, I'd begun to hope you had given that folly up. Are you going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} <b>be</b> <b>afraid</b> of it; it cannot work {{properly}} if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid.</b> See, look there," [...] he added, {{pointing to the}} conical rock on which another infatuated gull had perched himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You love him!" [...] he growled. [...] "Pah! I {{see it in}} your eyes--in your tremors--that <b>you</b> do. It <b>is</b> for {{him that}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid,</b> is't not?" ...|$|R
