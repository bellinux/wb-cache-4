6000|$|It was the cow that woke me {{the first}} morning. I {{did not know it}} was our cow--not at the time. I didn't know we had a cow. I looked at my watch; it was half-past two. I thought maybe she would go to sleep again, but her idea was that the day had begun. I went to the window, the moon was at the full. She was {{standing}} by the gate, her head inside the garden; I took it her anxiety was lest we might miss any of it. Her neck was stretched out straight, her eyes towards the sky; which gave to her the appearance of a long-eared alligator. I have never {{had much to do with}} cows. I don't know how <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> I told her to [...] "be quiet," [...] and to [...] "lie down"; and made pretence to throw a boot at her. It seemed to cheer her, having an audience; she added half a dozen extra notes. I never knew before a cow had so much in her. There is a thing one sometimes meets with in the suburbs--or one used to; I do not know whether it is still extant, but when I was a boy it was quite common. It has a hurdy-gurdy fixed to its waist and a drum strapped on behind, a row of pipes hanging from its face, and bells and clappers from most of its other joints. It plays them all at once, and smiles. This cow reminded me of it-- with organ effects added. She didn't smile; there was that to be said in her favour.|$|E

5000|$|Condé Nast Traveler {{described}} Sweetings as a A seafood {{institution in}} the City...You won't find the most sophisticated cooking here, but the fish is very fresh and the pleasure is in feeling that you have stumbled on a slice of history. The waiters and waitresses are trapped behind wooden counters and serve only the eight or so customers in front of them. There is an etiquette about when <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> but, after countless visits, I can't work it out. Tom Parker Bowles reviewed Sweetings for The Mail on Sunday in 2013 and wrote of the decor that [...] "the walls resemble the flat of an upper middle-class bachelor: spy prints, team photos and middling still lifes of Stilton" [...] and the clientele were [...] "contemporary City swells, supping Black Velvet from pewter tankards and guzzling oysters". Parker Bowles was less enthusiastic about the cooking but concluded that [...] "Because despite the hit-and-miss nature of the food (and my advice is {{to stick to the}} shellfish), this is one of London's greatest restaurants. You don't come for the food. You come for Sweetings".|$|R
5000|$|The {{best way}} to {{understand}} Soans’ theme for <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> Terrorists is with {{the words of the}} first ex-Secretary of State, [...] "Talking to Terrorists {{is the only way to}} beat them… If you want <b>them</b> <b>to</b> change their minds, <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> They won’t do it very willingly because they don’t trust you, but yes, <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> terrorists". Soans uses this dialogue at the very beginning of the play to honestly begin his production with the idea that <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> terrorists to accomplish any sort of resolution. Throughout the play the ex-terrorist characters constantly mention that they only did what was right in their minds to protect themselves and their community. Soans also wanted to balance his view on terrorism by adding characters that repeat the words of politicians and victims to illustrate the theme that <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> terrorists is the only way to create peace and end misery for humankind. The other half of Soans’ idea is that terrorism is a vicious circle and several times it is mentioned that the ideas of terrorism came from terrorism, such is the case with the Bethlehem school girl who states in Act One that she hopes her Christmas will be better than the last few days and that the soldiers are beginning to pester her. It is revealed in Act Two that the Bethlehem schoolgirl was quite happy for the 9/11 disaster in America, she states, “When I first saw the Twin Towers on television, I felt sorry. But now I feel happy that they died. It's their turn to suffer. I could see many thousands of them die. I wouldn’t feel a thing.” It's thoughts like these, that human lives are expendable to justify revenge that lead into acts or support of terrorism. Ultimately Soans expresses the idea that terrorism is bad, but terrorists aren’t monsters, they're humans with a message and need <b>to</b> be <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> resolve any issue; meeting violence with violence only fuels conflict.|$|R

He constantly teases Yossarian asking him {{if he wants to}} know why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, and that they were in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story.
