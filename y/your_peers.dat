[...] The award is regarded by the players themselves as extremely prestigious, with John Hartson commenting in 2005 that [...] "the award means a lot because it's voted by your fellow professionals" [...] and Shaun Maloney stating in 2006 that [...] "there is no better accolade than to be voted for by <b>your</b> <b>peers</b> and it does mean a lot to me". In 2007 the SPFA was replaced by a new body, PFA Scotland, but the new organisation's awards are considered to be a direct continuation of the SPFA awards.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 study titled An Empirical Analysis of [...] "Acting White" [...] by Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University and Paul Torelli {{suggested}} that the phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels, but might explain {{a significant role in}} the disparities between black and white students at high achievement levels. Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, [...] "acting white" [...] prejudices are actually more common the more integrated the school, with historically black schools free of any effects. He found that groups such as Italian immigrants in Boston’s West End and the Maori of New Zealand display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by <b>your</b> <b>peers</b> when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.|$|E

Of all prior NL Rookies of the Year, only Pujols and Willie McCovey hit for higher batting averages in their rookie year. Braun was voted the 2007 NL Sporting News Rookie of the Year by 488 major league players and 30 managers. Braun also received the 2007 Players Choice NL Most Outstanding Rookie in a vote by his fellow major league players.

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from <b>your</b> <b>peers</b> and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

Lancashire has received two nominations for the British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in both 2013 and 2014, winning in 2014.

2500|$|There {{has also}} been an issue with {{minority}} populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of [...] "Acting White." [...] It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one {{is trying to be}} a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G. Fryer, Jr., at Harvard University has noted that, [...] "There is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by <b>your</b> <b>peers</b> when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders." [...] Therefore, not only are there economic and prehistoric causes of racial educational segregation, but there are also social notions that continue to be obstacles to be overcome before minority groups can achieve success in education.|$|E
