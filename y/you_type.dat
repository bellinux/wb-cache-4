Alternatively, typing Control-Z (for Undo) immediately after entering the apostrophe will convert it back to a typewriter apostrophe. In Microsoft Word for Windows, holding down the Control key while typing two apostrophes will produce a single typographic apostrophe.|$|E

As before, <b>you</b> <b>type</b> {{the key for}} the character first, which is 'G', then the first stroke of that character, {{which is also a}} 'G'. Because this is all necessary information, the L is used as a filler until you reach 4 letters. Note that the '一' is also the shortcut character for 'G' (making it one stroke only in practice).|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{function}} accepts textual S-expressions as input, and parses {{them into}} an internal data structure. For instance, if <b>you</b> <b>type</b> the text [...] at the prompt, [...] translates this into a linked list with three elements: the symbol , the number 1, and the number 2. It so happens that this list is also a valid piece of Lisp code; that is, it can be evaluated. This is because the car of the list names a function—the addition operation.|$|E

However, {{he noted that}} the app does not currently support integration with other apps on the device, meaning that queries such as [...] "Buy Captain America movie tickets" [...] sent him to the web browser rather than an app for movie tickets installed on his phone. Olivarez-Giles also praised the predictive typing engine, stating that it [...] "blows past most competitors" [...] and [...] "it gets smarter with use". He also discovered that Gboard [...] "cleverly suggests emojis as <b>you</b> <b>type</b> words". He did note the lack of a one-handed mode, as well as lack of options for changing color or size of keys, writing that [...] "If you’re looking to customize a keyboard, Gboard isn’t for you." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite these improvements, Word 2013 {{stopped using}} ClearType. The reasons invoked are, {{in the words}} of Murray Sargent: [...] "There is a problem with ClearType: it depends {{critically}} on the color of the background pixels. This isn’t a problem if you know a priori that those pixels are white, which is usually the case for text. But the general case involves calculating what the colors should be for an arbitrary background and that takes time. Meanwhile, Word 2013 enjoys cool animations and smooth zooming. Nothing jumps any more. Even the caret (the blinking vertical line at the text insertion point) glides from one position to the next as <b>you</b> <b>type.</b> Jerking movement just isn’t considered cool any more. Well animations and zooms have to be faster than human response times in order to appear smooth. And that rules out ClearType in animated scenarios at least with present generation hardware. And in future scenarios, screens will have sufficiently high resolution that gray-scale anti-aliasing should suffice." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{limited amount}} of string input could be done, so a program could ask simple Yes/No questions, but this was really a kludge. For example, if <b>you</b> <b>typed</b> [...] "HELLO" [...] at an input statement, FOCAL would convert the H to [...] "8", then {{interpret}} the [...] "E" [...] as starting an exponent, then it would try to compute [...] "8" [...] to the [...] "LLO" [...] power, which would take several seconds of CPU time and result in a value of 0.76593020E+103, not a particularly helpful response.|$|R
5000|$|Interface expert Jef Raskin {{came out}} {{strongly}} against modes, writing, [...] "Modes {{are a significant}} source of errors, confusion, unnecessary restrictions, and complexity in interfaces."

[...] Raskin dedicated his book The Humane Interface to describe the principles of a modeless interface for computers. Those principles were implemented in the Canon Cat and Archy systems.|$|R
