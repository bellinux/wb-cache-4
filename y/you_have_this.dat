You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
500|$|Bryant's {{star power}} and her extreme views were {{highlighted}} in national news stories. Mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times, Associated Press and Washington Post reported weekly updates on campaign progress, with smaller local newspapers {{across the country}} weighing in their editorial opinions on which side should prevail. Bryant appeared on Good Morning America and The Phil Donahue Show. Her tone and accusations united {{gay men and lesbians}} in cities all over the U.S. In the weeks before the vote, almost $55,000 was raised outside of Florida to oppose Save Our Children. Foreshadowing the effectiveness of the Save Our Children campaign, on April 13, 1977, the Florida Legislature voted not to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), to the astonishment of those anticipating the vote. The connection between the ERA and ordinance 77-4 was obvious to many. Florida Senator Dempsey Barron vocally opposed passing the ERA, fearing it would legalize same-sex marriages, force people to use unisex bathrooms, and that it would harm laws meant to protect families. National Organization for Women founder and ERA proponent Betty Friedan expressed her disdain, saying [...] "suddenly <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> red herring in Anita Bryant. Suddenly <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> wave of anti-gay hysteria and then that was preempting the air waves behind the scenes".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot over four days, {{with an extra}} day allotted for re-shooting some of the scenes. Originally Lambert had casts taken of Robinson's face, hand and feet to create the statue of the saint which would {{be used as a}} decoration. The actor only enacted the live scenes. However during post-production, Lambert found that the statue did not look like Robinson, who was asked to re-shoot the {{respective}} scenes. He had to act as the statue and required special make-up for the retakes. The actor recalled that standing like a statue was difficult since [...] "first of all, I didn't realize how hard it is on the back to stand absolutely tall and straight and not move. Secondly, as a performer <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> nervous energy—and my requirements here were total antithesis of that." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} was well {{received}} among critics. Sam Lansky from MTV News called it dazzling and colourful, and cited the chair-dancing sequence as his favourite since that of Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger" [...] (2000). Lansky concluded: [...] "Who {{needs to be}} high-concept when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> much attitude?" [...] Similarly, Lewis Corner from Digital Spy highlighted the group's [...] "sassy poses, on-point strutting and [...] whole lot of attitude." [...] Rebecca Martin of Sky Living complimented their [...] "quirky outfits" [...] and [...] "fun dance moves", concluding that the video [...] "proves [...] ready to give other girlbands on the scene a serious run for their money." [...] Sarah Deen of Metro wrote that the visual demonstrated the group's dancing abilities and [...] "truly shows off their individual style". Deen said it made sure the song [...] "leaves a lasting impression", describing it as [...] "eye-catching" [...] and a [...] "vibrant and attitude-packed pop video". Ellie Ross from The Sun deemed the video [...] "sassy" [...] and felt it portrayed Little Mix as [...] "fully grown up", noting that [...] "they've stepped up their game even more since [...] ".|$|E
500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't like any of the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E

2500|$|The United States Senate {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} resolution which urged the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence. The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it. The House of Representatives held {{a moment of silence}} themselves, and one-minute speeches were given on the House floor as well. Representative Eliot Engel, who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on [...] "being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations." [...] However, Engel said, “If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, and that makes it even more disgraceful.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his {{limited number}} of appearances, the {{character}} of Darius has an important moral influence in the show. Horvath remarks, [...] "When he joined the show {{it was the first}} time that someone started talking about peace." [...] She explains, [...] "The arrival of Darius, aside from bringing in a great character, represented the first time that someone questioned the basic premise of the show. The basic premise is that 's a hero and he goes around kicking the ass of the bad guys. Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> character in Darius who shows up and says, 'Yes, but is it actually a good goal to kick the ass of the bad guys?' Even though Mac has to be a good guy who has to fight the bad guys, you set up this scenario where one of his closest friends has questioned whether beating up bad guys makes you a good guy or whether you should be a man of peace. (...) That underlying question shaped the whole rest of the series." [...] Abramowitz says further, [...] "It was a major moment for MacLeod. And {{it was the first time}} for him when he believed that the way of the warrior may not be the only way." [...] Abramowitz summarizes, [...] "Darius was the voice of God on the show, and then God died." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sales staff {{must learn}} to {{recognise}} when the customer is {{ready to make a}} purchase. If the sales person feels that the customer is ready, then they may seek to gain commitment and close the sale. Experienced sales staff soon learn to recognise specific verbal and non-verbal cues that signal the client's readiness to buy. For instance, if a customer begins to handle the merchandise, this may indicate a state of buyer interest. Clients also tend to employ different types of questions throughout the sales process. General questions such as, [...] "Does it come in any other colours (or styles)?" [...] indicate only a moderate level of interest. However, when clients begin to ask specific questions, such as [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> model in black?" [...] then this often indicates that the prospect is approaching readiness to buy. When the sales person believes that the prospective buyer is ready to make the purchase, a trial close might be used to test the waters. A trial close is simply any attempt to confirm the buyer's interest in finalising the sale. An example of a trial close, is [...] "Would you be requiring our team to install the unit for you?" [...] or [...] "Would you be available to take delivery next Thursday?" [...] If the sales person is unsure about the prospect's readiness to buy, they might consider using a 'trial close.' The salesperson can use several different techniques to close the sale; including the ‘alternative close’, the ‘assumptive close’, the ‘summary close’, or the ‘special-offer close’, among others.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{publications}} and analysts predicted {{the failure of}} Apple Stores. It was thought {{that because of the}} stores' diminutive size and non-aggressive sales team, Apple would succeed in presenting the Mac but fail in making a significant number of sales. However, the Apple retail program established its merits, bypassing the sales-per-square-foot measurement of competing nearby stores, and in 2004 reached $1 billion in annual sales, the fastest of any retailer in history. Sales continued to grow, reaching $1 billion a quarter by 2006. Then-CEO Steve Jobs said that [...] "People haven't been willing to invest this much time and money or engineering in a store before", adding that [...] "It's not important if the customer knows that. They just feel it. They feel something's a little different." [...] In 2011, Apple Stores in the United States had an average revenue of $473,000 for each employee. According to the research firm RetailSails, the Apple Store chain ranked first among U.S. retailers in terms of sales per unit area in 2011, with sales of $3,085per square feet, almost doubling Tiffany & Co., the second retailer on the list. On a global level, all Apple Stores had a combined revenue of US$16billion. Under the leadership of Ron Johnson, the former senior Vice President of Retail Operations, the Apple Stores have, according to an article in The New York Times, been responsible for [...] " [...] the boring computer sales floor into a sleek playroom filled with gadgets". The Apple Stores have also been credited with raising the company's brand equity, with Scott Galloway stating that the Stores are the [...] "temple to the brand which is this unbelievable experience called an Apple Store, and then <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> very mediocre experience called an AT or Verizon connect your phone experience for Samsung and the other Android players".|$|E
2500|$|From 1999 onwards, {{a renewed}} process was set into motion by the Tajik Ahmad Shah Massoud and the Pashtun Abdul Haq to unite all the ethnicities of Afghanistan. While Massoud united the Tajiks, Hazara and Uzbeks {{as well as}} some Pashtun {{commander}}s under his United Front command, the famed Pashtun commander Abdul Haq received increasing numbers of defecting Pashtun Taliban as [...] "Taliban popularity trended downward". Both agreed to work together with the exiled Afghan king Zahir Shah. International officials who met with representatives of the new alliance, which Pulitzer Prize winner Steve Coll referred to as the [...] "grand Pashtun-Tajik alliance", said, [...] "It's crazy that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> today ... Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazara ... They were all ready to buy in to the process ... to work under the king's banner for an ethnically balanced Afghanistan." [...] Senior diplomat and Afghanistan expert Peter Tomsen wrote: [...] "The ‘Lion of Kabul’ [...] and the ‘Lion of Panjshir’ ... Haq, Massoud, and Karzai, Afghanistan’s three leading moderates, could transcend the Pashtun—non-Pashtun, north-south divide." [...] The most senior Hazara and Uzbek leader were also part of the process. In late 2000, Massoud officially brought together this new alliance in a meeting in Northern Afghanistan to discuss, among other things, [...] "a Loya Jirga, or a traditional council of elders, to settle political turmoil in Afghanistan". [...] That part of the Pashtun-Tajik-Hazara-Uzbek peace plan did eventually materialize. An account of the meeting by author and journalist Sebastian Junger says: [...] "In 2000, when I was there ... I happened to be there in a very interesting time. ... Massoud brought together Afghan leaders from all ethnic groups. They flew from London, Paris, the USA, all parts of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India. He brought them all into the northern area where he was. He held a council of ... prominent Afghans from all over the world, brought there to discuss the Afghan government after the Taliban. ... we met all these men and interviewed them briefly. One was Hamid Karzai; I did not have any idea who he would end up being ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{composed}} {{several other}} new themes for the film, {{to represent the}} titular villain Ultron; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger Vision. Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound [...] "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, [...] "but dissonant and tweaky enough" [...] to reflect that [...] "he doesn't quite have it right" [...] and is still a villain. The melody is simple {{so that it is}} easy to remember, but starts flat by one note to make the theme sound slightly [...] "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played [...] "ahead by a beat" [...] the second time; [...] "not only out of tune, but out of time." [...] The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone. Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an [...] "unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation" [...] with [...] "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [...] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken." [...] Tyler wrote the [...] "lullaby" [...] to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello. For the Vision's theme, Tyler [...] "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic". He tried to reflect the character's role as a messianic figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth, and said, [...] "you don’t really know what side he’s on. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>this</b> guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." [...] The theme is an adagio that is [...] "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery." [...] To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds. Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, [...] "trying to say more with less for Vision". The music for the visions that the Scarlet Witch gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a [...] "randomly played" [...] vibraphone and strings such as a harp to create a [...] "dreaminess" [...] and [...] "hypnotic effect".|$|E
