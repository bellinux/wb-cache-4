6000|$|Presently after. 'I {{have made}} an {{engagement}} for you. Lady Conway wishes that you should go to luncheon with her to-morrow. I believe she wants to consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> birth-day celebration.' ...|$|E
5000|$|His car proves you {{can build}} a Formula One car by sweat alone, and makes <b>you</b> wonder <b>about</b> <b>some</b> of the astronomic {{development}} costs you hear the Establishment quoting!" [...] Stuart Turner, Competition Manager for Ford.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will tell}} <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it <b>some</b> day, Jacob; {{it is too}} long to go into now. You remind me of it some evening, when {{we are at a}} lonely inn, with nothing to do. How do you get on at night?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better. I {{had to fight}} the battle of {{life as well as}} you. I may tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it <b>some</b> day. But don't ever ask me to do it, and {{particularly}} do not press me to tell you now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I'm {{sorry to}} say that I haven't. But I have seen many other very {{wonderful}} things. I might tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> of them, if you would {{come over here and}} sit by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{he wishes}} to see <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> parish business, I think," [...] said Mrs. Robarts, looking up for a moment from the anxious {{discussion}} {{in which she was}} already engaged with Mrs. Crawley on nursery matters.|$|E
6000|$|... "She will be glad, I am sure," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Haswell, [...] "for {{she told}} {{me the other day}} that she wants to consult <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> outdoor theatricals that she means to get up in July." ...|$|E
40|$|Are <b>you</b> curious <b>about</b> <b>some</b> of {{the latest}} {{technology}} <b>you</b> have heard <b>about?</b> Come to this hands-on session to test out hardware (Flip Cams, Mimio, clickers, iPads 2 ̆ 6 more) and software (Audacity, Skype, YouTube Channel, Adobe Meeting) while talking with faculty and professional staff who use it in their daily work...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] said Deane. [...] "You shall go {{away and}} recuperate. When you're feeling {{stronger}} <b>you</b> can think <b>about</b> <b>some</b> work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “My dear,” {{said the}} vicar’s wife resignedly, “my own Sybil was thrown {{together}} with Bertie {{under the most}} romantic circumstances—I’ll tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it <b>some</b> day—but it made no impression whatever on Teresa; she put her foot down in the most uncompromising fashion, and Sybil married an Indian civilian.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{century before}} the last? Thank you!" [...] Strether laughed. [...] "If I ask <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> {{of the ladies}} it can't be then that I may hope, as such a {{specimen}} of the rococo, to please them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! Mrs. Eden,' Lily began, {{intending}} {{to make her}} explanation, but feeling confused, thought it better to wait till her friend's business was settled, and altered her speech into 'Miss Weston is come to speak to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> work.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to trouble you about such things,' said Tancred, in a hesitating voice, 'but perhaps I {{may not have the}} great {{pleasure}} to see you again, and Lord Eskdale said that I was to speak to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> letters of credit.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{shall have}} to call on them, but they are mere {{ordinary}} girls--no companions to Theresa. She laments it very much, and has {{had to make a}} line for herself. I must come and tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it <b>some</b> morning. It is nonsense to meet in this way and think of conversation.|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't much matter. <b>You</b> said {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>some</b> property you've got in diamonds, {{and you said}} once that you must go out to look after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Troublesome, {{careless}} child! {{and what}} are you doing now? You look quite red, as if <b>you</b> had been <b>about</b> <b>some</b> mischief: what were you opening the window for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, sir," [...] {{the other}} agreed. [...] "I don't know as you're not right. We Americans do hang round our businesses, and that's a fact.

6000|$|... "It is dreadful, very dreadful," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "But it {{is wholly}} his own fault. It shows {{what happens when}} one becomes dishonest and bad at heart.

6000|$|... 'You mistake my purpose, I see, ma'am,' replied Mr Nickleby, in {{his usual}} blunt fashion. 'I have no money to throw away on miniatures, ma'am, and nobody to give one to (thank God) if I had. Seeing you on the stairs, I wanted to ask a {{question}} of <b>you,</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> lodgers here.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, Robin, I'll {{be better}} advised before I gie {{it back to}} you; it is a wanchancy weapon in a Highlandman's hand, and I am {{thinking}} <b>you</b> will be <b>about</b> <b>some</b> harns-breaking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, my dear, {{you must}} be down to lunch, or {{if you are not}} you ought to be; so, as I want to have a chat with <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> of your poor father's affairs, and am engaged {{for the rest of the}} day, I will come over then if you will allow me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "My {{father did}} some service with our horse, and I fought by his side. We were with Colonel Baillie's force {{when it was}} destroyed, after for two days {{resisting}} the whole of Hyder All's army. Being mounted, we escaped, and reached Madras in safety, after losing half our number. But all that I can tell <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> <b>some</b> other day.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not quite}} as tall as Goliath, certainly," [...] the other answered, with a laugh that was rough and yet tender. [...] "As for me, I am disabled. I had a fatal hit in early life. I will tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it <b>some</b> day. <b>You</b> may, too, meet with your master. Don't be too eager, or too confident, or too worldly, my boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter, old man," [...] said James, [...] "I've {{been meaning}} to speak to <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it for <b>some</b> time. I've got Sandy MacBean's new book, and I {{think you ought to}} read it. It is full of helpful hints." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll tell <b>you</b> all <b>about</b> that <b>some</b> other time," [...] said Sam. [...] "Just for {{the moment}} I want to sit quite still and think. Are you comfortable? Fine! Then off we go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot bear {{to think}} of leaving this place without seeing you again. I wished for one thing--please don't think me very egotistical for saying it--to tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> little papers I am writing, {{and one or two}} of which have been printed in a periodical. I think the subject would {{interest}} you. Will you think me very bold, Miss Churton, if I ask you to let me call on you at your home?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'You told us {{we might}} write <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> {{interesting}} people we knew. I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I mean {{to tell you about}} them. I have never told anybody about them except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about them because you understand things. There are a great many people who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "if you inquire at the United Bank of Africa, {{you will}} find that I have a credit balance there of {{something}} over a hundred thousand pounds. Then I have also--well, let us say a trifle more, invested in first-class mines. Do me the favour of lunching with me, Mr. Mangan, and although Africa will never be a favourite topic of conversation with me, I will tell <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>some</b> of my speculations." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Cope had {{not much}} hope from the parish, so he said, 'Mr. Shepherd {{ought to do}} {{something}} for him after he has worked for him so long. He has been looking wretchedly ill for some time past; and I dare say half this illness is brought on by such lodging and living as he got there. But what did <b>you</b> say <b>about</b> <b>some</b> eggs?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Muhammad said, [...] "If one of <b>you</b> is {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>some</b> practical undertaking, or about making {{plans for a}} journey, he should perform two cycles (rak'atain) of voluntary prayer." [...] Then with all sincerity recite the following Du'a.|$|R
