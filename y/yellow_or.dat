5|$|Vanadinite {{is usually}} bright-red or orange-red in colour, {{although}} sometimes brown, red-brown, grey, <b>yellow,</b> <b>or</b> colourless. Its distinctive colour makes it popular among mineral collectors. Its streak {{can be either}} pale <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> brownish-yellow. Vanadinite may be transparent, translucent or opaque, and its lustre can range from resinous to adamantine. Vanadinite is anisotropic, meaning that some of its properties differ when measured along different axes. When measured perpendicular and parallel to its axis of anisotropy, its refractive indices are 2.350 and 2.416 respectively. This gives it a birefringence of 0.066.|$|E
5|$|Variety queletiformis can be {{distinguished}} from the main form by the reddish discolouration of the stem base that occurs both on the exterior surface and in the flesh. Variety rubriceps has a deep crimson red cap, while var. lupiniformis has a pale <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> dirty ochre cap, sometimes with pink tones throughout.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Fritillaria species {{are used as}} early spring {{ornamental}} flowers. These vary from the large Fritillaria imperialis (crown imperial) available {{in a number of}} colours such as <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> orange, to the relatively tiny species such as Fritillaria meleagris or Fritillaria uva-vulpis with their chequered patterns. Erythronium is less common but a popular cultivar is 'Pagoda' with its sulphur yellow flowers. Calochortus (mariposa lily) may be sold as a mixture or as cultivars.|$|E

5000|$|These are {{relatively}} large dragonflies. Their thoraces and abdomens are brown in color, with blue <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> stripes <b>or</b> {{spots on the}} thorax, and <b>yellow,</b> blue <b>or</b> green spots on the abdomen.|$|R
50|$|Plants {{with severe}} rust {{infection}} may appear stunted, chlorotic (<b>yellowed),</b> <b>or</b> otherwise discoloured. Rust sporulates on affected plant parts.|$|R
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or <b>yellow,</b> <b>or</b> an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} peridium that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|Helium–cadmium lasers are {{a common}} source of blue-ultraviolet laser light. They operate at either 325 or 422nm in {{fluorescence}} microscopes and various laboratory experiments. Cadmium selenide quantum dots emit bright luminescence under UV excitation (He-Cd laser, for example). The color of this luminescence can be green, <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> red depending on the particle size. Colloidal solutions of those particles are used for imaging of biological tissues and solutions with a fluorescence microscope.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution turns the cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The Danube crested newt's {{back and}} sides are dark brown with black spots and white stippling. The belly is orange to red (in other crested newts, {{it is usually}} <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> orange–yellow), with small or {{medium-sized}} black blotches that have sharp edges. Like all crested newts, T.dobrogicus males develop a crest on their back and tail during breeding phase, which can be quite high and jagged and usually starts between the eyes and nostrils. Another feature of males at breeding season is a bluish-white stripe along the tail.|$|E
50|$|Most whitestarts are 13-13.5 cm {{long with}} dark grey or dark olive-green upperparts, {{except for the}} white outer tail {{feathers}} which are frequently spread in display. Adults have brightly coloured red, orange <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> bellies. Many species have contrasting black, rufous <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> caps <b>or</b> distinctive facial patterns, often with white <b>or</b> <b>yellow</b> “spectacles” around the eye.|$|R

5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, <b>yellow,</b> <b>or</b> olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E
5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> green, {{and have been}} used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
5|$|The green hairstreak, purple hairstreak, comma, hummingbird hawk-moth, broad-bordered bee hawk-moth and {{ghost moth}} are {{sometimes}} {{seen in the}} woods with the common butterfly and moth species, and a clouded <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> Camberwell beauty may also occur in some years. Grayling, small heath and common blue butterflies {{can be found in the}} dunes, where there is also a large antlion colony, making Holkham one of only two locations for this predatory insect in the UK. Dragonflies include the migrant hawker, southern hawker and ruddy darter.|$|E

5|$|The ruff has a {{distinctive}} gravy boat appearance, {{with a small}} head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals {{on the sides of}} the tail.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> brown.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata, {{commonly}} known as old man banksia, saw banksia, saw-tooth banksia and red honeysuckle, is a species of woody shrub or tree of the genus Banksia in the family Proteaceae. Native to {{the east coast of}} Australia, it is found from Queensland to Victoria with outlying populations on Tasmania and Flinders Island. Commonly growing as a gnarled tree up to 16m (50ft) in height, it can be much smaller in more exposed areas. This Banksia species has wrinkled grey bark, shiny dark green serrated leaves and large <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> greyish-yellow flower spikes appearing over summer. The flower spikes, or inflorescences, turn grey as they age and pollinated flowers develop into large, grey, woody seed pods called follicles.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual ones. At Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. <b>Yellow</b> <b>or</b> brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or peridium, is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish <b>yellow</b> <b>or</b> greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
