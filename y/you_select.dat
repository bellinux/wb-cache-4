500|$|The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to {{our country}} to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven't {{accomplished}} this desire due to some small issues. However, {{in order to encourage}} my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that {{you will be able to}} build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that <b>you</b> <b>select</b> and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas."

2500|$|Adventure Gamers' Evan Dickens was {{the first}} {{professional}} critic to review the game when Boakes independently released it in 2002.

[...] He also praised {{the atmosphere of the}} game; [...] "The best part of Dark Fall is summarized in one word: atmosphere. This game demands that you turn off the lights and turn up the speakers. Boakes has succeeded masterfully at creating a world that is truly creepy." [...] He concluded [...] "It's clear {{that this is not a}} big-budget professional game that has been beta tested by large groups. There are small annoyances, such as not being able to skip the intro sequence if <b>you</b> <b>select</b> New Game. These are minor quibbles, though, and do not take away from the fact that Dark Fall is involving and intriguing." ...|$|E

The {{historical}} mode is a {{very common}} one: in it the author professes {{to find out the}} truth by collecting the facts of the case, and tracing them downwards; but this mode is worse than the other. Suppose the question is as to the true essence and character of the English constitution. First, where will you begin your collection of facts? where will you end it? What facts will <b>you</b> <b>select,</b> {{and how do you know}} that the class of facts which <b>you</b> <b>select</b> are necessary terms in the premisses, and that other classes of facts, which you neglect, are not necessary? And how do you distinguish phenomena which proceed from disease or accident from those which are the genuine fruits of the essence of the constitution? What can be more striking, in illustration of the utter inadequacy of this line of investigation for arriving at the real truth, than the political treatises and constitutional histories which we have in every library? A Whig proves his case convincingly to the reader who knows nothing beyond his author; then comes an old Tory (Carte, for instance), and ferrets up a hamperful of conflicting documents and notices, which proves his case per contra. A. takes this class of facts; B. takes that class: each proves something true, neither proves the truth, or any thing like the truth; that is, the whole truth.|$|E
