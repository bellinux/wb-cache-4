60|$|BALSQUITH (cautiously). I {{think we}} had better not commit {{ourselves}} too far. If I might carry your parasol, that would quite satisfy me. Let us change a subject which threatens to become embarrassing. (To Mitchener.) The moral of the occasion for you, Mitchener, appears to be that <b>youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> give up treating soldiers {{as if they were}} schoolboys.|$|E
5000|$|Outside court, Scalise {{told the}} Chicago Tribunes John Kass {{that he was}} {{writing a book about}} his exploits, and he {{explained}} that he pleaded guilty even though he thought he might win [...] "because sometimes <b>youve</b> just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be realistic."

500|$|... "I {{just feel}} like this record is really different- <b>youve</b> <b>got</b> club bangers <b>to</b> more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame is not about who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really <b>got</b> <b>to</b> allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|R
60|$|BLANCO [ignoring the interruption]--and {{you found}} a man without a horse. Is {{a man on a}} horse the same as a man on foot? Yah! Take your witness away. Who's going to believe her?

60|$|MRS TARLETON. Well, no, {{not afraid}} of them, exactly; but <b>youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> pick up their ways. You know, dear, I never quite agreed with your father's notion of keeping clear of them, and sending you to a school that was so {{expensive}} that they couldnt afford to send their daughters there; {{so that all the}} girls belonged to big business families like ourselves. It takes all sorts to make a world; and I wanted you to see a little of all sorts. When you marry Bunny, and go among the women of his father's set, theyll shock you at first.|$|E
60|$|RIDGEON [sternly] You must {{understand}}. <b>Youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{understand and}} to face it. In {{every single one}} of those ten cases I have had to consider, not only whether the man could be saved, but whether he was worth saving. There were fifty cases to choose from; and forty had to be condemned to death. Some of the forty had young wives and helpless children. If the hardness of their cases could have saved them they would have been saved ten times over. Ive no doubt your case is a hard one: I can see the tears in your eyes [she hastily wipes her eyes]: I know that you have a torrent of entreaties ready for me the moment I stop speaking; but it's no use. You must go to another doctor.|$|E
5000|$|Spirit of Edens moody, {{experimental}} nature made it {{a challenge}} to promote; one critic said it [...] "is the kind of record which encourages marketing men to commit suicide." [...] Tony Wadsworth, Parlophones marketing director at the time, told Q: [...] "Talk Talk are not your ordinary combo and require sympathetic marketing. Theyre not so much difficult as not obvious. <b>Youve</b> just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> find as many ways as possible to expose the music." [...] Evaluating some masterpieces of the eighties in a 2004 article for The Guardian, John Robinson calls Spirit of Eden, like David Sylvians Brilliant Trees, [...] "triumphant, but completely unmarketable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eyewitness {{accounts}} from Mormons that implicate the Paiutes (at first entirely so {{and then only}} in part) are set against Paiute accounts that absolve them from participation in the actual massacre. Historian Bagley believes [...] "the problem with trying {{to tell the story}} of Mountain Meadows—the sources are all fouled up. <b>Youve</b> either <b>got</b> <b>to</b> rely on the testimony of the murderers or of the surviving children. And so what we know about the actual massacre is—could be challenged on almost any point. _ [...] " [...] However, as Carleton mentions in his 1857 report, even Hamblin, the Indian agent who blamed the Paiutes for the massacre, admitted to him that in 1856 the Paiute tribe had only three guns, suggesting that it was incredible for them to have acquired sufficient guns to inflict the number of gunshot wounds evident among the victims, most of whom were killed by gunfire, not, as Mormon witnesses claimed, largely by being hit in the head with stones.|$|R

In future you attend to my orders and not to iz, e says: what does he know about it? You didnt give me any orders, I says. Couldnt you see for yourself there wasnt room for fours, e says: why cant you THINK? General Mitchener tells me Im not to think but to obey orders, I says. Is Mitchener your sergeant or am I, e says in his bullyin way. You are, I says. Well, he says, <b>youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do what your sergeant tells you: thats discipline, he says.

Im the more experimental person in the group, you see I like to experiment. Not go over {{the same thing over and}} over. Since Ive left England, Ive had this thing Ive wanted to do. Im not against rock & roll, but I really want to experiment. The new albums very rock & roll and its good. I mean, Im very bored with rock & roll. The revival.

50|$|The {{budget was}} {{provided}} entirely by Hexagon - half from Roadshow, half from Burstall, Bilcock and Copping - {{apart from a}} short term loan from the Australian Film Development Corporation, which was repaid before the films release. Burstall cast Graeme Blundell in the lead:I remember Bourkie executive Graham Burke saying, <b>Youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> cast somebody like Jack Thompson. I said, Absolutely not. <b>Youve</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> cast somebody who wouldnt, on the surface, seem a stud or even particularly attractive. I actually thought that Alvin wasnt, that the comic element was connected with having a Woody Allen or a Dustin Hoffman figure who is not very obviously sexually attractive, and the girls rushing him. This becomes much funnier than {{if he was a}} stud figure.Blundell was paid $500 a week for the role.|$|E
