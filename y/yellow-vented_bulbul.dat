50|$|The <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus goiavier), or eastern <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbul,</b> is {{a member}} of the bulbul family of {{passerine}} birds. It is resident breeder in southeastern Asia from Indochina to the Philippines. It is found in a wide variety of open habitats, but not deep forest. It is one of the most common birds in cultivated areas. They appear to be nomadic, roaming from place to place regularly.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbuls</b> eats {{berries and}} small fruits. They also sip nectar, nibble on young shoots, {{and take some}} insects.|$|R
50|$|The {{wilderness}} area is also surrounded by thick patches of mangroves that attract birds such as mangrove blue flycatchers, barred rails, zebra doves, kingfishers, Pacific swallows, <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbuls,</b> and chestnut munias.|$|R

40|$|Global warming may a¡ect the physiology, distributions, {{phenology}} and {{adaptations of}} plants and animals. In Israel, minimum summer temperatures increased {{by an average of}} 0. 26 8 C per decade {{during the second half of}} the 20 th century. Bergmann’s rule predicts that, in warm-blooded animals, races from warm regions are smaller than races from cold regions. Numerous studies have reported general correla-tions between body mass in fossil animals and independently established palaeoclimatic changes from various parts of the world in accordance with this rule. Using museum specimens, I tested the prediction that the body mass and tarsus length of ¢ve resident passerine species in Israel declined between 1950 and 1999. The body mass of four species (the graceful warbler Prinia gracilis, the house sparrow Passer domesticus, the <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> Pycnonotus xanthopygos and the Sardinian warbler Sylvia melanocephala, but not of the crested lark Galerida cristata) declined signi¢cantly during this period. Tarsus length also declined signi¢cantly during this period for two species (the graceful warbler and the house sparrow). Body condition (body mass-to-tarsus length ratio) decreased in the Sardinian warbler, the <b>yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> and the crested lark. It is suggested that the above declines in body mass and tarsus length are due to global warming and also in accordance with Bergmann’s rule. The above explanation does not exclude the possibility that other factors, such as a decrease in food availability, contributed to the decline in body mass. These declines may have serious implications for community structure and competition among bird species and may a¡ect the survival of small passerines...|$|E

40|$|Forest {{damage in}} any ways will {{determine}} {{all of the}} organism inside include the birds. Forest restoration is a positive step that would help to recover back the forest. Bird is one of bio-indicator of forest condition. This research was needed not only to compare the diversity of birds between restoration area and primary forest (middle and edge forest), but also to know the species of birds which could adapt in both areas. The research was conducted in June – July 2012 at Sei Betung Resort, based on the IPA (Indices Ponctuels d 2 ̆ 7 Abondence) or Point Count method. The result showed that bird diversity index in middle forest is 3, 586 {{as well as in}} edge forest is 3, 554. Both results are categorized as high diversity level, while the restoration area is categorized as middle diversity level with 3, 095 index value.

40|$|Urban {{expansion}} increases {{fragmentation of}} the landscape. In effect, fragmentation decreases connectivity, causes green space loss and impacts upon the ecology and function of green space. Restoration of the functionality of green space often requires restoring the ecological connectivity of this green space within the city matrix. However, identifying ecological corridors that integrate different structural and functional connectivity of green space remains vague. Assessing connectivity for developing an ecological network by using efficient models is essential to improve these networks under rapid urban expansion. This paper presents a novel methodological approach to assess and model connectivity for the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus) and <b>Yellow-vented</b> <b>bulbul</b> (Pycnonotus goiavier) in three cities (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Jakarta, Indonesia and Metro Manila, Philippines). The approach identifies potential priority corridors for ecological connectivity networks. The study combined circuit models, connectivity analysis and least-cost models to identify potential corridors by integrating structure and function of green space patches to provide reliable ecological connectivity network models in the cities. Relevant parameters such as landscape resistance and green space structure (vegetation density, patch size and patch distance) were derived from an expert and literature-based approach based on the preference of bird behaviour. The integrated models allowed the assessment of connectivity for both species using different measures of green space structure revealing the potential corridors and least-cost pathways for both bird species at the patch sites. The implementation of improvements to the identified corridors could increase the connectivity of green space. This study provides examples of how combining models {{can contribute to the}} improvement of ecological networks in rapidly expanding cities and demonstrates the usefulness of such models for biodiversity conservation and urban planning...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} was to determine and compare the density and diversity of water birds and terrestrial birds using distance sampling point count method at Paya Indah Wetland Reserve, Selangor Peninsular Malaysia. A total of 13872 bird individuals from 100 bird species were recorded in the wetland reserve. Out of the total, 25 (22. 26 % of all detections) and 75 (77. 74 % of all detections) bird species belong to water birds and terrestrial birds respectively. The results showed that total bird density of the wetland reserve is 83. 92 ± 4. 53 birds ha - 1 and ranged from 75. 40 - 93. 41 birds ha - 1 (95 % confidence interval). The terrestrial birds have higher density (70. 26 ± 4. 48 birds ha - 1) as compared to water birds (13. 09 ± 1. 78 birds ha - 1). The highest water bird density was recorded for Purple Swamphen (5. 05 ± 0. 89 birds ha - 1) and the lowest was Ballion's Crake (0. 31 ± 0. 13 birds ha - 1).
