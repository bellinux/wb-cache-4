Strive to get the retirement and succession of masses in irregular ground: much may be done in this way by careful watching of the perspective diminutions of its herbage, as well as by contour; and much also by shadows. If you draw the shadows of leaves and tree trunks on any undulating ground with entire carefulness, you will be surprised to find how much they explain of the form and distance of the earth on which they fall.|$|E

When {{you reach the}} bottom of the tree you will find yourself in a large hall; it is light there, for there are more than three hundred lamps burning.

If you go into the first room, you will see a great chest {{in the middle of the}} floor with a dog sitting upon it; he has eyes as large as saucers, but you needn't trouble about him. I will give you my blue-check apron, which you must spread out on the floor, and then go back quickly and fetch the dog and set him upon it; open the chest and take as much money as you like. It is copper there. If you would rather have silver, you must go into the next room, where there is a dog with eyes as large as mill-wheels. But don't take any notice of him; just set him upon my apron, and help yourself to the money. If you prefer gold, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> too, if you go into the third room, and as much as you like to carry. But the dog that guards the chest there has eyes as large as the Round Tower at Copenhagen! He is a savage dog, I can tell you; but you needn't be afraid of him either. Only, put him on my apron and he won't touch you, and you can take out of the chest as much gold as you like!' ...|$|E

If you cook low and slow then you can use all sorts of rubs and smoking agents to infuse the food with a depth of flavour you just can’t get out of an oven. As for high heat grilling, your barbecue puts out way more heat than your stovetop so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> wonderful charring and searing, just like in a restaurant." ...|$|E

Ian Rosenblatt had been a customer at the shop for 25 years, and when the owner mentioned to him in April 2013 that he was thinking of closing the shop, Rosenblatt made a rapid decision to buy it as a going concern. “I think people are still attracted to specialist shops where {{there are people who are}} knowledgeable about the products and where you get a personal service,” he has said. “If you want to see different options and possibly talk to somebody about, in the case of music, the best performers, the best performances ... you can’t get that on Amazon but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> here Aldrich Music Shop.” Rosenblatt himself regularly serves in the shop on Saturdays.|$|E
