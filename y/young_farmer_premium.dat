40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the characteristics of adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs in Iowa. The research procedure was survey, with data collected by means of mailed questionnaire that was sent to selected educators in Iowa. The dependent variables were demographic data and respondents 2 ̆ 7 importance scores for 55 adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> activities. The independent variable was the respondent group with four levels: (1) superintendents, (2) principals, (3) adult farmer instructors, and (4) <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> instructors. Respondents were from schools identified as having high quality adult or <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs;Major findings of the study were (1) administrators were in almost total agreement with their importance ratings of the 55 program activities. Likewise, instructor groups differed significantly on only one activity. (2) Administrator and instructor groups viewed the vocational agriculture instructor as a coordinator rather than a teacher for all class sessions. (3) Administrator and instructor groups differed significantly in their importance mean scores for having time during the regular school day for adult or <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> preparation and visitation. (4) Administrator and instructor groups indicated that adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> programs should meet the needs of on-farm and off-farm agribusiness males and females. (5) All respondent groups indicated that program enrollees should assist in the planning of adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> class sessions. (6) Activities in the area of teacher preparation were indicated to be very important in the adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational program;Findings suggested that additional efforts need to be made to promote adult and <b>young</b> <b>farmer</b> educational programs.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the “Young Farmer Problem” in Europe {{with a specific}} focus on how it applies in England. Recent reforms of the European Union’s (EU) Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have specifically targeted <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> for increased support; with <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> being seen as more innovative, entrepreneurial and amenable to change. Furthermore, the EU has stated that the “generational renewal” of agriculture is critical {{for the long term}} viability of the sector. This paper investigates the business performance and entrepreneurial behaviour of <b>younger</b> <b>farmers</b> in England through empirical analysis of Farm Business Survey (FBS) data, and finds some evidence to support the notion of higher levels of performance among <b>younger</b> <b>farmers.</b> Farmers in the 35 - < 45 years age group showed consistently higher levels of overall productivity, profitability and investment. Additionally, the results show that <b>younger</b> <b>farmers</b> demonstrate consistently higher levels of engagement with agri-environment schemes. This study concurs with the findings of Zagata and Sutherland (2015) in the need to improve targeting on the basis of age specifically in order to isolate the under 40 age group which is the focus of European policy and in the need to separate new entrants from inheritors in the assessment of <b>young</b> <b>farmers.</b> This paper and its supportive research builds on the fifth research objective of the Research platform proposed by Zagata and Sutherland (2015) to test the characterisation of young people and new entrants to farming, as entrepreneurial innovators sympathetic to and amenable with the goals of the CAP...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{steady decline}} in the number of {{holdings}} and farmers in the EU has led to a distressing shortage of new farmers. Today, the European Union is consequently faced with a dual problem: the scarcity of new and consequently <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> and the rapid ageing of the <b>farmer</b> population. <b>Young</b> <b>farmers</b> can bring new skills and energy, and a more professional management to the farming sector. Against the context of an ageing agricultural labour force, the future of the farmers’ profession must be ensured. Thus, European Unions’ Common Agricultural Policy pays particular attention to the decline in <b>young</b> <b>farmers,</b> having established different policy measures and motives for new entrants in agriculture. Support to the setting up of <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> includes support to facilitate the initial establishment and the structural adjustment of their holding afterwards. This paper attempts to identify Greek new farmers’ perceptions about their participation in this policy measurement. For this reason a questionnaire was developed and distributed among <b>young</b> <b>farmers</b> participating in the measure 112 ‘Setting up of young farmers’ (Common Agricultural Policy, Pillar II), in order to explore their expectations, perceptions and their daily practices in the field. The survey took place in different regions in Greece during an educational course series designed for new farmers. In total 254 new farmers answered questions concerning economic, environmental and cultivation practices...|$|R
