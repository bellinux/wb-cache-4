5000|$|According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS), {{there are}} two {{categories}} of dent corn hybrids. These hybrids are categorized by the colour of the kernels—either yellow or white. <b>Yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> is produced primarily for animal feed and industrial uses such as ethanol and cooking oils. [...] FGIS identifies that [...] "white food corn hybrids are dent corn... are typically contracted and sold to dry-mill processors and used in alkaline cooking processes for making masa, tortilla chips, snack foods, and grits" [...] as well as producing food-grade starch and paper. Dependent on their starch content, some <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> hybrids are grown and used {{in the production of}} food for human consumption.|$|E
5000|$|Dent corn {{also known}} as <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> Reid's <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It {{received}} its name {{because of the small}} indentation ("dent") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as [...] "Johnny Hopkins", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|The {{coloration}} of {{flint corn}} is often different from white and <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corns,</b> {{many of which}} were bred later. Most flint corn is multi-colored. Like the Linnaeus variant of maize, any kernel may contain the yellow pigment zeaxanthin but at more varying concentrations.|$|R
50|$|Sithiporn {{successfully}} propagated the Nicholson <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> {{variety of}} <b>corn</b> which he encouraged other farmers to plant for animal feed. Starting 1950 when rice was not favorable to land conditions, corn was planted instead. By the 1980s, corn {{became one of}} Thailand's major exports. He was also instrumental {{in the establishment of}} an egg producers' association which made Thailand an exporter of eggs.|$|R
40|$|There were {{significant}} differences in the hardness of the varieties of the <b>dent</b> <b>corns</b> fed in these experiments. Hardness of the corn was determined by a machine designed to find out the crushing resistance of the kernels. In the second and third trials, when three tests were made to determine actual crushing resistance, the means ranged from 24. 16 pounds on the Special Reid <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> or soft <b>corn</b> to 41. 46 pounds on the Krug. Average for these two trials showed that it required 27. 8 pounds to crush the soft type, 30. 3 pounds for the medium, Reid <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent,</b> and 37. 1 pounds to crush the hard type, Krug. The hard type corn was 25 percent harder than the soft type corn and 18 percent harder than the medium...|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the corn}} grown in the United States today is <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> or a closely related variety derived from it. Dent corn is the variety used in food {{manufacturing}} as the base ingredient for cornmeal flour (used in the baking of cornbread), corn chips, tortillas and taco shells. Starch derived from this high-starch content variety is turned into plastics, as well as fructose which {{is used as a}} sweetener (high-fructose corn syrup) in many processed foods and soft drinks.|$|E
50|$|Corn syrup is {{produced}} from number 2 <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn {{are required to}} yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1 kg of glucose or dextrose syrup. A bushel (25 kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3 kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1 kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524 kg) of corn to produce one short ton.|$|E
50|$|As per the {{standards}} of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Grade 2 corn is usually used for wet-milling. Harvested corn has to be cleaned before it is milled. Dockage tester with appropriate sieve number is used to removes particles other than the required grain like cob pieces, foreign seeds, metal pieces, leaves, dirt and the percentage of dockage contained can be calculated. The cleaned corn is then analyzed for its composition using NIR spectrometer. The compositional analysis of <b>Yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> carried out in Centre of Crop Utilization Research, Iowa State University is recorded in the table below.|$|E
40|$|Examinations during 3 {{consecutive}} years {{were made in}} Iowa for mold development in <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> shelled <b>corn</b> stored in steel bins of 1, 000 - 2, 740 bushel capacities. The first was made during August and September 1941, the second in March 1942 and the third in April 1943. Different bins were examined {{in each of the}} three inspections. Bins reportedly containing some corn of 14 percent or more moisture were examined and probed in the first examination, those with corn of 13. 5 percent or more moisture in the second examination; no selection of bins for moisture content was made in the third examination.

40|$|A 115 -d (16. 5 -wk) {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} validate the estimated availability of P in a high nutrient-dense (amino acids and calories), low-phytic acid (NDLP) corn variety as compared with conventional <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> (YD) <b>corn</b> when fed to commercial toms. The NDLP corn contained 0. 32 % P and 90 % of this was nonphytate P (NPP) compared with YD corn, which had 0. 25 % P and 32 % of the total P was NPP. Toms consuming NDLP corn were fed diets formulated {{to have the same}} dietary NPP level as the control diet with reduced levels of total P. Phosphorus was successfully formulated at 90 % availability for NDLP corn with no compromise to growth performance or bone integrity measurements compared with the control diet with YD corn. Ulna breaking strength was the most sensitive measurement of dietary P adequacy under the conditions of the experiment. Excretion of P from toms was decreased by 30 % when NDLP corn was fed in place of YD corn during the finishing phase, and litter P was decreased by 19 % by replacement of YD corn with NDLP corn...|$|R
40|$|Water {{absorption}} {{characteristic of}} six {{different types of}} maize namely; <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> (white and <b>yellow),</b> corn flour (white and yellow), popcorn and sweet corn during water soaking were studied at four different temperatures of 30, 40, 50 and 60 o C. The water absorption data fitted very well into both Peleg’s and Becker's models as to correspondingly determine the saturation moisture content (hydration equilibrium moisture content) and moisture diffusivity. The water absorption capacity and saturation moisture contents of each maize type increased as the water soaking temperature increased. The absorption kinetics followed the Fick's law of diffusion during the first hours of soaking. The determined diffusion coefficients values varied from 10. 6 to 13. 5 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for sweet corn, 6. 74 to 8. 88 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for white flour, 5. 27 to 7. 09 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for yellow flour, 4. 44 to 5. 79 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for popcorn, 4. 25 to 5. 69 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for <b>dent</b> white <b>corn</b> and 3. 28 to 4. 68 × 10 - 11 m 2 /s for <b>dent</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>corn,</b> respectively. An Arrhenius–type equation was used to relate the moisture diffusivity (diffusion coefficient) of <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> (white and <b>yellow),</b> corn flour (white and yellow), popcorn and sweet corn to temperature, and the energy of activation for <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> (white and <b>yellow),</b> corn flour (white and yellow), popcorn and sweet corn was estimated.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 144 gilts (initially 110. 4 lb, PIC) {{was used in}} a {{commercial}} research facility to evaluate the effects of corn source (NutriDense™, BASF, or # 2 Yellow Dent) and added fat (averaging 0, 3, and 6 %) on pig performance and carcass traits. Energy levels were based such that the higher energy (assuming 5 % greater ME than # 2 yellow dent) in NutriDense corn (with or without added fat) was calculated to be equal to that provided by <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> and added fat. In each phase, the first treatment diet contained <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> and no added fat. In the next dietary treatment, <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> was replaced with NutriDense corn, and then fat was added (2. 7 to 3. 2 % based on phase) to the yellow dent corn-based diet to equal the energy content of the NutriDense corn diet. This amount of added fat was then added to the NutriDensebased diet. The last <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> based diet used 5. 2 to 6. 2 % (based on phase) added fat to equal the energy content of the second NutriDense corn diet. This amount of fat was then added to the NutriDense-base diet to complete the treatment structure. For the overall study, pigs fed NutriDense corn had greater (P< 0. 04) ADG compared to pigs fed <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> There was a corn source by fat level interaction (P< 0. 01) observed for ADFI and F/G. When fat was added to diets containing NutriDense corn, F/G decreased linearly, whereas when fat was added to <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> the greatest improvement in feed efficiency was observed with the first 3 % added fat. Adding fat to diets also increased (P< 0. 01) final and carcass weight, and tended (P< 0. 09) to increase backfat thickness. Using the known energy values of <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> and fat, we calculated NutriDense corn to have 5. 3 % more ME than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> These results are similar to previous research in nursery pigs at Kansas State University showing 5 % more ME for NutriDense corn than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> This also supports work done the University of Illinois which determined that NutriDense corn has 6. 5 % more ME than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> Increasing the dietary energy level above a yellow dent corn-soybean meal-based diet with 6 % added fat improved ADG and F/G in grow-finish pigs. Furthermore, pigs fed NutriDense corn had greater ADG than pigs fed <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{variety of}} popcorn (Zea mays everta) grown in Ohio was {{analyzed}} for CP and amino acids and subsequently used in diets for growing turkeys. The {{objective of the}} experiment was to evaluate popcorn {{as a substitute for}} standard, Number 2 <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> in conventional diets for starting and growing turkeys. In comparison with Number 2 <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> popcorn was higher in CP and methionine but similar in lysine. There were no effects due to corn type on BW at 4 or 18 wk, feed conversion from 7 to 14 days, or fecal dry matter from 7 to 14 days.

40|$|A {{total of}} 315 nursery pigs (initially 33. 5 lb) {{were used in}} a 21 -d growth assay to compare {{relative}} energy values of ‘Nutridense’ and ‘Nutridense Low Phytate’ corn compared to <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> <b>corn.</b> Dietary treatments consisted of a 3 × 3 factorial with three sources of corn with 0, 3, or 6 % added fat. Increasing the energy density of the diet with added fat or higher energy corn varieties (Nutridense or Nutridense-LP corn) linearly improved feed efficiency. The linear improvement in feed efficiency allowed us to calculate the energy content of the Nutridense corn varieties relative to <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> <b>corn.</b> We determined that the ME values published by the University of Illinois indicating that Nutridense and Nutridense Low Phytate corn contain approximately 6. 5 and 4 % more energy, respectively, than normal <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> <b>corn</b> are appropriate for diet formulation...|$|E
40|$|Sitophilus zeamais (maize weevil) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pests of maize stored in tropical and subtropical regions. This study determined the resistance of flint <b>corn</b> and <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> to infestation by S. zeamais (Motschulsky), the maize weevil. Improved King Philip hybrid flint corn and Fontanelle 6 T- 510 hybrid <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> were used in this experiment. Two temperature conditions (10 °C and 27 °C) and two storage times (15 days and 30 days) were used. Results showed that flint corn was more resistant to insect damage than <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> at 27 °C and 30 day storage time. After 30 days storage time and 27 ºC death rate was significantly higher in flint corn (R 2 = 0. 945) compared to (R 2 = 0. 634) in <b>dent</b> <b>corn.</b> Damaged seed was 10 % higher in <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> then in flint corn at 27 ºC and 30 days. However, no significant difference was observed for seed weight loss between flint <b>corn</b> and <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> at the same storage conditions. Both <b>dent</b> and flint <b>corn</b> are extensively cultivated in developing countries.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} for two years to investigate the increase of <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> yields when intercropped with 3 different planting densities of soybean. <b>Dent</b> <b>corns</b> planted at a spacing of 80 cm × 40 cm, intercropped with soybean planted at the densities of 6, 25 and 38 plants/m 2, were observed in a completely randomized block design. The results were as follows. The Crop Growth Rate (CGR) and Net Assimilation Rate (NAR) of <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> at 8 to 9 weeks after planting were the highest at the soybean density of 25 plants/m 2.

40|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> hybrids having {{different}} kernel characteristics (A = small, hard; B = large, soft) but {{analyzed to}} contain similar nutrient profiles were compared as the grain source for broilers reared sex-separate to 7 wk of age. Feeds were formulated to NRC (1994) recommendations using a nutrient profile for typical <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> <b>corn</b> in the ingredient matrix. Direct substitution for the matrix corn with the test grains (A and B) provided two dietary treatments. Experimentation {{was conducted in}} winter and was repeated in summer. Broilers given corn A diets during the cold weather trial were heavier than those fed corn B. Feed conversion and mortality patterns were not affected. Chilled carcass weights were significantly greater for the corn A group, although abdominal fat, meat yield, and incidence of carcass quality defects were similar between the treatments. Duplication of the experiment during hot weather revealed parallel responses; however, the magnitude of variation decreased between treatment groups for all observations. The influence of corn source was independent of a significant broiler sex effect during both studies.
