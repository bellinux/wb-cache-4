2500|$|All but Rocco leave. A {{march is}} played as Pizarro enters with his guards. Rocco warns Pizarro that the {{minister}} plans a surprise visit tomorrow to investigate accusations of Pizarro's cruelty. Pizarro exclaims that he cannot let the minister discover the imprisoned Florestan, {{who has been}} thought dead. Instead, Pizarro will have Florestan murdered (Ha, welch ein Augenblick—"Hah! What a moment!"). As a signal, Pizarro orders that a trumpet be sounded at the minister's arrival. He offers Rocco money to kill Florestan, but Rocco refuses (Jetzt, Alter, jetzt hat es Eile!—"Now, old man, we must hurry!"). Pizarro says he will kill Florestan himself instead, with Rocco forced to dig the grave in a ruined well in the dungeons. Once the grave is ready, Rocco is to sound the alarm, upon which Pizarro will come into the dungeon and kill Florestan. Fidelio, hearing Pizarro's plot, is agitated, but is soothed by thoughts of Florestan (Abscheulicher! Wo eilst du hin? and Komm, Hoffnung, lass den letzten Stern—"Scum! Where are <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> so fast?" [...] and [...] "Come, hope, let the last star").|$|E
2500|$|The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was {{designed}} and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture {{is the sense of}} movement; [...] Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, black steel stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called [...] "confluence, interference and turbulence", ...|$|E

2500|$|The spot {{advertising}} for the fictional United Trek Federation was {{a spot on}} Darker Projects, premiering on the sixth third-season episode of Star Trek: The Section 31 Files called Invasion, Part III - Warday. In this spot, an announcer says [...] "How many times does this happen to you?", followed by the two geeks downloading a possible new Star Trek episode ( [...] or Section 31) available. Instead, they stumbled upon Doctor Who, and attempts to free the computer unsuccessful as it detonated, marking [...] "another tragic act of computer terrorism {{at the hands of}} the Who World Order." [...] The announcer then asks: [...] "Do you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering today's the day the forces of the Who World Order will come knocking on your door, to drag <b>you</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> their Who Relocation Camps?"

This particular agent is being intercepted by the UTF agent who's there for her, and the stolen DVDs are recovered back. It concludes with the line: [...] "With the United Trek Federation, you can sleep easily. Knowing the monsters of the Who World Order have at last met their match. United Trek Federation. We are here to protect you!" ...|$|E
