2500|$|Daly is popularly {{attributed}} in Marine Corps lore as yelling, [...] "Come on, you sons of bitches, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> forever?" [...] {{to his men}} {{during the}} Battle of Belleau Wood. Daly later told a Marine Corps historian that his words were [...] "For Christ's sake men—come on! Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> forever?" [...] The Chicago Tribune correspondent Floyd Gibbons, who was at Belleau Wood, reported hearing the words in his 1918 memoir And They Thought We Wouldn't Fight, which he attributed to an unnamed gunnery sergeant (Daly was a first sergeant at the time). Gibbons was attached to elements of Major Benjamin S. Berry's battalion (3rd Battalion 5th Marines) during the battle, but Daly was the First Sergeant of the 73rd Machine Gun Company, a part of 3rd Battalion 6th Marines {{under the command of}} Major Berton W. Sibley. Sibley's battalion attacked south of Berry's and were on the outskirts of Lucy-le-Bocage when Daly made the cry. Additionally, 6th Marines commander Colonel Albertus W. Catlin implied in his memoir that the yell came from an unnamed sergeant in Berry's battalion.. [...] For his actions at Belleau Wood, he was recommended for a third medal of honor. However, during the processing for his medal, someone thought that awarding three medals of honor to the same man was unacceptable, so Daly was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and later the Navy Cross and French Médaille Militaire.|$|E

2500|$|Demmin's current chronicler, then 14 years old, recalls:My {{mother was}} also raped.

[...] My siblings [...] realized only much later that I had held her back, that I had pulled her out {{of what may be}} called a state of trance, to prevent her from jumping into the water.

2500|$|In World War I, battle-tested, veteran Marines {{served a}} central role in the United States' entry into the conflict. Unlike the {{majority}} of Allied armies, the Marine Corps had a deep pool of officers and non-commissioned officers with battle experience, and experienced a smaller growth. They participated in small ways throughout 1918 (such as Château-Thierry, Soissons, and Saint-Mihiel), but its most famous action of the war would come that summer as the Spring Offensive neared its end. From 1 to 26 June, Marines fought their celebrated Battle of Belleau Wood, then the largest in the history of the Corps, creating their reputation in modern history. Rallying under the battle cries of [...] "Retreat? Hell, we just got here!" [...] (Capt Lloyd Williams) and [...] "Come on, you sons of bitches, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> forever?" [...] (GySgt Dan Daly), the Marines drove German forces from the area.

2500|$|In 1840, the Republic of Texas {{altered the}} city charter for Houston, {{dividing}} it into four wards. Historically the wards reflected geographic boundaries, without {{consideration of the}} population density within the wards. After slavery ended in Texas on June 19, 1865, ex-slaves were forced <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in separate enclaves within each of Houston’s wards. The voting population of the wards was lower than the population, since women and African-Americans had been forbidden from voting. Instead, wards followed boundaries of features such as the Buffalo Bayou, Congress Street, and Main Street. Each ward elected two aldermen to the Houston City Council. The election of the Mayor of Houston was citywide. Betty Chapman, a historian, said [...] "They really were mixed societies in the early days.

2500|$|In The Doctor of Stalingrad (1958) {{dealing with}} German POWs in the Soviet Union, Germans {{are portrayed as}} more civilized, humane and {{intelligent}} than the Soviets, who are shown {{for the most part}} as Mongol savages who brutalized the German POWs. One of the German POWs successfully seduces the beautiful and tough Red Army Captain Alexandra Kasalniskaya (Eva Bartok) who prefers him to the sadistic camp commandant, which as Bartov comments also is meant to show that even in defeat, German men were more sexually virile and potent than their Russian counterparts. In [...] (Dogs, do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> forever?) of 1959, which deals with the Battle of Stalingrad, the focus is on celebrating the heroism of the German soldier in that battle, who are shown as valiantly holding out against overwhelming odds with no mention at all of what those soldiers were fighting for, namely National Socialist ideology or the Holocaust. This period also saw a number of films that depicted the military resistance to Hitler. In Des Teufels General (The Devil's General) of 1954, a Luftwaffe general named Harras loosely modeled after Ernst Udet, appears at first to be cynical fool, but turns out to an anti-Nazi who is secretly sabotaging the German war effort by designing faulty planes. Bartov commented that in this film, the German officer corps is shown as a group of fundamentally noble and civilized men who happened to be serving an evil regime made up of a small gang of gangsterish misfits totally unrepresentative of German society, which served to exculpate both the officer corps and by extension Germany society. Bartov wrote that no German film of the 1950s showed the deep commitment felt by many German soldiers to National Socialism, the utter ruthless way the German Army fought the war and the mindless nihilist brutality of the later Wehrmacht. Bartov wrote that German film-makers liked to show the heroic last stand of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, but none has so far showed the 6th Army's massive co-operation with the Einsatzgruppen in murdering Soviet Jews in 1941.|$|E
