Hugo Strange then accuses him of having fabricated a series of events in order to conceal the truth about his condition, as he has read 12 different accounts of his past, all different, except for one detail: Batman.

500|$|Despite Kariya's {{success with}} Canada at the 2002 Olympics, {{he had come}} off the worst {{statistical}} season of his career prior to the national team's summer development camp {{in preparation for the}} 2006 Winter Olympics.

After a strong start to the 2005–06 NHL season, Kariya was one of 49 forwards chosen in October 2005 to Canada's preliminary list of players to be selected from for the final roster. When the team was announced in December 2005, however, he was not chosen.|$|E

500|$|The filming {{schedule}} {{was intended to}} last 138 days but grew to 160. Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned [...] "a lot of money". Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.|$|E

[...] On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, [...] "It's really {{an honor to be}} recognized like that, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a lot of help out there.
