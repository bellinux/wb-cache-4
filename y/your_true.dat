500|$|Beginning in late April, a Union {{force of}} 100,000 moved slowly against Corinth, under Halleck's command with Grant relegated to second-in-command; Sherman {{commanded}} the division {{on the extreme}} right of the Union's right wing (under George H. Thomas). [...] Shortly after the Union forces occupied Corinth on May 30, Sherman persuaded Grant not to leave his command, despite the serious difficulties he was having with Halleck. Sherman offered Grant an example from his own life, [...] "Before the battle of Shiloh, I was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of 'crazy', but that single battle gave me new life, and I'm now in high feather." [...] He told Grant that, if he remained in the army, [...] "some happy accident might restore you to favor and <b>your</b> <b>true</b> place". [...] In July, Grant's situation improved when Halleck left for the East to become general-in-chief, and Sherman became the military governor of occupied Memphis.|$|E
500|$|Winslet {{has said}} that she is {{interested}} in parts of [...] "angst-ridden women" [...] with strong dispositions masking flaws and insecurities. She connects with [...] "women who are either finding {{their way out of}} a situation, looking for love, having some struggle within love, or questioning the big things in life". She subconsciously finds herself drawn to parts that are in tandem with her personal struggles at certain points in her life. She finds it difficult to detach herself from her roles, saying that [...] "you have to confront <b>your</b> <b>true</b> feelings every single day. And that’s pretty exhausting. Then you have to go home and make dinner". Even so, she finds it therapeutic to perform. Winslet is known for her willingness to perform nude scenes, having done so in 12 of her films, although she considers its contribution to the narrative before agreeing to it. She believes that these scenes promote a positive body image among women.|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a slump in Grant's career. His roles as a top brain surgeon who is {{caught in the middle of}} a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in Crisis, and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in People Will Talk were poorly received. [...] Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years, being successful, wealthy and popular, and remarked: [...] "To play yourself, <b>your</b> <b>true</b> self, is the hardest thing in the world". In 1952, Grant starred in the comedy Room for One More, playing an engineer husband who with his wife (Betsy Drake) adopt two children from an orphanage. He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy Monkey Business, co-starring Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe. Though the critic from Motion Picture Herald wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career's best with an [...] "extraordinary and agile performance", which was matched by Rogers, it received a mixed reception overall. Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy Dream Wife would salvage his career, but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953. Though he was considered for the leading part in A Star is Born, Grant believed that his film career was over, and briefly left the industry.|$|E

500|$|... "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is a [...] "tender" [...] pop power ballad with {{contemporary}} R, soul and lite rock influences, performed {{in an urban}} contemporary style. According to the song's official sheet music, published by Walt Disney Music Publishing on Musicnotes.com, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] is set in signature common time and performed at a moderate tempo of 88 beats per minute in the key of C major. The Disney Song Encyclopedia author Thomas S. Hischak believes that the song's lyrics are [...] "about following your heart to find <b>your</b> <b>true</b> self", which begin [...] "They'll try to hold you back, they will say you're wrong, but they will never understand, no, the journey that you're on." [...] A writer for Barnes & Noble agreed that, thematically, the single [...] "correlates to the film's tale of an inexperienced young adventurer", Milo Thatch, and its diverse cast of supporting characters, all of whom long to follow various dreams of their own as they search for Atlantis. One of its verses reads, [...] "There's something in your soul/That won't be denied/It's the faith to dream that keeps the dream alive/So you still believe {{and you know you}} must go", encouraging listeners to follow their dreams despite others' opinions. Lasting a duration of four minutes, AllMusic cites the song's mood as both [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "mellow"; Mýa performs it using a [...] "sweet vocal", which spans two octaves from G3 to D♭5. Based on a melody heard only briefly during the film, [...] "Where the Dream Takes You" [...] encompasses [...] "soft, contemporary beats" [...] combined with the singer's [...] "dulcet tones" [...] that recall music played in a piano lounge, contrasting with the time period in which the film itself is set. Its production, which has been described as [...] "polished", was handled by Jay Selvester, Robbie Buchanan and Ron Fair.|$|E
500|$|A {{portion of}} the video is {{dedicated}} to the Broadway musical Cabaret. The video begins with soldiers in black leather uniforms in a cabaret with a close-up of a soldier passed out in female fishnet stockings and heels as another lone soldier stares into the distance. The scene then cuts to male dancers performing elaborate choreography while marching forward with a Star of David. As the intro of the song begins, Gaga is shown leading a funeral procession, carrying the Sacred Heart on a pillow. When the lyrics begin, she sits on a throne wearing an elaborate headpiece and binocular-like eyepieces, with a smoking pipe in her hand, watching her dancers perform a rigorous routine in the snow. Gaga is then seen as the character Sally Bowles from Cabaret, dancing and simulating sex acts with three men on a stage with twin beds surrounded by spotlights, all wearing nothing but underwear, intercut with shots of Gaga lying on a larger bed dressed in a red latex nun outfit. She subsequently appears dressed in a white hooded robe, reminiscent of Joan of Arc, with her dancers, interspersed with a shot of her as the nun, consuming a set of rosary beads. After this, Gaga and her dancers are shown in a sequence in black-and-white in their military uniforms performing a tribute dedicated to the late choreographer Bob Fosse, who won an Academy Award for his direction of the film version of Cabaret. Gaga is seen in a blonde bob and a similar outfit to one of Liza Minnelli's performance costumes. The video moves to a scene of her wearing a bra equipped with AR-15 rifle barrels [...] and her dancers performing another dance routine. She is then shown in the empty club, scenes of war breaking out flash by, and the lone soldier appears again. Going back to the Joan of Arc scene, she struggles with her dancers and disrobes. The video ends with her dressed as the nun, the film burning away from her face outwards. Klein explained that the video was, [...] "about a woman's desire to resurrect a dead love and who can not face the brutality of her present situation. The pain of living without <b>your</b> <b>true</b> love." ...|$|E

But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think {{that is one of the}} exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much." ...|$|E

The SS men lined them {{up against the wall}} of a barn and shot them all; only two survived. Meanwhile, the Luftwaffe dropped bombs and leaflets on the Allied armies.

2500|$|Different {{scholars}} have varying interpretations for {{the concept of}} amanitvam, humility, as virtue in the Bhagwad Gita. For example, Prabhupada explains humility to mean one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but {{from the point of}} view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. Jopson explains amanitvam, humility, as lack of arrogance and pride, and one of twenty six virtues in a human being that if perfected, leads one to a divine state of living and the ultimate truth. Eknath Easwaran writes that the Gita's subject is [...] "the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious", and [...] "The language of battle is often found in the scriptures, for it conveys the strenuous, long, drawn-out campaign we must wage to free ourselves from the tyranny of the ego, the cause of all our suffering and sorrow". To get in touch with <b>your</b> <b>true</b> self, whether you call that God, Brahman, etc., one has to let go of the ego. [...] The Sanskrit word Ahamkara literally translates into The-sound-of-I, or quite simply the sense of the self or ego.|$|E
2500|$|This creates further problems, {{as it is}} {{even more}} crucial to 'save face' after one's {{relationship}} has been broken when one is connected to new media technologies. Erving Goffman argues that all social life boils down to face-to-face interactions. These interpersonal interactions are mediated by what Goffman terms as [...] "face-work", which are the actions undertaken to maintain consistency with one's face, and to uphold the expressive order of social situations. Individuals attempt to keep a positive image of the self when interacting with others, and in order to do so, they may have to alter their appearance or manner in some way. Such face-work can also be seen in new technologies, especially social media websites such as Facebook. If someone breaks up with you, you can actively choose what [...] "face" [...] you want to present to your friends, including your ex. You can choose to either post sad updates, which is the most natural thing you would want to do, or you can [...] "save face" [...] by posting happy updates and pictures of you going out with your friends. Even though you may be absolutely heartbroken within, Facebook allows you to hide <b>your</b> <b>true</b> feelings from the online world, and from your ex, by manipulating your profile. New media is being utilized as a tool for helping users present a desirable image of themselves, enabling them to save face in difficult situations. Nearly 35% of respondents in a study admitted to using their Facebook status to make someone think that they had plans, even if they did not.|$|E

The people are Protestants... a persuasion not only favourable to liberty, but built upon it... My hold of the colonies is in the close affection which grows from common names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These are ties which, though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government—they will cling and grapple to you, and no force under heaven will be of power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it be once understood that your government may be one thing and their privileges another, that these two things may exist without any mutual relation—the cement is gone, the cohesion is loosened, and everything hastens to decay and dissolution. As long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The more they multiply, the more friends you will have; the more ardently they love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can have anywhere. It is a weed that grows in every soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have it from Prussia.
