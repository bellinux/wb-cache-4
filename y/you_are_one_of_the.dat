500|$|As captain, Johnson {{was noted}} for his public {{relations}} skills and his gift for public speaking. [...] He was optimistic by nature, with {{a belief in}} [...] "guts and determination". [...] However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: [...] "Just cos <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." [...] At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. Ian Craighis successor as Australian captainwas critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: [...] "I don't think [...] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team {{knew what was going}} on." [...] Pat Crawford felt [...] "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [...] ". [...] He was seen by some of his team mates as [...] "dictatorial" [...] with [...] Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Saëns {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878. In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday. On 28 July he {{disappeared}} from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say {{that he would not be}} returning. They never saw each other again. Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five. Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman. Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women. After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle. Marie told him, [...] "For us <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here." ...|$|E
500|$|Jervis {{could also}} be {{exceptionally}} kind when {{he felt that the}} situation warranted it. On one occasion, while the fleet was becalmed the men of the flagship were ordered to bathe. The men leapt over the side to swim in a sail that had been lowered over the side. One of the men, a senior able seaman, jumped in wearing his trousers. In one of the pockets he had his prize money and back pay that he had been saving for several years. The bank notes were destroyed by the water and when the man came aboard and discovered what had happened he began to weep. The Admiral saw the man and asked the problem. One of his officers told him and St Vincent went to his cabin. When he returned he had the crew mustered and called the man forward. [...] "Roger Odell you are convicted, Sir, by your own appearance of tarnishing the British oak with tears. What have you to say in your defence why you should not receive what you deserve?" [...] The man told him what had happened and St Vincent replied [...] "Roger Odell <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best men in this ship you are moreover a captain of a top and in my life I never saw a man behave himself better in battle than you did in the Victory in the action with the Spanish fleet. To show therefore that your Commander-in-chief will never pass over merit wheresoever he may find it. There is your money Sir!" [...] The Earl produced £70 of his own money and presented it to the surprised sailor [...] "but no more tears mind, no more tears Sir".|$|E

2500|$|Sun Ce asked Taishi Ci, [...] "In the past, {{you helped}} your commandery's {{administrator}} destroy {{a letter from}} the provincial administration, saved Wenju (Kong Rong) from danger, and successfully obtained reinforcements from Xuande (Liu Bei). These are all acts of heroism. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most intelligent people in this world, yet you haven't found someone who appreciates your talent.

2500|$|Liam Brady {{described}} Cole as {{a player}} with [...] "great character and determination" [...] and his former teammate Sylvinho noted that one of Cole's qualities was being competent: [...] "Ashley does not need people saying, 'Do this' or 'Go there'. He knows, he knows." [...] The rapid progress made by Cole in his debut season for Arsenal [...] "surprised" [...] Wenger and prompted {{him to make the}} defender his first pick. Sylvinho, the player displaced, commented that Wenger's belief in Cole helped him to develop {{as a player}}: [...] "He spoke to [...] and said: 'After Silvinho you can play left-back. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best left-backs at the club and one day {{will be one of the}} best in the world.'" [...] Cole's link-up play with winger Robert Pirès and main striker Thierry Henry in a 4–4–2 formation effectively made him [...] "a wing-back or winger playing in a back four" [...] because Arsenal's game emphasised attacking football.|$|E
