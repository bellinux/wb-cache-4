25|$|Following {{his second}} tour in Iraq, Petraeus {{authored}} a widely read article in Military Review, listing fourteen observations {{he had made}} during two tours in Iraq, including: do not do too much with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> money is ammunition, {{increasing the number of}} stakeholders is critical to success, success in a counterinsurgency requires more than just military operations, ultimate success depends on local leaders, {{there is no substitute for}} flexible and adaptable leaders, and, finally, a leader's most important task is to set the right tone.|$|E
500|$|On {{including}} the Punisher {{specifically in the}} season, where he is introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are [...] "able to do things {{on the small screen}} that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies." [...] Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than [...] "pushing the boundary" [...] or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more [...] "adult...darker, dirtier" [...] way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher. Petrie stated that the writers hoped to [...] "stir the pot" [...] and [...] "get people to think" [...] with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, [...] "Taking lethal justice into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings." [...] Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as [...] "Punisher" [...] in the writer's room, similarly to Wilson Fisk not being called [...] "Kingpin" [...] for season one, as it allowed the writers to think [...] "about [...] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell’s Kitchen or other things." [...] In the series, the moniker of [...] "The Punisher" [...] is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the Hawarden Amateur Horticultural Society on 17 August 1876, Gladstone remarked [...] "I am delighted to see how many young boys and girls have come forward to obtain honourable marks of {{recognition}} on this occasion,—if any effectual good is to be done to them, it must be done by teaching and encouraging them and helping them to help themselves. All the people who pretend to take your own concerns out of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> and to do everything for you, I won't say they are impostors; I won't even say they are quacks; but I do say they are mistaken people. The only sound, healthy description of countenancing and assisting these institutions is that which teaches independence and self-exertion". Lord Kilbracken, one of Gladstone's secretaries added: ...|$|E
60|$|Don Ant. Yes, sir; {{here is your}} consent, under <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then be assured," [...] said Ranald, [...] "that <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and none}} other, {{will do the}} deed of which you have {{witnessed}} the shadow." ...|$|R
6000|$|Eric. [...] I fear he {{scarcely}} {{has recovered}} [...] 80 [...] The toils of Monday: 'twas a noble chase: [...] You speared four with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Eventually, on 13 June 2006, five {{suspects}} in the lynching were arrested, one who was already serving a prison sentence was brought in for questioning, and a seventh suspect turned himself in after learning he was wanted by police. The police said: [...] "We're responsible for maintaining the law, and you can't take the law into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> even when it concerns a terrorist who murdered innocent people, even though he made a heinous terrorist act". Two suspects were subsequently released. There was general support for their arrest and even left-wing activist Yossi Beilin said: [...] "Israel can't {{put up with a}} lynch made on a handcuffed person even if his actions are heinous and unforgivable. It's a combined interest of both Jews and Arabs that Israel won't close its eyes to such behaviour". The Arab Knesset members however demanded their release and called their arrest a crime.|$|E
60|$|GIUSEPPE (with eager admiration). They say you {{jumped off}} your horse and worked {{the big guns}} with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> General.|$|E
60|$|Mess. Sir, {{a gentleman}} met {{me at the}} corner of the next street, and bid me give this into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Mackellar," [...] said he, [...] "carry {{this note}} to its {{destination}} with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand.</b> It is highly private. Find the person alone when you deliver it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What! Are you not satisfied? I {{tell you}} that if you say more I will force you to kill the boy with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand.</b> Take them away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{stopped her}} with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> Mrs Fyne," [...] I said. [...] "I presume {{she meant to}} get away. That girl is no comedian--if I am any judge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [With {{a sudden}} burst of furious anger.] You killed him! You killed him {{as surely as}} if you'd strangled him with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
6000|$|R.C. No, no, Sir, I do not {{understand}} him so. Will Atkins, explain yourself: you did not kill your father, did you, with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{take the}} task of curing the sick one, and of {{strengthening}} the weak one, into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> If you will teach, perhaps I may learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] {{continued}} the magistrate, [...] "how {{do you think}} you can be trusted with a charge in the prison, when you have broken at <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> half the jails in Scotland?" ...|$|R
60|$|The endeavor, with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and common}} pen and ink, to copy {{a small piece}} of either of the two Holbein woodcuts (Figures 2 and 3) will prove this to you better than any words.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Hobbie," [...] {{said the}} Laird, [...] "for one who {{believes}} so deeply {{as you do}} in supernatural appearances, I must own you take Heaven in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> rather audaciously, considering where we are walking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Señor, {{you seem}} to know our hearts as well as if your Excellency had made them with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> and then put them into our miserable bodies!" ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [pulling himself {{together}} huffily] It has {{no effect}} on me, madam. I fear my conversation does not interest you. If not, the remedy is in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My boy," [...] {{said his}} mother to him, [...] "all your cleverness, your {{breaking}} away from old things, and taking life in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> doesn't seem to bring you much happiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would do}} no {{discredit}} to any come of that illustrious race, Signore, {{and therefore we}} will say no more of the matter; always relying that, at the proper moment, you will not question <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> and seal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Note.--Did it ever {{occur to}} you to be obliged to copy out, with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> this sort of opinion of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> character? I can {{recommend}} the sensation produced as something quite new, and the temptation to add a line or two on <b>your</b> <b>own</b> account to be as nearly as possible beyond mortal resistance.--P.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you {{see what}} all that means? Well, I'll tell you. You're in the biggest streak of luck a man ever had. You've got the cards in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand!</b> They spell 'Fowler'! Play Fowler first, last, and all the time. Good-night, and good luck, MR. FOWLER." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are mad, Nigel!" [...] he cried. [...] "What do {{you hope}} to do then? Would you carry the castle with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands?</b> Halt, man, halt, {{in the name of the}} Virgin!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may thank {{your own}} obstinacy and conceit," [...] said Lord Marney. [...] "I took you to Mowbray Castle, and the cards were in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> if {{you chose to}} play them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All these things," [...] {{he muttered}} bitterly, [...] "this desperate resolve {{to take your}} life into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> your unnatural craving for independence, would never trouble you for a moment--if you really cared." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} as I {{opened the door}} last night you rushed out upon me, struck me with both your fists in the face, knocked me down, kicked me furiously in the side, and left me lying almost {{unconscious}} in the street. Look at <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> bearing witness against you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Seaforth's {{face grew}} grave. [...] "Then, as Harry wouldn't {{like it and}} there's nothing in it, I'd {{get rid of that}} fancy. Now, of course, you know what you can do, but isn't it playing a little too much into <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand?</b> And you see folks might get talking about the thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm always taking exercise," [...] {{said the}} earl. [...] "There isn't {{a man about}} the place works much harder than I do. And, let me tell you, sir, when you {{undertake}} to keep six or seven hundred acres of land in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand,</b> you must look after it, unless you mean to lose money by it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have quite}} enough on <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> already," [...] {{said the old}} Knight; [...] "he would do far more harm in your troop than out of it, and try your {{patience}} every hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it is no}} trouble; I {{dare say}} <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> are almost numbed with cold. Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a {{sandwich}} or two: here are the keys of the storeroom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] she said, {{as soon as}} she {{recalled}} herself to the outspread meal, [...] "it is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> and I idly asleep the while." ...|$|E
40|$|Illusionism {{provides}} a surprising and unforgettable way of explaining photonics {{to a wide}} audience. Imagine grabbing with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> an egg-sized photon with the same incredible properties as in a quantum computer! And what about touching the light beam which detects and removes diseased cells like in cutting edge medical prototypes? The art of magic allows promoting photonics, exploring advanced subjects in an understandable and palpable fashion that strongly inspires all ages...|$|R
6000|$|She seated herself {{near the}} window. The {{wardrobe}} stood {{against the wall}} opposite, and the bed was {{at the side of}} the room on her right hand. [...] "Open the wardrobe, Mr. Noel," [...] she said. [...] "I don't go near it. I touch nothing in it myself. Take out the dresses with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand</b> and put them on the bed. Take them out one by one until I tell you to stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If they do, you can {{go after}} them. The truth is simply this, Ballindine; Miss Wyndham will follow her own fancy in the matter, {{in spite of her}} guardian; but, if you make no further {{advances}} to her, of course she can make none to you. But I think the game is in <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>hand.</b> You haven't the head to play it, or I should consider the stakes as good as won." ...|$|R
