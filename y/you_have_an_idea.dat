500|$|On 15 March 1944, Operation Save was {{launched}} {{with the objective}} of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region. Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: [...] "We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland.... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons. Not only do you (have these) in your hands, but above all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> in your hearts – to liberate the homeland.... Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler." ...|$|E
500|$|Hersey {{began by}} making himself {{familiar}} {{with the work of}} writers already in the market who were capable of producing the kind of material Ralston wanted. [...] He soon concluded that the new magazine would have to include some reprinted stories alongside the original material. [...] The budget did not permit Hersey to pay rates that would attract top-quality writers, nor even to reprint the best-known stories of the kind he was looking for, and he was forced to use relatively unknown authors such as Perley Poore Sheehan and Robert W. Sneddon. [...] Hersey distributed a [...] "Notice to Writers" [...] that described what he was looking for: [...] "strange, bizarre, occult, mysterious tales... mystic happenings, weird adventures, feats of leger-de-main, spiritualism, et cetera... If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> which you have considered too bizarre to write, too weird or strange, let us see it." [...] This did not restrict the submissions to fantasy or science fiction, and as a result Hersey received (and printed) all kinds of fiction, including mysteries, adventures, and love stories, though it may be that he simply did not receive enough good quality science fiction and fantasy to fill the magazine. [...] Hersey later recalled that the notice did not bring in many usable manuscripts: [...] "As a result of the notices in the writers' magazines, I received a thousand manuscripts but was able to buy only ten!" ...|$|E
500|$|Enema of the State {{is mainly}} {{considered}} a pop punk album and is even considered a skate punk album. According to Mike Damante of the Daily Cougar, the album [...] "embraces the pop side of pop-punk". The songs on Enema of the State are fast-paced songs regarding [...] "adolescent aimlessness, broken hearts and general confusion over {{the care and}} feeding of girls." [...] Summarizing the album's content, The New York Times called Enema of the State a sampling of [...] "ecstatic, goofy numbers about teenage uselessness, with a smattering of tender introspection." [...] The songs are mainly autobiographical, or are inspired by stories from friends' experiences. Enema of the State largely revolves around age and maturity—"more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it." [...] The band decided to emphasize arrangements, harmonies and melodic ideas rather than the fast-paced nature of Dude Ranch; the change was {{brought about by the}} band, rather than the label. Barker hoped to give the songs varying tempos, something missing in the group's prior recordings. [...] "I told Mark and Tom, 'It's going to be repetitive if all our songs have the same punk-rock beat all the time. Why don't we try some different tempos?'" [...] DeLonge noted he was open to his proposals, and responded, [...] "Dude, I just play guitar and write melodies. You own the beats. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> that's what you're supposed to do." [...] DeLonge later reflected on his desire for a more [...] "pop" [...] sound: ...|$|E

60|$|Robert {{is in good}} spirits, and {{inclined}} to like Paris increasingly. Do you know I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> in England that you monopolise comforts, and I, for one, can't admit it. These snug 'apartments' exclude the draughty passages and staircases, which threaten your life every time that you run to your bedroom for a pocket-handkerchief in England. I much prefer the Continental houses to the English ones, both for winter and summer, on this account.|$|E

'Well, my lady, your la'ship knows best,' replied Mistress Pauncefort, evidently very disappointed; {{for she had}} {{indulged in}} {{momentary}} visions of noble visitors and noble valets; 'I am always content, you know, when your la'ship is; but, I must say, I {{think it is very}} odd for a lord to be so poor. I never heard of such a thing. I think they will turn out richer than <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea,</b> my lady.

But mind, if you do get into any adventure and need assistance, you are bound to let us help you. That is the compact we made, two months ago. We agreed to stand by each other, to be good comrades, to share our last sous, and naturally to give mutual aid under all and every circumstance." ...|$|E

"Then shouldn't it {{make you}} more careful not to fall into a similar error again? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fixed <b>idea</b> in your mind {{and the way you}} dwell on it is {{breaking}} you down; seeing you suffer is wearing me.

[...] "Because {{you are my}} Chief Steward <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> you can scold {{me as much as}} you please. But the very next time you become impudent, I will send you to work in the furnaces, and get another Nome to fill your place. Now follow me to my chamber, for I am going to bed. And see that I am wakened early tomorrow morning. I want to enjoy the fun of transforming the rest of these people into ornaments." ...|$|E
60|$|Divers negroes, in very free-and-easy pantaloons, {{and with}} no {{redundancy}} in the shirt line, were scuttling about, hither and thither, without bringing to pass any very particular results, except expressing a generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally {{for the benefit of}} Mas'r and his guests. Add to this picture a jolly, crackling, rollicking fire, going rejoicingly up a great wide chimney,--the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the calico window-curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw air,--and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the jollities of a Kentucky tavern.|$|E
60|$|You {{have only}} to {{multiply}} this little scene by forty or fifty, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> <b>idea</b> of the loading of that steamer on the high seas. Of course you must diversify the picture a little, for in one place you have a man hanging over the side with a trunk in mid-air, barely caught when in its descent, and almost too heavy for him by reason of his position. In another place you have a man glaring up at a trunk, in another glaring down;--in all cases action the most violent and most diversified, coupled with cool contempt of crushed fingers and bruised shins and toes.|$|E
