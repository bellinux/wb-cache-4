40|$|Sorption {{efficiencies}} of modified montmorillonite and vermiculite {{of their}} mono ionic Na and organic HDTMA and HDP forms were studied against {{chemical and biological}} warfare agents such as <b>yperite</b> and selected bacterial strains. <b>Yperite</b> interactions with modified clay minerals were observed through its capture in low-density polyethylene foil-modified clay composites by measuring <b>yperite</b> gas permeation with using chemical indication and gas chromatography methods. The antibacterial activities of synthetized organoclays were tested against selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species in minimum inhibitory concentration tests. The obtained results showed a positive influence of modified clay minerals on the significant <b>yperite</b> breakthrough-time increase. The most effective material was the polyethylene-Na form montmorillonite, while the polyethylene-Na form vermiculite showed the lowest efficiency. With increasing organic cations loading in the interlayer space the montmorillonite efficiency decreased, {{and in the case}} of vermiculite an opposite effect was observed. Generally the modified montmorillonites were more effective than modified vermiculites. The HDP cations seem to be more effective compare to the HDTMA. The antibacterial activity tests confirmed efficiency of all organically modified clay minerals against Gram-positive bacteria.

40|$|AbstractThe {{degradation}} of thiodiglycol (I) and benzyl sulfide (II) was attempted using Coriolus versicolor and Tyromyces palustris {{to investigate the}} potential ability of basidiomycetes to degrade <b>Yperite</b> (bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide), a mass-produced and stored chemical warfare agent. I was very rapidly degraded by both fungi. The metabolic pathway of II was elucidated, showing that the initial step was the hydrolytic cleavage of the thioether bond to yield benzyl alcohol and benzyl mercaptan. Benzyl alcohol was further oxidized and finally mineralized. Benzyl mercaptan is reversibly converted to benzyl disulfide and also converted to benzyl alcohol. Finally, the effective {{degradation of}} bis(2 -bromoethyl) sulfide strongly suggests that basidiomycete would be a potential tool for <b>Yperite</b> degradation...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential toxicological effects on fish related to the leakage of <b>yperite</b> from rusted bomb shells dumped at sea.

As for the in vivo experiment, specimen of European eel were subcutaneously injected with 0. 015, 0. 15 and 1. 5 mg/kg of <b>yperite</b> and sacrificed after 24 and 48 h. In the field study, specimen of Conger eel were collected from a dumping site in the Southern Adriatic Sea. The presence/absence of <b>yperite</b> in tissues, genotoxicity, detoxification enzymes, histological alterations and gross abnormalities were investigated. Results of the in vivo experiment showed a significant increase of EROD activity at both 24 h and 48 h. UGT activity increased significantly at 48 h post injection. An acute inflammatory response after 24 h in skin layers and muscle was observed, associated to cell degeneration and necrosis after 48 h at the highest dose.

40|$|Chemical weapons count {{among the}} weapons of mass destruction. In {{addition}} to chemical weapons, also nuclear and biological weapons belong here. Historically, chemical weapons rank among the oldest ones. Their initial steps were made in the distant past, even if they were not called so then. However, the initial utilization of chemical agents against human force is more connected with fire. It was used for protection against attacks of animals as well as people. Later on it was used to protect or capture towns and fortifications. The most extensive use of chemical weapons in war occurred during World War I. A large number of chemical substances was tested, the most important being phosgene. In 1917, German army used vesicant <b>yperite</b> near the town of Ypres. The development of chemical warfare agents continued also after the year 1918. During World War II, chemical weapons were practically not used. If it happened, then on the secondary fronts only. The main reason was the fear of possible retaliation. From 1939 to 1945, huge amounts of chemical warfare agents were made. Towards {{the end of the war}} this stockpile amounted to approximately 400 000 tonnes. After World War II, a new stage of chemical armament has begun. The greatest attention was concentrated on nerve agents, sarin, soman and agent VX. Chemical warfare agents have been further used also after the year 1945. In the not so distant past, Iraq used nerve-paralyzing agents and <b>yperite</b> during the Iran-Iraq War (1980 { [...] } 1988). Last but not least, the use of chemical warfare agents for terrorist purposes is to be mentioned. In January 1993, the global fight against chemical weapons culminated in signing of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Under this Convention, chemical weapons were to be liquidated until the year 2007. States Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention which did not comply with this deadline have asked for prolongation of the final deadlines for chemical weapons liquidation until 29 April 2012. The question remains if even this prolongation will fulfil the goal of the Convention { [...] } to ensure a world without chemical weapons. Until the time when the stockpiles of chemical weapons are completely liquidated their possible misuse cannot be excluded.

40|$|In {{order to}} perform Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) {{procedures}} {{for a system}} dedicated to the neutron interrogation of objects {{for the presence of}} threat materials one needs to perform measurements of reference materials (RM) i. e. simulants having the same (or similar) atomic ratios as real materials. It is well known that explosives, drugs, and various other benign materials, contain chemical elements such as hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen in distinctly different quantities. For example, a high carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) is characteristic of drugs. Explosives can be differentiated by measurement of both (C/O) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratios. The C/N ratio of the chemical warfare agents, coupled with the measurement of elements such as fluorine and phosphorus, clearly differentiate them from the conventional explosives. Here we present the RM preparation, calibration procedure and correlations attained between theoretical values and experimentally obtained results in laboratory conditions for C/O and N/C ratios of prepared hexogen (RDX), TNT, DLM 2, TATP, cocaine, heroin, <b>yperite,</b> tetranitromethane, peroxide methylethylketone, nitromethane and ethyleneglycol dinitrate simulants.

40|$|International audienceThe {{destruction}} of stockpiles or unexploded ammunitions of bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide, also called mustard gas or <b>yperite,</b> by thermal treatments requires {{the development of}} highly safe processes. The high-level of toxicity of this compound induces {{a high level of}} complexity for any experiments. Consequently, there is a considerable lack of knowledge on the behavior of this chemical under high-temperature conditions (with or without oxygen). In this work a detailed chemical kinetic model for the combustion and pyrolysis of mustard gas is proposed for the first time. A large number of thermo-kinetic parameters were calculated using quantum chemistry and reaction rate theory. The model was validated against experimental pyrolysis data of the literature. It was shown that the degradation of mustard gas is ruled by a chain reaction mechanism where the chlorine atom is the principal chain carrier. HS radical, formed in the primary mechanism by an original pathway found using quantum calculations, was also proved to be an important chain carrier. Comparison with the kinetics of the usual simulant of mustard gas, diethyl sulfide, showed that the lack of chlorine atom in the former chemical leads to an inappropriate simulation of the mustard gas behavior. Combustion and pyrolysis simulations were also compared and surprisingly demonstrated that chlorine atoms remain the main chain carrier in combustion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the environmental threat to benthic species from chemical weapons dumped in the southern Adriatic Sea. An ecotoxicological approach using chemical analysis and biological responses was applied, in two sentinel species: the Blackbelly rosefish Helicolenus dactylopterus and European conger Conger conger. Specimen were collected in a stretch of sea, where had been dumped war materials and from a reference site free of ordnance. Residues of <b>yperite,</b> Hg and As were measured in fish fillets. Skin, liver, kidney and spleen were examined for histopathological and macroscopical lesions. Liver detoxifying capacities (EROD and UDPGT) and genotoxicity (comet assay) were also investigated. As and Hg levels were three-four times higher than those from the reference site in both species (pb 0. 001). Both species captured in dumping site showed clear signs of chronic illness according to the health assessment index (HAI). Deep ulcers and nodules were observed on skin and external organs. Histological lesions such as periportal and bile duct fibrosis, pericholangitis, steatosis, granuloma and elevated splenic MMCs were detected in liver and spleen. Significantly higher EROD activities were also found in both species from dumping site (pb 0. 01). Comet assay revealed genotoxicty in gills of C. conger from dumping site, indicating uptake of chemical warfare agents through fish gills.

40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{used to assess}} the eco- toxicity of chemical munitions lying on the seabed in the Southern Adriatic Sea where aerial bombs charged with mustard agent and organoarsenic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) have been dumped. Sampling activities and laboratory analyses have been carried out on two sentinel species, the blackbelly rosefish, Helicolenus dactylopterus, and the European conger, Conger conger, collected in a CWA dumping site 35 nm from the coast of Apulia, Italy, and from a reference site. Fish were analyzed through an ecotoxicological approach, integrating chemical analysis and biological responses. Degradation products of the blister agents bis-(2 -chloroethyl) sulphide, commonly known as mustard agent or <b>yperite</b> (also called sulfur or sulfur mustard) were found in sediment samples collected nearby aerial bombs. Although no evidence of these compounds was detected in tissues of either fish, levels of heavy metals (arsenic and mercury), potentially released by rusted chemical weapons, were significantly higher in sediment and fish from the CWA site compared to the reference site. Severe external and internal lesions were observed in fish captured in the CWA site, with congers displaying small to large skin ulcers along the body. Health assessment index (HAI) values, as well as spleen melano-macrophages centres and CYP 1 A ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity were higher in fish from the CWA site, indicating a chronic state of illness and environment degradation. The working procedures and analyses performed during these surveys could be suitable for future biomonitoring studies in other CWA dumping sites...|$|E
