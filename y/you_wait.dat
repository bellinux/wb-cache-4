500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. <b>You</b> <b>wait</b> and see. No one else will talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} judged Mega Man 3 to be {{excessively}} difficult. GamePro contributor McKinley Noble comically stated that actions such as [...] "pulling teeth, lifting a car {{over your head}} or performing open-heart surgery" [...] are all significantly easier than beating Mega Man 3. Whitehead noted, [...] "Leaps must be precise, enemies must be dispatched rapidly and accurately, and there's {{a constant state of}} delicious near-panic as <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> to see what vicious demands the next room will place on your platforming skills." [...] The Lessers additionally saw considerable flicker when too many sprites appear onscreen at once. The writers mentioned that it detracted from the normally crisp graphics the few times it was noticed.|$|E
500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always told that you carry the impact to the opponent. If <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E

It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves.

500|$|The crew {{tried to}} keep CGI use to a minimum, as Anderson said people in suits and puppets are scarier than CGI monsters as they are [...] "there in the frame". Roughly 70% of scenes were created using suits, puppets, and miniatures. The Alien queen was filmed using three variations: a 4.8-meter {{practical}} version, a 1.2-meter puppet, and a computer-generated version. The practical version required 12 puppeteers to operate, and CGI tails {{were added to the}} Aliens and the queen as they were difficult to animate using puppetry. The queen alien's inner-mouth was automated though, and was powered by a system of hydraulics. Anderson praised Alien director Ridley Scott's and Predator director John McTiernan's abilities at building suspense by not showing the creatures until late in the film, something Anderson wanted to accomplish with Alien vs. Predator. [...] "Yes, we make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> 45 minutes, but once it goes off, from there {{until the end of the}} movie, it's fucking relentless".|$|E
500|$|The primary {{antagonist}} of {{the novel}} is Kobus Breed, a mercenary with a disfigured face and a permanently weeping eye who had previously served with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland; Olen Steinhauer, writing in The New York Times thinks the scarred villain to be [...] "an obligatory nod toward the requirements of the Bond formula". Some writers were unimpressed with Breed; Robert Crampton of The Sunday Times thought that the character [...] "feels more like a henchman than a proper power-crazed villain. He has menace, but no ambition. <b>You</b> <b>wait</b> for the evil genius to turn up—but he never does", while David Sexton in the London Evening Standard wrote that the character [...] "lacks charisma", and David Connett in the Sunday Express considered him [...] "a colourless character in comparison with factual and fictional counterparts". The journalist Geoffrey Wansell in the Daily Mail disagreed, writing that Breed, along with a second villain, millionaire Hulbert Linck, were as strong as some of Fleming's villains; Steinhauer also thought that the novel's villains were realistic, [...] "motivated by simple greed yet clever enough to be legitimately dangerous". There are two main female characters in Solo— horror film actress Bryce Fitzjohn and the local MI6 contact Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant; like many of Fleming's female characters, both are [...] "determined females who are not to be patronised by Bond".|$|E
500|$|On 4 September, Elliot {{sailed to}} Kowloon in the cutter Louisa for food supplies, {{accompanied}} by the small-armed schooner Pearl, and a pinnace from the Volage of Captain Smith. Upon arrival, they encountered three anchored Chinese men-of-war junks, whose presence prevented the regular supplies of food. Elliot sent interpreter Karl Gutzlaff in a small boat with two men to the centremost junk, which Elliot thought was the commanding vessel due to its size and superior equipment. Gutzlaff carried two documents that he translated from Elliot. They included demands for food shipments to be restored and a plea not to repeat the poisoning of the colony's water springs. After a Chinese spokesman read the messages, he told Gutzlaff that they lacked the authority to renew food sales but was willing to report the matter to his superiors. Gutzlaff responded, [...] "Suppose you were without food {{for any length of}} time, and debarred from buying it, would <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> until the case was transmitted to the higher authorities, or procure for yourself the same by every means in your power?" [...] to which they exclaimed, [...] "Certainly nobody will like to starve, and necessity has no law." [...] They then directed him to another junk where a naval officer was said to reside. The local Chinese commander was Lieutenant-Colonel Lai Enjue.|$|E

500|$|Despite her ongoing {{relationship}} with Rhys, the series explores possibilities {{of a romantic}} connection between Gwen and her boss Jack. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and stated that [...] "it's the real thing and they're going to make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for that." [...] AfterElton's Locksley Hall interprets Jack's attraction to Gwen as being influenced by [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Myles states of Gwen's interest in Jack that [...] "the most monogamous {{woman in the world}} would probably go for him". Stephen James Walker quotes the firing range sequence in 2006 episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as an example of romantic tension between the pair as well as the scene where Jack discovers Gwen engagement. Gwen remains monogamous during the second series and [...] "fights every day to be with [...] " [...] even though Jack remains [...] "a huge temptation". Her suspension between Jack and Rhys becomes a central theme; Valerie Frankel believes that Gwen is caught between [...] "Rhys, the sweet, kind handsome prince, and Jack, the compelling trickster". She suggests that Jack is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen. John Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, he portrayed Pontius Pilate in The Passion, a BBC/HBO {{adaptation}} of the {{last week in the}} life of Jesus. He had originally rejected the script due to other filming commitments, but accepted the role after his agent told him to re-read it before making a final decision. He was pleased to learn that the serial was being produced by Nigel Stafford-Clark, whose Bleak House adaptation he had enjoyed, and that he would be appearing with his Jekyll co-star Denis Lawson. Contrary to previous portrayals of Pilate, Nesbitt played the biblical figure as [...] "nice", and—as when playing Jack Parlabane—used his own accent. The serial was broadcast in the UK during Easter week 2008. Shortly after filming The Passion, he filmed the part of journalist Max Raban in the Carnival Films thriller Midnight Man, which was shown on ITV in May 2008. It won him a joint nomination (along with the 2007 series of Murphy's Law) for the ITV3 Crime Thriller Award for Best Actor. At the end of the year, he had a starring role in the low-budget independent film Blessed. The writer and director Mark Aldridge scripted the character of Peter with Nesbitt in mind to play him. The film had a limited release throughout 2008 and 2009 before the BBC screened it on television in 2010. Nesbitt said, [...] "The role of Peter is what I have dreamed about playing, <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> your whole life for an opportunity like this and when it comes you have to grab it." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{states in}} a behind-the-scenes {{featurette}} that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack, following her recruitment. In a 2007 interview, Eve Myles, who plays Gwen, describes the relationship between Jack and Gwen as a [...] "palpable love" [...] and opines that [...] "with Jack and Gwen, it’s the real thing and they’re going to make <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> for that." [...] The first two series suggest the possibility of romantic and sexual tension behind Jack and Gwen's working relationship, with Stephen James Walker drawing on the firing range sequence in series one episode [...] "Ghost Machine" [...] as a key example, {{as well as the}} scene where Jack discovers that Gwen has become engaged to Rhys in [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", the series two opener. AfterElton.com's Locksley Hall conjectures that Jack is attracted to Gwen because of [...] "her warmth, her sense of justice, her very ordinariness and lack of glamour", whilst Eve Myles explains Gwen's attraction to Jack by stating: [...] "the most monogamous woman in the world would probably go for him– it'd be hard not to". Valerie Estelle Frankel describes Jack as a [...] "compelling trickster", who acts out Gwen's private desires with his [...] "outrageous flirting". She suggests that Jack (unlike Rhys) is not mature enough to occupy the role of [...] "steady prince" [...] for Gwen, whilst Barrowman feels that if Jack were to settle down with her, [...] "he'd have to commit completely"; this is why he does not act on his feelings, because though Gwen would let him flirt with other people, he could [...] "never afford to do anything more". Gareth David-Lloyd, who played Ianto, feels that for Jack, [...] "there’s two different sorts of love going on there", and that Jack feels for Gwen and Ianto in different ways, although both have helped him become less emotionally isolated. [...] Lynnette Porter feels that part of the reason Jack leaves Earth at the conclusion of Children of Earth is Gwen's idealisation of Jack, which is so intense that he cannot stand to look at her in the wake of Ianto's death. Gwen hopes that she is reason enough for Jack to stay on Earth, but Jack is ready to give up any hero worship because he feels unworthy.|$|E

Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: [...] "Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: 'What do you do? How do you write, create?' You don't, I told them. You don't try. That's very important: not to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. <b>You</b> <b>wait,</b> and if nothing happens, <b>you</b> <b>wait</b> some more. It's like a bug high on the wall. <b>You</b> <b>wait</b> for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or if you like its looks you make a pet out of it."
