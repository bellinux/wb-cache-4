500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but I knew there was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 1, 2005, the {{official}} Tool website announced, as an April Fools' Day prank, that [...] "Maynard has found Jesus" [...] {{and would be}} abandoning the recording of the new album temporarily and possibly permanently.

On April 7, {{the official}} site revealed that it was a hoax. During an interview Keenan later stated, [...] "It was April Fools'. If <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> for that on April Fools' Day, there's nothing I can do for you."

Jon Blistein of Billboard commented that the video [...] "is sweet and will probably make you smile." [...] AOL's The Boot also liked the video, writing, [...] "If the storyline itself doesn't make <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> head over heels, the gorgeous scenery surely will, as the clip was shot in various picturesque places around the world." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Taste of Country noted that the video was [...] "heart-pinching". The Tennessean wrote that the [...] "sweet sentimentality should score with fans of ... 'Need You Now'." [...] However, Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the video [...] "sugary". Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote, [...] "Lady A's [...] "Just A Kiss" [...] video got us choked up after one viewing.

500|$|A {{group of}} Hmong {{refugees}} {{had settled in}} Philadelphia {{after the end of}} the 1970s Laotian Civil War associated with the Vietnam War. [...] They were attacked in discriminatory acts, and the city's Commission on Human Relations held hearings on the incidents. Anne Fadiman, author of The Spirit Catches You and <b>You</b> <b>Fall</b> Down, said that lower-class residents resented the Hmong receiving a $100,000 federal grant for employment assistance when they were also out of work; they believed that American citizens should be getting assistance. Between 1982 and 1984, three quarters of the Hmong people who had settled in Philadelphia left for other cities in the United States to join relatives who were already there. Vietnamese and other immigrants from Asia have settled in the city, many near the Italian Market area. [...] In addition, numerous Hispanic immigrants from Central and South America have entered the city, settling in North Philadelphia.|$|E

Martin commented that she was extraordinary in her audition, in which she read the scene where Shae meets Tyrion in a tent the night before the battle of the Green Fork. According to Martin, [...] "a lot of beautiful young women read for Shae. [...] But there's another dimension to Shae as well. She's not as practiced and hardened at this as a more seasoned pro. There's still a girl next door quality to her, a sense of vulnerability, playfulness, and, yes, innocence. [...] All of our Shaes were hot as hell. But only a handful of them captured that other quality, maybe three out of twenty, and Sibel was the standout. [...] Watching those auditions, any red-blooded male would want to take every one of our Shae candidates to bed. But Sibel made <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in love with her as well." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Til It Happens to You" [...] is {{a somber}} tune {{featuring}} orchestral production and soaring strings. The pop ballad delivers an empowering message: [...] "Hold {{your head up}} and be strong / When <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> you gotta get up", and {{has been described as}} [...] "stirring and emotional". Featuring a classical production, the song emphasizes Gaga's vocals, keeping focus on the lyrics, which clarifies that one cannot understand the feelings of a victim unless they have been in similar situation. The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice, which gradually changes into an aggressive tone, and finally a joyous one during the final lyrics. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Til It Happens to You" [...] is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals spanning from E3 to D5. The song follows a basic sequence of Am–C–Fmaj7–C–G/B as its chord progression.|$|E
500|$|After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra {{believed}} {{he needed to}} go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. [...] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> on your ass". He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a few thousand dollars, holding {{a gun to his}} head. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as [...] "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".|$|E

[...] The song isn't {{a cautionary tale}} , but a call to arms to misfits everywhere." [...] She went on to declare the song {{as one of the}} highlights of The Fame Monster but added that [...] "After a stuttering intro of orgasmic groans it becomes a little bit Gaga-by-numbers, which is a shame given the standard of the early tracks". Ben Patashnik from NME felt that [...] "Dance in the Dark", along with another song [...] "Monster", was [...] "slightly disposable". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH complimented the song for its [...] "monumental chorus and some Madonna-esque spoken-word moments, including this shout out to a lost Royal: 'You will never fall apart Diana, you're still in our hearts / Never let <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> apart / Together we'll dance in the dark.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Applause" [...] {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "It's good. Maybe even slow clap good. Because while so many (too many!) of Gaga's songs {{have been designed}} to boost the esteem of her flock, this song finds her openly pining for the mass-adulation that all superstars need to survive." [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard lauded the song's hook and remarked, [...] "As always, Gaga has turned a lofty idea into a jingle for the masses." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, stating that [...] "Lady Gaga makes no secret that she's after mass adoration, and as far as lead singles go, her next grand spectacle is off to a strong start." [...] Carl Williot of Idolator praised the track, saying that it [...] "ticks all the right boxes when it comes to being a balls-to-the-wall pop delight ... this is pop doing what good pop songs should do, which is grab you by the collar from the first listen and make <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in love on the spot." [...] The Huffington Post writer Baggers described it as [...] "pop at its best: instant, euphoric, joyful and impossible to get out of your head".|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song that I have a real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to, and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{patterns}} of his relationships throughout the series, Davis and Needham draw the conclusion that [...] "while Captain Jack desires both men and women, his long-term love affairs and onscreen kisses are mostly with men {{in the past and}} present." [...] Davies himself laments that this one of the pitfalls of writing a bisexual character, commenting [...] "The trap <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> into with bisexual men is only having them sleep with men." [...] Commenting on the show's postmodern attitude towards bisexuality, or in what Russell T Davies calls [...] "omnisexuality", they continue to remark that [...] "His character brushes against definitions of queer sexuality in that he resists any sort of classification based on sexual orientation." [...] They also comment on the subtexts of particular episodes, such as gay time-travel romance episode [...] "Captain Jack Harkness", and within that the relevance of time-travelling Jack Harkness to tackle the question of forbidden gay attraction in what is post-Brokeback television. In Understanding TV Texts by Phil Wickham, Wickham opines that Captain Jack explicitly [...] "brings to the fore" [...] with his [...] "brazen bisexuality", [...] "something we have to come to expect [...] as viewers of his work". Fans expressed fear that an Americanized fourth series of the show would mean the show would no longer portray Jack's bisexuality, but Davies assured interviewers that Jack's interests in both men and women would be honoured.|$|E

During the recital, images of newspaper headlines describing Carey's breakdown were projected on a large curtain behind her, with one reading [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> down, you get back up." [...] Following the song's completion, Carey received a standing ovation. Towards the end of March, Charmbracelet saw release throughout Europe, prompting Carey to appear on several programs in promotion of the album. She first performed the album's leading two singles on the British music chart show, Top of the Pops, followed by a similar set on The Graham Norton Show and Fame Academy. On the latter program, Carey was joined on stage by the show's finalists, as they all sang the climax on [...] "Through the Rain" [...] alongside her. [...] "Through the Rain" [...] was only performed on Carey's , which spanned throughout 2003–04. During the performances, Carey wore a sparkling bra and mini-skirt. During most of the song, Carey performed it while sitting on a large sofa, before standing for the climax. At her concert in Manila, Rito P. Asilo from Philippine Daily Inquirer praised Carey's live rendition of the song, describing it {{as one of the}} show's high-lights.|$|E
500|$|As a mascot character, Crash {{has drawn}} {{numerous}} comparisons to competing mascots such as Mario and Sonic by reviewers. Dave Halverson of GameFan praised Crash's animations, appearance and mannerisms as [...] "100% perfection". A reviewer for Game Revolution praised Crash's [...] "quirky mannerisms" [...] as [...] "always refreshing", and John Broady of GameSpot described Crash as [...] "disarmingly cute and fuzzy". Doug Perry of IGN {{was critical of}} the character, seeing him as [...] "insanely capitalistic", negatively comparing his voice to Luigi of the Mario series and accusing him of being [...] "the most see-through, copycat mascot that ever existed." [...] Louis Bedigian of GameZone also disliked Crash's voice, remarking [...] "it is really annoying to hear a child say, 'Whoa!' every time <b>you</b> <b>fall</b> in the water, especially {{when you realize that}} the child's voice is supposed to be Crash". Crash's animations, particularly in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex, have been praised as humorous by reviewers. Ryan Davis of GameSpot analyzed Crash's [...] "overextended running style and self-punishing attacks" [...] as establishing him as an [...] "empty-headed but enthusiastic character", and compared his facial contortions to those of comedian Red Skelton. In a poll held by MSN in late 2008 to determine the most iconic video game character, Crash ranked at #8. In the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition from 2011, he was voted as the eleventh best video game character. However, he also ranked eighth on IGN's top 10 list of video game characters who should die, adding {{that it would be a}} mercy killing. IGN editor Colin Moriarty stated that his games add little to innovate the series over the years, rendering the character useless.|$|E
500|$|Although their {{popularity}} continued to decline during the 1990s, their albums still reached gold and platinum status. The 1990 album Pass It on Down featured three number one singles: [...] "Jukebox in My Mind", [...] "Forever's as Far as I'll Go", and [...] "Down Home". According to AllMusic, {{by the time}} the band released 1992's American Pride, [...] "they were among the genre's aging veterans." [...] Richard Carlin of Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary, suggested that the group's harmonies sounded dated to the new audience. [...] "I'm in a Hurry (And Don't Know Why)" [...] became the album's biggest hit, reaching number one; the album's other singles still fared very well, with [...] "Take a Little Trip", [...] "Once Upon a Lifetime", and [...] "Hometown Honeymoon" [...] peaking within the top three. Cheap Seats followed in 1993, with [...] "Reckless" [...] becoming Alabama's final number one, although most of the band's singles afterward peaked within the top ten. The band's 1995 album, In Pictures, represented their eighteenth gold album, more than the total for any other country act to that point. In 1996, the group remained finalists in the Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. The band released Dancin' on the Boulevard in 1997, exploring R and beach music. Singles [...] "Sad Lookin' Moon" [...] and [...] "Dancin', Shaggin' on the Boulevard" [...] were top five hits in the U.S. and Canada. The following year, the group released For the Record, a two-disc greatest hits compilation that contained two new singles — [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Fall</b> in Love" [...] and [...] "Keepin' Up".

Tempt not God, lest he cast thee away indeed. I doubt there are many that have presumed upon this mercy, that thus do couch beneath, and have cast themselves down from their pinnacles into vanity, of a vain conceit that they shall be lifted up again: whom yet God will leave to die there, because their fall was rather of willfulness, than weakness, and of stubbornness, and desperate resolutions, than for want of means and helps to preserve them from it.|$|R
