500|$|Following the 2016 Presidential Election, the creators' {{vision for}} the comic shifted. Rucka, who had used the letter columns in the series to discuss his {{concerns}} about then-candidate Donald Trump, told Oregon Public Broadcasting that after the election results Lazarus had changed from a dystopian science fiction story to a documentary. During a discussion panel at the 2017 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, Rucka described Lazarus as being [...] "about the blood red rage {{that leads to a}} Trump administration" [...] before joking that he had [...] "tried to warn <b>you</b> <b>three</b> years ago!" [...] Although the overall plan for Lazarus did not change, Rucka said he had a growing interest in writing about a brighter future instead.|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} [...] "B–" [...] and {{concluded}} that, [...] "I did jump a few times, and I liked Haley's dour malevolence, but overall, the new Nightmare on Elm Street is a by-the-numbers bad dream that plays {{a little too much}} like a corporately ordered rerun. One, two, Freddy's coming for <b>you.</b> <b>Three,</b> four, we've been there before". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. So what? Are we supposed to be scared? Is the sudden clanging chord supposed to evoke a fearful Pavlovian response?".|$|E
500|$|The Fraternity Hymn {{was written}} by brother Scott Jeffrey Heckstall Jr. {{when he was a}} {{prospective}} member of the Eta Gamma chapter in 1977. Heckstall had wanted to be a charter member, but was not chosen. Heckstall was encouraged to rush, and he recalled that as part of his rush process, a couple of brothers took him to a piano and told him, [...] "We know that you play [...] in church. We need a fraternity hymn. We'll give <b>you</b> <b>three</b> hours, and you sit over there {{and come up with a}} hymn. We'll come back in three hours, and we expect a hymn." [...] Heckstall recalled the hymn Someday (Beams of Heaven As I Go) by Charles Albert Tindley and changed a few words—for example, [...] "Beams of Heaven as I go through this wilderness below" [...] became [...] "K K Psi, as we go through this wilderness here below." [...] The brothers of Eta Gamma were satisfied with Heckstall's hymn. Years later, the hymn was presented to the brotherhood assembled at the 1995 National Convention and accepted as the national fraternity hymn. Blue and white are the fraternity's official colors. The fraternity flower is a red carnation, so chosen because it was founder William Scroggs's favorite flower.|$|E

2500|$|Allmusic gave I Look to <b>You</b> <b>three</b> stars (out of five) commenting about Houston's {{problems}} in the past, her voice and her talent: [...] "I Look to You attempts to wash this all away with something {{of a return to}} roots—a celebration of Houston's deep disco beginnings, tempered with a few skyscraping ballads designed to showcase her soaring voice. Houston's rocky decade isn't ignored, but it isn't explored, either: songs allude to Whitney's strength, her willpower as a survivor struggling through some unnamed struggle — enough for listeners to fill in the blanks, either with their own experience or their imaginings of Houston's life. [...] at the very least, Whitney can still sing, knowing when to wring emotion out of a phrase, knowing when not to push for the glory notes that she can no longer hit. [...] What she undoubtedly is, is a pro – she sells these subdued glitzy productions, she makes boring songs interesting, she remains a forceful, tangible presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short. And emeralds are prettier anyway." [...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save <b>you</b> <b>three</b> months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick {{tried to make a}} great movie, but somewhere in the process he forgot to make a good one." ...|$|E
