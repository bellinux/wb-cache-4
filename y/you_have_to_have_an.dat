5000|$|Rochberg’s String Quartet No. 3 was {{immediately}} controversial. Its aesthetic, {{which appeared to}} draw from older tonal music, was heavily criticized by Rochberg’s academic colleagues. The composer's work was described by some major critics, such as Andrew Porter of The New Yorker, as “almost irrelevant.” At the time, the new music scene in America was dominated by the strict serialism championed by Milton Babbitt, and aleatory music, as championed by John Cage. Rochberg’s music rejected both approaches, focusing instead on a style revolving around expressionism and detailed notation. Describing the controversy that surrounded his music, Rochberg told the Philadelphia Inquirer that [...] "I was accused of betraying, in the following order, {{the church and the}} state, I was a traitor, a renegade." [...] He {{went on to say that}} [...] "If you're going to be a composer <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> iron stomach, fire in the belly, and fire in the brain." ...|$|E
5000|$|Performed {{towards the}} end of Act Two, the song springs from Elphaba's rage over her {{continuously}} thwarted efforts to do good and her inner turmoil about her intention for doing so. It explores the ideas of goodness and wickedness, which are central to the musical's theme. In the song she lists what she perceives as her failures at goodness, including anger with herself over Fiyero—her lover who is being concurrently tortured by the Wizard's guards over her whereabouts—the death of her sister, and the capture and dehumanisation of her favorite teacher, Dr. Dillamond. It occurs while Elphaba believes that Galinda has used her sister's death to lure her into being captured by the Wizard's Guard. She is distraught at being vilified by the Wizard's propaganda and the hatred of the citizens of Oz, and decides she will no longer attempt to do good. The song begins with Elphaba screaming [...] "Fiyero" [...] but instead of being an unhitched scream, she actually sings a high note that is a minor second above the tonal centre of the song. This creates the effect of a scream, as the note is very high and dissonant, but it is much more controlled and musical than an actual scream. It then moves into a chant of magical words making it the most chilling and foreboding of all the musical's numbers. Schwartz is quoted as likening No Good Deed to an opera aria. He says, [...] "It’s just written for a different voice type, and it’s not written to be sung amplified. So those are the two big differences. I mean, “No Good Deed” is written for a belter—I suppose a mezzo-soprano could sing it. But the orchestra is so busy and obstreperous throughout that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> amplified voice to carry over it, if you want to hear the words at all. But for instance there’s a moment in “No Good Deed” where she belts a big note and then there’s a place where it suddenly gets pianissimo — she has to hit the note very loud and hold it, and then get very soft — and that’s absolutely like something one would write in classical singing or an opera aria. Or the moment where she does “Nessa, Dr. Dillamond,” and then sort of shouts out “Fiyero” while the orchestra is sawing away at one of the motifs. I think it’s structured very much like an aria but it’s built to get a great big hand at the end with a big belted last note. So it’s still very much musical theatre." ...|$|E

You have the composition and (bond) topology of the system, so {{you only have to}} rearrange its atoms so they are somewhere in the major free energy basin and the problem is solved. There might be some problems with this approach. The search space grows exponentially with the number of particles. If you are able to search the conformational space for a five residue peptide this year, it might be another year or two until you can tackle six residues when your computer is several fold faster. Then, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> energy or score function which really can discriminate between correct and incorrect conformations. Any score function which is fast enough to apply to more than a few hundred atoms will be full of approximations and no longer close to the best level of theory.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine how {{teachers}} work and reflects on gender education in preschools. We also want to take part of how teacher’s thoughts {{are reflected in the}} physical indoor environment and how the environment is designed by reviewing the rooms furnishing and the selected materials. We will do this by visiting a number of preschools located in Stockholm and New York. We have chosen three questions to get the answers on our purpose. How teachers reflect around gender pedagogy are, and how the thoughts are expressed in the practical work. How the teachers communicate with their co-workers about gender pedagogy. How the teachers own thoughts and reflections on gender pedagogy have been expressed in the physical indoor environment where the children stay during the day.  We have used interviews and observations as a method to gather the information that we needed to answer our questions of the thesis. We have used the sociocultural perspective, variation theory and queer theory as a ground to analyze our gathered information. As a conclusion we have found that the teachers have different ways of reflecting about gender pedagogy but they still don´t want to focus their work on it. They would rather focus their pedagogy on working with equality, which for them means more than just gender. We have reached that to find a way you work sustainable with gender pedagogy <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> open minded attitude towards the children, have critical standards, and an environment where children can grow and learn without focusing on gender. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{was educated}} {{as a city}} planner and an architect. I am not practising any of these professions anymore {{due to the fact}} that they do not offer enough freedom during the process of creation. I later turned into an artist using mainly {{photography}} as a visual expression tool and a professional photographer shooting architecture and cityscapes. I always had a deep interest in urban photography, un/consciously referring to my educational past. I kept panoramic photography always in my orbit of most used visualisation apparatuses and techniques, in order to be able to construct more comprehensive urban depictions. Roofs, terraces of skyscrapers, observations decks, towers of any kind have usually been my typical platforms, where I have created a remarkably large collection of global cityscapes. It was and still is too expensive to hire a helicopter for a shoot that does not guarantee a commercial return. While I will keep using the above techniques, I feel like I entered a new era in my professional photography practice as I recently acquired a drone. Drones are not that easy to operate and that affordable to buy, if you intend to go highly professional with hi-res camera bodies on-board. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> operator flying an octocopter and yourself in command of the operator telling him/her where to go and what angle to give, in order to end up with the “right” photograph. I preferred a low-priced quadcopter with a rather lower resolution camera, since I can control both the flying gismo and the camera myself. I can now send my eye to the sky, to a sky tier that I personally call “dronosphere”, a layer that is roughly in between 50 - 150 metres. This height gives me a particular viewpoint in between street view and map view. This paper will discuss if drone photography can bring a novel visual language to cityscape and / or street photography...|$|E
