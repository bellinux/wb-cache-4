50|$|Indeed, as Aristotle says in {{his writing}} {{entitled}} Protrepticus, in which he exhorts the youth to do philosophy - he says this: if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do philosophy, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do philosophy, and if <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not do philosophy, then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do philo-sophy. Therefore in every case <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do philosophy. For if philosophy exists, then positively we are obliged to do philosophy, since it truly exists. But {{if it does not}} truly exist, even so we are obliged to investigate how it is that philosophy does not truly exist. But by investigating we would be doing philosophy, since to investigate is the cause of philosophy.|$|R
