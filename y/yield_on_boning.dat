In the present paper we analyse the talus of 15 modern red foxes of different ages, from 2 months old to adulthood, to investigate the possibility of identifying their different ages at death. Surface and volumetric variables describing bone properties are measured or evaluated from the microCT images following three approaches: (i) the bone volume to total volume ratio, quantified for the whole bones; (ii) two homologous subvolumes of trabecular tissue, virtually extracted and analysed to evaluate trabecular bone structure; and (iii) {{the development of the}} cortical region, deduced through the analysis of bone cross-sections. All approaches <b>yielded</b> interesting information <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> development, and preliminary results show that the third approach clearly allows us to discriminate among different age groups. This is important both from a zooarchaeological and a palaeontological perspective, suggesting that microCT imaging can be considered a new non-invasive tool to estimate the age at death of animal remains, or to discriminate taxa characterized by a close morphology but different adult body size...|$|R

This nonsystematic review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the effects of αTF <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> health from cell culture, animal, and human studies in order to clarify the role of αTF <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> health. Our review found that αTF exerted beneficial, harmful or null effects <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> formation cells. Animal studies generally showed positive effects of αTF supplementation <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> in various models of osteoporosis. However, high-dose αTF was possibly detrimental to bone in normal animals. Human studies mostly demonstrated a positive relationship between αTF, as assessed using high performance liquid chromatography and/or dietary questionnaire, and bone health, as assessed using bone mineral density and/or fracture incidence. Three possible reasons high dosage of αTF can be detrimental to bone include its interference with Vitamin K function <b>on</b> <b>bone,</b> the blocking of the entry of other Vitamin E isomers beneficial to bone, and the role of αTF as a prooxidant. However, these adverse effects have not been shown in human studies.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sulfide mineral framboids {{associated}} with fossil bones in marine settings may aid in taphonomic reconstructions because framboids reflect the geochemical {{conditions under which}} they form. However, the timing and mechanism(s) of framboid formation <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> remain poorly understood. To better constrain the initial formation of framboids during decomposition of bone in marine depositional environments, we simulated aspects of <b>bone</b> decay <b>on</b> the ocean floor and analyzed framboids found <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> surfaces and in the associated sediment. We observed that framboids formed <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> surfaces within one week of experimentation, and were {{associated with}} reducing conditions within a dark-colored microbial mat overlain by oxic waters. Statistical and discriminant analyses of elemental data show that bone-hosted framboids formed in situ <b>on</b> the <b>bone</b> surfaces. Close associations of framboids with sulfidic microbial biofilms indicate that bone-hosted framboids resulted from conditions generated during the microbial degradation of bone-associated organic matter. Our results suggest that framboids can form <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> surfaces while <b>bones</b> rest <b>on</b> the seafloor prior to burial and perhaps prior to the so-called sulphophilic stage of whale-fall animal colonization. We compared experimentally produced framboids with published sedimentary framboid populations. Bone-hosted framboids resemble smaller and less variably sized sedimentary framboid populations canonically known to form in anoxic water columns, even though the bone-hosted framboids were overlain by oxygenated conditions. We propose that the period available for framboid growth is shorter <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> surfaces than in sediments, because geochemical conditions that favor sulfide mineral precipitation <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> are transient. Shorter growing periods and localized conditions resul...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{effect of}} vitamin E on {{health-related}} conditions {{has been extensively}} researched, with varied results.

This paper systematically audited past studies of the effect of vitamin E <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> fracture healing. Methods. Related articles were identified from Medline, CINAHL, and Scopus databases. Screenings were performed based on the criteria that the study must be an original study that investigated the independent effect of vitamin E <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> fracture healing. Data were extracted using standardised forms, followed by evaluation of quality of reporting using ARRIVE Guidelines, plus recalculation procedure for the effect size and statistical power of the results. Results. Six animal studies fulfilled the selection criteria. The study methods were heterogeneous with mediocre reporting quality and focused on the antioxidant-related mechanism of vitamin E.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % mass lignin intake on solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good yields (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product yields and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil yields were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) versus 18 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time <b>on</b> oil <b>yields</b> and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product yields and composition.

40|$|Backround: Leptin a {{cytokine}} protein secreted by {{adipose tissue}} raises considerable interest {{as a potential}} mediator of the protective effects of fat mass <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> tissue. After menopause heavier women conserve bone mass better than those with lower body weight. The protective effect of obesity <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> mass has been ascribed to a high body fat content.

Methods: A search of the available literature focused on the role of leptin <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> tissue. Results: Both peripheral and central action of leptin <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> metabolism have been proposed. In vitro and in vivo evidence supports the hypothesis that leptin can act directly or indirectly <b>on</b> <b>bone</b> remodelling by modulating both osteoblast and osteoclast activities. However, studies in humans have not yet been able to confirm these actions possibly because of the shifting balance between stimulatory direct action and suppressive indirect action of leptin <b>on</b> <b>bones</b> via the hypothalamus. The effects of oestrogen decline and deficiency during natural or artificially induced menopause and administration of hormone replacement therapy has on leptin production remains controversial. Various studies have shown differences in leptin values in pre- and postmenopausal women. The existing clinical data on this issue are discordant.
