500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're {{going to do it}} the right way, or they're going to do it my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby.

On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000. Of his songs with André 3000, he told GQ, [...] "We're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record".|$|E

Synthesizers and [...] "stuttering" [...] drums are {{featured}} at the pre-chorus, [...] "Don't even tell me your name/ All I {{need to know is}} whose place/ And let's get walking". Chris Martins of Spin commented that the lyrics actually means, [...] "The economy is in the tank, congress can't agree on anything, war and natural disasters consume us ... so, what else can we do but make love?" [...] At the second verse, she tells her lover, [...] "I am a freak, I'm disturbed/ So come on and give me your worst/ We're moving faster than slow/ If you don't know where to go/ I'll finish off on my own". The four-on-the-floor refrain has Aguilera [...] "flaunting her famous pipes" [...] on the chorus, [...] "All I wanna do is love your body/ Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it".

500|$|In September 2014, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Jeffrey Bell stated {{that in order}} to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment {{at some point during the}} first ten episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s second season. In October, the special was revealed to be Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, which was hosted by Emily VanCamp, who portrays Agent 13 in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and aired on November 4, 2014. The special features behind the scenes footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic-Con. Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not [...] "do the topic justice" [...] adding, [...] "For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko, Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop! should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, [...] "Understandably, the more <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because <b>you</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the winter}} of 256, Zhuge Dan found an excuse to entrench himself further in Shouchun and build up his defences. He wrote to the Wei {{imperial}} court, claiming that he heard that Eastern Wu forces were planning to attack the Huai River region. He asked for 100,000 troops and permission to build more defensive structures in the area. At the time, as Sima Shi had died in 255, his younger brother Sima Zhao {{had taken over the}} reins of power as the regent of Wei. Jia Chong suggested to Sima Zhao to keep a close watch on the generals who were guarding strategic locations throughout the Wei Empire and assess whether they were loyal to him. Sima Zhao heeded his words and sent him to Shouchun to meet Zhuge Dan. Jia Chong told Zhuge Dan, [...] "Many wise men in Luoyang hope to see the Emperor abdicate in favour of a better ruler. <b>You</b> <b>already</b> <b>know</b> this. What do you think?" [...] Zhuge Dan replied sternly, [...] "Aren't you Inspector Jia's son? The State has treated your family generously for generations. How can you betray the State and let it {{fall into the hands of}} others? I can't stand this. If there is trouble in Luoyang, I'll die for the State." [...] Jia Chong remained silent. After returning to Luoyang, Jia Chong told Sima Zhao, [...] "Zhuge Dan has high prestige and popularity in Yang Province. If you summon him here and he doesn't obey, it's a small problem. But if you don't summon him, it'll become a big problem." [...] Around the early summer of 257, Sima Zhao issued an order in the imperial court's name, ordering Zhuge Dan to return to Luoyang to serve as Minister of Works (司空) in the central government. While the order ostensibly promoted Zhuge Dan to a prestigious ministerial office (one of the Three Ducal Ministers, in fact), it was actually a move to remove him from power in Shouchun and put him under Sima Zhao's control in Luoyang.|$|E
