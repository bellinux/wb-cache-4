500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large brown seaweeds, such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar kelps, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, common periwinkle, blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, sculpins and cunners, halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their <b>young</b> on <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> floes.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{representation}} of Antarctic coastal polynyas in global ice-ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), in particular their local, regional, and high-frequency behavior. This is verified with the aid of daily ice concentration derived from satellite passive microwave data using the NASATeam 2 (NT 2) and the bootstrap (BS) algorithms. Large systematic regional and temporal discrepancies arise, some of which are related to the type of convection parameterization used in the model. An attempt is made to improve the fresh-water flux associated with melting and freezing in Antarctic coastal polynyas by ingesting (assimilating) satellite ice concentration where it comes to determining the thermodynamics of the open-water fraction of a model grid cell. Since the NT 2 coastal open-water fraction (polynyas) tends to be less extensive than the simulated one in the decisive season and region, assimilating NT 2 <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> concentration yields overall reduced net freezing rates, smaller formation rates of Antarctic Bottom Water, and a stronger southward flow of North Atlantic Deep Water across 30 S. Enhanced net freezing rates occur regionally when NT 2 <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> concentration is assimilated, concomitant with a more realistic ice thickness distribution and accumulation of High-Salinity Shelf Water. Assimilating BS rather than NT 2 <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> concentration, the differences to the non-assimilated simulation are generally smaller and of opposite sign. This suggests that the model reproduces <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> concentration in closer agreement with the BS data than with the NT 2 data, while more realistic features emerge when NT 2 data are assimilated...|$|R

40|$|High-resolution {{records of}} coarse lithic content and oxygen isotope have been {{obtained}} in a piston core from the Irminger Basin. The last glacial period is characterized by numerous periods of increased iceberg discharges originating partly from Iceland and corresponding to millennial-scale instabilities of the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> sheets and ice shelves in the Nordic area. A comparison with midlatitude sediment cores shows that ice-rafted material corresponding to the Heinrich events was deposited synchronously from 40 ° to 60 °N. There are thus two oscillating systems: every 5 - 10 kyr massive iceberg armadas are released from large continental ice caps, whereas more frequent instabilities of the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> sheets in the high latitude regions occur every 1. 2 - 3. 8 kyr.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Application of SAR {{images to}} detect the onset of breakup and dynamic decay process of <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice</b> was investigated, using a time series of RADARSAT- 1 C-band {{scanning}} SAR images of the areas around Seward Peninsula coastal region, Alaska, including Bering Strait and Norton Sound. Satellite image analyses mainly include a time series feature space images composed of radar backscattering coefficient versus look angle derived from RADARSAT- 1 amplitude images covering both coastal sea and land area. It {{was found that the}} feature space images have a single mode before the decay and breakup of the <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice,</b> and have multiple modes when large-scale open water first appears until the <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice</b> disappears completely. The mode patterns in the feature space images can then be determined by the water surface roughness caused by the wind field. The single-mode phenomenon before ice melting is thought to be due to a similarity of the backscattering of snow cover on sea ice and land surface due to the common coverage by snow and ice. The appearance of multiple modes is due to the differences in backscattering of sea ice surface at various decaying stages or open water with different wave roughness due to wind effect, and the land surface with snow and ice cover with different melting conditions once the melting or decay starts and proceeds. The feature space images reported here {{can be used as a}} useful tool in detection of decay of <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice</b> and landfast ice in the field of sea ice dynamics as the imaging radar technology is weather independent, providing information of <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> on a regular basis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Although shorefast sea ice forms a {{platform}} that facilitates travel, camping, and hunting by Iñupiat subsistence hunters and fishers {{in the western}} Arctic, the nearshore sea-ice zone remains an unforgiving and dynamic environment. Traditional hunters constantly hone site-specific experiences and skills with which to optimize the reward-to-risk ratio inherent in operating from this <b>coastal</b> <b>ice.</b> Nearshore ice conditions nevertheless can change suddenly, endangering even the most experienced subsistence hunters. This study examines two (of several) 20 th-century events, 40 years apart, in which shorefast ice failed, threatening Iñupiat whale hunters with loss of confidence, livelihood, and life. These events differed in character. In one event, the shorefast ice was “crushed ” by moving ice floes. In the other, the shorefast ice broke free of land. Our examination focuses {{on the relationship of}} subsistence hunters to the ice, the environmental causes of ice failures, the evolving technology for predicting ice behavior, and the longer-term implications of global change for this system. The complexity of geophysical processes underlying <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> behavior makes ice failures unpredictable. Thus, hunters must assume and manage risk. The variable and uncertain environment to which whale hunters are accustomed has produced an inherent flexibility that has helped them adapt to new conditions {{and will continue to do}} so in the future...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We use {{data from}} four {{automatic}} weather stations (AWSs) in Dronning Maud Land, East Antarctica, {{to study the}} surface mass balance and its components. Distinct {{differences were found between}} the moisture climates of the high plateau, the katabatic wind zone and the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> shelves: significant undersaturation occurs year-round in the katabatic wind zone, while on the high plateau and on the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> shelf the air is usually close to saturation. In summer, absorption of shortwave radiation at the snow surface enhances surface sublimation at all sites, removing 3 – 9 % of the annual solid precipitation. Significant summer melting is an equally important ablation term near the coast, but vanishes inland. Vertically integrated column drifting-snow sublimation was estimated using two different methods. This process appears to be similar to or greater in magnitude than surface sublimation. Because intervals between significant precipitation events may last as long as several months, sublimation and melt cause extended periods of surface ablation in summer. In summer, all ablation processes together remove 15 – 56 % of the solid precipitation, or 6 – 27 % on an annual basis. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Use of an {{autonomous}} underwater vehicle (AUV) to obtain environmental observations beneath <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice</b> offshore of Barrow, Alaska is described. The work is motivated {{by the desire to}} obtain cross-shore hydrographic transects (temperature, salinity and velocity vs. depth) that would provide estimates of the transport of relatively dense, salty water from the Chukchi Sea to the Arctic Ocean in winter. Although person-portable AUVs are well suited to the task, it was recognized that achieving the science goals would require increasing the range of acoustic navigation and communication as well as developing a robust approach to through-ice deployment and recovery. These needs drove three modifications to the AUV: 1) Incorporation of a lower frequency (10 kHz) transponder and associated hardware for navigation and communication, 2) Addition of special-purpose sensors and hardware in a hull extension module, 3) Development of a homing algorithm utilizing Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) acoustics. In March 2010, eight days of field work offshore of Barrow provided successful demonstration of the system.

50|$|After {{a winter}} in Chaun bay, Litke was {{declared}} seaworthy again on 20 June 1933. On 28 June, Litke assisted two transports, beached by a storm, and on 1 July sailed {{once more to}} attempt to release Uritsky from the ice. On this occasion Litke carried 450 tonnes of coal - enough to last for seven days in heavy ice. To save fuel, she moved in a start-stop manner, shutting down her boilers {{for days on end}} when ice density or fog forced her to idle. On 18 July Litke finally approached Uritsky and both ships safely reached Kolyma Inlet on 21 July. Meanwhile, the fleet in Chaun Bay finally unloaded their cargoes and on 16 August, Litke, along with Anadyr, sailed to Vladivostok, picking up other stranded ships on their way. The short run to the Bering Strait was a hazardous operation, and numerous ships again became trapped in the ice with fuel running low.

40|$|In {{order to}} open a coal mine in Ispallen, a {{prospect}} of the company Store Norske, it will necessary to transport the coal across a tidal inlet, Sveasundet, in Svea, Svalbard. In anticipation of this challenge, Store Norske partly funded a PhD position at UNIS to study {{the action of the}} ice on a possible causeway across the inlet and, more generally, to better understand the action of sea <b>ice</b> on <b>coastal</b> structures. I designed and supervised the construction of a 50 -m-long, 8 -m-high and 25 -m-wide breakwater in this microtidal environment— 2. 0 m maximum tidal range—where the seaice period lasts between 4 and 6 months. At the tip of the breakwater I installed a cabin with a weather and ground temperature station and time-lapse cameras. On the seabed I installed a tide and wave gauge. I went on the site on a weekly basis during a full ice season and documented the ice conditions both visually and quantitatively. I used a differential GPS to monitor tidal ice movements, measured ice stresses and took cores to analyse the properties of the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice.</b> To my knowledge, nowhere in the world have ice conditions ever before been documented so thoroughly throughout a whole season. Most engineering literature on sea ice is related to offshore structures. There is so little literature on <b>coastal</b> sea <b>ice</b> that several terms lack a precise definition. In this thesis <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> is defined as the ice in the zone that is affected by the boundary conditions at the shore. I identified and documented a variety of coastal-ice processes, most notably the formation, growth and decay of the ice foot, the tidal movement, and the break-up. The observations of the ice foot lead me to revise its definition. At the site of study, the term is essentially relevant during the formation of the sea ice cover and during the breakup. In between, it is more relevant to consider the hinge zone, which is the area where the tide cracks occur. The ice pile-ups that occurred during the break-up perpertrated little damage because that late in the season, the ice was rotten and soft. Since these were the most destructive events, the ice conditions may be characterised as mild. Measurements of the ice strength, elasticity and creep across the coastal zone revealed that the <b>coastal</b> <b>ice</b> was weaker, less stiff and crept less than the free-floating ice. From the shore to the free-floating ice, the measured value of strength ranged monotonously from about 3 to 4 MPa and the measured value of elasticity ranged monotonously from about 1 to 1. 5 GPa. Measuring the stresses in metre-thick ice was challenging but the peak stresses of about 150 kPa is in the range of those found in similar studies (Frederking et al., 1986; Sayed et al., 1988; Moslet, 2001; Nikitin et al., 1992). Surprisingly, the highest stresses were measured in the direction not perpendicular but parallel to the tide cracks. More work is needed to understand the process of stress-build up.
