If we don’t this time, then what happens next? Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive, and the players really understand that.

To encourage people {{to vote in the}} US election of 2016, Johansson appeared in a commercial alongside her Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Robert Downey, Jr., and Joss Whedon. In 2017, she spoke at the Women's March on Washington, addressing Donald Trump's presidency and stating that she would support him if he works for women's rights and stops withdrawing federal funding for Planned Parenthood. She elaborated, [...] "Once the heaviness [...] began to subside, an opportunity has presented itself to make real long-term change, not just for future Americans, but in the way we view our responsibility to get involved with and stay active in our communities. Let this weight not drag you down, but help to get <b>your</b> <b>heels</b> stuck in." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "In My Eyes" [...] {{utilizes}} tingling synths. Colly {{said that}} Robyn is [...] "an encouraging den mother" [...] on the song, singing [...] "Little star, I got you. You'll be okay." [...] Luke O'Neill of The Boston Globe {{said that the}} song showcases [...] "the tension-and-catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals." [...] The second track, [...] "Include Me Out" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "digitised stop-start funk". The song begins with the line, [...] "It is really very simple, just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval", which according to O'Neill described [...] "the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance-ready songs." [...] On the song, Robyn plays a party-starter that is [...] "repping matriarchs and cross-dressers alike" [...] with the line [...] "This one's for the granny, take a bow... Come on all you trannies, click <b>your</b> <b>heels</b> for me." [...] "Hang with Me", carries a [...] "fierce, club-wrecking beat", with [...] "relentlessly energetic bass" [...] and synth arpeggios. Lyrically, the song speaks of trust in a relationship, with lines such as [...] "Just don't fall recklessly, headlessly in love with me." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views [...] "the perspective of someone who's a bit too tightly buttoned-up to let her defences down." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Love Kills" [...] was described as a [...] "discofied, sharp-edged" [...] song, with fierce vocals and [...] "haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes." [...] "We Dance to the Beat" [...] is a techno song, with an [...] "apocalyptic, big-beat". It features a [...] "sort of spoken-word hype-up jam" [...] that was compared to [...] "Don't Fucking Tell Me What to Do". The song features lines such as [...] "We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough" [...] and [...] "We dance to the beat of bad kissers clicking teeth." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, [...] "I {{fought hard}} against the emotionalism of In America [...] [...] [...] but I lost. There's no {{questioning}} the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants {{trying to make it}} in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down— but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? [...] [...] [...] [...] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in <b>your</b> <b>heels.</b> Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away." ...|$|E
2500|$|The State of North Carolina was {{the next}} to last state to secede from the United States of America, {{and as a result}} the state was nicknamed [...] "the {{reluctant}} state" [...] by others in the south. The joke circulating around {{at the beginning of the}} war went something like: [...] "Got any tar?" [...] "No, Jeff Davis has bought it all." [...] "What for?" [...] "To put on you fellows' heels to make you stick." [...] As the war continued, many North Carolinian troops developed smart replies to this term of ridicule: The 4th Texas Infantry lost its flag at Sharpsburg. As they were passing by the 6th North Carolina a few days afterward, the Texans called out, [...] "Tar Heels!", and the reply was, [...] "If'n you had had some tar on <b>your</b> <b>heels,</b> you would have brought your flag back from Sharpsburg." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put <b>your</b> <b>heels</b> under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
