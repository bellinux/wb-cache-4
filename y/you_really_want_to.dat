I made this short film so I could share my thoughts on this incredibly special place and talk to others about theirs.

It's a story about people making the impossible possible—whether it's Kanye West, James Franco, or a kid who's living on the streets on Hollywood Boulevard.

Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up.

Upon reading the script, Kirkman thought that producers were consistent with his comic, adding that they could possibly improve his initial work. [...] "Reading that pilot was just a revelation.
