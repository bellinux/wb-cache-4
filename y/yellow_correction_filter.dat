Assuming that the {{distortion of the}} ADCs can be modeled by linear time-invariant systems, it can be shown that the design problem of the digital FIR <b>correction</b> <b>filters</b> using least squares (LS) or minimax criterion subject to linear and convex quadratic inequalities constrains can be formulated as a SOCP problem.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we present an {{alternative}} separable implementation of L 2 -orthogonal space-time codes (STC) for continuous phase modulation (CPM). In this approach, we split the STC CPM transmitter {{into a single}} conventional CPM modulator and a <b>correction</b> <b>filter</b> bank. While the CPM modulator is common to all transmit antennas, the <b>correction</b> <b>filter</b> bank applies different correction units to each antenna. Thereby desirable code properties as orthogonality and full diversity are achievable with just a slightly larger bandwidth demand. This new representation has three main advantages. First, it allows to easily generalize the orthogonality condition to any arbitrary number of transmit antennas. Second, for a quite general set of correction functions that we detail, it can be proved that full diversity is achieved. Third, by separating the modulation and correction steps inside the receiver, a simpler receiver can be designed as a bank of data independent inverse <b>correction</b> <b>filters</b> followed by a single CPM demodulator. Therefore, in this implementation, only one correlation filter bank {{for the detection of}} all transmitted signals is necessary. The decoding effort grows only linearly with the number of transmit antennas...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a systematic approach to block processing with iterative <b>correction</b> <b>filters</b> for time-interleaved analog-to-digital con-verters (TI-ADCs). TI-ADCs consist of several channels and can significantly increase the achievable sampling rate, but suffer from mismatches among the channels. Iterative digital <b>correction</b> <b>filters</b> are a general approach {{to mitigate the}} impact of mismatches in TI-ADCs. To reduce the requirements on the digital hardware, we intro-duce block processing for such filters. To this end, the transforma-tion of a single-input single-output linear time-varying (LTV) finite impulse response filter into a multiple-input multiple-output LTV fil-ter {{is described as a}} design equation and applied to two representa-tive iterative correction structures from the literature. Finally, the beneficial properties and advantages of the transformation are high-lighted.

40|$|Abstract—Digital {{analysis}} and processing of signals inherently {{relies on the}} existence of methods for reconstructing a continuoustime signal from a sequence of corrupted discrete-time samples. In this paper, a general formulation of this problem is developed that treats the interpolation problem from ideal, noisy samples, and the deconvolution problem in which the signal is filtered prior to sampling, in a unified way. The signal reconstruction is performed in a shift-invariant subspace spanned by the integer shifts of a generating function, where the expansion coefficients are obtained by processing the noisy samples with a digital <b>correction</b> <b>filter.</b> Several alternative approaches to designing the <b>correction</b> <b>filter</b> are suggested, which differ in their assumptions on the signal and noise. The classical deconvolution solutions (least-squares, Tikhonov, and Wiener) are adapted to our particular situation, and new methods that are optimal in a minimax sense are also proposed. The solutions often have a similar structure and can be computed simply and efficiently by digital filtering. Some concrete examples of reconstruction filters are presented, as well as simple guidelines for selecting the free parameters (e. g., regularization) of the various algorithms.
