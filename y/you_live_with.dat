I could forever tell of the qualities of this beloved man, Horatio Nelson. I have not shed a tear before the 21st October, and since whenever I am alone, I am quite like a child.|$|E
500|$|Chéreau {{was in a}} {{long-term}} relationship with his lover and favorite actor Pascal Greggory. He {{was not interested in}} gay topics, saying: [...] "I never wanted to specialise in gay stories, and gay newspapers have criticised me for that. Everywhere love stories are exactly the same. The game of desire, and how <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> desire, are the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{the bands}} {{presented}} themselves as {{no different from}} minor local bands. Jack Endino said in the 1996 documentary Hype! that Seattle bands were inconsistent live performers, since their primary objective {{was not to be}} entertainers, but simply to [...] "rock out". Grunge bands gave enthusiastic performances; they would thrash their long hair during shows as [...] "a symbolic weapon" [...] for releasing [...] "pent-up aggression" [...] (Dave Grohl was particularly noted for his [...] "head flips"). One of the philosophies of the grunge scene was authenticity. Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, [...] "for Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll...threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, {{to live up to the}} music ... And if you can't, can <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1859, Bizet and several companions {{travelled}} {{in the mountains and}} forests around Anagni and Frosinone. They also visited a convict settlement at Anzio; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences. In August, he made an extended journey south to Naples and Pompeii, where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: [...] "Here <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils..." [...] Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his Roma symphony, was not finished until 1868. On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete [...] "an important work" [...] (which has not been identified). In September 1860, while visiting Venice with his friend and fellow-laureate Ernest Guiraud, Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} at a {{press conference}} about Sheridan's goal, Meath manager Eamon O'Brien said: [...] "I can't say and I'm not commenting. I can comment, as I said to RTÉ, that loads of decisions were made during the game that didn't go our way. I can recall three or four balls that were blown for picking off the ground that I didn’t think were off the ground. Nigel Crawford was booked up here and Louth got a point off it. The game goes for 70 minutes, decisions are made and <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> it. That’s it, that’s the way I see it".|$|E
5000|$|Texas {{does not}} recognizes palimony. The Texas Family Code {{does not provide}} for [...] "palimony.” This means you cannot gain rights under the Texas Family Code because <b>you</b> <b>lived</b> <b>with</b> someone absent a valid marriage.|$|R

2500|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>with</b> {{dignity and}} self-respect, the Kali would destroy itself" [...] is another oft-repeated verse from Akilattirattu. The {{importance}} of this instruction comes to light when considering that the destruction of Kali is projected in Akilattirattu {{as one of the}} chief motives of the mission of Ayya Vaikundar. The book, through various other narratives, underscores the point that the people are to live in dignity. For example, the narrative on the origin of the Santror Makkal as the children of Narayana endowed the people with a divine pedigree, and it was a powerful story to drive home the message that the people were a dignified humanity. Some of the rituals that emerged in the life of Ayyavazhi were aimed at indoctrinating the message of human dignity. Wearing a piece of headgear during worship is an example of one of these rituals.|$|E
