50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{on how to}} express this objection. William F. Vallicella holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when {{in search of an}} ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation. Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation. And Plantinga writes that when not in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity. Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over The God Delusion, saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts on earth or another planet that an intelligence existed, but that <b>you</b> would <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.|$|R

Special emphasis {{is given to}} key theological perspectives that emerge in the stories and narratives. The goals of the course are: for the student a) to be familiar adequately {{with all of the}} texts and stories of Genesis. This means that you will know the literal presentation of the entire book by your reading and rereading of the texts themselves in translation. b) to appreciate the literary structure of several narratives for the purpose of their help in theological interpretation c) to be able to evaluate the various perspectives of myth, covenant and history in light of the texts and the history of interpretation. d) to be thoroughly familiar with a chosen text in Genesis {{from the point of view}} of literary analysis, history of interpretation and theological import. This will arise from your focus on a chosen text or topic for a major term paper.

These workshops brought together practitioners {{from a wide range of}} fields and engaged them in intense conversations about issues regarding technology and education. Such conversations are rooted in participants personal experiences, driven by the problems they have overcome, and aimed at collaborative articulation of their design knowledge; knowledge of how to get things done. We call these workshops Collaborative Reflection Workshops. Our process goes beyond a single workshop. Over the years, we have identified a structure of three consecutive workshops; a Design Narratives Workshop, a Pattern Mining Workshop and a Design scenarios Workshop. Together, these form what we call the Participatory Patterns Workshops framework. If you are about to participate in such a workshop, this document will tell you what to expect and how to maximise your benefits from the event. If you would like to run such a workshop (or series of workshops) yourself, this document should give you a good starting point for their design. <b>You</b> will <b>still</b> <b>need</b> to adapt the framework for your own needs and circumstances, and we will be happy to assist you in doing that.
