500|$|In Atlanta, {{two women}} {{involved}} in the protest were struck by eggs thrown by three men in a pickup truck. In Pueblo, motorists shouted obscenities at protesters, with one person telling demonstrators to [...] "get a job". In Washington, D.C., two bikers for Trump surrounded the demonstration and attempted to drown out speakers by revving their motorcycle engines. A man {{standing in front of}} the White House with a megaphone <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> marchers to [...] "Leave Trump alone!" [...] The ACLU tweeted that the arrests of peaceful protesters in Portland was [...] "shameful". The organization also advised Mayor Wheeler to [...] "revise crowd-control strategies".|$|E
500|$|Forty-four {{seconds after}} Moosally's order, Lieutenant Buch {{reported}} that Turret Two's right gun was loaded {{and ready to}} fire. Seventeen seconds later, he reported that the left gun was ready. A few seconds later, Errick Lawrence, in Turret Two's center gun room, reported to Ziegler over the turret's phone circuit that, [...] "We have a problem here. We are not ready yet. We have a problem here." [...] Ziegler responded by announcing over the turret's phone circuit, [...] "Left gun loaded, good job. Center gun is having a little trouble. We'll straighten that out." [...] Mortensen, monitoring Turret Two's phone circuit from his position in Turret One, heard Buch confirm that {{the left and right}} guns were loaded. Lawrence then called out, [...] "I'm not ready yet! I'm not ready yet!" [...] Next, Ernie Hanyecz, Turret Two's leading petty officer suddenly called out, [...] "Mort! Mort! Mort!" [...] Ziegler shouted, [...] "Oh, my God! The powder is smoldering!" [...] At this time, Ziegler may have opened the door from the turret officer's booth {{in the rear of the}} turret into the center gun room and <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crew to get the breech closed. About this same time, Hanyecz yelled over the phone circuit, [...] "Oh, my God! There's a flash!" ...|$|E
500|$|During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was {{targeted}} by Team Canada for attention. According to Conacher, [...] "every {{time they get}} a chance, they're taking him for a rough ride along the boards." [...] Kharlamov {{was the target of}} numerous bodychecks by Brad Park. Things started to heat up in the second period. Kharlamov had knocked down Bobby Clarke, who in retaliation, rubbed Kharlamov's face with his glove to raise Kharlamov's temper and the two exchanged punches. Bergman then stepped in and bumped into Kharlamov and harassed him {{all the way back to}} the bench. Peter Mahovlich later elbowed Kharlamov, who retaliated by dumping Mahovlich to the ice. Later, Clarke raced down the ice to catch a streaking Kharlamov and deliberately slashed Kharlamov's already sore ankle, injuring it and according to reports, fracturing it. Kharlamov skated over to the Canadian bench and <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Canadians, before limping off the ice to the dressing room. The referees handed Clarke a minor penalty for slashing and an additional 10-minute misconduct penalty. Later, with Clarke still stuck in the box serving the misconduct, the referees also gave Dennis Hull a slashing penalty, during which Yakushev scored. On his injured ankle, Kharlamov returned to play and very nearly scored on Dryden during a power play later in the second period.|$|E
50|$|Kicking {{the cat is}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} behaviour of staff abusing coworkers or subordinates as a mechanism to relieve stress. This behaviour can result in a chain reaction, where a higher-ranking member of the company abuses his or her subordinate, who takes it out on his or her own subordinate, and so on down the line. This domino effect can also be seen in family dynamics, where <b>the</b> father <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mother who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> older child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> younger child who <b>yells</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pet.|$|R

500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{others when}} escaping", calling it [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was}} able to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He wondered how the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} to draw {{comparisons}} with The Year of the Sex Olympics and the rise of reality television programmes (soap operas without professional actors), such as Big Brother, Castaway 2000 and Survivor, was the journalist Nancy Banks-Smith [...] in a review {{of the first}} series of the UK version of Big Brother for The Guardian in 2000, a theme she later expounded upon in 2003, writing that the play [...] "foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome". Banks-Smith had long been an admirer of The Year of the Sex Olympics, having written in The Sun following its original broadcast in 1968: [...] "Quite apart from the excellent script and the 'big big' treatment, the play radiated ripples. Is television a substitute for living? Does the spectacle of pain at a distance atrophy sympathy? Can this coffin with knobs on furnish all we need to ask?". Another admirer, the writer and actor Mark Gatiss, has said that upon seeing Big Brother he <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> television, [...] "Don't they know what they're doing? [...] It's The Year of the Sex Olympics! Nigel Kneale was right!". When The Year of the Sex Olympics was repeated on BBC Four on 22 May 2003, Paul Hoggart in The Times noted that [...] "in many respects Kneale was right on the money [...] when you consider that nothing gets contemporary reality show audiences more excited than an emotional train-wreck on live TV".|$|E
500|$|Soon after, in May 1924, {{the club}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour, beginning with an ill-tempered match against Czechoslovakian side Sparta Prague. The match was an intensely physical encounter with Cardiff accusing their opposition of dirty tactics. As the teams left the pitch {{at the end of}} the first-half, a furious Keenor, upset at the nature of some tackles he had received, <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prague players [...] "If I get anymore kicks on the shin I shall be chopping someone off at the knee". In the second-half, Cardiff players found themselves being physically assaulted by members of the crowd, who aimed kicks and punches at the players, when they approached the sidelines to take throw-ins and corner-kicks, going on to lose the match 3–2. They later played matches against First Vienna in Austria and Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV in Germany. The following season, the side reached the final of the 1924–25 FA Cup where they suffered a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United, who claimed their fifth FA Cup win, following a goal from Fred Tunstall. After the Final, Keenor stated: [...] "Just because we lost in our very first Cup Final, I don't think there is any cause to get down in the mouth. I can say here and now that one day soon our followers can be sure that Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales." ...|$|E

500|$|By about 00:20, 40minutes {{after the}} collision, the loading of the {{lifeboats}} was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith {{standing near the}} bridge {{looking out at the}} ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, [...] "I <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of my voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply." [...] Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to [...] "put the women and children in and lower away". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the [...] "women and children" [...] evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred {{on the side of caution}} by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.|$|E
500|$|As was {{the common}} {{practice}} for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along {{with music and}} sound effects. [...] As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. [...] Liliana Betti, Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the [...] "number system" [...] or [...] "numerological diction": [...] "Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. [...] For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. [...] The actor merely counts til thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc." [...] Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: [...] "It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [...] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to [...] "27",' he'll tell an actor, 'but this time, smile.'" [...] Since he didn't {{need to worry about}} noise while shooting a scene, Fellini would keep up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan: [...] "He talked through each take, in fact <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, look at her. [...] See how sad she is, see her tears? [...] Oh, the poor wretch! [...] You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. [...] Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!'... That's how he's able... to use performers from many countries. [...] He does part of the acting for the actors." ...|$|E

2500|$|In December 1998, Harris and Klebold made Hitmen for Hire, a {{video for}} a school project in which they swore, <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camera, made violent statements, and acted out {{shooting}} and killing students in the hallway of their school as Hitmen for Hire. They both displayed themes of violence in their creative writing projects for school; of a Doom-based story written by Harris on January 17, 1999, Harris's teacher said: [...] "Yours is a unique approach and your writing works in a gruesome way — good details and mood setting." ...|$|E

[...] They grabbed Emperor Wenzong's litter, put him on it, and ran north through the roped screen behind Hanyuan Hall (breaking the screen in the process) toward the palace. Li Xun ran after the litter and grabbed it, yelling, [...] "I have not finished my report, and Your Imperial Majesty should not return to the palace!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis was asleep, {{but other}} cadets {{went looking for}} Hitchcock. Three other cadets were {{discovered}} by cadet James G.

At around 05:00, Hitchcock found another inebriated cadet wandering the academy. By this point, several window panes had been broken. Hitchcock returned to the room where he was staying, No. 8. Several cadets then attacked his door, Guion drawing his pistol and firing a shot into the room. [...] Hitchcock opened the door and <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cadets to stop.

2500|$|To the end, Guiteau {{was making}} plans to start a lecture tour after his {{perceived}} imminent release and {{to run for president}} himself in 1884, {{while at the same time}} continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882. After the guilty verdict was read, Guiteau stepped forward, despite his lawyers' efforts to tell him to be quiet, and <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> jury saying [...] "You are all low, consummate jackasses!" [...] plus a further stream of curses and obscenities before he was taken away by guards to his cell to await execution. Guiteau appealed his conviction, but his appeal was rejected, and he was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia, just two days before the first anniversary of the shooting.|$|E

2500|$|Gaeta's {{commander}} Prince Hesse was {{an eccentric}} soldier of fortune. The general was short in stature and red-faced with an aquiline nose. Known for his hard drinking, {{he was also}} a good leader of men. He gained the respect of his poorly motivated soldiers by joking with them and showing outstanding personal courage. From the first days of the siege, he posted himself at the Breach Battery and announced that he would not quit until the siege was done. He also vowed to limit his drinking to only one bottle a day. Referring to Karl Mack von Leiberich's surrender of Ulm, he famously <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> besiegers through a speaking-trumpet, [...] "Gaeta is not Ulm! Hesse is not Mack!" [...] When the French first arrived in the neighborhood on 13 February, they demanded that the fortress be handed over to them.

2500|$|Bob Denver is Gilligan, the inept, {{accident-prone}} First Mate (affectionately {{known as}} [...] "Little Buddy" [...] by [...] "the Skipper") of the SS Minnow. Denver {{was not the}} first choice to play Gilligan; actor Jerry Van Dyke was offered the role, but he turned it down, believing that the show would never be successful. He chose instead to play the lead in My Mother the Car, which premiered the following year and was cancelled after one season. The producers looked to Bob Denver, the actor who had played Maynard G. Krebs, the goofy but lovable beatnik in The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. None of the show's episodes ever specified Gilligan's full name or clearly indicated whether [...] "Gilligan" [...] was the character's first name or his last. [...] In the DVD collection, Sherwood Schwartz states that he preferred the full name of [...] "Willy Gilligan" [...] for the character. Denver, on various television/radio interviews (The Pat Sajak Show; KDKA radio), said that [...] "Gil Egan" [...] was his choice. The actor reasoned that because everyone <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first mate, it ran together as [...] "Gilligan." [...] In the unaired pilot episode, whether Lovey Howell refers to Gilligan as [...] "Stewart" [...] or steward is unclear. On Rescue from Gilligan's Island, the writers artfully dodged Gilligan's full name when the other names are announced. Little is revealed about Gilligan's past, except his occasional reference to best friend Skinny Mulligan and a one-time reference to his older brother.|$|E
2500|$|The Algerian police used {{night vision}} devices to {{identify}} the lead hijacker, Abdul Abdullah Yahia. The government sent his mother to plead for her son to release the passengers, hoping that her pleas would cause Yahia to give in. The tactic backfired. Zahida Kakachi, a passenger, said that Yahia became enraged by the attempt. The hijackers began to target the French passengers; two staff members of the Embassy of France in Algeria, a secretary and a chef, were on board. The hijackers used the chef, Yannick Beugnet, by having him plead in the microphone. The hijackers demanded that if the Algerian government did not let the A300 take off before 9:30pm, the hijackers would kill one passenger every 30 minutes, starting with Beugnet. They threatened to shoot him and throw {{him out of the}} door. The French diplomat said that the Algerians assured them that the hijackers were bluffing while the French demanded that the aircraft be allowed to take off. When the deadline passed, the hijackers fatally shot the chef. The door open warning light in the cockpit indicated to the pilots that another passenger had been murdered. Enraged, Captain Delhemme <b>yelled</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Algerian authorities, saying [...] "see what you get when you play tough?!". The airline knew that the chef was murdered since it listened to the conversations between the aircraft and the control tower. Philippe Legorjus, a former Air France security adviser, {{said in an interview that}} the airline employees [...] "lived through" [...] the event [...] "with great emotion." [...] Passenger Zahida Kakachi recalls Lotfi calmly converting two stewardesses to Islam, herself and another woman, though Kakachi was only pretending so that she would not enrage or upset Lotfi.|$|E
