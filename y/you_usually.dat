25|$|While {{promoting}} the band's 2013 box set, Sound System, which Jones says {{will be the}} final time he works on Clash music, he discussed the band reuniting prior to Strummer's death.There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper Headon, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band.|$|E

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and I guess he was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Black is {{the color}} of power, ambition, death, illness, corruption, selfishness, amorality, and sacrifice. It is not {{necessarily}} evil, though many of its cards refer directly or indirectly to this concept. Black's strengths include the ability to destroy creatures instantly; forcing players to discard cards from their hand; decreasing a player's life while <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> gain that same amount lost; evasive abilities are common among Black creatures; and resurrecting creatures from a player's graveyard. Furthermore, because Black seeks to win at all costs, it has limited access to many abilities or effects that are normally available only to one of the other colors; but these abilities often require large sacrifices of life totals, creatures, cards in hand, cards in library, and other difficult-to-replace resources. One of the most notable abilities among Black creatures is [...] "", which always causes creatures damaged by those possessing this ability to be sent to the graveyard, regardless of the damage amount assigned. Black's main weaknesses include an almost complete inability to deal with enchantments and artifacts; the tendency to inflict itself with severe negative effects in order to defeat the opponent; {{the way in which it}} overly relies on cards inside the graveyards; and difficulties in removing other Black creatures.|$|E

500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened.

Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it for me, and I say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E
500|$|An unused {{scene was}} drafted showing Chris, {{directly}} after hearing Lois' prison term, flashbacking {{back to him}} watching Six Feet Under, seeing a same-sex couple kissing, and exclaiming [...] "Oh, come on!" [...] The song based around Glen Quagmire was sung and recorded by professional studio singers who sing at {{events such as the}} Academy Awards. The scene following Peter saying to Lois: [...] "I had to do, well you know, that thing that <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> do for me every Thursday night" [...] showing Peter attempting to give himself fellatio, hitting his head on the wall and falling down the stairs was repeatedly fought by broadcasting standards, but they eventually allowed the scene. In the original episode draft, Peter was to be seen falling down the stairs, and Stewie's foot was to be lodged inside Peter's anus, where he was to lose his shoe. Peter breaks the fourth wall and begins to speak with viewers during his interview with the sumo wrestling employee; Executive Producer David A. Goodman comments in the episode DVD commentary that this is [...] "one of the few times, maybe the only time, when [...] can step out of format and point out the format." [...] The [...] "CBS Asiantown" [...] logo shown on the Griffins' television was prohibited from broadcast on the televised version of the episode.|$|E

2500|$|Meirelles {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} making a film that would simulate the experience of blindness to the audience. He explained, [...] "When you do a film, everything is related to point of view, to vision. When you have two characters in a dialogue, emotion is expressed by the way people look at each other, through the eyes. Especially in the cut, the edit. <b>You</b> <b>usually</b> cut when someone looks over. Film is all about point of view, and in this film there is none." [...] Similar to the book, blindness in the film serves {{as a metaphor for}} human nature's dark side: [...] "prejudice, selfishness, violence and willful indifference." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "The Rising" [...] was extremely positive. [...] Allmusic called it [...] "one of Mr. Springsteen's greatest songs. It is an anthem, {{but not in}} the sense <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> reference in regard to his work. This anthem is an invitation to share everything, to accept everything, to move through everything individually and together." [...] Rolling Stone worried that, [...] "As with 'Born in the U.S.A.', the title ... may mislead some who hear it, particularly those intent on retaliation, which Springsteen himself shows little interest in contemplating. His concern is not with a national uprising but with a rising above: the transcending of ever-mounting losses and ancient hatreds." [...] The New York Times described [...] "The Rising" [...] as a work in which [...] "one man's afterlife is an endless longing for the physical touch of those left behind, and the music climbs toward jubilation as an act of will." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sun Ce {{was very}} fond of going on hunting excursions. Yu Fan told him, [...] "You {{gathered}} a mob, used them {{to rein in the}} wandering scholar-gentry, and earned their fervent allegiance towards you. Even Emperor Gao of Han can't be compared to you. When you dress casually and venture out, the officials who accompany <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> don't have enough time to prepare for the trip, while the servants and soldiers are getting tiresome. A leader who doesn't behave in a serious manner doesn't command respect. The White Dragon transformed into a fish for fun and ended up being trapped by the fisherman Yuqie (豫且); the White Serpent behaved recklessly and ended up being slain by Liu Bang. I hope you will be more careful." [...] Sun Ce replied, [...] "You're right. However, sometimes, when I'm thinking hard, I feel frustrated if I were to sit down and think. As such, I venture out in search of insight and inspiration." ...|$|E
2500|$|The show's {{first season}} was well regarded. [...] "One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season is a {{surprisingly}} rewarding experience", said Neal Solon of DVD Verdict. [...] "Throughout its first season, One Tree Hill distinguishes itself from other teen dramas by dealing {{with more than}} just the backstabbing, backbiting, and backwards morals of today's youth," [...] he said. [...] "Certainly, the show contains its fair share of this petty drama, but it also explores the reasons behind it." [...] He gives the effect of the parents' mistakes on the teenagers as an example. Solon felt that the Season 1 finale was strong partly because its creators did not know if the WB would renew the show. [...] "The last few episodes bring some form of closure to the major story arcs, while leaving the door wide open for further development should the show continue. It is an artfully employed strategy that paid off," [...] he said. Also reviewing season 1, Paul Cooke of DVDActive.com stated, [...] "If you take the time to invest some emotional capital {{in the lives of the}} characters, <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> will find yourself absorbed in their trials and tribulations. One Tree Hill is no different, in fact, it may be notch above some of the other teen angst shows." [...] Cooke added, [...] "All of the actors are pleasant to look at, the storylines are interesting and the music is fresh and enjoyable. How could someone not enjoy this show? Do yourself a favour, and visit One Tree Hill." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as <b>you</b> <b>usually</b> do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.
