5|$|The <b>yucca,</b> <b>Yucca</b> whipplei, is pollinated {{exclusively}} by Tegeticula maculata, a <b>yucca</b> moth {{that depends on}} the <b>yucca</b> for survival. The moth eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when the moth moves to the next flower. The <b>yucca</b> provides a place for the moth to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
5|$|The DOE was {{scheduled}} to begin accepting spent fuel at the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain repository by January 31, 1998. , years after this deadline, the future status of the repository at <b>Yucca</b> Mountain was still unknown due to on-going litigation, and opposition by Senator Harry Reid.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} found {{evidence}} that Native Americans used the immediate vicinity of <b>Yucca</b> Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{radioactive}} waste at Hanford {{was supposed to}} be stored in the planned <b>Yucca</b> Mountain nuclear waste repository, but after that project was suspended, Washington State sued, joined by South Carolina. Their first suit was dismissed in July 2011. In a subsequent suit, federal authorities were ordered to either approve or reject plans for the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain storage site.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2009, the Obama {{administration}} {{attempted to}} close the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain repository, despite current US law that designates <b>Yucca</b> Mountain as the nation's nuclear waste repository. The administration agency, DOE, began implementation of the President's plan in May 2009. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also {{went along with the}} administration's closure plan. Various state and Congressional entities attempted to challenge the administration's closure plans, by statute and in court.|$|E
5|$|The California State Legislature defined Route 26 as a {{route from}} Lucerne Valley to Morongo Valley in 1959. SR 247 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route from SR 62 in <b>Yucca</b> Valley to SR 18 near Lucerne Valley, {{and then from}} there to I-15 in Barstow. That year, the Lucerne Valley Chamber of Commerce began an effort to have a state highway designated from Lucerne Valley to <b>Yucca</b> Valley along Old Woman Springs Road. By 1969, county roads had been constructed from Barstow to Lucerne Valley, {{and from there to}} <b>Yucca</b> Valley. Barstow Road and Old Woman Springs Road were given to the state by San Bernardino County in 1972, although the county had agreed to perform some improvements on the two roads after the state began to maintain them.|$|E
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at <b>Yucca</b> Mountain will not {{significantly}} affect repository performance. <b>Yucca</b> Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to significantly affect the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that <b>Yucca</b> Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate {{hearing that}} the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain site was no longer {{considered}} an option for storing reactor waste.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} <b>Yucca</b> Mountain {{received}} much more {{rain in the}} geologic past and the water table was consequently much higher than it is today, though well {{below the level of}} the repository.|$|E
5|$|The costly nuclear {{accident}} in 2014 at New Mexico's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant {{in which a}} nuclear waste container exploded, has caused doubt that it could serve as an alternative for <b>Yucca.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Yucca</b> Mountain and {{surrounding}} lands were central {{in the lives}} of the Southern Paiute, Western Shoshone, and Owens Valley Paiute and Shoshone peoples, who shared them for religious ceremonies, resource uses, and social events.|$|E
5|$|EPA {{published}} in the Federal Register a final rule in 2009. The new rule limits radiation doses from <b>Yucca</b> Mountain for up to 1,000,000 years after it closes. Within that regulatory time frame, the EPA has two dose standards that would apply {{based on the number}} of years from the time the facility is closed.|$|E
5|$|In November 2013, in {{response}} to a lawsuit filed by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and the Nuclear Energy Institute, the US court of appeals ruled that nuclear utilities may stop paying into the nuclear waste recovery fund until either the DOE follows the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which designates <b>Yucca</b> Mountain as the repository, or Congress changes the law. The fee ended May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|State Route 247 (SR 247) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California in San Bernardino County. The road passes through the Mojave Desert, {{connecting}} SR 62 in <b>Yucca</b> Valley to Interstate 15 (I-15). SR 247 was designated by the California State Legislature in 1969; the county roads along that route {{were given to the}} state in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} {{that makes}} up <b>Yucca</b> Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural barrier to the radiation. It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts.|$|E
5|$|This {{same problem}} also was {{cited by the}} Nevada Legislature {{as a reason to}} {{dissolve}} Bullfrog County, Nevada, a short-lived county specially created in 1987 for purposes of shifting federal transfer payments related {{to the creation of the}} <b>Yucca</b> Mountain nuclear waste facility directly to the state treasury.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule’s dose limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a dose limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that <b>Yucca</b> Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public dose through 1,000,000 years.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2010, {{the state}} of Washington filed suit to prevent the closing of <b>Yucca</b> Mountain, since this would slow efforts to clean up Hanford Nuclear Reservation. South Carolina, Aiken County (the {{location}} of Savannah River site) and others joined Washington. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit dismissed the suit in July 2011, saying the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had not ruled on {{the withdrawal of the}} license application. Washington and South Carolina filed another lawsuit on July 29.|$|E
5|$|The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{established}} its <b>Yucca</b> Mountain {{standards in}} June 2001. The storage standard set a dose limit of 15 millirem {{per year for}} the public outside the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain site. The disposal standards consisted of three components: an individual dose standard, a standard evaluating the impacts of human intrusion into the repository, and a groundwater protection standard. The individual-protection and human intrusion standards {{set a limit of}} 15 millirem per year to a reasonably maximally exposed individual, who would be among the most highly exposed members of the public. The groundwater protection standard is consistent with EPA's Safe Drinking Water Act standards, which the Agency applies in many situations as a pollution prevention measure. The disposal standards were to apply for a period of 10,000 years after the facility is closed. Dose assessments were to continue beyond 10,000 years and be placed in DOE's Environmental Impact Statement, but were not subject to a compliance standard. The 10,000 year period for compliance assessment is consistent with EPA's generally applicable standards developed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. It also reflects international guidance regarding the level of confidence that can be placed in numerical projections over very long periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The curve-billed {{breeding}} season begins in February and reaches an apex between March and May; however, new fledglings {{have been recorded}} as late as August. Dates vary within its range due to temperature and rainfall. Nests are generally built at conspicuous locations, the cholla being favored. Other potential nesting sites range from mesquite, prickly pear or <b>yucca</b> to the occasional oak and pine trees. The nest is generally a deep cup but can be flat with a depression for the eggs. The outer layer consists of thorny twigs while the inner layer includes smooth sticks, roots, coarse and fine grasses, rootlets or hair.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and <b>yucca</b> moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the French {{physicist}} Francis Perrin discovered fifteen {{ancient and}} no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in Gabon, West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain nuclear waste repository.|$|E
5|$|In many European {{countries}} (e.g., Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland) {{the risk}} or dose limit for {{a member of}} the public exposed to radiation from a future high-level nuclear waste facility is considerably more stringent than that suggested by the International Commission on Radiation Protection or proposed in the United States. European limits are often more stringent than the standard suggested in 1990 by the International Commission on Radiation Protection by a factor of 20, and more stringent by a factor of ten than the standard proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for <b>Yucca</b> Mountain nuclear waste repository for the first 10,000 years after closure. Moreover, the U.S. EPA’s proposed standard for greater than 10,000 years is 250 times more permissive than the European limit.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and <b>yucca,</b> as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{first human}} {{presence}} in the region dates to 8,000years ago when family groups camped where they could hunt or collect plants and seeds. About 2,000years ago, some groups began growing corn and other crops, leading to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Later groups in this period built permanent villages called pueblos. Archaeologists call this the Archaic period and it lasted until about 500CE. Baskets, cordage nets, and <b>yucca</b> fiber sandals have been found and dated to this period. The Archaic toolkits included flaked stone knives, drills, and stemmed dart points. The dart points were attached to wooden shafts and propelled by throwing devices called atlatls.|$|E
5|$|Under President Obama the Department of Energy (DOE) was {{reviewing}} options {{other than}} <b>Yucca</b> Mountain for a high-level waste repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, {{established by the}} Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It expressed urgency to find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy. In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E
5|$|Because its {{coloration}} {{is similar}} to Bendire's thrasher, the two birds are easily mistaken for one another. The bill of the curve-billed is all black, while that of Bendire's is paler down to the lower mandible, showing a dark grey with a basal area that does not feature a stark contrast. The upper and lower mandibles of the curve-billed are curved, while the upper is curved and lower is essentially straight for the Bendires'. Although geographic variances for the curve-billed can make discerning breast patterns difficult, the curve-billed {{has a tendency to}} display larger and rounder spots overall on its breast, in contrast to the Bendires' smaller, more pronounced markings shaped like arrowheads. However, curve-billed thrashers can also present this feature. Bendires' typically have yellow eyes while curve-billed eyes are typically orange, but Bendires' can have variations that appear yellow-orange while some curve-billed eyes are red-orange, yellow-orange, or yellow. The curve-billed is heavier and is more likely to inhabit suburban regions; Bendires' are likely to avoid dense vegetation such as mesquite and prefers open grassland with scattered <b>yucca</b> or around hedgegrows in agricultural areas. The song call of Bendire's is said to be more melodic and continuous with a chuck, while the curve-billed is known for its whit-wheet calls.|$|E
25|$|At {{the south}} end of <b>Yucca</b> Flat is <b>Yucca</b> Lake, also called <b>Yucca</b> Dry Lake. The dry, {{alkaline}} lake bed holds a restricted runway (<b>Yucca</b> Airstrip) which was built by the Army Corps of Engineers before nuclear testing began in the area. To the west of the dry lake bed is News Nob, a rocky outcropping from which journalists and VIPs were able to watch atmospheric nuclear tests at <b>Yucca</b> Flat.|$|E

25|$|A {{series of}} large {{explosive}} volcanic eruptions occurred {{to the north}} of <b>Yucca</b> Mountain millions of years ago, producing dense clouds of volcanic ash and rock fragments which melted or compressed together to create layers of rock called tuff, forming the mountains and hills of the region. The volcanic eruptions that produced <b>Yucca</b> Mountain ended about 12 million years ago. This explosive volcanism produced almost all (more than 99 percent) of the volcanic material in the <b>Yucca</b> Mountain region.|$|E
