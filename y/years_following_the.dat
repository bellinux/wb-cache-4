5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies {{as an academic}} discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious movements in the United States.

5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it received little attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In the <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{remained}} {{politically active}} in the <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> failure of Monsieur Verdoux, his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in Edwardian London, was devoid of political themes. Limelight was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood {{and the lives of}} his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E

5|$|As with {{internment}} in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of paramilitary activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> hunger strikes.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the thyroid}} {{concentrates}} iodine, it also concentrates the various radioactive isotopes of iodine produced by nuclear fission. In {{the event of}} large accidental releases of such material into the environment, the uptake of radioactive iodine isotopes by the thyroid can, in theory, be blocked by saturating the uptake mechanism with a large surplus of non-radioactive iodine, taken {{in the form of}} potassium iodide tablets. One consequence of the Chernobyl disaster was an increase in thyroid cancers in children in the <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> accident.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{significant}} European {{success in}} the 1970s and early 1980s, the late '80s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs were banned from European competition for five <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.|$|E

5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the <b>years</b> <b>following</b> <b>the</b> deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, set the stage for Domenico Selvo.|$|E
