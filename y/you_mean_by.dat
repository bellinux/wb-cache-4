500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E

You are {{constant}} in your brightness, but I must change with the seasons. Remember that I willingly let you enter me and I gave birth to your sons, [...] enduring pain to bring them into the world. As different as we are, we are of one spirit. As dissimilar as we are, you and I, we are of equal worth. As different as we are, there must be solidarity between us. There can be no harmony in the universe unless there is harmony between us. If there is to be harmony, my request must matter to you. There is to be no more coming from me to you than there is from you to me." ...|$|E

I want it built floating on the shimmering water, away from the shore, so that the Earth-Surface people will not bother me with their quarrels. I want white shell, and blue shell, and turquoise. I want haliotis. I want soapstone, agate, redstone, and jet. Because I will live there alone while you are gone each day, I want animals to keep me company. [...] Give me buffalo, and deer, and mountain sheep, jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and muskrats. Provide me with those things and I shall go with you to the west." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien {{responded to}} the media's {{questions}} about the incident at a press conference. He {{was asked about the}} pepper-spraying by a Vancouver-based comedic reporter known as [...] "Nardwuar the Human Serviette", a frequent contributor to Canada's MuchMusic network, known for his high-pitched voice and odd attire, who told Chrétien that there was a song released by a punk rock band called [...] "The Nomads" [...] (a fictitious band Nardwuar had made up) called [...] "The Suharto Stomp". Nardwuar then asked Chrétien [...] "Do you think, if you were say 40 years younger, that you too would be writing punk songs about Suharto and protesting against APEC?" [...] Chrétien replied that he himself had protested as a student, and that in a democracy, protests were to be expected. Nardwuar followed up by telling the Prime Minister that [...] "Some of the protesters were maced." [...] Chrétien asked, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> that?" [...] Nardwuar then clarified, [...] "Mace? Pepper spray?" [...] Chrétien then stated abruptly, [...] "I don't know, these techniques did not exist in those days", which received big laughs from everyone in the room. Nardwuar simply smiled at Chrétien's joke, and the Prime Minister concluded his answer by adding [...] "For me, pepper, I put it on my plate", with a smile while pantomiming shaking pepper onto a plate. This line also received laughter. However, allegations soon arose that someone in the Prime Minister's Office or Chrétien himself gave the go-ahead for the pepper-spraying of protesters. Chrétien denied any involvement, and it has never been proven.|$|E
2500|$|Matson held to and {{developed}} his youthful instincts, and this effort {{was supported by}} several Beat paradigms: One, that a poem is shaped by the poet's breath, a perception extended by Charles Olson as [...] "projective verse." [...] Ginsberg disseminated a similar idea from William Carlos Williams, who advised him in the 1940s to [...] "Listen {{to the rhythm of}} your own voice. Proceed intuitively by ear." [...] A second paradigm suggests that the source of poetry is life itself. Life as lived on streets, in jobs, in relationships, in meditation groups, on farms and in mountains, not something found through scholarship or abstraction. [...] "No ideas but in things," [...] also passed on from Williams, and Robert Creeley's [...] "Form is never more than an extension of content" [...] were significant ideas in the conversation. Street wisdom, too, informed Beat sensibility, that a homeless drunk was more likely to see God than a professor. A third, and largely unacknowledged, dictum of the Beats is that writing is to communicate. Many times Huncke asked, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>by</b> that?" [...] The question was legitimate, though undercurrents among intellectuals at the time were palpable, to reframe poetry as an arcane art and make it ripe for the academies to hijack. Matson's original impulse to communicate to others, educated or not, endured for him as a common-sense virtue. A fourth feature of Beat sensibility, the longing to expand consciousness, drove much of Matson's experimentation. That desire was ubiquitous among young artists and found clear articulation in Timothy Leary's Turn on, tune in, drop out. This code expressed widespread dissatisfaction with mainstream culture and gave license to rebellion. Leary's formulation, plus the emerging hippie ethic, kept the political concerns of Matson's forebears in the foreground. Behind these paradigms, for some, lay the intuition that the feeling in the body is paramount, along with what one observes with one's own eyes. The childhood study of minerals informed Matson's sensibilities, since Dana's early science stipulated that visible qualities of crystals revealed their essence. Seeing and describing with clarity mapped fluidly into his writing. The weakness of cultural imperatives kept the field open, fertile, and largely undescribed.|$|E
