2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want to make it so that when you hit the left button, you really hit with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> combo." ...|$|E

Relying upon the temper of the times, you have surely thought little argument necessary to content what few will be hardy enough to support; the strongest of auxiliaries, imprisonment and the pillory, has <b>left</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> little to perform. But the happiness of mankind is so closely connected with this subject, that I cannot suffer such considerations to deter me from throwing out a few hints, which {{may lead to a}} conclusion that a Republic legitimately constructed contains less of an oppressive principle than any other form of government.|$|R
5000|$|In 624, {{when there}} was an ongoing rivalry between Li Shimin and his eldest brother, Li Jiancheng (the Crown Prince), over the {{succession}} to their father's throne, Li Jiancheng became very suspicious and distrustful of Cheng Yaojin. Emperor Gaozu appointed Cheng Yaojin as the Prefect of Kang Prefecture (康州; around present-day Zhaoqing, Guangdong), effectively sending him {{far away from the}} capital, Chang'an (present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi). Cheng Yaojin told Li Shimin, [...] "Great Prince, if you lose <b>your</b> <b>left</b> and right <b>arms,</b> you will not survive long. I will not leave you, even if it means I will die." [...] On 2 July 626, Cheng Yaojin joined Li Shimin in assassinating Li Jiancheng and his fourth brother, Li Yuanji (the Prince of Qi), at the Xuanwu Gate Incident, after which Li Shimin became the new Crown Prince. He was appointed as a [...] "Right Guard Commander to the Crown Prince" [...] (太子右衛率) and subsequently promoted to [...] "Right Martial Guard Senior General" [...] (右武衛大將軍) and awarded 700 taxable households in his dukedom.|$|R

Now that I look at you closely, it seems to me that you use <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> but stiffly, Albert; and you have your hair cut away in one place, Edgar, and a strip of plaster on it.

This afternoon I couldn't settle down because I was wondering all the time whether you were wearing blue linen or white muslin.

And he knows it too. So that what you take for the White Whale's malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d'ye see? No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm {{for the sake of the}} privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why, in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that's all." ...|$|E

You see, I've bin brought up to {{cartridges}} all my life, an' the change to pullin' a stopper out o' a horn wi' your teeth, pourin' the powder into your left hand, wi' the gun under <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm,</b> an' the pitchin' o' the frigate, like {{as if it was}} in a cross sea, was raither perplexin'. Hows'ever, it had to be done, for I was alongside of another cow in a jiffy. I nigh knocked out two o' my front teeth in tryin' to shove the stopper in my mouth. Then, when I was pourin' the powder into my hand, I as near as could be let fall the gun, which caused me to give a sort of gasp of anxiety, when two o' the three bullets dropped out o' my mouth, but I held on to the third wi' my teeth. Just then a puff o' wind blew the powder out o' my hand into the buffalo's eyes, causin' her to bellow like a fog-horn, an' obleegin' me to pour out another charge. I did it hastily, as you may well believe, an' about three times what I wanted came out. Hows'ever, I lost a deal of it in pourin' it into the gun; then I spat the ball in, gettin' another nasty rap on the teeth as I did so, but I'd bit the ball so that it stuck half-way down.|$|E
60|$|Pshaw! I know another trick I'd {{like to work}} on him, and I almost {{regret that}} I {{did not do it}} at the moment I was captured. I could make him sick, what of his clutch on my collar. His fingers, tight-gripping, are buried inside my collar. My coat is tightly buttoned. Did you ever see a tourniquet? Well, this is one. All I {{have to do is to}} duck my head under his arm and begin to twist. I must twist rapidly--very rapidly. I know how to do it; {{twisting}} in a violent, jerky way, ducking my head under his arm with each revolution. Before he knows it, those detaining fingers of his will be detained. He will be unable to withdraw them. It is a powerful leverage. Twenty seconds after I have started revolving, the blood will be bursting out of his finger-ends, the delicate tendons will be rupturing, and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing together in a shrieking mass. Try it sometime when somebody has you by the collar. But be quick--quick as lightning. Also, be sure to hug yourself while you are revolving--hug your face with <b>your</b> <b>left</b> <b>arm</b> and your abdomen with your right. You see, the other fellow might try to stop you with a punch from his free arm. It would be a good idea, too, to revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it. A punch going is never so bad as a punch coming.|$|E
