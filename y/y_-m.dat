This ridge is roughly parallel to the active ridge axis of the Endeavor Segment ~ 100 km to the west. From south to north these sites are Baby Bare Outcrop, Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1026, and the southern and northern sides of Mama Bare Outcrop. The composition of basement fluids is determined or estimated from analyses of pore water samples that were extracted from sediments at each of these sites, spring waters from Baby Bare, and basement fluids that vented from the open ODP Hole 1026 B. Chemical trends in basement fluids along this transect show increasing alteration from south to north. A similar trend was observed along an ODP transect perpendicular to the ridge axis with increasing fluid alteration from west to east. Much {{of the increase in}} fluid alteration along the ODP transect is explained by greater water-rock exchange with increasing basement temperature to the east. In contrast, the trend along the 3. 5 <b>-m.</b> <b>y.</b> -old ridge is best explained by diffusive exchange with the overlying sediment. The rate of this exchange is used to constrain hydrologic properties within basaltic basement.

40|$|The ribosomal S 6 kinase 2 (RSK 2) is a {{well-known}} serine/threonine kinase {{and a member of}} the p 90 ribosomal S 6 kinase (p 90 RSK) family of proteins. It is activated downstream of the MEK/ERKs cascade by mitogenic stimuli such as EGF or TPA. Here, we show that RSK 2 is activated by treatment with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and directly phosphorylates IκBα at Ser- 32, leading to IκBα degradation. The phosphorylation of IκBα promotes the activation and translocation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) subunits p 65 and p 50 to the nucleus. The net result is an increased NF-κB activity, which serves as a mechanism for RSK 2 blockade of TNF-α-induced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival. —Peng, C., Cho, Y. -Y., Zhu, F., Xu, <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.,</b> Wen, W., Ma, W. -Y., Bode, A.

40|$|When {{mechanical}} parts are assembled, their dimensional and form variations accumulate statistically and propagate kinematically, causing critical assembly features to vary. The main {{objective of this}} thesis was to relate engineering tolerance requirements to manufacturing constraints {{by means of a}} common engineering model for variation in assemblies. A comprehensive system for defining assembly specifications (engineering requirements) and for analytically predicting assembly variations was developed, which will allow closer control of product quality and performance. Vector loops were used to model mechanical assemblies. The loops join relevant dimensions into chains. Closed loops define the kinematic constraints on the assembly. Open loops define engineering constraints. Linearized equations derived from the vector loops were used to solve for the assembly variations. The linearized equations are expressed in terms of scalar sensitivities and known component tolerances. Simplified methods were developed for determining sensitivities using nodal coordinates. Eight distinct assembly specifications were identified, patterned after the ANSI <b>Y</b> 14. 5 <b>-M</b> 1982 standards for geometric dimensioning and tolerancing. They are general enough to cover a wide range of assembly applications.

In order to provide theoretical interpretation for the release of the full SZ cluster samples over the next few years, we have exploited the large-volume Millennium gas cosmo- logical N-body hydrodynamics simulations to study the SZ cluster population at low and high redshift, for three models with varying gas physics. We confirm previous results using smaller samplesthattheintrinsic(spherical) <b>Y</b> 500 <b>–M</b> 500 relationhasverylittlescatter(σlog 10 Y ≃ 0. 04), is insensitive to cluster gas physics and evolves to redshift 1 in accordance with self-similar expectations. Our preheating and feedback models predict scaling relations that are in excel- lent agreement with the recent analysis from combined Planck and XMM–Newton data by the Planck Collaboration. This agreement is largely preserved when r 500 and M 500 are derived using thehydrostaticmassproxy,YX, 500,albeitwithsignificantlyreducedscatter(σlog 10 Y ≃ 0. 02),a result that is due to the tight correlation between Y 500 and YX, 500. Interestingly, this assumption also hides any bias in the relation due to dynamical activity. We also assess the importance of projection effects from large-scale structure along the line of sight, by extracting cluster Y 500 values from 50 simulated 5 × 5 -deg 2 sky maps. Once the (model-dependent) mean signal is subtracted from the maps we find that the integrated SZ signal is unbiased with respect to the underlying clusters, although the scatter in the (cylindrical) <b>Y</b> 500 <b>–M</b> 500 relation increases in the preheating case, where a significant amount of energy was injected into the intergalactic medium at high redshift. Finally, we study the hot gas pressure profiles to investigate the origin of the SZ signal and find that the largest contribution comes from radii close to r 500 in all cases. The profiles themselves are well described by generalized Navarro, Frenk & White profiles but there is significant cluster-to-cluster scatter. In conclusion, our results support the notion that Y 500 is a robust mass proxy for use in cosmological analyses with clusters...|$|R

We report on the observation of bright emission of single photons under pulsed resonance fluorescence conditions from a single quantum dot (QD) in a micropillar cavity. The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced via the coupling to the fundamental mode of a micropillar, allowing us to determine a single photon extraction efficiency of (20. 7 ± 0. 8) % per linear polarization basis. This yields an overall extraction efficiency of (41. 4 ± 1. 5) % in our device.

The open reading frame deduced from this sequence consists of 1, 230 bp encoding 410 amino acids. The mature form of this enzyme contains 409 amino acids after the deletion of the first methionine.

It is typically accompanied by an enhanced coercivity when theFM/AF bilayer is field-cooled below the Neel temperature (TN) of the AF. The loopshift, Hex, depends on the exchange coupling energy and the thickness of theferromagnetic layer. The exchange bias effect has been extensively studied during thelast decade due to its applications in spin valves for the ultra high density magneticrecording. Our previous works [1, 2] indicate that the exchange bias in FM/AF systemsstrongly depends on the structures of antiferromagnetic oxides (eg.

Numerical simulations demonstrate that it is the last option that takes place - the local density distribution and the nearest-neighbor correlations in the middle chain correspond to a shock phase with completely delocalized domain wall.

The brightness of the QD fluorescence is greatly enhanced on resonance with the fundamental mode of the pillar, leading to an overall device efficiency of η = (74 ± 4) % for a single photon emission as pure as g(2) (0) = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0004. The combination of large Purcell enhancement and resonant pumping conditions allows us to observe a two-photon wave packet overlap up to ν = (88 ± 3) %. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{molecule}} profiles undergo dynamic {{changes in}} physiology and pathology, serve as markers of cellular state and phenotype {{and can be}} exploited for cell selection strategies and diagnostics. The isolation of well-defined cell subsets is needed for in vivo and in vitro applications in stem cell biology. In this technical report, we present an approach for defining a subset of interest in a mixed cell population by flow cytometric detection of intracellular antigens. We have developed a fully validated protocol that enables the co-detection of cluster of differentiation (CD) surface antigens on fixed, permeabilized neural cell populations defined by intracellular staining. Determining the degree of co-expression of surface marker candidates with intracellular target population markers (nestin, MAP 2, doublecortin, TUJ 1) on neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY 5 <b>Y,</b> BE(2) <b>-M</b> 17) yielded a combinatorial CD 49 f(-) /CD 200 (high) surface marker panel. Its application in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) generated enriched neuronal cultures from differentiated cell suspensions derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Our data underlines the feasibility of using the described co-labeling protocol and co-expression analysis for quantitative assays in mammalian neurobiology and for screening approaches to identify much needed surface markers in stem cell biology...|$|R

Based on the mineralogical composition of the fraction 63 µm, the whole section can be subdivided into three major periods of sedimentation. Between 17. 1 and 6 m. y., and between 0. 8 m. y. to present, the sediments are characterized by sandy and silty turbiditic inputs with a high proportion of minerals derived from a gneissic source without alteration. In the fraction 63 µm contains quartz, muscovite, biotite, chlorite, and feldspars. The 6 -to 0. 8 <b>-m.</b> <b>y.</b> period is represented by an alternation of sandy/silty horizons, muds, and calcareous muds rich in smectite, and kaolinite (50 % to 85 % of the fraction < 2 µm) and bioclastic material. The presence of smectite and kaolinite, as well as the 18 O/ 16 O and the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the fraction < 2 µm, imply an evolution in a soil environment and exchanges with meteoric ground water. The ranges of isotopic compositions are limited throughout the section: d 18 O quartz = 11. 7 to 13. 3 per mil, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 733 to 0. 760 and epsilon-Nd (0) = - 17. 4 to - 13. 8. These values are within those of the High Himalaya Crystalline series, and they are considered to reflect this source region. The data imply that, since 17 Ma, this formation has supplied the major part of the eroded material...|$|R

The results indicate a rather strong velocity gradient below the sediments with little evidence of layering in the upper crust and a slightly dipping oceanic layer. The crust-to-mantle transition zone appears sharp providing a relatively good wave guide for multiple Moho reflections which are modeled synthetically to further test the usefulness of a layered earth model in explaining entire seismograms. The mantle head waves decay abruptly near 50 km which can be explained by the onset of a low-velocity zone in the upper mantle at about a depth of 12 km below the ocean surface...|$|R
40|$|Sensitive {{surveys of}} the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) will detect {{thousands}} of galaxy clusters via the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect. Two SZ observables, the central or maximum and integrated Comptonization parameters ymax and Y, relate in {{a simple way to}} the total cluster mass, which allow the construction of mass functions (MFs) {{that can be used to}} estimate cosmological parameters such as the ratio of the average matter density to the critical density ΩM, the normalization of the spectrum of initial density perturbations σ 8, and the dark energy equation of state parameter w. However, clusters form from the mergers of smaller structures, events that can disrupt the equilibrium of intracluster gas upon which SZ–M relations rely. From a set of N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers, we calculate the evolution of Y and ymax over the course of merger events and find that both parameters are transiently “boosted, ” primarily during the first core passage. We then use a semi-analytic technique developed by Randall et al. (2002) to estimate the effect of merger boosts on the distribution functions YF and yF of Y and ymax, respectively, via cluster merger histories determined from extended Press-Schechter (PS) merger trees. The scatter in the <b>Y</b> <b>–M</b> and ymax–M relations from merger boosts are found to be ∼ 2 % and 25 – 30 % respectively. To determine ΩM, σ 8...|$|E
40|$|When we {{consider}} an asynchronous distributed computation on which local checkpoints have been defined (namely, {{a communication and}} checkpoint pattern- in brief, CCP), two types of dependencies between its local checkpoints can be observed. The first type is due to causal sequences of messages that establish on-line trackable dependencies. The second type is due to noncausal sequences of messages (called Z-paths) that establish “hidden ” dependencies between local checkpoints (a dependency is “hidden ” if {{it can not be}} tracked online). The Rollback Dependency Trackability (RDT) property, defined by <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.</b> Wang, has been introduced to study CCPs. A CCP satisfies the RDT property if every pair of local checkpoints that are connected by a “hidden ” dependency are also connected by a causal sequence of messages. The RDT property has a great interest: CCPs that satisfy this property allow relatively simple solutions to a lot of practical problems. This paper first introduces the notion of RDT-compliant property. In a given CCP, an X-path is a Z-path that satisfies a property X. The property X is RDT-compliant if every CCP without X-paths satisfies the RDT property. Then, the paper presents a particular RDT-compliant property. This property enjoys several very interesting features. (1) It is “visible ” (i. e., it can be tested on-line). (2) It is stronger than previously known RDT-compliant properties. Consequently, this property provides a characterization of RDT better than the previous ones. The question of the minimal characterization of the RDT property is finally investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|Cleavage of the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) polyprotein by the viral NS 3 protease releases functional viral proteins {{essential for}} viral replication. Recent studies by Foy and coworkers {{strongly suggest that}} NS 3 -mediated cleavage of host factors may abrogate cellular response to alpha interferon (IFN-α) (E. Foy, K. Li, R. Sumpter, Jr., <b>Y.</b> <b>-M.</b> Loo, C. L. Johnson, C. Wang, P. M. Fish, M. Yoneyama, T. Fujita, S. M. Lemon, and M. Gale, Jr., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102 : 2986 - 2991, 2005, and E. Foy, K. Li, C. Wang, R. Sumpter, Jr., M. Ikeda, S. M. Lemon, and M. Gale, Jr., Science 300 : 1145 - 1148, 2003). Blockage of NS 3 protease activity therefore is expected to inhibit HCV replication by both direct suppression of viral protein production {{as well as by}} restoring host responsiveness to IFN. Using structure-assisted design, a ketoamide inhibitor, SCH 503034, was generated which demonstrated potent (overall inhibition constant, 14 nM) time-dependent inhibition of the NS 3 protease in cell-free enzyme assays as well as robust in vitro activity in the HCV replicon system, as monitored by immunofluorescence and real-time PCR analysis. Continuous exposure of replicon-bearing cell lines to six times the 90 % effective concentration of SCH 503034 for 15 days resulted in a greater than 4 -log reduction in replicon RNA. The combination of SCH 503034 with IFN was more effective in suppressing replicon synthesis than either compound alone, supporting the suggestion of Foy and coworkers that combinations of IFN with protease inhibitors would lead to enhanced therapeutic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} some Neurospora mutants which grow on minimal medium {{when the}} gas-phase contains 30 yo CO, (v/v); they {{are referred to}} as ‘CO, mutants’. One is an arginine mutant (arg- 2; 33442) having a mutation at a different locus from the other arginine CO, mutant (arg- 3; 30300); a second (arg- 11; 30820) requires arginine + a purine + a pyrimi-dine for growth in the absence of CO,; a third (44601) requires arginine +a purine + a pyrimidine + a carboxylic acid for growth in the absence of CO,. The mutations in mutants 30820 and 44601 are allelic and the carboxylic acid requirement of mutant 44601 is attributable to its genetic back-ground. The remaining CO, mutants described here were isolated directly from wild-type Neurospora, and their nutritional requirements in the absence of CO, subsequently determined. Two of these mutants, which are allelic, are adenine-requiring mutants sited at the adenine- 3 locus, although the adenine- 3 A and- 3 B mutants 38709 and <b>Y</b> 112 <b>-M</b> 2 are not CO, mutants. Another two of these new CO, mutants, which may be allelic, require carboxylic acids in the absence of CO,; these mutants are similar in their nutritional requirements to the succinate mutants de-scribed by Lewis (1948) and Strauss (1956) ...|$|R

This will contribute data to the future testing of the Matthews and Poore model of 1980, in which it was assumed that low-latitude sea-surface temperature has remained virtually constant as global climate evolved. Spectral analyses of the record by means of biostratigraphic time controls show a distinct peak at a period near 40 ka that is probably associated with the orbital obliquity cycle.
