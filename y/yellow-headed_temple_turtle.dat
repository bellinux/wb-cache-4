25|$|Black marsh turtles are {{culturally}} important to Buddhism. In Thailand and Japan, {{large numbers of}} black marsh turtles, along with the <b>yellow-headed</b> <b>temple</b> <b>turtles</b> (Heosemys annandalii) are released into temple and castle ponds and cared for by Buddhist monks. They are treated as sacred by the public, being believed to contain the souls of people who died while trying to rescue other people from drowning. One of their commons names, Siamese <b>temple</b> <b>turtle,</b> originated from this practice.|$|R

500|$|The temple {{floor is}} {{elevated}} [...] above the plaza and the temple superstructure, including both the temple {{walls and the}} roof, would have added another [...] to the total height of the structure {{at the time of}} the Spanish Conquest. The temple shrine had benches built against three sides of the interior and a hearth in the middle. A small rear chamber also had benches, this chamber may have been where the gods of the Sotz'il were kept. A small section of the temple floor had been opened as if to receive a burial but the tomb was never used and was covered over again. The remains of a turtle were excavated from the plaza immediately in front of the temple and may have represented one of the bacabs (a class of mythical being) that supported the <b>temple.</b> <b>Turtles</b> also played an important part in the Classic Period Maya myth of the rebirth of the Maize God.|$|R
