5|$|Edge of Tomorrow (also {{known by}} its tagline Live. Die. Repeat. and renamed as Live. Die. Repeat.: Edge of Tomorrow such upon home release) is a 2014 American science fiction action film {{starring}} Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Doug Liman directed the film based on a screenplay adapted from the 2004 Japanese light novel All <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Is</b> Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The film {{takes place in a}} future where Earth is invaded by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations officer with no combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the aliens. Though Cage is killed in combat, he finds himself in a time loop that sends him back to the day preceding the battle every time he dies. Cage teams up with Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Blunt) to improve his fighting skills through the repeated days, seeking a way to defeat the extraterrestrial invaders.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{has also}} had an {{intermittent}} acting career, most well-known {{for his role in}} Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg's Performance (1968), and as Australian bushranger Ned Kelly (1970). He composed an improvised soundtrack for Kenneth Anger's film Invocation of My Demon Brother on the Moog synthesiser in 1969. Jagger auditioned for the role of Dr. Frank N. Furter in the 1975 film adaptation of The Rocky Horror Show, a role that was eventually played by Tim Curry the original performer from its run on London's West End. The same year he was approached by director Alejandro Jodorowsky {{to play the role of}} Feyd-Rautha in Jodorowsky's proposed adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, but the movie never made it to the screen. Jagger appeared as himself in the Rutles' film All <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>Is</b> Cash in 1978 and was cast as Wilbur, a main character in Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, in the late 1970s. However, the illness of main actor Jason Robards (later replaced by Klaus Kinski), and a delay in the film's notoriously difficult production, resulted in him being unable to continue due to schedule conflicts with a band tour; some footage of Jagger's work is shown in the documentaries Burden of Dreams and My Best Fiend. In 1983 he starred in Faerie Tale Theatre's The Nightingale as the emperor. Jagger developed a reputation for playing the heavy later in his acting career in films including Freejack (1992), Bent (1997), and The Man From Elysian Fields (2002).|$|E
