2500|$|In 1886, Koyle heard {{a sermon}} on gaining a {{testimony}} through manifestations, so he prayed {{to gain a}} testimony. That night, he dreamed of a lost cow in a field that had an injured horn which poked its own eye. A voice asked him, [...] "If you find your cow at this place tomorrow, will <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Restored Gospel is true?" [...] He responded yes, and that morning he reportedly saw the injured cow just as the voice had told him. Historian Kevin Cantera compared the Dream Miners' views of this experience with traditional LDS views of Joseph Smith's First Vision.|$|E
2500|$|Korine's {{next project}} was the crime drama Spring Breakers, which was {{produced}} in 2012 in Florida, and starred James Franco, Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, and Korine's wife, Rachel Korine. In looking at early scenes being filmed and in speaking toward the plot, cast, and earlier works of the filmmaker, Indiewire wrote [...] "this might be the weirdest movie the director has ever made simply by nature of being totally unlike his previous work." [...] "That Mr. Korine appears to be having it both (or many) ways {{may seem like a}} cop-out, but only if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> role of the artist is to be a didact or a scold." [...] wrote The New York Times. Principal filming wrapped up on March 30, 2012. The film was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Spring Breakers received its world premiere at the 2012 Venice International Film Festival, and later was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival before being released to the general public in March 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority of my business activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E

He married <b>you</b> <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> girl-wife he had left in France was dead. For fear it should come to his father's knowledge, he kept that marriage secret from all. He durst not own his marriage to his father." ...|$|R

60|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} {{which now}} prevails in France {{would have found}} many partisans among us in 1789? No: a revolution in ideas and in prejudices is not made with that rapidity; it moves gradually; it does not escalade.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I see that. Of course, {{if we were}} {{absolutely}} {{in a position to}} prove that this child has been kept down near Pitsea with their cognizance we could arrest them at once; but, unfortunately, in the words you heard {{there was no mention of}} the child, and at present we have nothing but a series of small circumstantial facts to adduce. You believe, Mr. Pettigrew tells me, that the man who calls himself John Simcoe is an impostor who has no right to the name, and that General Mathieson was under a complete delusion when he made that extraordinary will. You believe that, or at any rate you have a suspicion that, having got the General to make the will, he administered some unknown drug that finally caused his death. You believe that, as this child alone stood between him and the inheritance, he had him carried off with the assistance of the other man. <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body the coroner's jury decided to be that of Walter Rivington was not his, and that the child himself is being kept out of the way somewhere in Essex, and <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conversation that you most singularly overheard related to him.|$|E

60|$|It is {{also well}} worthy the {{consideration}} of the good people of Britain, {{that at the same}} time these men would have <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ministers of state are bringing in the pretender, they would also have the ministers of state made believe, that the generality of the people are inclined to receive the pretender; by which double-faced fraud they endeavour to restrain you, the people of Britain, from appearing against the pretender, for fear of offending the government; and to restrain the said government in the same case, for fear of the people.|$|E

60|$|Again, thou sayest, it is a sander put {{upon the}} Quakers, to say, they slight the resurrection: Ans.

60|$|Your Lordships {{witnessed}} the insolence with which this man, stung {{to the quick}} by the recital of his crime, interrupted me; and you heard his recrimination of falsehood against us. We again avouch the truth of all and every word we have uttered, and the validity of every proof with which we have supported them.

50|$|Author and alumnus Chris Hayes {{stated in}} Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy <b>that</b> <b>the</b> school's sole {{reliance}} on the one test for admissions reproduces societal inequalities; that students whose families cannot afford intensive test prep courses {{are less likely to}} earn competitive scores on the entrance exam. As a result, in recent years, the number of African-American students admitted to the school has been increasingly disproportionate to their presence in the public school system. Hayes quotes Hunter College High School's 2010 graduate Justin Hudson's commencement speech:If <b>you</b> truly <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> demographics of Hunter represent the distribution of intelligence in this city then <b>you</b> must <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Upper West Side, Bayside and Flushing are intrinsically more intelligent than the South Bronx, Bedford-Stuyvesant and Washington Heights, and I refuse to accept that.|$|R
