500|$|Reagan {{feels that}} Armageddon is {{inevitable}} and it's dangerous {{when you have a}} President who thinks that way since he's the one who can call for the pushing of the button. He sees himself in his personal drama, I think, increasingly as a religious leader and he has public lunches with some of these very powerful evangelists, Pat Robertson and The 700 Club for instance. In other words, you have the church stroking Reagan and saying [...] "Yes, yes, aren't they saying nasty things about you, they must be communists. Therefore they threaten both you and me. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should silence these communists from speaking?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{features}} an interpolation of Right Said Fred's song [...] "I'm Too Sexy", which was composed by Christopher Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Robert Manzoli. It samples the trademark lyric, [...] "I'm too sexy for my shirt, too sexy for my shirt, so sexy it hurts", but replaces [...] "for my shirt" [...] with [...] "in this club". According to Digital Spy, {{in an interview}} with Teletext, Buchanan revealed that inspiration for the song came [...] "by accident", saying: [...] "The producers were messing around going, 'I'm too sexy for the studio'. We were like, 'That sounds cool', and [...] said, 'You remember that Right Said Fred song?' We were like, 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can do it?' By accident it came together." [...] Balls and Levine compared the song to [...] "Boom Boom Pow" [...] by Black Eyed Peas.|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

2500|$|At the 2008 Republican National Convention, McCain was {{formally}} nominated by roll {{call on the}} night of September 3, following Palin's vice-presidential acceptance speech. McCain himself appeared onstage at the convention for the first time following her speech, telling the cheering delegates, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> made the right choice for the next vice president of the United States?" [...] McCain accepted his party's nomination the following night.|$|E
2500|$|Beckjord said {{he heard}} Bigfoot's voice telling him [...] "We're not what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are, we're here, but we're not real, {{like what you}} think is real." [...] Along with the {{photographs}} of leaves and shadows Beckjord believed showed images of Bigfoot, he also reported having seen Bigfoot footprints that turned into deer tracks, confirming for him that the creature had the ability to shift its shape. He theorized that Bigfoot creatures share a [...] "space-time origin and connection with UFOs and come from an alternative universe by a wormhole." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on April 23, 2002, McCain said that [...] "no American leader should be {{expected}} to sell a false peace to our ally, consider Israel's right to self-defense less legitimate than ours, or insist that Israel negotiate a political settlement while terrorism remains the Palestinians' preferred bargaining tool." [...] During the 2006 Lebanon War, McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and Hezbollah, [...] "What would we do if somebody came across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> would be exercising total restraint?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Palestinian Cleric Ismat Al-Hammouri, {{a leader}} of the Jerusalem-based Hizb ut-Tahrir, called for the {{destruction}} of America, France and Britain and Rome to conquer and destroy the enemies of the [...] "Nation of Islam". He warned: [...] "We warn you, oh America: Take your hands off the Muslims. You have wreaked havoc in Syria, and before that, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and now in Egypt," [...] shouted the cleric to the enthusiastic replies of the crowd. [...] "Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are, America? We are the nation of Islam — a giant and mighty nation, which extends from east to west. Soon, we will teach you a political and military lesson, Allah willing. Allah Akbar. All glory to Allah". Al-Hammouri also warned U.S. president Barack Obama that there is an impending rise of a united Muslim empire that will instill religious law on all of its subjects.|$|E
2500|$|When {{constitutional}} amendments were being {{considered in the}} 1960s, {{the role of the}} monarchy was not strenuously questioned, as it was deemed to be [...] "no great priority in the present round of constitutional changes." [...] This statement was reflected in the four opinion polls conducted in 1970, which showed that the monarchy was favoured by two thirds of those questioned. The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion asked nationally: [...] "Do you think Canada should continue to pay allegiance to The Queen, or do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should become a republic with an elected president?" [...] To this, 50% opted for retention of the status quo, 33% favoured a republic, and the remainder declined to answer. Further, the answers differed by region: in Quebec, 46% wished for a republic as against 23% for monarchy, while in Ontario the monarchy was favoured well above the national average, and support was even higher in the western provinces. Older persons (over 50 years) were the strongest advocates for the monarchy than any other age group, although those in their 20s also gave their preference for the Crown. Similarly, another poll that year revealed that in Canada, exclusive of Quebec, the monarchy was of no issue to 37% of the populace, and a further 41% rated themselves as loyalists, although many of the older responders [...] "recognised that youth had different ideas which might have an effect in the future." ...|$|E
