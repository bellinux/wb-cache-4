500|$|On Bennett's {{return to}} London {{he took up}} a {{teaching}} post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E

Later, Liz reveals that she has a Life Alert Emergency Response necklace; this necklace helps the elderly contact emergency services in case of an accident. Carol wonders why Geico—an auto insurance company—has multiple mascots, a reference to Geico's advertising campaigns. Jack plans to seduce the gay interior designer that Avery hired and hopes to get the designer to agree with him to leave the apartment the way it is, explaining to Liz [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> prize I am in the gay community? There's a term for it. I'm a bear. And I'm a daddy. I'm a daddy bear." [...] Before parting ways, Liz says to Carol [...] "See you October 14", a reference to the live episode of 30 Rock entitled [...] "Live Show" [...] that aired on October 14, 2010.|$|E

60|$|Cam. But, do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> hour in love is worth? 'Tis more {{precious}} than {{an age of}} ordinary life; 'tis the very quintessence and extract of it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Datchery {{rises from}} his papers, {{and comes to}} his doorstep. ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> cathedral is?’ he asks, jocosely.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What! Don't <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> sawbones is, sir?' inquired Mr. Weller. 'I thought {{everybody}} know'd as a sawbones was a surgeon.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{actually}} see any tigers, but I expect they were sneaking round. There were mosquitoes, though. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> mosquito is?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> affection I {{have for}} Mrs. Watson, and how happy {{it made me}} to see her again--younger, much, than when I first knew her in Switzerland.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{conflict}} {{goes on in}} {{the business}} mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right-o," [...] said Mr. Hills, {{dropping}} {{into a chair}} by the counter and caressing his moustache. [...] "But you wouldn't speak {{to me like that}} if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> terrible day I've had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly! How can I {{expect you}} to help me unless <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> serious reason there is for keeping Lucilla in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can you {{ask that}} when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> good Presbyterian I am, Cornelia? How could a Presbyterian {{get along without}} a devil?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'My dear children,' said he, 'I have {{captured}} a Woggle-Bug--a very rare and interesting specimen. Do any of <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> Woggle-Bug is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, to be sure!' said Uriah. 'When <b>a</b> person's umble, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what's</b> <b>an</b> apology? So easy! I say! I suppose,' with a jerk, 'you have {{sometimes}} plucked a pear {{before it was}} ripe, Master Copperfield?' ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{raised his}} head, strode forward, and grasped my hand. [...] "Forgive me, Cumberledge," [...] he cried. [...] "But a proscribed and hounded man! If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> relief {{it is to}} {{me to get out}} on the water!" ...|$|R

60|$|FANNY. The excitement! Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> actress's life {{always seemed}} to me like? Dancing on a tight-rope with {{everybody}} throwing stones at you.

60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear Miss Worsley, I {{thought you}} liked English society so much. You {{were such a}} success in it. And you were so much admired by the best people.

60|$|My friend, {{you will}} {{possibly}} object to this. You will say <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> good man is. Perhaps you will say your clergyman {{is a good}} man, for instance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Maggie, I try {{to believe}} it--indeed I do.

6000|$|... "That's {{the very}} thing. Now consider, Ethel. His work, after {{he goes to}} Oxford, will be doing his very utmost--and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> utmost that is.
