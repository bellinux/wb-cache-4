2500|$|The overall gloominess of A Song of Ice and Fire {{can be an}} {{obstacle}} for some readers; the Inchoatus Group writes that, [...] "If this absence of joy is going to trouble you, or you're looking for something more affirming, then <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> seek elsewhere." [...] However, for many fans, {{it is precisely this}} level of [...] "realness" [...] and [...] "completeness"–including many characters' imperfections, moral and ethical ambiguity, and (often sudden) consequential plot twists–that is endearing about Martin's work. Many find that this is what makes the series' story arcs compelling enough to keep following despite its sheer brutality and intricately messy and interwoven plotlines; as TM Wagner points out: There's great tragedy here, but there's also excitement, humor, heroism even in weaklings, nobility even in villains, and, now and then, a taste of justice after all. It's a rare gift when a writer can invest his story with that much humanity.Martin's characters are multifaceted, each with intricate pasts, aspirations, and ambitions. Publishers Weekly writes of his ongoing epic fantasy A Song of Ice and Fire: [...] "The complexity of characters such as Daenerys, Arya and the Kingslayer will keep readers turning even the vast number of pages contained in this volume, for the author, like Tolkien or Jordan, makes us care about their fates." [...] Misfortune, injury, and death (including false death and reanimation) often befall major or minor characters, no matter how attached the reader has become. Martin has described his penchant for killing off important characters as being necessary for the story's depth: [...] "when my characters are in danger, I want you to be afraid to turn the page, (so) you need to show right from the beginning that you're playing for keeps".|$|E

5000|$|In Contact Music, Natalie Kaye noted [...] "The {{key thing}} is with this band is that they've never taken {{themselves}} too seriously. The pompous, blown-up music/lyrics are complemented by Paul and Steven's deadpan delivery, so it never becomes too overbearing to listen to. They pack a strong punch of wailing crescendos ("Self Destruct") and sweeping harmonies ("Hole in My Emotion") that deliver swiftly to the gut.

They awarded the game a score of 5.3 (mediocre). In a similarly mixed review, Vincent Lopez of IGN noted the graphical improvements over the previous game, its open-ended structure and the inclusion of GameSpy Arcade, but criticized its erratic AI and easy diffuculty, saying [...] "If, perhaps, you enjoy spending your money on things of value, such as say... well, any other game on the market, than <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>probably</b> take the twenty bucks and get yourself Superbike 2001, or at least {{something a little more}} valuable." ...|$|E

[...] Brian Lowry of Variety said that [...] "'Wars' should have been left in storage, indefinitely."

Given the state of affairs in the music industry today, I can see Ashes Remain having some success with their accessible sound.

[...] William Clark from Music Enthusiast Magazine similarly gave a positive review, saying [...] "“Frequency Unknown” is a-roller-coaster-ride-of-an-album", singling out the tracks “Cold”, “The Hands of God”, and “The Weight Of The World” as [...] "songs that shows the band embracing their progressive metal side, and contain some strengthy elements of the classic Queensrÿche vibe".|$|E
