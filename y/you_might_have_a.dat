2500|$|To {{help promote}} the album, Hogan {{appeared}} in the November 2006 edition of FHM, becoming the first FHM cover model under 21 years old.

2500|$|The hippies {{inherited}} various countercultural {{views and}} practices regarding sex and love from the Beat Generation; [...] "their writings influenced the hippies {{to open up}} {{when it came to}} sex, and to experiment without guilt or jealousy." [...] One popular hippie slogan that appeared was [...] "If it feels good, do it!" [...] which for many [...] "meant you were free to love whomever you pleased, whenever you pleased, however you pleased. This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. Group sex, public sex... homosexuality under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex... or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the open relationship became an accepted part of the hippy lifestyle. This meant that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{ought to}} have shot myself. Then people would have {{forgotten}} all about it, and <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance. Why didn't you marry Bobbie?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I hoped,' faltered Mrs Nickleby, 'that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{opportunity}} {{of doing something}} for your brother's children. It was his dying wish that I should appeal to you in their behalf.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should <b>have</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{school of}} your own," [...] said the lad. [...] "You know so much, {{and get on}} so well with boys. I should <b>have</b> thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been tutor at a college." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Do you?' said Miss Grandison. 'Well, I have {{sometimes}} thought that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> latent suspicion of that subject, too. I {{thought you were}} his confidant.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mine?" [...] {{said the}} mate. [...] "Well, {{as a matter}} o’ fact, I don’t like lending my clothes. I’m rather pertickler. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fit in THEM." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{you were}} around the post office," [...] said Mrs. Nelson. [...] "He even insinuates that my {{sickness}} was not real, but {{was put on}} so that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> excuse for being out {{at that time of}} night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gwendolen. True. In {{matters of}} grave importance, style, not sincerity is the vital thing. Mr. Worthing, what {{explanation}} can you offer {{to me for}} pretending to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> brother?

50|$|Aortic aneurysms {{are often}} {{discovered}} during an X-ray, ultrasound, or echocardiogram done for other reasons.

6000|$|... “All {{we caught}} hardly {{paid for the}} net,” Bethune replied. “On the whole, I don’t think we’ll smoke. Perhaps we had better not, so to speak, confuse our {{relations}} at the start.
