Another $5.4million in relief funds were provided by President Lyndon B. Johnson on February15, 1964. The United States Congress provided Guam with $60million, including $45million through federal loans, mainly to help rebuild the territory and promote expansion of the economy. Additionally, the storm brought {{about the end of}} military security on the island, which in turn aided economic growth. Within five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decision, Japanese tourism to the island dramatically increased, prompting a major {{increase in the number of}} hotels. In the long term, Typhoon Karen, along with other destructive storms, shaped the development of the island's infrastructure. It led to higher quality buildings and more efficient utilities that could withstand powerful typhoons. Since Karen, most buildings on the island have been constructed with concrete and steel.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{originally had}} high expectations of encountering a densely populated region that would quickly submit to Spanish rule, with the natives being parcelled out in encomienda to the conquistadores, effectively as slave labour. The fierce resistance to Luis Marín's expedition quickly extinguished such hopes. However, within two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> first reconnaissance, titles of encomienda were being issued {{and used as}} justification to seize slaves. Chamula was given to Bernal Díaz, and Zinacantan was given to Francisco de Marmolejo.|$|E

25|$|With no military, Carthage {{suffered}} raids {{from its}} neighbor Numidia. Under {{the terms of}} the treaty with Rome, such disputes were arbitrated by the Roman Senate. Because Numidia was a favored client state of Rome, Roman rulings were slanted heavily in favor of the Numidians. After some fifty <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> condition, Carthage had managed to discharge its war indemnity to Rome, and considered itself no longer bound by the restrictions of the treaty, although Rome believed otherwise. Carthage mustered an army to repel Numidian forces. It immediately lost the war with Numidia, placing itself in debt yet again, this time to Numidia.|$|E

TVR Engineering Ltd. was then formed on 30 November 1965, with Arthur as chairman. Arthur approached David Hives and offered him the position of General Manager and Senior Designs and Development Engineer, which David accepted. After two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> arrangement, Hives asked Arthur Lilley to appoint his son Martin as managing director whilst Hives went to America to talk to Gerry Sagerman about the importation of TVRs. This ultimately resulted in Sagerman establishing TVR Cars of America.|$|E

In 1966, Bittaker underwent further examinations by two independent psychiatrists, who declared {{him to be a}} borderline psychotic, highly manipulative individual who was resistant to acknowledging his responsibility for his actions. To one of these psychiatrists, Bittaker explained that his acknowledged criminal activities gave him a feeling of self-importance, although he insisted circumstantial matters decreased his ability to resist committing crimes. Bittaker was prescribed anti-psychotic medication. One year later, in June 1967, he was again released into society.|$|E
