500|$|NPR writer Linda Holmes {{challenged}} the show's assertions of female empowerment. Finding the episode itself [...] "silly {{and full of}} bad dialogue" [...] and [...] "cheesy more than offensive", Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience. She opined that [...] "you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered, no argument. It depends on what's {{going on in the}} rest of your life. But shaking a Bunny tail isn't enough to demonstrate empowerment if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem, and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage." [...] The series, she concluded, might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement. In concurrence, Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner's narration, deeming it as delusional and stupid, and criticize the series for its stance on feminism. She wrote, [...] "The show wants things both ways: to glamorize the Playboy 'lifestyle' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that, although Bunnydom had its hardships and rigors—no gum chewing, constant smiling—wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a poufy fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe." [...] Television Blend's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode, and asserted that [...] "The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at, but beyond that, there is a story beginning to develop and characters that, while not quite as original as they are nice to look at, are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and uninterestingm calling it a [...] "bad show, period. The writing was weak, the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once." [...] Alan Pergament, former critic for The Buffalo News, said of the show that [...] "the truth is [...] should have been a pay-cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he was 14, the Spanish tennis {{federation}} {{requested that}} he leave Mallorca {{and move to}} Barcelona to continue his tennis training.

You can do it from your home." [...] The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.|$|E

It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says.

[...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> therapy.
