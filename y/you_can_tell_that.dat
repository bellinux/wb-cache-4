According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies {{that the only way}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad."

500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as a hard worker, and stated that the [...] "first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he's a hard worker. When you look at him, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E

500|$|Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "It's not an {{especially}} scary movie, but right from the start, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> this Beauty and the Beast has a beauty of a bite." [...] John Hartl of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "It's exceptionally difficult to make an audience care for animated characters unless they're mermaids or anthropomorphized animals or insects, yet the Disney animators, with a big assist from the vocal talents of a superb cast, have pulled it off." [...] Gene Siskel, also of the Chicago Tribune, gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Beauty and the Beast is one of the year`s most entertaining films for both adults and children." [...] On their Beauty and the Beast edition of Siskel & Ebert, both Siskel and Roger Ebert proclaimed that the film is [...] "a legitimate contender for Oscar consideration as Best Picture of the Year." [...] Michael Sragow of The New Yorker gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's got storytelling vigor and clarity, bright, eclectic animation, and a frisky musical wit." [...] Eric Smoodin writes in his book Animating Culture that the studio was trying to make up for earlier gender stereotypes with this film. Smoodin also states that, in the way it has been viewed as bringing together traditional fairy tales and feminism as well as computer and traditional animation, the film's [...] "greatness could be proved in terms of technology narrative or even politics". Animation legend Chuck Jones praised the film, in a 1992 guest appearance on Later with Bob Costas he claimed he [...] "Loved it. I think it should have won ...

In a retrospective review of the game, Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett praised the game's soundtrack and called the multiplayer [...] "excellent." [...] Plunkett cited {{the release of the}} visually superior Quake a year earlier and Half-Life not long after as factors that led to the game fading into obscurity for most players. The Escapists Stew Shearer gave high marks for the game's villains; he called them [...] "fun to hate." [...] He stated that Outlaws [...] "isn't just Doom with cowboys; <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> the developers put some real hard work into making the player feel like they're the hero in a Sergio Leone flick." [...] The reviewer for Computer Games Magazine noted that while the game did not look as visually appealing as its competitors, other developers should [...] "show as much thought in level and multiplayer design." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jordan Pundik later accounted, [...] "I'm not {{comparing}} my band to the Beatles whatsoever, {{but their}} [...] records were simple songs {{about love and}} relationships, and people could relate to their songs because they understood what {{they were trying to}} say. That's what this record reminds me of. There's not weird metaphors. It's just straight up, wearing your heart on your sleeve." [...] Steve Klein emphasised the shift in mood from their previous album by stating, [...] "I think every record we make we try and capture a time period. When writing the songs for Coming Home it was more positive than negative. I felt on the last record, Catalyst, we were very negative lyrically. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> by the titles [...] "All Downhill From Here" [...] and [...] "This Disaster," [...] it was a heavier record. Coming Home on the other hand takes you to a different place. It’s the record I feel we’ve been waiting our whole career to do, taking everything people love about NFG and bringing it to the next level." [...] Bassist Ian Grushka further explained, [...] "We only really talk about personal things that have affected us first-hand, our songs are about emotions rather than some political agenda." [...] The song, [...] "When I Die" [...] was written by Gilbert about the death of his father. When initially writing the bridge section for the song, Gilbert found the experience emotionally draining and had to leave the studio in order to compose himself. Despite this, he maintains that while song is [...] "sad", it remains [...] "a good sad." [...] He reflected this in the album's liner notes by adding, [...] "It is a song about accepting death and finding the bright side of the situation. I'm no longer afraid to die because I have my father there waiting for me on the other side." ...|$|E
