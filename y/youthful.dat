5|$|Tarkington's {{accompanying}} essay {{published in}} the February 20, 1943 issue of The Saturday Evening Post was really a fable or parable in which <b>youthful</b> Adolf Hitler and <b>youthful</b> Benito Mussolini meet in The Alps in 1912. During the fictional meeting both men describe plans to secure dictatorships in their respective countries via the suppression of freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|A late {{piece of}} Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, {{was an early}} example of a studio premiere: its first {{performance}} was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his <b>youthful</b> sketch-books.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta's {{serpentine}} ornaments indicate asceticism {{while her}} <b>youthful</b> nude ornamented body has erotic overtones. Like all Hindu goddesses, she is decked in gold finery, symbol {{of wealth and}} fertility.|$|E
5|$|His <b>youthful</b> {{love for}} the fairy-tale element in Shakespeare prefigured his later {{expressions}} of Catholic liturgy. Messiaen {{was not interested in}} depicting aspects of theology such as sin; rather he concentrated on the theology of joy, divine love and redemption.|$|E
5|$|Robertson's {{men took}} many Turkish prisoners, {{including}} a senior officer of engineers {{who insisted that}} he would only surrender his sword to the Australian officer in charge. He was disappointed to discover that it was Robertson, a <b>youthful</b> major, but handed it over anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Kalika Purana {{describes}} Kaali as {{possessing a}} soothing dark complexion, as perfectly beautiful, riding a lion, four-armed, holding a sword and blue lotuses, her hair unrestrained, body firm and <b>youthful.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} the St Kilda Cricket Club, {{one of the leading}} clubs in Melbourne's pennant competition, gave the <b>youthful</b> Armstrong a trial. In the 1896–97 season, Armstrong fell out with St Kilda and {{returned}} to Caulfield. His last years of school were at University College.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has also}} been cited as a {{possible}} influence on Oscar Wilde for his 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, although this hypothesis is rejected by most scholars. The protagonist, Dorian Gray, acquires a magical portrait that ages while he remains forever <b>youthful.</b>|$|E
5|$|The two Voyager {{spacecraft}} {{made the}} first close-up images of Enceladus. Voyager 1 {{was the first to}} fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000km on November 12, 1980. Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution, but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters, indicating a <b>youthful</b> surface. Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse E ring. Combined with the apparent <b>youthful</b> appearance of the surface, Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus's surface.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} and oppressive system of rules regulating {{every facet of}} Victoria's life, it kept her in reclusive isolation most of the time, {{with the goal of}} making her weak, compliant and utterly dependent upon her mother and Conroy. The intention was for the Duchess to be appointed regent upon Victoria's (assumed <b>youthful)</b> ascension and for Conroy to be created Victoria's private secretary and given a peerage.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} <b>youthful</b> Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, the Soviet economy was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s. These issues prompted Gorbachev to investigate measures to revive the ailing state.|$|E
5|$|Daisy Fay Buchanan– an {{attractive}} and effervescent, if shallow and self-absorbed, young Louisville, Kentucky debutante and socialite, {{identified as a}} flapper. She is Nick's second cousin, once removed, and the wife of Tom Buchanan. Daisy {{is believed to have}} been inspired by Fitzgerald's own <b>youthful</b> romances with Ginevra King. Daisy once had a romantic relationship with Gatsby, before she married Tom. Her choice between Gatsby and Tom is one of the central conflicts in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying {{over the heads of}} her <b>youthful</b> top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|Hiroyuki Okiura, the {{character}} designer and key animation supervisor, designed a more mature and serious Motoko than Masamune Shirow's original portrayal of {{the character}} in the manga. Okiura chose to depict a physically mature person to match Motoko's mental age, instead of the <b>youthful</b> twenty-something appearance in the manga. Motoko's demeanor lacks the comedic facial expressions and rebellious nature depicted in the manga.|$|E
5|$|In 2013's free-to-play mobile game Snow White: Queen's Return (also {{known as}} Seven Dwarfs: The Queen's Return), an uncanonical {{continuation}} of the film, the Queen has survived the fall at {{the climax of the}} film and then reverted to her <b>youthful</b> form to cast a curse on Snow White and the dwarfs and their entire forest.|$|E
5|$|In March 1897 Arnold Heseltine died {{suddenly}} {{at the age}} of 45. Six years later, Bessie married a Welsh landowner and local magistrate, Walter Buckley Jones, and moved to Jones's estate, Cefn Bryntalch, Llandyssil, near Montgomery, although the London house was retained. The <b>youthful</b> Philip was proud of his Welsh heritage and retained a lifelong interest in Celtic culture; later he would live in Wales during one of his most productive and creative phases.|$|E
5|$|Jose Roberto Pulido Jr. (born April 25, 1971), known professionally as Bobby Pulido, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. He is {{credited}} for introducing Tejano music to a <b>youthful</b> crowd {{and became a}} teen idol {{and one of the}} most influential Tejano recording artists among Mexican American teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Laguna Loire {{appears in}} Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, {{where he is}} voiced by Hiroaki Hirata in the Japanese version and Armando Valdes-Kennedy in the English version. He is {{featured}} in his <b>youthful</b> Final Fantasy VIII appearance while his older and his Galbadian soldier forms. His costume of a knight is also available as downloadble content. Laguna was also planned to appear in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep {{as the head of}} Mirage Arena.|$|E
5|$|The one-sided {{relationship}} has been discussed in many books. Some question the accuracy of Kubizek's memoir, the only source for the story. Others accept {{that there is some}} basis of fact, but downplay the significance of the <b>youthful</b> infatuation, while yet others consider that it gives valuable insight into the development of Hitler's personality.|$|E
5|$|The {{pavilion}} did {{not prove}} to be durable enough for the interactive environment of Millennium Park. Kamin feels that the Pavilion was designed more for veneration like indoor museum works of art and outdoor sculpture on pedestals. However, skateboarders, avid fireworks spectators and <b>youthful</b> climbers {{have been part of}} the multiple causation of the decline of the pavilion that led to its closure during the week of August 10–14.|$|E
5|$|The playable protagonists in {{the game}} are Mario and Luigi, whose quest is to rescue the voice of Princess Peach, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. The voice is stolen by the game's antagonists Cackletta and Fawful. Throughout the game, Mario and Luigi must work with the Beanbean monarchy headed by Queen Bean. Both she and her son, Prince Peasley, offer Mario and Luigi assistance. The <b>youthful</b> Prince Peasley is a celebrity figure in his native Beanbean Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|This {{discretion}} and ambiguity {{is likely}} due to SEGA's desire to maintain Sonic's free and <b>youthful</b> nature, believing that committing to a relationship {{at this point in}} his life would simply be uncharacteristic of him. In addition, given that chasing Sonic and the ensuing antics are fundamental parts of Amy's character, their relation seems unlikely to change any time soon.|$|E
5|$|Uniquely, Ciomadul is a {{still alive}} volcano in Eastern Europe and its craters have a <b>youthful</b> appearance. There {{is always the}} {{possibility}} of renewed volcanic activity if the magma chamber has not solidified. Deep earthquake activity at Ciomadul occurs down {{to a depth of}} , indicating that the volcanic system between the magma chamber and lithospheric melts is still active. It {{is considered to be a}} potentially active volcano.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a <b>youthful</b> star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
5|$|Appearing on a {{document}} of May 28, 1239, the oldest seal of Munich has {{a picture of}} a monk wearing an open hood. While all seal impressions show the monk with the book in one hand and three outstretched fingers in the other, the monk has varied slightly, appearing in profile, then later full-faced and bare-headed. By the 19th century the figure was portrayed as <b>youthful</b> and became known as the Münchner Kindl or Munich Child. The coat of arms in its current form was created in 1957 and is still an important symbol of the Bavarian state capital.|$|E
5|$|At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty {{exhibited}} two paintings: Drunken Barnaby and The Coral Finder: Venus and her <b>Youthful</b> Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos. Drunken Barnaby is a {{scene of}} a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty would continue to paint women throughout his career. The Coral Finder is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts Venus Victrix lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references {{for which he was}} to become famous.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in {{his approach to}} problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official to the central government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his <b>youthful</b> vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Britten {{was born}} in the fishing port of Lowestoft in Suffolk, on the east coast of England on 22 November 1913, the feast day of Saint Cecilia. He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Robert Victor Britten (1878–1934) and his wife Edith Rhoda, née Hockey (1874–1937). Robert Britten's <b>youthful</b> ambition to become a farmer had been thwarted by lack of capital, and he had instead trained as a dentist, a profession he practised successfully but without pleasure. While studying at Charing Cross Hospital in London he met Edith Hockey, the daughter of a junior Home Office official. They were married in September 1901 at St John's, Smith Square, London.|$|E
5|$|During the Shiba {{siblings}} second year, Mayumi is {{succeeded by}} , a timid and <b>youthful</b> looking girl. Azusa {{has an interest}} in magic engineering and suspects Tatsuya is Taurus Silver. She is able to use a unique magic named after her, Azusa Dream, to forcefully pacify people. Mari is succeeded by , an impulsive and good-natured girl. She is engaged to , an androgynous and timid boy, and loves him dearly. Azusa is voiced by Saki Ogasawara, Kanon is voiced by Saori Onishi, and Isori is voiced by Sōma Saitō.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} career, Vonnegut {{decided to}} model his style after Henry David Thoreau, who wrote as if from the {{perspective}} of a child, allowing Thoreau's works to be more widely comprehensible. Using a <b>youthful</b> narrative voice allowed Vonnegut to deliver concepts in a modest and straightforward way. Other influences on Vonnegut include The War of the Worlds author H. G. Wells, and satirist Jonathan Swift. Vonnegut credited newspaper magnate H. L. Mencken for inspiring him to become a journalist.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Conant {{were hoping}} to harness Thomas's {{industrial}} expertise {{for the benefit of}} the project. They offered him a post as a deputy to Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, but he did not wish to move his family or give up his responsibilities at Monsanto. Instead he accepted the role of coordinating the plutonium purification and production work being carried out at Los Alamos, the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, and Ames Laboratory in Iowa. Chemistry and metallurgy at Los Alamos would be led by the <b>youthful</b> Joseph W. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|His {{first major}} work, the poem London, {{contains}} {{an early version}} of Johnson's ethics and morality system. Within the poem, he combined attacks on the politics of Walpole and the British government with the immoral actions of the common Londoner to form a general satire of 18th-century London society. Johnson compares London to the Roman Empire in its decline and blames moral and political corruption for its fall. Although Johnson did not start his literary criticism career until later, London is an example of what Johnson thought poetry should be: it is <b>youthful</b> and joyous, but it also relies on simple language and easy to understand imagery.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, Mary Shelley was {{party to}} a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, Mary Diana Dods, who wrote {{under the name}} David Lyndsay, {{to embark on a}} life {{together}} in France as man and wife. With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark about the details, Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her <b>youthful</b> beauty.|$|E
5|$|In 1858 Bennett {{returned}} to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned {{and did not}} arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his <b>youthful</b> compositions had done. He was Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge from 1856 to 1866. In that year he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was knighted in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and <b>youthful.</b> For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E
5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many of his stories, {{including}} his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a <b>youthful</b> attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
