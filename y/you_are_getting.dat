He {{tells him}} that {{the words of the}} Sophists go {{straight}} into the soul (psychē) and can corrupt a person straightaway. Socrates says that buying wisdom from a Sophist is different from buying food and drink at the market. With food and drink, you never know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting,</b> but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E

2500|$|In February {{he started}} {{a new series of}} nudes, this time of dancer Bertha Wardell. One of this series, of her {{kneeling}} body cut off at the shoulders, is one of Weston's most well-known figure studies. At this same time he met Canadian painter Henrietta Shore, whom he asked to comment on the photos of Wardell. He was surprised by her honest critique: [...] "I wish you would not do so many nudes [...] <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to them, the subject no longer amazes you ‒ most of these are just nudes." ...|$|E

He drew a picture of a woman to my back and made me stand in shameful position holding my buttocks." [...] "'Do you pray to Allah?' one asked. I said yes. They said, ' you. And [...] him.' One of them said, 'You are not getting out of here health, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> out of here handicapped. And he said to me, 'Are you married?' I said, 'Yes.' They said, 'If your wife saw you like this, she will be disappointed.' One of them said, 'But if I saw her now she would not be disappointed now because I would rape her.'
