5|$|For the game, Julio Jones set {{a school}} record with 221 {{receiving}} yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 217 yards set by David Palmer against Vanderbilt in 1993. Ingram and Richardson finished with 88 and 119 <b>yards</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground respectively. For his performance, left tackle James Carpenter {{was selected as the}} SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week.

The game also marked the first between Nick Saban and Derek Dooley who previously worked for Saban as an assistant coach at LSU and with the Miami Dolphins.
