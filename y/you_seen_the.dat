Davies said of the incident, [...] "In his apartment, Robert had been dancing with this black woman, and he said, 'I'm really onto a thing here.' And it was okay until we left at {{six in the morning}} and then I said, 'Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> stubble?' He said 'Yeah', but he was too pissed [...] to care, I think".|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks better than she has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1944 Journalists David Nasser and Jean Manzon made an unfriendly {{report of}} the Medium, which was {{published}} at [...] "O Cruzeiro" [...] Magazine. The Reporters pretended to be foreigners using false names {{in order to test}} whether Chico was a fraud; Later when Nasser and Manzon arrived home after the interview, they were surprised, as reported by Nasser in an interview with TV Cultura in 1980: [...] "From dawn, the Manzon called me and said, 'have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> book that Chico Xavier gave to us?'. I said no. 'So you see,' he said. I was in my library, I picked up the book and was written : 'To my brother David Nasser, Emmanuel'. He had made a similar dedication for Manzon.

2500|$|After the Liberation of Paris, {{the first}} post-World War II Salon d'Automne {{was to be}} held in the fall of 1944 in the newly freed capital. Picasso was given a room of his own that he filled with {{examples}} of his wartime production. It was a triumphant return for Picasso who had remained aloof from the art scene during the war. The exhibition however, was [...] "marred by disturbances that have remained unattributed" [...] according to Michèle C. Cone (New York-based critic and historian, author of French Modernisms: Perspectives on Art before, during and after Vichy, Cambridge 2001). On Nov. 16, 1944, Matisse wrote a letter to Camoin: [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Picasso room? It is much talked about. There were demonstrations in the street against it. What success! If there is applause, whistle." [...] One can guess who the demonstrators might have been, writes Cone, [...] "cronies of the Fauves, still ranting against the Judeo-Marxist decadent Picasso".|$|E

She is basically a scrubber, trying to reform herself. [...] "Nobody turns me on like Jack" [...] she says loudly in public, [...] "I can't make it with another man." [...] But she does, often...Class is what Pearl wants, and something she'll never pull off. Yes, she's attractive. She's also flash...Pearly the worker is no fool.
