5|$|During {{the first}} three {{quarters}} of 2016, sales of plug-in hybrids surpassed sales of all-electric cars {{for the first time in}} the country. A total of 17,074 units were registered, consisting of 7,678 all-electric cars and 9,396 plug-in hybrids. The plug-in segment achieved a market share of 0.7% of new car sales. The top selling models during the first eight months of 2016 were the Renault Zoe (1,836), BMW i3 (1,237), Tesla Model S (978), Audi A3 e-tron (908), and Volkswagen Golf GTE (852). The introduction of the federal government purchase e-bonus, in effect since May 2016, did not produce immediate effect on plug-in car sales until September 2016, when registrations peaked to 3,061 units, consisting of 1,641 all-electric cars, up 76.6% <b>year-on-year,</b> and 1,420 plug-in hybrids, up 36.8% <b>year-on-year.</b> Combined registrations of both type of plug-in accounted for 1.1% of new car registrations, allowing the German plug-in market share to pass the 1% mark for the first time during 2016.|$|E

5|$|Plug-in {{car sales}} in March 2016 {{achieved}} the best monthly plug-in sales volume on record ever, with 7,144 grant eligible cars registered. Registrations {{during the first}} six months of 2016 recorded the highest-volume half-year ever for plug-in electric car registrations. During the first three quarters of 2016 a total of 29,185 plug-in electric vehicles were registered, of which, 28,035 cars were eligible for the Plug-in Car Grant. Registrations consisted of 8,107 all-electric cars, up 16.6% <b>year-on-year,</b> and 21,078 plug-in hybrids, up 46.3% <b>year-on-year.</b> During this period, sales of plug-in hybrids oversold pure electric cars, with the latter more than doubling sales of battery electric models. During the first nine months of 2016 the plug-in car segment's market share reached 1.36% of new car sales. While overall new car registrations year-to-date increased 2.6% from the same period in 2015, total plug-in car registrations during the first nine months of 2016 increased 36.6% from a year earlier. The Outlander P-HEV continued to lead sales of the plug-in electric segment in 2016 with 9,486 units delivered. The Leaf remained as the top selling all-electric car with 4,463 units registered.|$|E
5|$|The ad {{was also}} a hit with the public. It has been {{credited}} by Guinness as being responsible for the substantial boost in sales experienced by the brand during {{the period in which}} it was broadcast. While revenues within the UK beer market declined by an average of −0.4%(−£19M), the <b>year-on-year</b> figures for Guinness showed an increase of 3.6%(+£13.3M). Between October 2005 and October 2006, Guinness achieved its highest ever volume (6.8%) and value (7.4%) shares, taking the position of market leader from Stella Artois. Diageo attributed the growth in no small part to the positive reception garnered by noitulovE.|$|E

5|$|Mugabe's {{government}} {{continued to}} make regular pronouncements about converting Zimbabwe into a socialist society, although did not take concrete steps in that direction. In contrast to Mugabe's talk of socialism, his government's budgetary policies were conservative, operating within a capitalist framework and emphasising the need for foreign investment. In office, Mugabe sought a gradual transformation away from capitalism and tried to build upon existing state institutions. From 1980 to 1990, the country's economy grew {{by an average of}} 2.7% a year, but this was outstripped by population growth and real income declined. The unemployment rate rose, reaching 26% in 1990. The government ran a budget deficit <b>year-on-year</b> that averaged at 10% of the country's gross domestic product. Under Mugabe's leadership, there was a massive expansion in education and health spending. In 1980, Zimbabwe had 177 secondary schools, but by 2000 this number had risen to 1,548. During that period, the adult literacy rate rose from 62% to 82%, one of the best records in Africa. Levels of child immunisation were raised from 25% of the population to 92%.|$|E

The decrease in domestic consumption has been attributed to the fiscal austerity, to the freeze on budget expenditure in the final months of 2011, to the failure of the efforts to implement economic reforms, to inappropriate financing, and to the decrease in exports.|$|E

25|$|Opinions have {{differed}} as to {{the precise}} mechanism by which water had built up in such quantity and then had suddenly been released with such devastating consequences. For many years the accepted explanation was that proposed by Joseph Vallot. It was believed that meltwater had drained through the glacier and become trapped as an intraglacial cavity, i.e. as an underground lake within a crevasse which itself had then become enlarged and widened by the water. However, recent re-analysis of historic photographs, accounts and contemporary meteorological precipitation data and field measurements, including radar analysis and magnetic resonance imaging, has presented an alternative and more plausible mechanism in which meltwater collected {{much closer to the}} surface (as a supraglacial lake) in a period when the glacier had a negative mass balance (i.e. was experiencing <b>year-on-year</b> melting and retreat). Prior to 1878 the glacier would not have been well-visited, so any surface lake could have gone unnoticed, and after 1878 the glacier experienced a positive mass balance (i.e. <b>year-on-year</b> accumulation of snow and ice) which would have hidden the lake from view until the eventual outburst flood in 1892.|$|E
