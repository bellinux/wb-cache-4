6000|$|... "Now {{you are all}} right, Tubbsky," [...] {{said the}} fun-loving Rover. [...] "My, but <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> know how to dress!" [...] he added, in {{affected}} admiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{think of}} everything, dad! That wouldn't have {{occurred}} to me. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> take to Crime in the most wonderful way. It seems to come naturally to you!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Mae: [...] "Why, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did.</b> I got {{marks to}} prove it. An' splinters, too." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Certainly</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> — <b>certainly</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “Four {{stones are}} missing,” {{announced}} the manufacturer. “And they are {{worth less than}} a thousand dollars. Dave, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> well.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there will}} be no harm in agreeing to forfeit him if you fail," [...] rejoined Wallace; [...] "for if <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> feed him, then your {{agreement}} to forfeit him will be a dead letter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pooh, nonsense!" [...] the squire said hotly. [...] "You {{have seen}} the world. You have {{travelled}} and mixed with men. You are fit to associate as an equal with anyone. Don't you deceive yourself; <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not deceive me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I congratulate you," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "though just at present, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not look a very {{formidable}} colonel. However, we will soon build you up; but don't {{try to talk}} now. I see the journey has been almost too much for you.|$|E
6000|$|Afterward Elbert Wing admired, [...] "Gee, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{have that}} poor Dago going, W. A. He couldn't make you out at all!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} here for my sake," [...] said Ransom, anticipating this insinuation; [...] "for you couldn't {{possibly}} have known I was coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, {{certainly}} not; but I {{was scarcely}} myself at that moment, and <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{your best to}} vex me about Fan and other matters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} well enough," [...] rejoined Sir Percy with a quaint laugh. [...] "I know what venomous {{reptiles}} you {{and those of}} your kidney are. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> owe your life at the present moment to the unfortunate girl whom you are persecuting with such infamous callousness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that a fact! Georgie, do {{you hear}} that? They get their fresh garden peas out of the garden, in Italy! By golly, you live and learn, don't you, Antonio, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> live and learn, if you live long enough and keep your strength. All right, Garibaldi, just shoot me in that steak, with about two printers'-reams of French fried spuds on the {{promenade}} deck, comprehenez-vous, Michelovitch Angeloni?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he answered. [...] "People might wonder, perhaps, {{how it is}} {{possible}} {{to fall in love with}} anyone whose expression so much resembles that of those statues in there," [...] pointing to a gallery which they were passing. [...] "You have no other fault. There is none, at least, to be found in your appearance. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> look, however, a little inclined to be faultily faultless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose you}} went out of {{kindness}} of heart to relieve the poor lady's mind,' she said. 'But <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> the wrong thing. You started something!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> Jenny. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> and I'm {{sorry to}} disturb you," [...] replied Peter meekly. [...] "I wouldn't {{have thought of}} doing such a thing, but I just didn't know who else to go to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{very well}} at tea," [...] she remarked. [...] "If you really are going to wait, make {{yourself}} as comfortable as you can. There are cigarettes and magazines in the corner there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Dodge is a {{profound}} republican, and is an advocate for rotation in language, {{as well as in}} office: I must accuse you of inconstancy, my dear friend, if I die for it. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not pronounce your words always in the same way, and when I had the honour of carrying you out this time six months, when you were practising the continentals, as you call them, you gave very different sounds to many of the words I then had the pleasure and gratification of hearing you use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} who he be," [...] said Joan de Tany, [...] "except {{that he be}} the most {{marvelous}} fighter and the bravest man {{it has ever been}} given me to see. He called himself Roger de Conde, but I know nothing of him other than that he looks like a prince, and fights like a devil. I think he has no quarrel with either side, My Lord, and so, as <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not make war on women, you will let us go our way in peace as we were when your soldiers wantonly set upon us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And still Smith couldn't see. He {{thought the}} charge was of violating social {{morality}} by pursuing a married woman, and tried to mitigate the offense by showing the woman encouraged him and by pleading: 'And after all, Mr. Forrest, a man is only a man, and I admit she made a fool of me and I made a fool of myself.' [...] "'Mr. Smith,' Dick said. 'You've worked for me eight years. You've been a foreman six years of that time. I have no complaint against your work. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{know how to handle}} labor. About your personal morality I don't care a damn. You can be a Mormon or a Turk for all it matters to me. Your private acts are your private acts, and are no concern of mine {{as long as they do}} not interfere with your work or my ranch. Any one of my drivers can drink his head off Saturday night, and every Saturday night. That's his business. But the minute he shows a hold-over on Monday morning that is taken out on my horses, that excites them, or injures them, or threatens to injure them, or that decreases in the slightest the work they should perform on Monday, that moment it is my business and the driver goes down the hill.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "I quite understand. I was not playing cribbage, but I was doing nothing very important. However, as <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> take me by surprise, perhaps you will excuse my coat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But that <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did,</b> for <b>you</b> {{spent the}} whole morning in Edgar's Buildings--it was the day your father's consent came--and I am pretty sure that you and John {{were alone in the}} parlour some time before you left the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{did that}} well," [...] said Archie, {{who knew that}} the amount of {{pleasing}} encouragement which he might hope to get from his friend, must depend on the praise which he himself should bestow. [...] "Yes; <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> bowl her over uncommon well." ...|$|R
60|$|Nay, the {{beginning}} of this hypocrisy--a desire to excel, a desire to be hearty, fruity, generous, strength-imparting--is a virtuous and noble ambition; and it is most difficult for a man in his own case, or his neighbor's, to say at what point this ambition transgresses the boundary of virtue, and becomes vanity, pretence, and self-seeking. You are a poor man, let us say, showing a bold face to adverse fortune, and wearing a confident aspect. Your purse is very narrow, but you owe no man a penny; your means are scanty, but your wife's gown is decent; your old coat well brushed; your children at a good school; you grumble to no one; ask favors of no one; truckle to no neighbors on account of their superior rank, or (a worse, and a meaner, and a more common crime still) envy none for their better fortune. To all outward appearances you are as well to do as your neighbors, who have thrice your income. There may be in this case some little mixture of pretension in your life and behavior. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>DO</b> put on a smiling face whilst fortune is pinching you. Your wife and girls, so smart and neat at evening parties, are cutting, patching, and cobbling all day to make both ends of life's haberdashery meet. You give a friend a bottle of wine on occasion, but are content yourself with a glass of whiskey-and-water. You avoid a cab, saying that of all things you like to walk home after dinner (which you know, my good friend, is a fib). I grant you that in this scheme of life there does enter ever so little hypocrisy; that this claret is loaded, as it were; but your desire to PORTIFY yourself is amiable, is pardonable, is perhaps honorable: and were there no other hypocrisies than yours in the world we should be a set of worthy fellows; and sermonizers, moralizers, satirizers, would have to hold their tongues, and go to some other trade to get a living.|$|E
5000|$|On another {{occasion}} Fitzgibbon objected that Curran was splitting hairs- surely the words [...] "also" [...] and [...] "likewise" [...] have {{exactly the same}} meaning ? [...] "Hardly, my Lord". Curran replied. [...] "I remember when the great Lord Lifford presided over this Court. You also preside here, but <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not preside likewise".|$|E
3000|$|If you {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} an inference of the kind not based on a causal relation, all of our activities, including eating and drinking, would be impossible, which <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not desire. We see in life {{that people who have}} experienced that hunger and thirst, for instance, are appeased by eating and drinking, proceed to adopt these means, expecting similar results; all these would be impossible. As a matter of fact, however, people who have the experience of eating and drinking infer, on the ground of similarity, that their hunger and thirst would be appeased if they ate and drank again, and proceed to act accordingly. (BUB. 4.3. 6.) [...]...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{blame you}} a bit, Esmeralda," [...] said Clayton, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> {{hit it off}} right when you called them 'lonesome' noises. I never {{have been able to}} find the right word for them but that's it, don't you know, lonesome noises." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{if you did}} {{not love}} our father before marriage, <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not fall in love with him afterwards," [...] broke in Mr. William, with a laugh. [...] "Fan and I {{remember}} how our honoured parents used to fight. Don't us, Fan? And our brother Esmond kept the peace." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} allow me, I {{will tell you}} exactly how the matter rests. <b>You</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> receive a promise {{conditional}} on Mr. Harding's refusal. I am sure you will do me the justice to remember that you yourself declared that you could accept the appointment on no other condition than the knowledge that Mr. Harding had declined it." ...|$|R
40|$|The four British Prime Ministers giving {{testimony}} to the Leveson Inquiry choose not to confront the media on issues of large-scale media abuse. "A missed opportunity", John Major said. "I think <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> fear the power being directed at you", Tony Blair declared. "We had no mandate", Gordon Brown asserted. The relationship between the media and politicians "has become too close", David Cameron stated. How did this closeness come about? This article discusses the political actors' decisions and non-decisions with regard to possible media policy strategies in Britain during four different Prime Ministers in the period between 1990 and 2012. The four cases examine media policy goals, values, contexts and alternatives offered for every Prime Minister. Their testimonies to the Leveson Inquiry are used for a comparison of media policy decision strategies during the examined period. Copyright © 2015 (Lars W Nord and Torbjörn Von Krogh).

6000|$|... "I should think," [...] Jonas suggested, [...] "that Isaac {{should go}} back, and break it to them, first, that I have returned; that I {{have been a}} slave among the Romans, and have escaped from them. He might {{say that he has}} {{questioned}} me, and that I said that <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not fall at the siege of Jerusalem; and that I believe that you, like me, were sold as a slave by the Romans.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, not now; <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> can't <b>do</b> it now. If I am {{not very}} much mistaken, the chance is gone. I think you'll find she engaged herself to that Frenchman tonight.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> shall <b>do.</b> I {{can hardly}} do {{anything}} {{in the way of}} festivities, at present; but {{there is no reason why}} you should not enter into anything that is going on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] he answered, [...] "but <b>you</b> <b>certainly</b> won't <b>do</b> it. Can't you {{understand}} that, unless we grow into our parts, {{they will never}} come naturally to us? Besides, we may be watched. You cannot tell." ...|$|R
