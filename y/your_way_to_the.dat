500|$|Jon Favreau {{said it was}} {{originally}} his intent to create a film trilogy for Iron Man, with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) becoming Iron Monger during the sequels. After a meeting between Favreau and various comic book writers, including Mark Millar, Stane became the main villain in Iron Man. Millar argued the Mandarin, whom Favreau originally intended to fill that role, was too fantastical. Favreau concurred, deciding, [...] "I look at Mandarin more like how in Star Wars you had the Emperor, but Darth Vader is the guy {{you want to see}} fight. Then you work <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time when lightning bolts are shooting out of the fingers and all that stuff could happen. But you can't have what happened in Return of the Jedi happen in A New Hope. You just can't do it." [...] Favreau also discussed in interviews how the films' version of Mandarin [...] "allows us to incorporate the whole pantheon of villains". He mentioned that S.H.I.E.L.D. would continue to have a major role.|$|E
500|$|On the April 18 of Impact Wrestling, James {{defeated}} Ms. Tessmacher {{to become}} the number one contender to the Knockouts Championship. James received her title match the following week, but was defeated by defending champion Velvet Sky. On the May 23 episode of Impact Wrestling, James defeated Sky after attacking her injured knee to become a three-time Knockouts Champion. The following week, James began portraying a villainous persona by calling out Velvet Sky, acting sarcastic and pompous towards her, and also did not help Sky when she was attacked by Gail Kim. James turned villainous on the June 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, when she attacked Sky when the latter {{said that she was}} ready for a rematch. James and Sky had their rematch on the June 27 episode of Impact Wrestling, where James retained her championship. On the July 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, James justified her actions by claiming that getting {{to the top of the}} Knockouts division requires [...] "clawing and scratching <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top"; James also claimed that [...] "no woman would ever be as great as her" [...] and she'll [...] "stand atop the division as the greatest Knockouts Champion of all time". On the July 25 episode of Impact Wrestling, James successfully defended the championship against Gail Kim. At the September 6 airing of Knockout Knockdown, James defeated Serena Deeb to qualify for the gauntlet battle royal finals, in which James was lastly eliminated by Gail Kim. James lost the Knockouts Championship on the September 19 episode of Impact Wrestling to ODB. Four days later, it was revealed that James had failed to come to terms on a contract renewal with TNA. James later stated in an interview that she technically wasn't under contract with TNA, but she did not confirm that she was gone. On November 15, 2013, James appeared in an interview on WWE.com, discussing her history with WWE and the possibility of making a return to the company. At the December 6 airing of World Cup of Wrestling, James was a member of Team USA, along with James Storm, Christopher Daniels, Kazarian and Kenny King. James was defeated by Team Aces & Eights' Ivelisse Vélez following interference from the other members of Aces & Eights. Team USA would go on to defeat Team Aces & Eights in a 5-on-5 elimination tag team match, in which James gained a measure of retribution by eliminating Vélez during the match. James and Storm were presented with the trophy afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2008, {{after the}} toured ended, Bassingthwaighte quit the band {{to focus on}} her acting and solo music career.

2500|$|DreamWorks and Paramount began a {{significant}} awards campaign for Dreamgirls while {{the film was}} still in production.

Three months later, twenty minutes of the film— specifically, the musical sequences [...] "Fake <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Top", [...] "Family", [...] "When I First Saw You", and [...] "Dreamgirls" [...] - were screened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, with most of the cast and crew in attendance.

2500|$|Curtis convinces James [...] "Thunder" [...] Early, {{a popular}} R star, and his manager, Marty, to hire The Dreamettes as backup singers. Though Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' first {{performance}} together is successful ("Fake <b>Your</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Top"), Jimmy is desperate for new material. Curtis convinces Jimmy and Marty {{that they should}} venture beyond traditional rhythm and blues and soul audiences and aim for the pop market. C.C. composes [...] "Cadillac Car" [...] for Jimmy and the Dreamettes, who tour ("Cadillac Car (On the Road)") and record the single upon their return ("Cadillac Car (In the Recording Studio)"). [...] "Cadillac Car" [...] makes its way up the pop charts, but a cover version by white pop singers Dave and the Sweethearts ("Cadillac Car" [...] (Reprise)) steals the original recording's thunder. Angered by [...] "Cadillac Car's" [...] usurpation, Curtis, C.C., and Jimmy's producer, Wayne, resort to payola, bribing disc jockeys across the nation to play Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' next single, [...] "Steppin' to the Bad Side". As a result, the record becomes a major pop hit. Conflict arises between Marty and Curtis when Curtis moves in on Marty's turf: Jimmy Early. Things become more complicated when Effie begins dating Curtis, and Jimmy, a married man, begins an affair with Lorrell ("Party, Party").|$|E

2500|$|In Odisha, {{the festival}} is known as Deepavali (Odia: ଦୀପାବଳୀ). The festival day starts with drawing rangolis {{in front of the}} house. The rangoli is drawn in the shape of {{sailboat}} on {{the ground in front of}} the house and is filled with items such as cotton, salt, mustard, asparagus root, turmeric and a wild creeper. Prasad is placed in the central chamber, over which a deepa of a jute stem with cloth wick is lit. This marks the beginning of Puja. Tarpanam – the ritual meant to invoke the spirits of the ancestors. Immediately after the dusk, all members of household gather for lighting Kaunria (pith of the jute plant). A lighted lamp is placed inside an earthen pot that is tied to a pole erected in front of the house. All the members then hold a bunch of jute stick in their hands and light them from the fire from the main deepa and raise the bunch towards the sky chanting the following verse. Then, in the presence of every member of the house, a bundle of the Kaunria is lit during the Puja and raised skywards accompanied with the chant: [...] "Badbadua ho andhaara re aasa aalua re jaa" [...] meaning [...] "O' forefathers come in the dark of the evening, we light <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heaven". The significance of the ritual is that we show respect to our ancestors who reinforce their absence from the physical world by our presence.|$|E
