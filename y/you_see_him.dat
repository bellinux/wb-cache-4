500|$|In 1997, McEntire headlined a {{tour with}} Brooks & Dunn {{that led to}} the {{recording}} of [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] with the duo the following year. This song was included on McEntire's If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Him</b> album and Brooks & Dunn's If You See Her album, both of which were released on June 2. Thom Owens of AllMusic reported in its review that both album titles were named nearly the same as [...] "a way to draw attention for both parties, since they were no longer new gunsâ€”they were veterans in danger of losing ground to younger musicians". The duet reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in June 1998 and spawned an additional three Top 10 hits during that year: [...] "Forever Love", [...] "Wrong Night", and [...] "One Honest Heart". In addition, If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Him</b> peaked within the Top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 8 and No. 2, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Suzuki recounts {{his youth}} and {{academic}} {{years as a}} student, professor, and genetics researcher. On his broadcasting career, Suzuki recalls early interviews that demonstrated an affinity for public speaking and the jobs {{that allowed him to}} travel the world. Regarding his personal life, he describes his relationships with his five children and the development of his two marriages. In a review in the New Zealand Listener, David Larsen observes: [...] "Step by step, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> thinking his way into full-fledged environmentalism: not because he's a natural zealot, but because he's an intellectually honest man brought face to face with evidence that our current economic and energy policies are digging our grandchildren's graves." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, Gravel was {{speaking}} to a crowd of supporters of Sami Al-Arian (who two years earlier had pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison for a charge of conspiracy in helping Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a [...] "specially designated terrorist" [...] organization) when he was caught on tape saying of Al-Arian's prosecutor, [...] "Find out where he lives, find out where his kids go to school, find out where his office is: picket him all the time. Call him a racist in signs if <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Call him an injustice. Call him {{whatever you want to}} call him, but in his face all the time." [...] Gravel was criticized for potentially involving the children of the prosecutor, and Al-Arian's family disavowed the sentiments.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, of course. You shall go up now immediately; and God {{grant you}} may be able to comfort him! But you know <b>you</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as <b>you</b> have done always. That is, <b>you</b> may <b>see</b> <b>him</b> as often as you please, but <b>you</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>him</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil he has!" [...] Douglas muttered, amazed. [...] "And {{how many}} more times have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> during the fortnight, I wonder?" ...|$|R
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{described the}} Joker's look as reflecting his personality, in that [...] "he doesn't care about himself at all"; she avoided designing {{him as a}} vagrant, but still made him appear to be [...] "scruffier, grungier," [...] so that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> move, he's slightly twitchier or edgy." [...] Nolan noted, [...] "We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [...] This corruption, this decay in {{the texture of the}} look itself. It's grubby. You can almost imagine what he smells like." [...] In creating the [...] "anarchical" [...] look of the Joker, Hemming drew inspiration from such countercultural pop culture artists as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop, and Johnny Rotten. Ledger described his [...] "clown" [...] mask, made up of three pieces of stamped silicone, as a [...] "new technology," [...] taking less than an hour for the make-up artists to apply, much faster than more-conventional prosthetics usually requires. Ledger also said that he felt he was barely wearing any make-up.|$|E
500|$|Brooks & Dunn {{collaborated with}} Reba McEntire to perform [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her", {{which was the}} lead-off single to Brooks & Dunn's If You See Her and McEntire's If <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>Him,</b> {{both of which were}} {{released}} on the same day. Arista Nashville and MCA Nashville, the label to which McEntire was signed, both promoted the single. This cut went to number one, as did If You See Hers next two singles: [...] "How Long Gone" [...] and a cover of Roger Miller's [...] "Husbands and Wives", which also became the duo's first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Dunn recorded the vocals for [...] "Husbands and Wives" [...] in one take. Also included on the album was [...] "Born and Raised in Black and White", the first song of the duo's career in which they alternated on lead vocals. The album's fourth single was [...] "I Can't Get Over You", which was a top five country hit. Following it was [...] "South of Santa Fe", which peaked at number 41 on the country charts and thus became the duo's lowest-peaking single there. In 2001, If You See Her reached double-platinum certification in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{interesting}} {{comments on}} Grossman in Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home. One is Dylan's: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a Colonel Tom Parker figure... all immaculately dressed, every time <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> You could smell him coming." [...] The other is John Cohen's: [...] "I don't think Albert manipulated Bob, because Bob was weirder than Albert." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{critical}} that Salk develop {{the trust of}} the U.S. public for his experiments and the mass tests that would become necessary. An associate of his noted, [...] "That boy really suffers when he sees a paralytic case. You look at him and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> thinking, 'My God, this can be prevented'." [...] An article in Wisdom notes that at one point, [...] "he even thought of giving up virus research": ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{really want}} to fight Prince Naseem..." [...] Mayweather continued, [...] "but {{hopefully}} I can face the winner of Casamayor (vs.) Freitas". Although neither fight materialised, Mayweather's opponent Diego Corrales would later hand Freitas (the winner of the Casamayor vs. Freitas fight) his first professional defeat and defeat Casamayor via controversial decision in a rematch of their first bout. Afterwards, Bob Arum was ecstatic about his new star. [...] "Better than Sugar Ray Leonard", he asserted. [...] "And did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> at those press conferences...?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated. [...] "What this guy wears is who he is. You {{want to get a}} sense of this guy as soon as <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> So I pick out the necklaces, the sunglasses. But the hat? The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Had <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> at Christmas <b>you</b> {{might have}} said so,' replied James; 'but now I see naught amiss; I had been {{thinking}} I had never <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> so fair and comely.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BEGGAR [...] Daughter! truly-- [...] But how's the day?--I fear, {{my little}} Boy, [...] We've {{overslept}} ourselves.--Sirs, have <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him?</b> [...] [Offers to go.] ...|$|R

2500|$|Among those {{referenced}} in {{the song}} was fellow Queensbridge-based rapper Cormega ("And night time is more trife than ever/What up with Cormega, did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> are y'all together?"). Cormega's rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s, before his release in 1995. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastizes a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin {{to tell me that}} he liked my style ... Words of wisdom from Nas, try to rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Music writer Susan Weinstein wrote that [...] "the literary technique Nas most strongly excels in is the one that would seem to be most pedestrian: rhyme", and cited [...] "One Love" [...] as the first display of Nas's [...] "formal inventiveness".|$|E
2500|$|He is {{to collect}} {{all of his}} bodily senses in concentration, and to cut himself off from all preoccupation and notions that inflict {{themselves}} upon the heart. And thus he is to turn his full consciousness towards God Most High while saying three times: [...] "IlahÃ® anta maqsÃ»dÃ® wa-ridÃ¢ka matlÃ»bÃ®â€”my God, you are my Goal and Your good pleasure is what I seek". Then he brings to his heart the Name of the Essenceâ€”AllÃ¢hâ€”and as it courses through his heart he remains attentive to its meaning, which is [...] "Essence without likeness". The seeker remains aware that He is Present, Watchful, Encompassing of all, thereby exemplifying the meaning of his saying (may God bless him and grant him peace): [...] "Worship God as though <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>Him,</b> for {{if you do not}} see Him, He sees you". And likewise the prophetic tradition: [...] "The most favored level of faith is to know that God is witness over you, wherever you may be".|$|E
2500|$|Bousman {{said they}} did not intend to have a twist ending, as {{distinctly}} as the previous films, [...] noting that [...] "I think most people will figure it out in the first 15 minutes of the film". Whannell added, [...] "What Darren and I struck for Saw III was to have an emotionally impactful ending. We wanted something that would almost make someone who was really invested in the story cry. We have Jigsaw, this character who's been so cold and clinical, he's been presented throughout the previous two films as someone who's very much in control. He's more like a reptile than a human being. In Saw III he becomes a human being. <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> crack. His veneer cracks and that was what was most important to us far and above any sort of gimmick or twist". Whannell also answered questions from previous films that were brought up by fans on the official Saw message board. As with the previous two films, the ending was only given to the actors who appeared in the final scene {{at the time it was}} filmed. At one point the script was stolen from Bousman's chair; however, it was returned before it was leaked online.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had <b>you</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> devour the {{raw meat}} of the lion, Esmeralda," [...] laughed Clayton, [...] "you {{would have thought}} him a very {{material}} angel." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Fool!--and slow {{of heart}} to believe! Where else would <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>Him</b> but in {{yourself}} {{and in the}} world? They are all things cognisable to you. Where else, but everywhere, would <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>Him</b> whom no man hath seen, or can see?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Decline? Can <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> declining? Just {{conjure up}} {{the picture in}} your mind, Jeeves. Scene, the drawing-room at Brinkley; Gussie wedged into a corner, with Aunt Dahlia {{standing}} over him making hunting noises.

6000|$|... "Cap'ain, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> small drop tar {{on water}} dere? <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> well, spose him one whale eye, well, den!" [...] and taking sharp aim at it, he darted the iron right over old Bildad's broad brim, clean across the ship's decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.|$|E
