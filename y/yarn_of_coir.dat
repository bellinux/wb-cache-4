40|$|Problem statement: The {{absorption}} characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber {{were analyzed}} previously. &# 13; Analytical method {{to predict the}} acoustical behavior <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber has already been developed. &# 13; However, compression effects <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber were not explored which might significant for acoustics&# 13; absorption during seat padding. In this study, compression effect on the sound absorption&# 13; characteristics <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber are demonstrated based on the previous analytical approach such as rigid&# 13; frame method with the modification in the physical parameters. Approach: The verification of the&# 13; estimated acoustical absorption coefficient in uncompressed condition using rigid frame Johnson-&# 13; Allard Model are shown for three different thicknesses <b>of</b> industrially processed <b>coir</b> fiber mixed with&# 13; binder latex. Measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption&# 13; <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber. It {{is well known that}} the absorption behavior of a porous material varies during&# 13; compression and affects the physical parameters. In these analyses, formulas proposed by Castagnede&# 13; are employed to predict the compression effect on the absorption <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber which takes into account&# 13; the modifications of the physical parameters during compression. Results: The agreement between the&# 13; analytical and measured results is justified for all three sample thicknesses in uncompressed condition. &# 13; Analyses on the acoustic behavior of material during compressed condition show that compression has a&# 13; substantial effect on the absorption <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber. It also indicates that the absorption <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber can be&# 13; enhanced by compressing the material. In addition, the absorption performances are compared by varying&# 13; the compression rate on material at uncompressed and compressed condition. Conclusion: From overall&# 13; analyses, it is evident that compression <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber can significantly change the absorption behavior of&# 13; coir fiber from the actual acoustical characteristics as estimated at normal condition. Moreover,&# 13; compressing the material might be considered as a possible approach to improve the absorption&# 13; coefficient <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} sound {{absorption}} capacity <b>of</b> natural <b>coir</b> fiber. Absorption coefficient <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber is calculated using Delany-Bazley model. Experiments are conducted in impedance tube {{to validate the}} analytical outcomes for three samples having different thickness. Increasing the thickness <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber enhances sound absorption and shifts noise absorption peak towards low frequency. Moreover, effect of air gap on sound absorption performance <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fiber has also been investigated. Increasing air gap thickness usually shifts the peak of absorption coefficient towards lower frequency. Then, the noise absorption <b>of</b> <b>coir</b> fibers with and without air gap is compared and shows that earlier one has greater absorption at low frequency than the later one. However, resonances can not be predicted using this technique.

Chemical characteristics showed that coir dusts are poor in nutritional value but high in nutrient retention capacity and it is highly resistant to environmental biodegradation. The available water capacity measured in coir dust aged from 0 to 20 years indicated that the quantity of available water increased from 122. 7 % in fresh to 222. 4 % in 20 years old material (g/g).
