On the character, a journalist from the Liverpool Echo said that [...] "she's got herself in to some ridiculous situations in the past, but mark Mercedes' words, {{she will not}} be pushed around". A writer for the Liverpool Daily Post commented that [...] "say what <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> Mercedes, but she's good at getting what she wants". The Wirral Newss Laura Cox called Mercedes' pairing with Riley [...] "Hollyoaks favourite on-off couple" [...] before dubbing the storyline [...] "dramatic". She added that the storyline [...] "kept viewers on tenterhooks".|$|E
500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, {{he rolled}} off the bottom to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>about</b> it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E

"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] {{began as}} two {{different}} demos, one variously called [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] and [...] "69" [...] (which eventually {{evolved into the}} B-side [...] "Lady with the Spinning Head") and an alternately arranged demo called [...] "Light My Way". Over {{the course of the}} recording sessions, U2 added various overdubs to the song, but producer Brian Eno believed these additions negatively impacted the track. Eno aided the group in editing down the song, and he explained his assistance as such: [...] "I'd go in and say, 'The song has gone, whatever it is <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>about</b> this song is not there anymore. Sometimes, for example, the song would have disappeared under layers of overdubs." ...|$|R
