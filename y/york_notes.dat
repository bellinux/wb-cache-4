500|$|Big Boi's {{lyrics are}} playful and irreverent, with clever wordplay and boasts, while {{incorporating}} non-sequiturs, pop culture references, and tongue-twisters. His rhymes are delivered through a fast, versatile flow and dexterous cadence. Rolling Stones Christian Hoard describes his flow as [...] "inimitably slick and speedy". Amos Barshad of New <b>York</b> <b>notes</b> his lyrics as [...] "playful, but his flow is stern and unpredictable". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker describes the album's mood as [...] "decidedly upbeat" [...] and writes of Big Boi's rapping, [...] "The musical DNA of Sir Lucious {{lies in a}} simple strategy that Big Boi has used for years: he often raps in double time, {{no matter what the}} tempo of the song is. This means that even the slower songs [...] don’t drag—Big Boi uses the space in the beat to provide another rhythm with his words". Frere-Jones describes him as [...] "simultaneously forceful and careful" [...] with his lyrics and compares his rapping technique to [...] "the clatter of a machine, like a lawnmower, where secondary rhythms whisper underneath the main beat [...] Big Boi is never laid-back when he raps: he defines wide-awake".|$|E

5000|$|In {{an artistic}} sense, as Lorraine <b>York</b> <b>notes,</b> [...] "Critics and readers feel a {{persistent}} need to 'de-collaborate' these works, to parse the collective text into the separate contributions {{of two or}} more authors". This is part of a tradition in criticism to view collaboration as a subset or aberrant kind of individual authorship - such that later readers could separate out by examining the collaborative text. Particular examples of this approach to criticism include Cyrus Hoy who studies authorship in the Beaumont/Fletcher plays.|$|E

50|$|The 1980s were {{framed by}} two {{large-scale}} works for chorus and orchestra based on Biblical texts, the 60-minute oratorio The Celestial Sphere for the 100th Anniversary of the Handel Oratorio Society in Rock Island Illinois of 1980 and Genesis (1989), jointly {{commissioned by the}} Minnesota Orchestra and San Francisco Symphony. Other major orchestral works during this period include the Rhapsody for Violin and Orchestra; the Third Piano Concerto, written for pianist Garrick Ohlsson; Movers and Shakers, the first work commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra for music director Christoph von Dohnányi; Bamboula Squared for computer-generated sound and orchestra (inspired by Wuorinen's work at Bell Labs); and The Golden Dance. Wuorinen was composer in residence with the San Francisco Symphony from 1984 to 1989. Major chamber works of the 1980s include his Third String Quartet commissioned to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College, The Blue Bamboula for pianist Ursula Oppens, the Sonata for Violin and Piano commissioned by the Library of Congress and premiered at the Library on an all-Wuorinen concert, String Sextet, New <b>York</b> <b>Notes,</b> Third Piano Sonata for Alan Feinberg, and trios for various combinations including three works for horn trio.In the 1980s Wuorinen began an association with the New York City Ballet {{which resulted in a}} series of works designed for dance: Five (Concerto for Amplified Cello and Orchestra) for choreographer Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux and Wuorinen's longtime colleague and champion Fred Sherry, Delight of the Muses based on works of Mozart and commissioned in honor of the Mozart Bicentennial, and three works inspired by scenes from Dante's La Divina Commedia for Peter Martins (The Mission of Virgil, The Great Procession and The River of Light). In addition to the Dante texts Wuorinen was influenced by the watercolors of William Blake. For the New York City Ballet Wuorinen also made a two-piano arrangement of Schoenberg's Orchestra Variations choreographed by Richard Tanner, and Martins created a ballet based on Wuorinen's A Reliquary for Igor Stravinsky. In 1985 Wuorinen was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship.|$|E
