500|$|A little {{matter that}} seems to have been {{overlooked}} by all of you is the opportunity to beautify the design of the nickel or five cent piece during your administration, {{and it seems to me}} that it would be a permanent souvenir of a most attractive sort. [...] As possibly <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware,</b> it is the only coin the design of which you can change during your administration, as I believe there is a law to the effect that the designs must not be changed oftener than every twenty-five years. [...] I should think also it might be the coin of which the greatest numbers are in circulation.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1967 and {{continuing}} until 1986, the Albanian government {{carried out a}} policy of [...] "bunkerisation" [...] that saw the construction {{of hundreds of thousands}} of bunkers across the country. They were built in every possible location, ranging from [...] "beaches and mountains, in vineyards and pastures, in villages and towns, even on the manicured lawns of Albania's best hotel". Hoxha envisaged Albania fighting a two-front war against an attack mounted by Yugoslavia, NATO or the Warsaw Pact involving a simultaneous incursion by up to eleven enemy airborne divisions. As he put it, [...] "If we slackened our vigilance even for a moment or toned down our struggle against our enemies in the least, they would strike immediately like the snake that bites you and injects its poison before <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|These traits come to {{the fore}} in Hi, Mom!s [...] "Be Black, Baby" [...] {{sequence}}. This sequence parodies cinéma vérité, the dominant documentary tradition of the 1960s, while simultaneously providing the audience with a visceral and disturbingly emotional experience. De Palma describes the sequence as a constant invocation of Brechtian distanciation: [...] "First of all, I am interested in the medium of film itself, and I am constantly standing outside and making people aware that they are always watching a film. At the same time I am evolving it. In Hi, Mom! for instance, there is a sequence where you are obviously watching a ridiculous documentary and you are told that and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of it, but it still sucks you in. There is a kind of Brechtian alienation idea here: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of what you are watching {{at the same time that}} you are emotionally involved with it." ...|$|E

I know that in order to play football again I will have to be accepted back by the players and staff of the West Coast Eagles and the AFL and I'm willing to fulfil any obligations imposed on me.

50|$|There are {{at least}} three types of awareness: agency awareness, goal awareness, and {{sensorimotor}} awareness, which may also be conscious or not. For example, in agency awareness <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> that <b>you</b> performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it. In goal awareness <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> that <b>you</b> must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it. In sensorimotor awareness, <b>you</b> may <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.|$|R

2500|$|In a 2012, {{interview}} with LeftLion magazine, Alan Moore {{was asked to}} put a figure on {{how much money he}} had turned down by refusing to be associated with these film adaptations. He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: [...] "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware,</b> you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{report of}} the {{convention}} in the New York Tribune for Europe inspired women in Sheffield, England, {{to draw up a}} petition for woman suffrage and present it to the House of Lords and Harriet Taylor to write The Enfranchisement of Women. Harriet Martineau wrote a letter to Davis in August 1851 to thank her for sending a copy of the proceedings: [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of the interest excited in this country by that Convention, the strongest proof of which is the appearance of an article on the subject in the Westminster Review ...I am not without hope that this article will materially strengthen your hands, and I am sure it can not but cheer your hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Saint Optatus clearly {{believed}} in a [...] "Chair of Peter", {{calling it a}} gift of the Church and saying, as summarized by Henry Wace, that [...] "Parmenian must {{be aware that the}} episcopal chair was conferred from the beginning on Peter, the chief of the apostles, that unity might be preserved among the rest and no one apostle set up a rival." [...] "You cannot deny that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that in the city of Rome the episcopal chair was given first to Peter; the chair in which Peter sat, the same who was head [...] that is why he is also called Cephas [...] of all the Apostles; the one chair in which unity is maintained by all. Neither do other Apostles proceed individually on their own; and anyone who would set up another chair in opposition to that single chair would, by that very fact, be a schismatic and a sinner".|$|E

2500|$|Michael Tye {{holds the}} opinion {{there are no}} qualia, no [...] "veils of perception" [...] {{between us and the}} referents of our thought. He {{describes}} our experience of an object in the world as [...] "transparent". By this he means that no matter what private understandings and/or misunderstandings we may have of some public entity, it is still there before us in reality. The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as [...] "a massive error"; as he says, [...] "it is just not credible that visual experiences are systematically misleading in this way"; [...] "the only objects of which <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes"; there are [...] "no such things as the qualities of experiences" [...] for [...] "they are qualities of external surfaces (and volumes and films) if they are qualities of anything." [...] This insistence permits him to take our experience as having a reliable base since there is no fear of losing contact with the realness of public objects.|$|E
