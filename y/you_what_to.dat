500|$|Deus Ex {{received}} critical acclaim, attaining a {{score of}} 90 out of 100 from 28 critics on Metacritic. Thierry Nguyen from Computer Gaming World said that the game [...] "delivers moments of brilliance, idiocy, ingenuity, and frustration." [...] Computer Games Magazine praised the title for its deep gameplay and its use of multiple solutions to situations in the game. Similarly, Edge highlighted the game's freedom of choice, saying that Deus Ex [...] "never tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. Goals are set, but alter according to your decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do, even though the game is always telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinter's {{aversion to}} any {{censorship}} by [...] "the authorities" [...] is epitomised in Petey's {{line at the}} end of The Birthday Party. [...] As the broken-down and reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg and McCann, Petey calls after him, [...] "Stan, don't let them tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do!" [...] Pinter told Gussow in 1988, [...] "I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." [...] The example of Pinter's stalwart opposition to what he termed [...] "the modes of thinking of those in power"—the [...] "brick wall" [...] of the [...] "minds" [...] perpetuating the [...] "status quo"—infused the [...] "vast political pessimism" [...] that some academic critics may perceive in his artistic work, its [...] "drowning landscape" [...] of harsh contemporary realities, with some residual [...] "hope for restoring the dignity of man." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Perry, {{the song}} is about [...] "falling {{in love with a}} foreigner". James Montgomery of MTV News also noted that Perry sings about a [...] "lover from {{different}} dimension". For its single release, the song was reworked to feature two verses from Kanye West, in which he raps about [...] "extraterrestriality". [...] "E.T." [...] opens with the first rap verse by West containing the lines [...] "I got a dirty mind / I got filthy ways / I'm trying to bathe my Ape in your milky way / They callin' me an alien / A big-headed astronaut". Then, using metaphors about extraterrestrials, Perry sings, [...] "You're not like the others / Futuristic lover / Different DNA". The chorus has Perry addressing her lover: [...] "Kiss me, kiss me / Infect me with your love and / Fill me with your poison", claiming to be [...] "ready for abduction". West contributes a second verse to the track, before Perry's final refrain, with heavily auto-tuned vocals: [...] "I know a bar out in Mars / Where they driving spaceships instead of cars". He finishes with a reference to the fictional animated character Shrek and lyrics about [...] "alien sex": [...] "I'mma disrobe you then I'mma probe you / See, I abducted you so I tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Ben Kaplan from National Post noted West's presence on the track was similar to the work on his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).|$|E
500|$|The series {{initially}} gained {{interest from}} major terrestrial networks {{such as the}} BBC and ITV. However, Max Beesley and Philip Glenister grew frustrated with the comments from the commissioning teams from the networks. Glenister stated that [...] "the problem with the BBC and ITV is more people coming in and telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do; we are grown up and big enough {{to know where the}} boundaries are". They ultimately settled for Sky, as the network was [...] "the one that we believed would let us do what we wanted". In January 2012, Glenister believed their decision to go with Sky was [...] "vindicated", as the terrestrial networks would restrict its content, violence, and language. He stated that the restrictions would not make the series [...] "the show it is and it wouldn't be the show we wanted to make". Head of Sky Drama Elaine Pyke had an immediate interest in the project, as she was [...] "immediately grabbed by how thrilling, scary, and funny it is", believing it to be [...] "the perfect show for Sky1". In a separate interview, Beesley stated: [...] "Andy Harries basically put the show out to a few of the networks and Sky said, 'Here's the money, go and make it and we'll give you notes later on, but really do have the freedom to make it,' which is great, and there's not a lot of that happens nowadays." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} core {{morphing}} concept but criticized its repetitive gameplay, awkward controls, easy combat, disorganized introduction, and overemphasis on tutorial. Bramwell (Eurogamer) wrote that though the fundamental idea was good, the repetitious combinations of elemental attacks were rarely novel and often laborious. The excitement of realizing a puzzle's solution, Bramwell said, was often ruined by the player's struggle {{to perform the}} task correctly. He wrote that the game's design constrained players and [...] "bred apathy". For example, tutorials followed the scenes {{in which they would}} have been useful, cutscenes left no puzzle solution to imagination, puzzle solutions were rarely revisited after their first use, and character dialogue overstated the importance of simple puzzles. Bramwell was [...] "desperate" [...] for the freedom to experiment without forced guidance. [...] "The game", he wrote, [...] "hardly ever stops telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Clayman (IGN) agreed that there was too much help but alternatively appreciated the continual challenge and activity density of Kameo level design, with townspeople interspersed within the level's action. He also liked to experiment in the Badlands as a break from the puzzles. Clayman found the game's combat easy but fun. He especially enjoyed the slowed time combat. Bramwell (Eurogamer) said that the [...] "relative pleasure" [...] of Kameo combat was ultimately worth little, as the player could use basic attacks and avoid most major upgrades throughout the whole game. Phil Theobald (GameSpy) added that character upgrades were required for maintaining interest in the gameplay, but that the game does not incentivize finding such combinations. Pfister (1UP.com) too found the gameplay balance and puzzle design insipid.|$|E

2500|$|Few singers of the English folk revival have {{attempted}} {{as much on}} record as Collins – an extraordinary combination of fragility and power.

2500|$|In the {{original}} interview {{first published in}} The New York Times, on 30 December 1988, Gussow quotes Pinter as stating: [...] "The character of the old man, Petey, {{says one of the}} most important lines I've ever written. As Stanley is taken away, Petey says, 'Stan, don't let them tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do.' I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{major theme}} {{of much of}} West's work was a question: when so many organisations use extreme {{violence}} towards evil ends, when {{and under what circumstances}} is it morally acceptable for their opponents to respond with violence?

"Out of Step", A Minor Threat {{song from}} their second EP, further {{demonstrates}} the said belief: [...] "Don't smoke/Don't drink/Don't fuck/At least I can fucking think/I can't keep up/I'm {{out of step}} with the world." [...] The [...] "I" [...] in the lyrics was usually only implied, mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song, like the updated version on the 1983 album Out of Step, which is slower, allotting a bridge where MacKaye explains his philosophy of straight edge, explaining that straight edge [...] "is not a set of rules; I'm not telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. All I'm saying is there are three things, that are like so important to the whole world that I don't happen to find much importance in, whether it's fucking, or whether it's playing golf, because of that, I feel... (chorus)". Some of the other members of Minor Threat, Jeff Nelson in particular, took exception to what they saw as MacKaye's [...] attitude on the song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the rest}} of your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage {{was born}} September 5, 1912, at Good Samaritan Hospital in {{downtown}} Los Angeles. His father, John Milton Cage, Sr. (1886–1964), was an inventor, and his mother, Lucretia ("Crete") Harvey (1885–1969), worked intermittently {{as a journalist}} for the Los Angeles Times. The family's roots were deeply American: in a 1976 interview, Cage mentioned that George Washington was assisted by an ancestor named John Cage in the task of surveying the Colony of Virginia. Cage described his mother as a woman with [...] "a sense of society" [...] who was [...] "never happy", while his father is perhaps best characterized by his inventions: sometimes idealistic, such as a diesel-fueled submarine that gave off exhaust bubbles, the senior Cage being uninterested in an undetectable submarine; others revolutionary and against the scientific norms, such as the [...] "electrostatic field theory" [...] of the universe. John Milton Sr. taught his son that [...] "if someone says 'can't' that shows <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] In 1944–45 Cage wrote two small character pieces dedicated to his parents: Crete and Dad. The latter is a short lively piece that ends abruptly, while [...] "Crete" [...] is a slightly longer, mostly melodic contrapuntal work.|$|E

2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> do. It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E
