The Teas Nursery business was either {{going to move to}} a new location or be liquidated. In December the Rubenstein family bought the Teas property; the family planned to donate it to the City of Bellaire for community purposes. The Teas property has two historic buildings. Scott Rubenstein, who handled negotiations for the Rubenstein family, described the Teas lot as [...] "the last largely undeveloped tract in the city and, frankly, in the inner loop of the city of Houston where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that can be used by people from all around the city." [...] Mayor of Bellaire Cindy Seigel said [...] "I am just thrilled we’ll be able to preserve a historical property that is an important piece of Bellaire’s history." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Burger King began {{licensing}} its logo {{and items}} to outside companies for non-Burger King products. A licensed products company, Broad Street Licensing Group, and its manufacturing partner, the Inventure Group, introduced the first {{products in the}} fall of that year: flavored potato crisps in two flavors, flame-broiled burger and French fries with ketchup. Inventure added a third flavor, onion rings, in 2008. A second licensed product, the company's child-oriented BK Fresh Apple Fries, was licensed for sale in supermarkets in 2009 to the Cruch Pak company. The company stated that while the products are important in providing brand identity, they will not be concentrating their resources on them, and will be investing the licensing fees into the company's marketing fund. Industry pundits have criticized the company for this scheme, with Rob Frankel, author of the book The Revenge of Brand X, stating [...] "just because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> does not mean you should." ...|$|E

Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true.

2500|$|Blackman {{attended}} a Baptist church during her teenage years, but became {{a follower of}} the Bahá'í Faith {{at the age of}} 18; she also started studying Kabbalah in the 2000s. Blackman cultivates spirituality in her musicianship. [...] "I believe that music is so sacred that once you're playing music you are doing the work of prayer, whether you're conscious of it or not, because you have a focused intent", says Blackman. [...] "You transcend, because you're crossing barriers {{that a lot of people}} and even us as musicians don't normally venture to, because we don't think about it. When you can learn to move those energies, even if they're sad, into something that is of benefit, like focusing on bringing light to people who are listening, or just to the universe in general, then <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> good with it.

Keneally disputed claims that she was never paid for her contributions, [...] "not least because I had {{recently}} sent Emilie a check myself." [...] He also confirmed with Spielberg's office that payment had been sent from there. Filmmaker Michael Haneke criticized the sequence in which Schindler's women are accidentally sent off to Auschwitz and herded into showers: [...] "There's a scene in that film when we don't know if there's gas or water coming out in the showers in the camp. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> only <b>do</b> <b>something</b> like that with a naive audience like in the United States.

He received a letter from his wife which mentioned the American airmen's plight: [...] "there are hundreds... <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for them?

Sometimes I try to negotiate, and sometimes I just lose my temper (Grace).|$|R
500|$|Bono is {{credited}} as the album's sole lyricist. Thematically, the album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States against the band's deep {{fascination with the}} country, its open spaces, freedoms, and ideals. Anger is directed particularly at the perceived greed of the Ronald Reagan administration and its foreign policy in Central America. Bono said, [...] "I started to see two Americas, the mythic America and the real America", hence the album's working title, The Two Americas. Having toured the US extensively in the past, the group were inspired by the country's geography. As such, the desert, rain, dust, and water appear as lyrical motifs throughout the record. In many cases, the desert {{is used as a}} metaphor for [...] "spiritual drought". One track that chiefly represents these themes is [...] "In God's Country", which critic Barbara Jaeger interpreted as addressing America's role as the [...] "promised land". Clayton explained the impact of the desert imagery: [...] "The desert was immensely inspirational to us as a mental image for this record. Most people would take the desert on face value and think it's some kind of barren place, which of course is true. But in the right frame of mind, it's also a very positive image, because <b>you</b> <b>can</b> actually <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with blank canvas, which is effectively what the desert is." ...|$|R
5000|$|Though he had {{initially}} {{wanted to avoid}} the rhythm and blues market, Gaye figured it was his only way to establish himself as a crossover pop act, and reluctantly agreed to record a song in that style. Hiring Stevenson and Gordy, Gaye wrote and composed a song that fit his sometimes moody attitude, titling it [...] "Stubborn Kind of Fellow" [...] after Berry Gordy suggested some piano chord changes to Gaye. In a 1982 interview conducted in Europe, Gaye recalled [...] "Berry heard me playing it on the piano. He came over and he {{said something to the}} effect of, 'I like that melody but <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> else with it.' That was my first power encounter with him. I remember he wanted me to change some chords. I had a brief argument with him as to why I thought it should remain the way I wrote it. In any event, I changed things his way." ...|$|R

40|$|Feeling drowsy at work? Despite {{findings}} that poor {{indoor air quality}} causes cognitive performance decline, the average office-worker has no access to information {{on the quality of}} air in the room until it becomes poor enough to cause discomfort. In this talk, I discuss our user-centred research from the REFRESH project, which joins the dots between the individual and social factors that affect perception of IAQ, and the human physiological responses to changes in air quality. This involves (1) physiological measurement such as (EEG) to detect the effect of air quality on drowsiness, (2) qualitative methods to understanding the social factors which influence air quality in offices, and (3) designing ambient technology which visualises CO 2 of an office- an indicator of indoor air quality. At the end of the talk you will have some actions for how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> detect- and <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about- the air quality of your office; how easily <b>you</b> <b>can</b> incorporate qualitative methods into your research and use technology to understand your users’ needs...|$|R
40|$|In {{your first}} lecture, LT 1 is nearly full. Hundreds of {{students}} are looking at you, waiting to learn from <b>you.</b> But how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> possibly engage with so many students all at once? How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> give quick and constructive feedback to students in this environment? How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> avoid the “stand-and-deliver” lecture? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that the students will value, and is actually helpful to their learning? Ah, easy. “Welcome to class, “ you say. “Please turn on your mobile phone. ” Classroom Response Systems (CRS) have been available for some time, with encouraging results for student learning outcomes (see Kay and LeSage, 2009; Barnett, 2006). Most CRS use dedicated devices (often called `clickers’) that can be costly. Recently, some textbook publishers have developed CRS that enable students to use their mobile phones as voting devices (such as Wiley’s ClickOn system: [URL] but are tied to that publisher. In this presentation, we discuss using a mobile-phone-based CRS that is free to use, free to implement, and is not tied to any textbook publisher. We briefly report on the encouraging results of using this CRS at USC, {{and the results of}} an online student survey evaluating the CRS...|$|R
40|$|The Himalaya, all {{the experts}} agree, face serious {{environmental}} problems; they {{are caught in}} a downward spiral. The rate of fuelwood consumption, for instance, is asserted to be far {{in excess of the}} rate at which the forest grows. However, the expert estimates of these two rates vary by such immense factors that we simply cannot say whether the spiral, if it exists, is upward or downward. There is something severely wrong with the Himalaya but we cannot tell what it is. The traditional response - a call for more research - has not worked and the perceived urgency of the situation calls for action now, before it is too late. The challenge is to furnish a non-arbitrary strategic framework for that action. Putting such a framework together calls for a new synthesis of hard and soft science. When, try as you may, you cannot find out what the facts in the Himalaya really are <b>you</b> <b>can</b> still <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> find out why it is that you cant find out what they are. The authors (a cultural anthropologist, an ecologist-turned-historian and a natural resource economist) begin by showing how it is the institutions and their contradictory problem definitions - the international agencies insisting that there are too many people; the people themselves insisting that that there is not enough food - that continually muddle the hard scientists efforts to pinpoint what is really going on and why. In an important sense, they argue, the institutions "are" the facts. They then go on to show how a combination of hard and soft approaches - obtainable physical facts correlated with obtainable institutional facts - can provide a framework for action - immediate action. This, because it anticipates the grassroots obstacles that all too often get in the way of conventionally designed development programmes, actually improves on the sorts of hard-fact dominated frameworks that are unobtainable in the Himalaya anyway. The uncertainty is itself the key. That is the surprising and hopeful, message of this book...|$|R
