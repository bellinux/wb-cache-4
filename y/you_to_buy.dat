He released a new album carrying the sarcastic title Jesus Wants <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Buy</b> This Record in 2001; which was initially made available at Cornerstone Festival. The album was noted for its several new songs, including the gothic worship song [...] "In Your Hands."

Healy co-worked up with Saviour Machine frontman Eric Clayton on a remake of the Daniel Amos' early 1980s song [...] "Through the Speakers", and included covers of two songs from the 1970s: The Bee Gees' mournful ballad [...] "I Started a Joke" [...] and Cheap Trick's light-hearted rock song [...] "Surrender", with the original's reference to Kiss replaced by Cheap Trick. Christian rock group The 77's made guest appearances on live versions of early songs [...] "Christmas" [...] and [...] "Angeline", and Healy went acoustic on live recordings of [...] "Hello" [...] and [...] "Beautiful World".|$|E
