25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. You must have already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. You should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

The most prominent are Rob Andrew, brothers Rory Underwood and Tony Underwood, and Mathew Tait who have all played for England at international level. Former headmaster David Ewart explained the school's rugby ethos: [...] "We believe the game breeds important life skills in those who play it. It's a civilising game and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gentlemen on the pitch, as well as off." [...] During the period 1970 to 1995 no other British school produced as many England international players. In 2012 Tim Visser described his former school's rugby programme as [...] "brilliant".|$|E

[...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It was just such a 'this isn't right for you right now.

500|$|The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) {{announced}} in September 2009 that it [...] " [...] to prioritise" [...] and {{would most likely}} be sending a weakened squad to tour Bangladesh. The press theorised that possible candidates to be rested included captain Andrew Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad and James Anderson. When the squad was officially {{announced in}} January 2010, only Strauss and Anderson were omitted from the touring squad. The reason given for Anderson's break was to give him opportunity to undergo a specialist review and rehabilitation for a chronic injury to his right knee, to enable {{him to return to}} full fitness for the 2010 ICC World Twenty20. The decision to rest Strauss was rationalised by national selector Geoff Miller as [...] "the selectors feel it is important that he takes a break ahead of an extremely busy programme of international cricket". This decision was not universally accepted, with former England captains Ian Botham and Michael Atherton among those who spoke out against the move; Botham claimed: [...] "As captain <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there with your team ... I think it’s a major mistake." ...|$|E

5000|$|Dirk Gently (real name Svlad Cjelli) {{operates}} a Holistic Detective Agency {{based on the}} [...] "fundamental interconnectedness of all things". To solve cases, Dirk relies on random chance methods for example [...] "Zen navigation" [...] (following people or vehicles who look like they {{know where they are}} going, in the hope that while you might not get <b>to</b> where you <b>were</b> originally headed, you might still end up somewhere <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> even if <b>you</b> didn't originally know <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there.) or throwing a dart at a board of words to select the direction of his detection. By following up on apparently random occurrences and whims, Dirk discovers connections between seemingly unrelated cases and often produces surprising results. He claims that he follows the principles of quantum mechanics (although it is implied when he speaks to an expert in these fields that he doesn't really understand them); most people suspect he is just a conman and he rarely gets paid by clients and is therefore in almost permanent financial difficulty.|$|R
500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was pretty confident {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time." [...] Da Matta stated he did not want to lead the race with two laps remaining because of the draft and believed there would be a larger battle for the victory. Second-place finisher Papis said his team were planning a new strategy after the race's distance was reduced and had been looking forward to further racing and congratulated Da Matta on winning the race. Tagliani, who finished in third, revealed that he lifted from his accelerator pedal and ran in fifth gear on the backstraight and stated it was about conserving fuel and avoiding being caught in any incidents. He said the final ten laps felt like qualifying lap times and felt the race before then was [...] "kind of boring, just driving around and around." ...|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode, {{and gave it a}} D. He called the visual effects [...] "hilariously bad," [...] likening the CGI to [...] "a '90s computer game." [...] Sava added, [...] "As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn’t that these kids can’t act (although that might be the problem), it’s that the writing for their characters is horrible... This week’s episode is straight-up children’s television, and not in the way that it can be enjoyed by all ages. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a child to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'" [...] Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel [...] "parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too." [...] Orel felt the episode seemed [...] "like a demented episode of Chopped," [...] and called the gingerbread house [...] "just like it should , colorful and candylike." ...|$|E
500|$|According {{to music}} {{journalist}} Jon Pareles, Songs of Innocence features U2 strictly playing rock music, particularly arena rock, whose elaborate production [...] "puts a higher gloss, {{and sometimes a}} heavier fuzz tone, on the band's instantly recognizable sound". Thematically, Songs of Innocence revisits the group members' youth in Ireland in the 1970s, touching on childhood memories, loves, and losses, while paying tribute to their musical inspirations. Bono described it as [...] "the most personal album we've written". In an interview with Gus Wenner of Rolling Stone, he said, [...] "Let's {{try to figure out}} why we wanted to be in a band, the relationships around the band, our friendships, our lovers, our family. The whole album is first journeys—first journeys geographically, spiritually, sexually." [...] He said that he felt challenged to write about more personal themes and why he wanted to be in a rock band after producer Jimmy Iovine told him, [...] "The person <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> to make the album that you wanna make {{is a long way from}} where you live." [...] Rolling Stone deemed Songs of Innocence as having the feeling of a concept album, a notion that Bono rejected, although he did opine it was lyrically cohesive in a way the group's other records were not. For the album, the group revisited adolescent musical influences, such as punk rock band Ramones and electronic music group Kraftwerk, for inspiration.|$|E

[...] Before tournaments, Hendrixson describes himself as [...] "nervous" [...] and [...] "anxious," [...] but when finally sitting down and getting into the game, [...] "all of that melts away."

500|$|He wrote [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] {{after the}} death of his uncle. The two were not on {{speaking}} terms after his uncle forced him out of his home before Cudi could find another living situation. A [...] bitter Cudi never apologized to him before his death, which he now regrets. Other songs on the album expand upon themes discussed in that single. Back in 2007, Drake, who was one of Cudi's first supporters, had shown interest in doing an official remix of [...] the song with him. However, Cudi chose against it since he was not interested in working with people who are in the [...] "same creative realm" [...] as him and because he was in the midst of creating his own works. Beginning in the fourth grade, and getting more tense after his father's death when he was 11, Cudi began dreaming of his own death (which usually was an automobile accident). He channeled these things into his material. Speaking to BlackBook in May 2009, Cudi said of the album and its content, [...] "Each song is a message. All the hooks are stadium-worthy, crowd sing-along, powerful joints that I can't wait for people to hear in stadium magnitude. My album definitely needs to be heard loudly, but it's also a great album if you're smoking and you need to go to sleep. So far I have the lineup of how I want the first seven tracks on my album and if I play the first seven from the beginning to the end, I'm zoned out and it's the best trip ever. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high to appreciate the instrumentation and how everything is put together on the album—but you don't have to be high just to enjoy it in general." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of the {{television}} broadcast were highly positive, praising its close attention to detail in parodying the original film. Jason Hughes of TV Squad found the episode to be [...] "incredibly ," [...] going on to note, [...] "As much as we fans love the films, we know they're not perfect, and that they're downright ridiculous in places. Family Guy managed to point out virtually all of those moments in this parody." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found the episode to have [...] "a lot of solid laughs", and admired the show for [...] "throwing itself into these outsized movie parody things". Critics of the DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases gave the episode high praise {{for its ability to}} accurately reflect the original film. Cindy White of IGN gave the episode an 8 out of 10, noting that it [...] "lives up to its predecessor and, like the film it spoofs, arguably exceeds it in some ways". John Scott Lewinski of Wired praised the faithfulness to the original film, saying that it [...] "becomes clear that MacFarlane and his writers are legit Star Wars fans". Adam Rosenberg of MTV Movies Blog called the episode [...] "hilarious" [...] and Paul Semel of Metromix praised the episode for featuring [...] "some very ribald humor", and [...] " [...] the original movie with some rather insightful moments". In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Ramsey Isler of IGN listed [...] "Something, Something, Something, Dark Side" [...] as being a [...] "pretty entertaining parody, and a safe way to wrap things up." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number six on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "almost as good as the first , but much better than the third [...]" [...] He added that the episode is [...] "a bit bizarre on paper, but it works", and noted that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fan of the Star Wars franchise to understand the jokes.|$|E
