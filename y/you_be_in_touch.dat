6000|$|Now, {{let us look}} at {{the light}} which we get from the spirit guides upon this {{question}} of Christianity. Opinion is not absolutely uniform yonder, any more than it is here; but reading a number of messages upon this subject, they amount to this: There are many higher spirits with our departed. They vary in degree. Call them [...] "angels," [...] and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with old religious thought. High above all these is the greatest spirit of whom they have cognizance--not God, since God is so infinite that He is not within their ken--but one who is nearer God and to that extent represents God. This is the Christ Spirit. His special care is the earth. He came down upon it at a time of great earthly depravity--a time when the world was almost as wicked as it <b>is</b> now, <b>in</b> order to give the people the lesson of an ideal life. Then he returned to his own high station, having left an example which is still occasionally followed. That is the story of Christ as spirits have described it. There is nothing here of Atonement or Redemption. But there is a perfectly feasible and reasonable scheme, which I, for one, could readily believe.|$|R

This week there <b>was</b> here <b>in</b> this place {{a man who}} claimed to be the {{original}} Jessie James. He exhibited himself at a picture show here. I talked with him at a hotel here for over an hour, and he talked very convincingly that he was the original Jessie James of outlaw fame. He is an old man of 90 years old, and he talked like he was telling honest facts within his experience. I never did dream that I would ever see Jessie James. I know that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with all such, and I would be glad to hear from you about this, and thanking you. Dear X, Your letter of March 10, 1949 has <b>been</b> received. <b>In</b> response to your inquiry, the Encyclopedia Britannica indicates that Jesse James, the notorious outlaw, was born on September 5, 1847 in Clay County, Missouri.

2500|$|Tye {{proposes that}} phenomenal {{experience}} has five basic elements, {{for which he}} has coined the acronym PANIC—Poised, Abstract, Nonconceptual, Intentional Content. It is [...] "Poised" [...] {{in the sense that}} the phenomenal experience is always presented to the understanding, whether or not the agent is able to apply a concept to it. Tye adds that the experience is [...] "maplike" [...] in that, in most cases, it reaches through to the distribution of shapes, edges, volumes, etc. in the world—you may not be reading the [...] "map" [...] but, as with an actual map there is a reliable match with what it is mapping. It is [...] "Abstract" [...] because it is still an open question in a particular case whether <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> with a concrete object (someone may feel a pain in a [...] "left leg" [...] when that leg has actually been amputated). It is [...] "Nonconceptual" [...] because a phenomenon can exist although one does not have the concept by which to recognize it. Nevertheless, it is [...] "Intentional" [...] in the sense that it represents something, again whether or not the particular observer is taking advantage of that fact; this is why Tye calls his theory [...] "representationalism". This last makes it plain that Tye believes that he has retained a direct contact with what produces the phenomena and is therefore not hampered by any trace of a [...] "veil of perception".|$|R

Subsequently, they planned to continue at Vizianagaram.|$|R

40|$|Tooteko {{is a smart}} {{ring that}} allows to {{navigate}} any 3 D surface with your finger tips and get in return an audio content that <b>is</b> relevant <b>in</b> relation to {{the part of the}} surface <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>touching</b> <b>in</b> that moment. Tooteko can be applied to any tactile surface, object or sheet. However, in a more specific domain, it wants to make traditional art venues accessible to the blind, while providing support to the reading of the work for all through the recovery of the tactile dimension in order to facilitate the experience of contact with art that is not only "under glass. " The system is made of three elements: a high-tech ring, a tactile surface tagged with NFC sensors, and an app for tablet or smartphone. The ring detects and reads the NFC tags and, thanks to the Tooteko app, communicates in wireless mode with the smart device. During the tactile navigation of the surface, when the finger reaches a hotspot, the ring identifies the NFC tag and activates, through the app, the audio track that is related to that specific hotspot. Thus a relevant audio content relates to each hotspot. The production process of the tactile surfaces involves scanning, digitization of data and 3 D printing. The first experiment was modelled on the facade of the church of San Michele in Isola, made by Mauro Codussi in the late fifteenth century, and which marks the beginning of the Renaissance in Venice. Due to the absence of recent documentation on the church, the Correr Museum asked the Laboratorio di Fotogrammetria to provide it with the aim of setting up an exhibition about the order of the Camaldolesi, owners of the San Michele island and church. The Laboratorio has made the survey of the facade through laser scanning and UAV photogrammetry. The point clouds were the starting point for prototypation and 3 D printing on different supports. The idea of the integration between a 3 D printed tactile surface and sensors was born as a final thesis project at the Postgraduate Mastercourse in Digital Architecture of the University of Venice (IUAV) in 2012. Now Tooteko is now a start up company based in Venice, Italy...|$|R
