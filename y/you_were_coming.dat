Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".|$|E
