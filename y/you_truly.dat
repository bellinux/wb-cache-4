500|$|Parts II and III have {{a similar}} structure; an {{overarching}} narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have [...] "a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to know when you have done wrong, and making <b>you</b> <b>truly</b> and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin." [...] Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus {{to a greater extent}} on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.|$|E

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy.
