[...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if you {{are a part of the}} heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E

500|$|Likewise, in the New York Daily News, David Bianculli {{states that}} the episode is [...] "a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series" [...] Brian Courtis in Australia's Sunday Age agrees, and writes that [...] "Hush" [...] is [...] "(c)lever, well-written and brightly {{directed}} ... Buffy at its best." [...] Robert Hanks from The Independent in the UK writes that [...] "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights" [...] with [...] "Hush". Noel Murray in The A.V. Club calls it an [...] "episode unlike any other, with a lusher score {{and some of the}} most genuinely disturbing imagery I've yet seen on Buffy." [...] The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it [...] "scans just like one of those listless dreams in which you try to scream, and can't. Everybody's had 'em—and yet the way the eerie quiet of 'Hush' sucks you in, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds Allen Greenberg in 1992 {{described}} it as [...] "an ambitious project" [...] but [...] "not without its share of problems." [...] He praised the game's [...] "enjoyable story and well-crafted puzzles", but disliked its [...] "robotic" [...] controls and [...] "confusing" [...] perspectives, and stated that [...] "far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games". He summarized the game as [...] "an enjoyable challenge with a unique game-playing engine to back it up." [...] Scorpia was also positive, stating that despite flaws [...] "Ultima Underworld is an impressive first product. The meticulous construction of a real-world dungeon environment is outstanding. [...] may be a dungeon trek, {{but it is certainly}} the dungeon trek of the future". In 1993 she praised the [...] "superb graphics" [...] of [...] "a definite must for game players". [...] The magazine later awarded the game [...] "Role-Playing Game of the Year". Computer Shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters, and believed that the game [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if you've entered a virtual reality". Despite describing its interface as [...] "not truly intuitive", the reviewer finished by calling the game [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "a fine value". The Chicago Tribune awarded it Best Game of the Year, and called it [...] "an amazing triumph of the imagination" [...] and [...] "the creme de la creme of dungeon epics".|$|E
500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning our hopes on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] sighed Mrs. Corey. [...] "And {{perhaps it}} won't turn out so badly. It's a great comfort {{to know that}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> just <b>as</b> I do about it." ...|$|R

500|$|Carnivàle {{was often}} {{compared}} to David Lynch's 1990s mystery TV series Twin Peaks and John Steinbeck's 1939 novel The Grapes of Wrath. Matt Roush of TV Guide called Carnivàle [...] "the perfect show {{for those who}} thought Twin Peaks was too accessible", whereas the show reminded Salon.com's Heather Havrilesky of the [...] "disappointment <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> a kid {{when you come to}} the last few pages of The Grapes of Wrath." [...] She argued that a [...] "surreal Twin Peaks-style shockfest [...] hardly bears repeating," [...] especially if it [...] "avoid the 'hugging and learning' of mainstream television [...] such a steady diet of anguish and dashed hopes that viewers refuse to take the risk of making an emotional connection." [...] Carnivàle, as The Australian stated, [...] "seems to have been conceived in essentially literary terms" [...] which [...] "can sometimes work on the page but is deadly on the large screen, let alone a small one. It's almost like a biblical injunction against pretension on television." [...] A reviewer admitted his temptation to dismiss the first season of Carnivàle as [...] "too artsy and esoteric" [...] because his lack of involvement prevented him from understanding [...] "what the heck was going on, [...] can be a problem for a dramatic television series." [...] TV Zone however considered Carnivàle [...] "a series like no other and [...] {{the fact that it is}} so open to interpretation surprisingly proves to be one of its greatest strengths." [...] Carnivàle was lauded for bringing [...] "the hopelessness of the Great Depression to life" [...] and for being among the first TV shows to show [...] "unmitigated pain and disappointment", but reviewers were not confident that viewers would find the [...] "slowly unfolding sadness" [...] appealing over long or would have the patience or endurance to find out the meaning of the show.|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals were {{considered}} its strongest feature. Allgame's Shawn Sackenheim praised the [...] "vibrant texture maps" [...] with [...] "no pop-up or glitching", while Kelly of Electronic Gaming Monthly made {{note of the}} [...] "lush" [...] environmental details. Kelly and Sega Saturn Magazines Lee Nutter highlighted the consistent framerate (which rarely dropped below 30 frames per second) as a noteworthy achievement, with the latter favourably comparing Sonic R to the Saturn version of Sega Rally Championship. Next Generation hailed the game as [...] "the most visually outstanding Saturn title" [...] for its use of transparency effects and reflective surfaces, a sentiment echoed by EGMs Shawn. Nutter cited the [...] "Radiant Emerald" [...] level, which is [...] "constructed entirely out of transparent polygons", as offering a [...] "far superior" [...] counterpart to Mario Kart 64s [...] "Rainbow Road". GameSpot's Ryan MacDonald stated that the [...] "cartoon {{look and feel of}} previous Sonic games comes across well in the 3D polygonal world", adding: [...] "The sense of speed that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> the track goes zipping by... makes the game look really cool." [...] MacDonald, Shawn, and GamePros Dan Elektro criticised the background's graphical [...] "pop-up", with the latter opining that it [...] "kill the two-player mode outright". However, Nutter praised the two-player mode for maintaining the same speed and graphical detail as its single-player counterpart, with [...] "the only visible difference being that the scenery mists into view slightly closer than in the standard game". Reiner of Game Informer asserted that [...] "the way they hid the background pop through translucent melting is innovative", but he and Game Informers Paul panned the [...] "poor" [...] quality of the character animation. Finally, Nutter complimented the replay mode's [...] "dramatic camera angles".|$|E
2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> if you [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
