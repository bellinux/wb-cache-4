500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And {{that was the first}} time I ever heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{capture of}} the Union guns turned the tide of battle. Although McDowell had brought 15 regiments into the fight on the hill, outnumbering the Confederates two to one, {{no more than two}} were ever engaged simultaneously. Jackson {{continued}} to press his attacks, telling soldiers of the 4th Virginia Infantry, [...] "Reserve your fire until they come within 50 yards! Then fire and give them the bayonet! And when <b>you</b> <b>charge,</b> yell like furies!" [...] For the first time, Union troops heard the disturbing sound of the Rebel yell. At about 4 p.m., the last Union troops were pushed off Henry House Hill by a charge of two regiments from Col. Philip St. George Cocke's brigade.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{surveillance}} videotape made on February 5, 2003, {{of a private}} meeting in Garson's , Siminovsky asked Garson if he would award the couple’s home to his client, Avraham Levi. Garson responded: [...] "I’ll award him exclusive use". He gave Siminovsky detailed instructions {{as to how to}} argue the Levi divorce case before him. He assured Siminovsky that if he followed Garson's instructions: [...] "The worst possible scenario is a win.... You're in good shape. You're a winner either way. And your schmuck [...] doesn't deserve it." [...] Garson dictated to Siminovsky the exact language the lawyer should use in a memo to Garson. He urged him to charge his client extra for the memo, saying: [...] "I am telling <b>you,</b> <b>charge</b> for it. This is extra; this was not contemplated; the judge made me do it.... Squeeze the guy." [...] Referring to the estranged wife (Sigal Levi), the judge said: [...] "She's fucked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{delicate}} matter, ma'am," [...] I heard the Sergeant say, [...] "giving money back. <b>You</b> <b>charged</b> her cheap for the things, I'm sure?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now," [...] Alexis said, [...] "I want two peasant dresses complete, coat, trousers, high boots, and caps. What do <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> for them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "will {{you listen}} to me for a moment? You spoke of those other men, <b>you</b> <b>charged</b> me with heartlessness. Perhaps you were right. What then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm here to {{look after}} Mowbray's. <b>You</b> <b>charged</b> him what <b>you</b> call expenses, which you didn't incur. Guess you'll have to prove them {{if you take the}} case to court." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am, to look at," [...] Mr. Beldeman continued, [...] "an {{unimportant}} person. As {{a matter}} of fact, I represent a very great country, and I come to <b>you</b> <b>charged</b> with a great mission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No Poll Parroting!' he vociferated, in return. 'Keep {{your mouth}} shut!--I want to know, you sir, whether <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> that there crime on George Radfoot?' ...|$|E
60|$|CHARLES. True true as {{you were}} going to say--then seriously I never had the least idea of what <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> me with, upon my honour.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am none," [...] {{said the}} unfortunate Porteous; [...] "that which <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> upon me fell out in self-defence, in the lawful {{exercise}} of my duty." ...|$|E
60|$|Seb. I {{have not}} yet forgot I am a king, Whose royal office is redress of wrongs: If I have wronged <b>thee,</b> <b>charge</b> me face to face;-- I {{have not yet}} forgot I am a soldier.|$|R
5000|$|Schneider: They never <b>charged</b> <b>you</b> — {{originally}} in {{your first}} indictment <b>you</b> were <b>charged</b> with the 924C, {{possession of a}} weapon in conjunction with Bly camp, right? Remember that? ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{broke the}} silence of {{surprise}} occasioned by my abrupt entrance.--"My name, Mr. Inglewood, is Francis Osbaldistone; I understand that some scoundrel has brought a complaint before <b>you,</b> <b>charging</b> me with being concerned in a loss which {{he says he has}} sustained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, lad, I don't want to {{beat you}} down; indeed, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> enough. However, let us say, to begin with, three groats a week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirteen dollars! You mean to {{say that}} <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> {{thirteen}} dollars for these damned inhuman hospitalities of yours? Are you a professional buccaneer? Is it your custom to--" ...|$|E
60|$|Dor. O, <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> your faults {{upon our}} sex! You men are like cocks; you never make love, but you clap your wings, and crow {{when you have}} done.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I go riding {{against the}} raid, [...] And ye know not where I am; [...] But ye shall know {{in a day}} or year, [...] When one green star of grass grows here; [...] Chaos has <b>charged</b> <b>you,</b> <b>charger</b> and spear, [...] Battle-axe and battering-ram.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes." [...] She {{caught his}} hand gratefully. [...] "Get over the back-channel somehow and tell {{my father to}} come.

6000|$|... "At {{the risk}} of being told again that I am unfeminine, I must explain myself. Do <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> me with having allowed Mr. Harcourt to speak to me as a lover?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I {{not speak}} my {{thoughts}} when I called you mad," [...] said Menteith, indignantly, [...] "your own life were a brief one. In what do <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> me with deceiving you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you remember, Master," [...] said Bes {{when he had}} {{finished}} laughing, as he wiped his brow with some damp moss, [...] "how, once far away up the Nile <b>you</b> <b>charged</b> a mad elephant with a spear and saved me who had fallen, from being trampled to death?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What's the trouble, Bill?' he inquired, {{when he had}} {{deposited}} his lordship in {{a corner}} of the reading-room, which he had selected because silence was compulsory there, thus rendering it possible for two men to hear each other speak.

6000|$|... "'I don't {{believe that}} note ever was bad!' I say. 'I told <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>charged</b> me I didn't believe it. That is why I {{have made up}} my mind to give you notice, to go away from here. And if that note is bad then you can put me in prison.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will have}} the {{goodness}} to recollect, Miss Nickleby,' said Mrs Wititterly, 'that when you use such terms as [...] "unjust", and [...] "unfounded", <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> me, in effect, with stating that which is untrue.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Kenwardine with {{a steady}} look, [...] "I've no doubt you see what this implies. <b>You</b> <b>charge</b> me with a plot to intoxicate your friend and take a mean {{advantage}} of his condition." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{matter of}} bookkeeping?" [...] Charnock suggested. [...] "Much {{depends on how}} <b>you</b> <b>charge</b> up your costs, and one understands that doing it cleverly leads to promotion. The worst is {{when you come to}} the total--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirteen dollars! Why, it's impossible! I am no robber. I am <b>charging</b> <b>you</b> what I <b>charge</b> everybody. It's {{a dollar}} and thirty cents, and that's all it is." ...|$|R
