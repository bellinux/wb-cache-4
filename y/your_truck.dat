You can read, if you want to, but you don't read worth a damn. I know you can read, because your readings of Cable and your repeatings of the German doctor's remarks prove that.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a truckmount lies with the carpet cleaning customer, as truck mounts {{do not need to}} use your electric or hot water so it means no costly electric and gas bills in the post long after the carpet cleaning company have left <b>your</b> home, <b>truck</b> mounts have a waste tank fitted so the technician can take the dirty water away and it does not end up down your sink or toilet, quick setup and easy use of the truckmount makes it preferable among professional cleaners.

50|$|The Navatkadu Water Tank. Navatkadu is a hamlet in the {{interior}} that until the summer of 2007 was {{under the control of}} the LTTE Liberation Tamil Tigers of Eelam (LTTE), the rebel group fighting against the Sri Lankan Government. Having no source of drinking water, the villagers were reliant on a government water truck which drove through the village once a day. If you missed the <b>truck,</b> <b>your</b> family had no water. ABDF.org, in co-operation with the local District Secretary, built a 5,000 liter water tank. Now the water truck fills the tank and the villagers have access to clean water all day. This project has proven so popular and effective that two nearby villages have requested tanks of their own.|$|R

50|$|On the road, {{the player}} can earn extra money by smashing other vehicles. This {{money can be}} multiplied through combos, or by hitting a vehicle with the trailer. If the player earns a high enough combo, he can make reward icons appear on the road. When collected, these icons can refuel the truck, repair damage, or offer a cash bonus. Law {{enforcement}} and biker gangs are both present in the game, and cause trouble for the player {{if he or she}} attacks them by mistake. Any cop will pursue and capture a player, while bikers will attempt to shoot up the trailer, or even detach it from the truck. In either case, it is a significant blow to the player's cash. Every cop in this game can be avoided with skillful driving, and bikers can be shaken away from <b>your</b> <b>truck.</b>|$|E

I sold loads of 'em in towns where they like to burn niggers quick, without having to ask somebody for a light.

'We can have a coon in hell with this here petroleum before <b>your</b> old flint-and-tinder <b>truck</b> can get him warm enough to perfess religion.'

40|$|Written {{and oral}} {{literacy}} narratives produced by seven fifth-grade students are examined {{to identify the}} literacy identities students construct when narrating their past and present experiences with reading and writing. The narrative analyses reveal four major findings: 1. The students who contributed to this study have experienced literacy in multiple modes and contexts indicative of relatively broad conceptions of what counts as literacy. 2. They primarily describe literacy experiences in positive or neutral terms; when literacy events are evaluated negatively, it is usually in response to literacy demands that diminished students’ feelings of autonomy. 3. Students in this study intuitively understand that literacy {{is a set of}} social practices that take place in interactions among multiple actors. 4. Students sometimes portray themselves as having power to control the direction of literacy events; other times, their agency is limited by authoritative actors who are portrayed as enforcers of reading rules rather than as collaborative supporters. These findings are relevant for instructional practice because they present personal narrative writing as a way of infusing student voices into the discourse of the classroom in hopes of creating a more culturally relevant instructional space. At Granny’s table, spread thick with food, this is where your story begins. You are sitting with an open spiral notebook in front of you, a pencil curled tightly in your fingers. Uncle Joe took you to the store that day {{in the back of his}} <b>truck.</b> <b>Your</b> brothers asked for candy bars and sodas; and so did you, at first. But then you saw the stack of notebooks, sitting on the shelf two aisles over beneath rows of Funyuns and hot fries and barbecue pork rinds. You held your breath. There was a reason for those notebooks. They were covered with a thin layer of dust, into which you instinctively inscribed your name with your index finger. Then you blew and watched your name soak into the air around you. And you knew that all the Zero bars and Gatorades in the world would not satisfy you the way that notebook would. So you marched up to the counter and watched Joe’s expression as he paid seventy-five cents for the raggedy orange spiral notebook that would change your life forever. So you are sitting with the spiral notebook in front of you. While everyone else around you eats, you stare at the dingy white pages, then at the point of your pencil which you found under Granny’s bed and sharpened with a kitchen knife. If you don’t eat now, don’t complain later about being hungry, Ma tells you. You hear her, but you continue to be mesmerized by the blankness of the paper in front of you. The preceding excerpt is from an autobiographical piece I wrote several years ago to share with my fifth-grade students. I included this here as a reminder of Soliday’s (1994) assertion that life stories are “dialogical account[s] of one’s experience rather than a chronological report of verifiable events” (p. 514). In narrativizing this event from my childhood, I went to great lengths to position myself as a certain kind of person (i. e., an eager writer). This narrative is not a verbatim reconstruction of the past. Yes, I enjoyed writing as a kid; and yes, my uncle once bought me a notebook; but the magnitude of the event is obviously overstated. My narrativized version of this event is a carefully plotted construction of how my adult self wants my child self to be portrayed. In the analysis that follows, student literacy narratives will be treated as storied retellings in which students seek to construct a particular reading/writing identity (Connelly 2 ̆ 6 Clandinin, 1990). These narratives speak volumes about the way students position themselves in the context of school and out-of-school literacy events...|$|R
