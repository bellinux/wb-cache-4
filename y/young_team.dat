The series of competitions {{leading up to the}} London 2012 Paralympic Games were seen as providing valuable training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Don Robinson {{took over}} as {{chairman}} and appointed Colin Appleton as the new manager. Both had previously held the equivalent roles with non-league Scarborough. Promotion to Division Three followed in 1983, with a <b>young</b> <b>team</b> featuring the likes of future England international Brian Marwood, future England manager Steve McClaren, centre-forward Billy Whitehurst, and the prolific goal-scorer Les Mutrie. When Hull City missed out on promotion by one goal the following season, Appleton left to manage Swansea City.|$|E

5|$|During the 2010 NBA offseason, LeBron James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas left Cleveland for the Miami Heat, {{which led}} several other {{veterans}} to also leave the team. The departures would thrust Parker, Antawn Jamison and Anderson Varejão {{into the spotlight}} as the veteran leaders for the <b>young</b> <b>team.</b> While Cleveland only managed a conference-worst 19–63 season, {{they were able to}} upset LeBron James' heavily favored Miami Heat on March 29, 2011 in a game where Parker grabbed eight rebounds and scored 20 points.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past four rounds to reach the final. Chelsea made {{comfortable}} progress; they scored 12 goals while conceding only one to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final. Arsenal fielded a relatively <b>young</b> <b>team</b> throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the semis were acclaimed by the British press. Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E
5|$|At the Corporatie, Vandersteen met a {{colleague}} whose wife worked at Bravo, a weekly Flemish comics magazine that appeared since 1936 {{and had a}} French-language version since 1940. Due to the war conditions, they were desperately in need of local artists to replace the American comics they used to publish. Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a <b>young</b> <b>team</b> was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs and Jacques Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E

5|$|The Football League Cup is a cup {{competition}} open to {{clubs in}} the Premier League and Football League. Like the FA Cup it is played on a knockout basis, {{with the exception of}} the second round and semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. Together with the other clubs playing in European competitions, Arsenal entered the Football League Cup in the third round. The team were drawn to face Manchester City, on the week of 25 October 2004. Wenger fielded a relatively <b>young</b> <b>team</b> for the tie, which took the lead in the second half when Van Persie scored. Daniel Karbassiyoon extended the visitor's lead in the 90th minute, just before Manchester City striker Robbie Fowler scored from a free-kick.|$|E
5|$|Hungarian {{international}} Zoltán Szélesi {{joined the}} squad in training {{ahead of their}} next match against Romanian champions Unirea Urziceni. They came from behind to record a 2–1 win in a feisty encounter, with Steve MacLean scoring the decisive goal. Argyle returned to England to play against Morecambe on 25 July 2009, and included a triallist called Réda Johnson in their defence, who appeared in the match under a pseudonym. Two second half goals ensured that they left Christie Park with a win. The club's only pre-season friendly to take place at Home Park was against Scottish club Heart of Midlothian on 29 July 2009. Neither side could break the deadlock in a dour 0–0 draw. Swindon Town were the opposition for Argyle's penultimate friendly. A goal from Marcel Seip after 57 minutes set the visitors {{on their way to}} a 2–0 victory at manager Paul Sturrock's old club. Argyle's final pre-season match took place on 3 August 2009 against Tiverton Town. A <b>young</b> <b>team</b> containing only two senior professionals, Yoann Folly and Simon Walton, secured a 1–0 win at Ladysmead.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Sooners {{competed with}} a {{relatively}} <b>young</b> <b>team.</b> Oklahoma listed 72players on the roster and only nine of them were scholarship seniors. Following the dismissal of quarterback Rhett Bomar, fifth-year senior Paul Thompson reconverted back to his former role of quarterback after spending 2005 as a wide receiver. Junior college transfer Joey Halzle was slotted as his backup. Thompson had several wide receivers to look to in 2006, including Malcolm Kelly, Manuel Johnson, and Juaquin Iglesias. Not to mention junior Adrian Peterson, the team's main running back. Most of the Sooners' experience {{was on the other}} side of the ball. The Sooner linebackers were the most experienced players on the team. The squad was anchored by Rufus Alexander and Zach Latimer. Alexander was ranked as the third best linebacker in the country at the beginning of the season by College Football News. Behind them were other key players such as Demarrio Pleasant and Lewis Baker. Sophomore Ryan Reynolds, a notable player coming out of high school, was injured in the preseason and therefore was unable to contribute in 2006. In addition to a veteran linebacker squad, Oklahoma had a number of big-name defensive ends. During the preseason, College Football News ranked Larry Birdine, Calvin Thibodeaux and C.J. Ah You in the top 25 best defensive ends for the 2006 season (ranked 14th, 20th, and 22nd, respectively). Oklahoma was the only team with three players in the top 25.|$|E

5|$|Mobile Suit Gundam SEED was {{directed}} by Mitsuo Fukuda (Future GPX Cyber Formula and Gear Fighter Dendoh) with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. The series was first announced in June2002, while a trailer was available in September on the series' official website. A total of eight writers {{were in charge of}} the series. The characters were designed by Hisashi Hirai, while the mechanical designs were made by Kunio Okawara and Kimitoshi Yamane. Mobile Suit Gundam planning manager Koichi Inoue stated that the staff making Gundam SEED was a new and <b>young</b> <b>team</b> that would continue working with following Gundam series. Inoue, however, would work with anime based on the original Gundam series. Fukuda stated that Gundam SEED was initially told from Kira's point of view, but deeper into the series the point of view would shift to other characters. His main focus with the series was to entertain the audience, pointing out that the drama would develop through the series in a similar vein to previous Gundam series. The first part worked on was the plot followed by action sequences, stating that the human characters were more important than the combat sequences. In retrospect, Fukuda said that Kira's wish to fight was forced upon him stemming from his desire to protect his friends. Moreover, he considered these actions as being based on Japanese thoughts.|$|E
5|$|This dip in {{success was}} {{compounded}} when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season, although Arsenal did win the FA Cup (the Final of which Henry missed through injury). Henry maintained {{his reputation as}} one of Europe's most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring, and with 31 goals in all competitions, he was the co-recipient (with Diego Forlán) of the European Golden Boot, and is currently the only player to have officially won the award twice in a row (Ally McCoist also had two Golden Boots in a row, but both were deemed unofficial). The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game. Along with being chief goalscorer, he was responsible for leading a very <b>young</b> <b>team</b> which had yet to gel fully.|$|E
25|$|A poor showing by the West Indies in the 1992 World Cup in Australia and a <b>young</b> <b>team</b> {{reeling from}} the {{retirement}} of Richards, Greenidge and Marshall led to the West Indies calling on former skipper Rohan Kanhai as their first coach, appointed by the WICB in autumn 1992.|$|E
50|$|Bucaspor's <b>young</b> <b>teams</b> {{had a lot}} of {{championship}} in Turkey. The most important success was the championship of Premier Cup in 2010.
