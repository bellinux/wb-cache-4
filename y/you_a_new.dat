500|$|The Duke of York, an avowed Catholic, was {{twenty-five years}} older than his bride, scarred by {{smallpox}} and afflicted with a stutter. He had secretly converted to Catholicism around 1668. Mary first saw her husband on 23 November 1673 OS, {{on the day of}} their second marriage ceremony. James was pleased with his bride. Mary, however, at first disliked him, and burst into tears each time she saw him. Nonetheless, she soon warmed to James. From his first marriage to the commoner Anne Hyde, who had died in 1671, James had two daughters: Lady Mary and Lady Anne. They were introduced to Mary by James with the words, [...] "I have brought <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> play-fellow". [...] Unlike Lady Mary, Lady Anne disliked her father's new wife. Mary played games with Anne, to win her affection.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1947, {{serialisation}} of {{the story}} paused after Hergé disappeared. Doctors diagnosed him as suffering from a mental breakdown {{as a result of}} overwork, and to recover he spent time in retreat at the Abbey of Notre-Dame-de-Scourmont. In a letter to his wife Germaine, Hergé wrote, [...] "Life has spoilt me... I no longer draw like I breathe, as I used to not so long ago. Tintin is no longer me... my Boy Scout spirit has been badly damaged." [...] He followed this with a holiday to Gland on Lake Geneva, Switzerland with Germaine. Editors of Tintin magazine posted a sarcastic notice in the magazine stating that [...] "Our friend Hergé is in need of a rest. Oh, don't worry, he's fine. But in refusing to marshal his forces to bring <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> episode of The Temple of the Sun each week, our friend is a little over-worked." [...] He disappeared again in early 1948, this time for six weeks, again to Gland, but according to biographer Pierre Assouline he was accompanied by a young, married woman, with whom he was having an extra-marital affair. Angered by his absence, the editorial board decided to command other artists and writers to continue the story, a threat which made Hergé return to work.|$|E
500|$|After his 2010 {{debut album}} Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which {{produced}} the singles [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Grenade", Bruno Mars revealed {{he wanted to}} create something unexpected with its follow-up. [...] "This is me going into the studio and recording and writing whatever I want," [...] Mars said confidently. [...] "This album represents my freedom." [...] It all started backstage, after a show, during a jamming session in a [...] "greenroom", while singing the phrase [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". According to Philip Lawrence, the track developed a meaning as they started to write it, [...] "when you’re with someone who’s showing <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> way to love." [...] The Smeezingtons went to New York to work with Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mark Ronson and during a jamming session with drums, bass, and guitar, Mars created the riff of the song. He started singing the chorus previously created {{on the top of}} the riff. Then, The Smeezingtons went back to L.A., where they finished the lyrics and changed the original melody. Lawrence felt that the recording was [...] "sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it", making them enthusiastic to place a [...] "driving rhythm" [...] in it. The composer recalled thinking it was [...] "something special" [...] in the studio, the same way he did during the creation of [...] "Just The Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Billionaire".|$|E

[...] If you persist in doing them, it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may continue to be believed." [...] Here, New Jersey threatened punishment for infractions against its firearms laws, and additional punishment for violations of its hate-crimes laws. [...] Due process procedural safeguards should apply equally to both of these punishments.|$|E
2500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film upon its premiere was mostly positive. Tim Reyes of Universe Today complimented the titular theme of ambition in the film, stating that it [...] "shows us the forces at work in and around ESA", and that the it [...] "might accomplish more in 7 minutes than Gravity did in 90." [...] Ryan Wallace of The Science Times also gave praise to the film, writing, [...] "whether you're a sci-fi fanatic, or simply an interested humble astronomer, the short clip will undoubtedly give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> view of our solar system, and the research out there in space today." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Capp-Fisher feud {{was well}} known in cartooning circles, and it grew more {{personal}} as Capp's strip eclipsed Joe Palooka in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, Moe Leff. After Fisher underwent plastic surgery, Capp included a racehorse in Li'l Abner named [...] "Ham's Nose-Bob." [...] In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named [...] "Happy Vermin"—a caricature of Fisher—who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet, (after sacking his previous [...] "temporary" [...] assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: [...] "I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do— I'll get <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> light bulb!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. So, I kept away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to me one day, I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, I smiled and said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat.
