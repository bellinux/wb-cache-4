6000|$|... "And so," [...] {{she said}} reproachfully, [...] "you slipped off {{as soon as}} his back was turned. I would not have {{believed}} that of you, Bob. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fair to him or me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{girls had}} it at Vevay frightfully. And {{none of them}} were as strong afterward. Some of the parents came and took them away; but Madame Schebres never let mamma know. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a kind of}} swearing, Susan? What is the {{difference}} between slamming a door viciously and saying d----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang it, do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> quite sound?--upsetting The old treatment, {{which has}} made Englishmen what they re?" [...] said Mr. Standish.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are you {{staring at}} so?' {{said the new}} bride to her ladies. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} wonderful? Why, I can do as much myself!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Who do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> marching {{steadily}} sternly confronting death? [...] It was {{the brigade}} {{of the youngest}} men, two thousand strong, [...] Rais'd in Virginia and Maryland, {{and most of them}} known personally [...] to the General.|$|E
6000|$|LADY CICELY. Well, {{what was}} he to do? He wasn't in love with Sir Howard; and he WAS in love with me. So he {{naturally}} offered to swop Sir Howard for me. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> nice of him, Captain Kearney? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You tricked us {{that day}} in the {{mountain}} glen, {{and for the first time}} an Alcanta brigand lost his prisoners and his ransom money through being outwitted. But did <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the end? If so you failed to appreciate us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps Mr. Sisson, your flute {{might call}} out the bird of song. As thrushes call each other into challenge, you know. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very probable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> all <b>you</b> {{have to ask}} pardon for,' said Mr. Edmonstone. 'I {{advise you}} to study your apologies, for you are in pretty {{tolerable}} disgrace.' ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{pulled up}} at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes {{despatched}} his wire. [...] "Whom do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to?" [...] he asked, as we resumed our journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{she can be}} {{as great}} a goose as I! Why, the Yankee muse and Mrs. Duncombe took all in good part; but Cecil has not atom of fun in her. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the gift the fairies left out at the christening of the all-endowed princess?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Mrs. Elmore admitted. [...] "The {{officer was}} very polite; {{and when he}} found that she was from America, {{it turned out that}} he was a great sympathizer with the North, and that he had a brother in our army. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> nice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My gracious no! We can't afford it. Taxes {{are much}} too {{high as it}} is. We ought to retrench, and not let the city council spend another cent. Uh----Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a grand paper Mrs. Westlake read about Tolstoy? I was so glad she pointed out how all his silly socialistic ideas failed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{decline of}} the vaudeville?" [...] we repeated, {{wrinkling}} our forehead in grave misgiving. Then, for want of something better, we asked, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a very dignified subject for the magazine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{adventure}} by which, I hope, {{you will}} not be a loser, my hearty," [...] put in the captain. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the craft which was built at New Bedford, and fitted out on the Vineyard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Sibyl {{sprang to}} the defence, {{and there was}} a general {{struggle}} and romp interspersed with screams, which was summarily stopped by Mr. Rollstone explaining severely, 'If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the deportment of the aristocracy, Miss Ida, you are much mistaken.' ...|$|R
6000|$|As to a chair, or {{anything}} of that kind for helping Mrs. Peerybingle into the cart, you know very little of John, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> necessary. Before you could have seen him lift her from the ground, there {{she was in her}} place, fresh and rosy, saying, [...] "John! How can you? Think of Tilly!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maxwell mused for {{a moment}} of discouragement. They were always coming back to that; very likely Godolphin was right; but Maxwell did not know just how to subdue the {{character}} of Salome so as to make her less interesting. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> what gave you bad houses in Chicago--the double interest, or the weakened interest in Haxard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly. But {{things when}} I was very young." [...] Miss Milray {{did not know}} quite what she intended, {{but she knew that}} Clementina was feeling her way to {{something}} she wanted to say, and she let her alone. [...] "When it was all over, and I knew that as long as I lived he would be somewhere else, I tried to be paht of the wo'ld I was left in. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I tell Laura she has affronted him,' said Eveleen, laughing. 'She {{has been}} always busy of late {{when we have}} wanted her; and I assure her his pride has <b>been</b> piqued. Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an explanation, Captain Morville?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> wise, Master? I suppose Kilmeny is pretty; the egg peddler {{told me she}} was; and {{no doubt}} she is a good, nice girl. But she wouldn't be a {{suitable}} wife for you--a girl that can't speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{expect to}} make a fortune, Kitty," [...] said Jack quietly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the one {{desirable}} thing? I shall never be a rich man. But riches {{are not the only}} thing that makes life pleasant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' I said. 'It was not that. I can't let {{you even}} pretend <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all. I love you. I always have loved you, though I {{did not know}} how much till you had gone away. After a time, I thought I had got over it. But when I met you again down here, I knew that I had not, and never should. I came back to say good-bye, but I shall always love you. It is my {{punishment}} for being the sort of man I was five years ago.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Colonel Clay, leaning forward, {{and looking}} quite engaging, began {{a new line}} of cross-examination. [...] "We have seen, Sir Charles," [...] he said, [...] "that we cannot implicitly trust your identifications. Now let us see how far we can trust your other evidence. First, then, about those diamonds. You tried to buy them, did you not, from a person who {{represented}} himself as the Reverend Richard Brabazon, because you believed he thought they were paste; and if you could, you would have given him 10 pounds or so for them. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> honest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ANNA--[To him--seeming not to {{have heard}} their interruptions.] That was why I run away from the farm. That was what made me get a yob as nurse girl in St. Paul. [With a hard, mocking laugh.] And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a nice yob for a girl, too, don't you? [Sarcastically.] With all them nice inland fellers yust looking {{for a chance to}} marry me, I s'pose. Marry me? What a chance! They wasn't looking for marrying. [As BURKE lets a groan of fury escape him--desperately.] I'm owning up to {{everything}} fair and square. I was caged in, I tell you--yust like in yail--taking care of other people's kids--listening to 'em bawling and crying day and night--when I wanted to be out--and I was lonesome--lonesome as hell! [With a sudden weariness in her voice.] So I give up finally. What was the use? [She stops and looks at the two men. Both are motionless and silent. CHRIS seems in a stupor of despair, his house of cards fallen about him. BURKE's face is livid with the rage that is eating him up, but he is too stunned and bewildered yet to find a vent for it. The condemnation she feels in their silence goads ANNA into a harsh, strident defiance.] You don't say nothing--either of you--but I know what you're thinking. You're like all the rest! [To CHRIS--furiously.] And who's to blame for it, me or you? If you'd even acted like a man--if you'd even been a regular father and had me with you--maybe things would be different! ...|$|E
5000|$|Brian Tamaki, a Bishop of the Destiny Church stated: [...] "That Christianity is {{the chosen}} {{religion}} of the Head of the Commonwealth. For us to depart from <b>that,</b> don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> bordering on creating some type of treason, religious treason anyhow?".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} supply is sufficient," [...] said Ben, [...] "so don't run any chances. If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> an enemy {{give him a}} shot. But don't hit one of our fellows by mistake," [...] he added, by way of caution.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Belle! do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> there <b>is</b> {{anything}} in <b>that?</b> Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{what has made}} Jessie act so queerly {{for the last couple}} of days? I noticed she was not herself at all; and Dave seemed to be different, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am trying}} to feel {{my way through the}} most {{difficult}} problem, the most difficult situation that a responsible Government can have to face. Of course, I am dependent upon information. But as I read it, as I listen to serious Indian experts with large experience, it all sounds estrangement and alienation even though it be no worse than superficial. Now that is the problem that we have to deal with. Gentlemen, I should very badly repay your kindness in asking me to come among you to-night, if I were to attempt for a minute to analyse or to prove all the conditions that have led to this state of things. It would need hours and days. This is not, I think, the occasion, nor the moment. Our first duty--the first duty of any Government--is to keep order. But just remember this. It would be idle to deny, and I am not sure that any of you gentlemen would deny, that there is at this moment, and there has been for some little time past, and very likely there will be for some time to come, a living movement {{in the mind of the}} peoples for whom you are responsible. A living movement, and a movement for what? A movement for objects which we ourselves have all taught them to think desirable objects. And unless we somehow or other can reconcile order with satisfaction of those ideas and aspirations, gentlemen, the fault will not be theirs. It will be ours. It will mark the breakdown of what has never yet broken down in any part of the world--the breakdown of British statesmanship. That is what it will do. Now I do not believe anybody--either in this room or out of this room--believes that we can now enter upon an era of pure repression. You cannot enter at this date and with English public opinion, mind you, watching you, upon an era of pure repression, and I do not believe really that anybody desires any such thing. I do not believe so. Gentlemen, we have seen attempts, in the lifetime of some of us here to-night, attempts in Continental Europe, to govern by pure repression. Has one of them really succeeded? They have all failed. There may be now and again a spurious semblance of success, but in truth they have all failed. Whether we with our enormous power and resolution should fail, I do not know. But I do not believe anybody in this room representing so powerfully as you do dominant sentiments that are not always felt in England--that in this room there is anybody who is for an era of pure repression. Gentlemen, I would just digress for a moment if I am not tiring you. ("Go on,") About the same time as the transfer, about fifty years ago, of the Government of India from the old East India Company to the Crown, another very important step was taken, a step which I have often thought since I have been concerned with the Government of India was far more momentous, one almost deeper than the transfer to the Crown. And what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was?</b> That was the first establishment--I think I am right in my date--of Universities. We in this country are so accustomed to look upon political changes as the only important changes, that we very often forget such a change as the establishment of Universities. And if any of you are inclined to prophesy, I should like to read to you something that was written by that great and famous man, Lord Macaulay, in the year 1836, long before the Universities were thought of. What did he say? What a warning it is, gentlemen. He wrote, in the year 1836:--"At the single town of Hooghly 1,400 boys are learning English. The effect of this education on the Hindus is prodigious.... It is my firm belief that if our plans of education are followed up, there will not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal thirty years hence. And this will be effected merely by the natural operation of knowledge and reflection." [...] Ah, gentlemen, the natural operation of knowledge and reflection carries men of a different structure of mind, different beliefs, different habits and customs of life--it carries them into strange and unexpected paths. I am not going to embark you to-night upon these vast controversies, but when we talk about education, are we not getting very near the root of the case? Now to-night we are not in the humour--I am sure you are not, I certainly am not--for philosophising. Somebody is glad of it. I will tell you what I think of--as I have for a good many months past--I think first of the burden of responsibility weighing on the governing men at Calcutta and Simla and the other main centres of power and of labour. We think of the anxieties of those in India, and in England as well, who have relatives in remote places and under conditions that are very familiar to you all. I have a great admiration for the self-command, for the freedom from anything like panic, which has hitherto marked the attitude of the European population of Calcutta and some other places, and I confess I have said to myself that if they had found here, in London, bombs in the railway carriages, bombs under the Prime Minister's House, and so forth, we should have had tremendous scare headlines and all the other phenomena of excitement and panic. So far as I am informed, though very serious in Calcutta--the feeling is serious, how could it be anything else?--they have exercised the great and noble virtue, in all ranks and classes, of self-command. Now the Government--if you will allow me for a very few moments to say a word on behalf of the Government, not here alone but at Simla--we and they, for after all we are one--have been assailed for a certain want of courage and what is called, often grossly miscalled, vigour.|$|E
