25|$|Nauru Air Corporation, trading as Nauru Airlines (formerly trading as Our Airline and Air Nauru) is {{the flag}} carrier airline of the Republic of Nauru. It {{operates}} scheduled international services to other Pacific islands and Australia. Its main base is Nauru International Airport. Its head office {{is on the}} property of Nauru International Airport, <b>Yaren</b> District, and its operations office is in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. On the 15 July 2014, the airline {{announced that it would}} change the name of the airline to Nauru Airlines, effective 1 August 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{organization}} of the island's defences was the first task of the occupiers. They sited 152mm artillery pieces around the coast and placed 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine guns on Command Ridge. They built pillboxes on the beach, bunkers further inland, and an underground hospital. Their main work was {{the construction of an}} airstrip (which, after the war, formed the basis of Nauru International Airport). To build it, they brought in 1,500Japanese and Korean workers, as well as using Nauruans, Gilbertans, and Chinese as forced labour. The creation of the airstrip on the narrow coastal belt led to the expulsion of many natives from the districts of Boe and <b>Yaren,</b> where the best lands of the island were located. The airfield became operational in January 1943. Work on airstrips in Meneng and Anabar was begun but never completed.|$|E

The Nauru Public Health Centre offers treatments for diabetes and other obesity-related diseases. This is the only form of specialized medical care in Nauru. Patients who require higher treatment are flown to Australia. In 2012, an estimated 7.5% of its GDP was spent on healthcare. As of 2010, there are 50 hospital beds. In 2004, there were 149 physicians and 557 nurses per 100,000 people. In 2012, it was estimated 26.2% and 22.1% of the population under 15 years of age consumed tobacco and cigarettes, respectively. The World Factbook estimates the population has a life expectancy of 66.4 years at birth, which ranks Nauru 169th in the world.|$|E
