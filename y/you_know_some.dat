It is also backed by doo-wop beats, finger snaps and cooing backup vocals. Lyrically, the song speaks of a woman's breaking point and Hilson [...] "voices the frustration" [...] {{of women who are}} being neglected and exploited by men. In the chorus, she sings: [...] "Every woman has a breaking point, y'all/ Hey, I know <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>some</b> women can be lied to, cheated on and beat on/ Somebody know, hey, every woman has a breaking point, y'all." [...] According to Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio, Hilson vocally incorporates an [...] "improvisational gospel style. MTV Buzzworthy writer Chris Ryan compared Hilson's vocals with Mary J. Blige's, particularly in Blige's cover of [...] "I'm Going Down" [...] (1995). Halfway through [...] "Breaking Point", Hilson talks about [...] "the need for each woman to reclaim her life" [...] in a spoken-word interlude, during which she mimics Blige, according to Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe. Hilson phrases: [...] "Now ladies, we really should be mad at ourselves, cause see, some women just tolerate too damn much. Huh!" ...|$|E

Set in common time, [...] "Work" [...] is written in the common verse-chorus form. The singer has described the song as [...] "actually very innocent [...] a little aggressive maybe:" [...] "All I'm saying is don't come around if you're {{not going to live}} up to all your talk and as <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>some</b> guys are just full of talk," [...] Rowland said in a 2008 interview with Popjustice. [...] "It's just a woman saying you can't catch me easy and you have to put in the work. It's about putting in work – that's it, of course." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{industry}} {{needs the}} hobbyists {{and this was}} illustrated by what happened eventually. When National Semiconductor, which made their own microprocessor chips in '77 or '78, decided they needed a BASIC [...] they asked, 'What's the most popular BASIC?' And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way. This was the marketing function and the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete antipathy of the company in question. There were other BASICs and, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>some</b> of them might even have been better. [...] was in a certain measure {{because of what we}} did, that he said we shouldn't do, we were thieves to do it, and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably {{should have done it}} live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>some</b> people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
