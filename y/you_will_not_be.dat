500|$|Johnson {{identified}} himself as a poet and, in November 1734, applied to Edward Cave {{to work on the}} poetry reviews for The Gentleman's Magazine. In a letter written under the name S. Smith, Johnson said, [...] "As You appear no less sensible than Your Readers of the defects of your Poetical Article, <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> displeased, if, in order to the improvement of it, I communicate to You the sentiments of a person, who will undertake on reasonable terms sometimes to fill a column". In particular, Johnson suggested removing the magazine's [...] "low Jests" [...] and [...] "awkward Buffoonery" [...] and then replacing them with poems, inscriptions, and [...] "short literary Dissertations in Latin or English" [...] written by himself. Cave did not accept Johnson's proposal to write a column, but he did employ Johnson occasionally to work on minor aspects of the periodical.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{unfavorable}} reviews came from major American newspapers. A.O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as [...] "about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid," [...] while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are [...] "pioneers {{in the art of}} face-piercing", but that the Spartans had access to [...] "superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> endlessly fascinated." [...] Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film a two-star rating, writing, [...] "300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud." [...] Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the [...] "digital action" [...] but irritated by the [...] "pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters." ...|$|E

500|$|The Commander-in-Chief of the Brazilian forces, Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (then Baron {{and later}} Marquis of Tamandaré), himself a Progressive, {{complained to the}} Brazilian Cabinet of the outcome {{engineered}} by Paranhos. By the time the peace treaty was concluded, the Uruguayan capital was under siege by Brazilian troops and under blockade by the Brazilian fleet. The admiral and the Cabinet were eager {{for an end to}} the conflict which would have resulted in a conquest of the enemy capital and a consequent boost in the popularity of the Brazilian government. Paranhos, however, had preempted such an outcome. As retaliation for the bloodless conclusion, he was fired from his post. Returning to Brazil, he defended himself in the Senate: [...] "Say [...] whatever you want about the diplomatic act of 20 February; <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to take away from me this grateful conviction: that through that solution I saved the life of 2,000 fellow compatriots, [...] avoided the destruction of an important capital". Nonetheless, he received accolades in Uruguay, Brazil and even Argentina for his accomplishment in engineering both an end to the war and the formation of the alliance.|$|E
500|$|The {{archive of}} Mari reports a plan between Zimri-Lim, {{the king of}} Carchemish and the king of Eshnunna (who made peace with Mari), to attack Qatna. Such an {{alliance}} {{could not have been}} realized without the participation of Yamhad, overlord of both Mari and Carchemish; in the end, the plan was not pursued and the tense relations between Qatna and Yamhad eased toward the last years of Yarim-Lim's reign. In a letter written to Zimri-Lim, Yarim-Lim I agreed to establish peace with Qatna if Amut-piʾel II were to come by himself to Aleppo, thus acknowledging the supremacy of Yamhad; no proof can be shown for a meeting taking place between the two kings. Just before his death in 1765 BC, Yarim-Lim called a meeting of his vassals, and Zimri-Lim traveled to Aleppo where he met messengers from Qatna and Hazor, indicating that Amut-piʾel II started recognizing the supremacy of Yarim-Lim, and that Hazor, Qatna's vassal, was now obeying Yamhad. Yarim-Lim's successor Hammurabi I arranged a peace with Qatna that probably did not require the Qaṭanean king to visit Aleppo personally, but indicated Qatna's acceptance of Yamhad's superiority. This apparent yielding seems a mere formality as Qatna continued its aspirations for power, as became clear in its behavior during the Elamite invasion of Mesopotamia in year ten of Zimri-Lim's reign. An Elamite messenger reached Emar and sent three of his servants to Qatna; Hammurabi I of Yamhad learned of this and sent troops to intercept them on their return. The servants were captured and questioned, revealing that Amut-piʾel II told them to tell their monarch that [...] "The country is delivered to you, come up to me! if you come up, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> taken by surprise." [...] The Qaṭanean king also sent two messengers to Elam, but they were probably captured in Babylon.|$|E
