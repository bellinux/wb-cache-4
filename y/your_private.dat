25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right {{to do what you want}} with <b>your</b> <b>private</b> property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in your bedroom. Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|Willis {{built up}} his {{reputation}} in the public {{at a time when}} readers were interested in the personal lives of writers. In his writings, he described the [...] "high life" [...] of the [...] "Upper Ten Thousand", a phrase he coined. His travel writings in particular were popular for this reason as Willis was actually living the life he was describing and recommending to readers. Even so, he manufactured a humble and modest persona, questioned his own literary merit, and purposely used titles, such as Pencillings by the Way and Dashes at Life With Free Pencil, which downplayed their own quality. His informally toned editorials, which covered a variety of topics, were also very successful. Using whimsicality and humor, he was purposely informal to allow his personality to show in his writing. He addressed his readers personally, as if having a private conversation with them. As he once wrote: [...] "We would have you... indulge us in our innocent egotism as if it were all whispered in <b>your</b> <b>private</b> ear and over our iced Margaux". When women poets were becoming popular in the 1850s, he emulated their style and focused on sentimental and moral subjects.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all <b>your</b> <b>private</b> records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... and sooner or later this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people." [...] As Snowden observed it, this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported, being considered one of the [...] "fringe benefits" [...] of the work.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1880s, Carp suggested, the {{territorial}} administration had been redesigned {{to function as}} a political machine, or [...] "giant electoral device". He believed that corruption was the direct consequence of excessive politicking and bureaucracy, which absorbed human energies out of the economic sector, and which the PNL seemed to encourage. The result of such trends, he argued, was a [...] "budgetary", [...] "budgetivore" [...] or etatist pseudo-democracy, as opposed to a working and transparent liberal democracy. Even after the 1882 rapprochement between Junimea and Brătianu, Carp attacked the PNL as a sanctuary of endemic corruption: [...] "I know Mr. Brătianu does not desire , but corruption does desire him, and, with invisible but numerous arms, like those of a giant polyp, squeezes him and will squeeze him till he's choking." [...] Shortly after the [...] "Hot Iron" [...] speech of 1911, he addressed Brătianu an equally famous exhortation: [...] "Always be fair in <b>your</b> <b>private</b> life, always be selfless in your public life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{broke with}} Fox {{in a debate}} in the commons on 6 May 1791 over the French Revolution. Later that month Fitzwilliam offered {{financial}} assistance to Burke, who sat {{for one of his}} pocket boroughs, Malton in Yorkshire. Burke replied on 5 June, declaring that he would quit his seat before the session ended and that [...] "I beg to appeal to your Equity and candour, whether I could receive any further Obligations of any kind out of a party whose publick principles are the very reverse of mine...let me beg the continuance of <b>your</b> <b>private</b> friendship and partial goodness—and believe there is not living one who more respects your Virtues publick and private, or that loves you with a more warm true and grateful attachment than I do". Burke would refuse money from Fitzwilliam again on 21 November. Fitzwilliam continued his friendship with Fox but his opinions were moving more in Burke's direction. French Laurence wrote to Burke on 8 August, claiming that Fitzwilliam had praised the Reflections [...] "in a large, mixed company ...in a manner which made it understood to be his wish that his opinion should be as publicly known as possible". Upon reading Burke's An Appeal from the New to the Old Whigs, he wrote to him on 18 September: ...|$|E
