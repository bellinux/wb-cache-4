5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

25|$|As magma {{nears the}} surface and its {{pressure}} decreases, gases escape. This process is much like what happens when <b>you</b> <b>open</b> a bottle of fizzy drink and carbon dioxide escapes. Sulfur dioxide {{is one of the}} main components of volcanic gases, and increasing amounts of it herald the arrival of increasing amounts of magma near the surface. For example, on May 13, 1991, an increasing amount of sulfur dioxide was released from Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. On May 28, just two weeks later, sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 5,000 tonnes, ten times the earlier amount. Mount Pinatubo later erupted on June 12, 1991. On several occasions, such as before the Mount Pinatubo eruption and the 1993 Galeras, Colombia eruption, sulfur dioxide emissions have dropped to low levels prior to eruptions. Most scientists believe that this drop in gas levels is caused by the sealing of gas passages by hardened magma. Such an event leads to increased pressure in the volcano's plumbing system and an increased chance of an explosive eruption. A multi-component gas analyzer system (Multi-GAS) is an instrument package used to take real-time high-resolution measurements of volcanic gas plumes. Multi-GAS measurements of CO2/SO2 ratios can allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.|$|E

The song was produced by Swizz Beatz, and was included on the album as a bonus track.

2500|$|In The Big Bang Theory episode, [...] "The Tangerine Factor" [...] (May 19, 2008), Leonard's {{attempt to}} arrange a date with Penny results in both Penny and Leonard's seeking Sheldon's advice.

[...] The only {{way to find out}} is to [...] "open the box", in other words collapse the wave-function of an uncertain date into a specific outcome. Also, in the episode [...] "The Russian Rocket Reaction" [...] (October 13, 2011), Sheldon characterizes his relationship to Leonard as [...] "Schrödinger's friendship", in the sense that Leonard is simultaneously his friend and mortal enemy (as he may or may not attend Wil Wheaton's party).

2500|$|The album's booklet is twenty-four pages long, {{consisting}} of song lyrics and comics drawn by Zombie. Gene Colan and Dan Brereton, of Marvel Comics, contributed numerous drawings for the booklet. The booklet contains numerous images of ghosts, goblins, monsters, and other creatures. Numerous references to Lucifer and Satan are made throughout the pages, along {{with images of}} Sheri Moon and other near-nude women. Zombie had {{a replica of the}} robot from the film The Phantom Creeps (1939) created for the booklet. The replica was created by Wayne Toth, and stood ten feet tall.

2500|$|The series {{developed}} a cult following partially {{due to the}} large number of in-jokes it contains, most of which are aimed at [...] "nerds". In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his [...] "nerdiest joke". These included mathematical jokes— such as [...] "Loew's -plex" [...] (aleph-null-plex) movie theater,— as well as various forms of science humor— for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming [...] "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. On {{the front seat of the}} car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until <b>you</b> <b>open</b> the box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA"). The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction. These are most often to Star Trek— many soundbites are used in homage— but also include the reference to the origin of the word robot made in the name of the robot-dominated planet Chapek 9, and the black rectangular monolith labeled [...] "Out of Order" [...] in orbit around Jupiter (a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey series). Bender and Fry sometimes watch a television show called The Scary Door, a humorous parody of The Twilight Zone.|$|E
