'As <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> sir,' cried brother Charles, utterly forgetting his assumed dignity, 'as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> How {{dare you}} think, Frank, {{that we would}} have you marry for money, when youth, beauty, and every amiable virtue and {{excellence}} were to be had for love? How dared you, Frank, go and make love to Mr Nickleby's sister without telling us first what you meant to do, and letting us speak for you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You feel, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> {{what is most}} to {{the credit}} of human nature. Such {{feelings}} ought to be investigated, that they may know themselves." ...|$|E
60|$|Concerning supper-toast (of which I feel {{bound to}} make some mention), you did, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> right, and exactly what was most {{agreeable}} to me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All that meaning my wickedness,' said Lucilla. 'Tell me again. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{like the}} sprite {{even when it}} was wicked, only you were too good and right-minded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Counting up my toes!" [...] snorted Songbird. [...] "Nothing of the kind! <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> knock my poetry endways, Tom. That {{last line}} was to read like this: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{what good}} {{will that be}} to-night?' grumbled Alfred. 'But <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> put Harold before me. However, I shall soon be dead and out of your way, that's all!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wouldn't hurry for her," [...] said Dolly; [...] "but {{of course}} you'll hurry. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> don't you, papa?" [...] Then {{they sat down}} to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|LILY--[Turning on EMILY fiercely.] So! You got {{someone to}} say it for you as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> Poison Mind! Oh, I wish the ducking stool had never been abolished! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can only}} express my sympathy with any sorrow of yours, Henrietta,' said Lord Montfort. 'Speak {{to me as}} <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> with that frankness which so much delights me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter made a good-natured face at Sammy. [...] "Which means, I suppose, {{that what}} I can't <b>do</b> <b>you</b> can. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{have a pretty}} good opinion of yourself, Sammy," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then by {{the same}} token I had a similar right," [...] she said. [...] "Though I haven't, Dick, I haven't," [...] she hastened to add. [...] "Well, anyway, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> preach the single standard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never felt}} {{the way you}} did about Rogers, but I know how <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> feel, and I guess I {{surprised}} him with my answer. He had brought along a lot of stock as security----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on," [...] {{she murmured}} gently; [...] "you {{always used to}} do that when I was ill or tired--don't stop it yet, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> now, and go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh nonsense, come along, {{show me the}} way. That's right, Robins, {{only your}} hands are so sticky. What, down here!--Oh, Wilmet, how d'ye do? what delicious work! do <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho, you're at it again! Take {{your hands}} away, {{and let me}} see your eyes. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> that when I read a letter from her. I will write and tell her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marse Tom, you {{are just}} putting on; you know it {{perfectly}} well; I don't know what makes you act like that--but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> even when <b>you</b> was little, and you can't get over it, I reckon. Are you over it now, Marse Tom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By God! you're right!" [...] he ejaculated, {{with the}} {{trembling}} strain {{of his face}} suddenly fixing. Blood and life shot into his eyes. He got up heavily and began to stride to and fro before her. [...] "You see clearer than me. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> Lenore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I donâ€™t {{understand}} you," [...] said Mr. Catesby, with a bewildered glance {{from one}} to the other. [...] "I am Fred. Am I much changed? You look the same as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and it seems only yesterday since I kissed Prudence good-bye at the docks. You were crying, Prudence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, Betty, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> {{my cousin}} less than justice. She means well {{by the child}} and by us all. Come, come say what is in your mind," [...] he add testily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} Fitz says. It's all jealousy. You'll {{have it all}} your own way, if you look sharp. I think <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> have it all your own way. Are you nearly ready?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, O simple one! {{but there}} are times to think and times not to think. Your misfortune is that <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> both at the wrong time, and never do either at the right time." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy {{glanced at}} his father's face, at his tattered {{garments}} and bandaged leg, and read the whole story. It was a familiar page to him. He paled first and then flushed, and then, with an odd glitter in his eyes, said, [...] "Take me with <b>you,</b> father. <b>Do!</b> <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> before. I'll bring you luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween. She {{will go with}} <b>thee.</b> They <b>always</b> <b>do.</b> She {{will ride}} with thee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to say I would take a can of peaches, Mrs. Green?" [...] asked Tom, and then his face fell. [...] "Oh, dear, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> put me down as the worst boy in the school, when--I--I--do--my--very best," [...] and, almost sobbing, Tom put his face up against his coat sleeve. Mrs. Green was very tender-hearted in spite of her {{somewhat}} free tongue, and she was all sympathy immediately.|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew you'd {{agree with}} me--ha! ha! <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> mother," [...] cried the farmer, flinging his {{handkerchief}} {{at a small}} kitten which was sporting {{on the floor and}} went into fits of delight at the attention.|$|E
6000|$|As {{they walked}} away, she said, [...] "You're a good man, Laban Billings, {{to feel the}} way <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> about Joey. You've been a true father to him; I wonder what his own father'd have been." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{you will}} {{get me out of}} it, Rose of Sharon! <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> {{brightest}} and sweetest of friends! What an alliance is ours! My invention, your judgment; my combinations, your criticism. It must carry everything before it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Her frankness {{appealed to}} his own. [...] "You are free. I never held you bound {{to me in}} my fondest hopes. <b>You</b> have <b>always</b> <b>done</b> right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so characteristic!" [...] Edgar exclaimed. [...] "Why must <b>you</b> <b>always</b> be <b>doing</b> things? Do {{you imagine}} that {{whatever}} one receives {{is the result of}} so much exertion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dodo, do {{listen to}} what James says," [...] said Celia, [...] "else you will be getting into a scrape. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>always</b> will, when <b>you</b> set about doing as you please. And I {{think it is a}} mercy now after all that you have got James to think for you. He lets you have your plans, only he hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having a brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} had better see him, ma'am. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> see him, you know, and it will look so strange if you don't. There, I will pop these things into the drawers again and hide the box." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For {{the matter}} of that,' said Kit, 'you speak true and {{sensible}} enough, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> mother. Still, I do consider that a week is quite long enough for 'em to be rambling about; don't you say so?' ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN. Mother: {{you have}} no {{consideration}} for me. For Heaven's sake either treat me as a child, as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> and tell me nothing at all; or tell me everything and let me take it as best I can.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{not very}} lively, always going about with <b>you.</b> It's <b>always</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> love me, {{do you love}} me, till I just get about sick of it." ...|$|R
50|$|You know I am {{not sure}} I {{am going to be}} around if I get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame so you must read this for me, I {{am not sure}}, I guess I am feeling sorry for myself at this time but you must {{remember}} everything I want you to do and say. Mother said you would do what I want because <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did.</b> So read this for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must go {{back and}} feed your goats and mules, and do just as <b>you</b> have <b>always</b> <b>done</b> before, and say no word to any one about me." ...|$|R
