A witness interviewed by Physicians for Human Rights said that he and other protesters moved closer to army forces following the initial shooting. According to him he asked [...] "Why do you shoot us? We had our hands up. We are peaceful. What do you want from us?", one soldier replied [...] "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> If you do not turn back, I have orders to shoot".

500|$|... "Who's That Chick?" [...] is a euro-house and electro song, which {{lasts for}} 2:47 (2 minutes, 47 seconds). Instrumentation {{consists}} of pounding synthesizers. Rihanna's vocals on the song are technologically processed using the Auto-Tune effect. For the first verse, she [...] "hollers" [...] the lyrics [...] "Feel the adrenaline/ Moving under my skin/ It's an addiction" [...] over the heavy synth beat. During the chorus, Rihanna sings [...] "She's been a crazy dita/ Disco diva, and you wonder/ Who's that chick? Who's that chick?/ Too cold {{for you to}} keep her/ Too hot for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her/ Who's that chick? Who's that chick?", which incorporates heavy usage of Auto-Tune.

Stacey Anderson of Spin commented that its first disc [...] "meanders over [...] down-tempo cuts" [...] and called ...Sasha [...] "an intriguing but diluted direction". The Village Voices Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond felt that the I Am... disc lacks cohesion, but complimented [...] "Sasha Fierce as [...] "brassy, big-headed, confrontational, and witty," [...] and stated, [...] "each incendiary track challenges <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> your inhibitions at coat-check." [...] Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone noted that its slow songs are [...] "full of bland self-affirmation and saggy lines", but wrote that [...] "the [...] "Sasha" [...] disc boasts Beyoncé's most adventurous music yet". Colin McGuire of PopMatters called the album [...] "a little rough around the edges at times" [...] and viewed its Sasha Fierce disc as [...] "a far more compelling trip down dance-lane". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the album offers [...] "two compelling sides" [...] of Beyoncé and stated: [...] "The collection {{might have been better}} served had she edited it down to one disc, rather than belabor what ultimately seems like a marketing gimmick. And while fans will surely speculate, there's little in the lyrics that feels more revealing than previous emotional fire-starters." [...] Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker found the album to be [...] "something of a mess", mostly because the alter ego [...] "trips on the idea of redefinition".|$|E

By the late 1990s, only several hundred remained, mainly in a northwestern mountainous region named Sa'ada and town of Raida. Houthi members put up notes on the Jews' doors, accusing them of corrupting Muslim morals.

[...] "I am sorry to find that the situation of your domestic affairs renders it necessary for you to quit the service.
