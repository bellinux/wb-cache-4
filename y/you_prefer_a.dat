2500|$|The 'If <b>You</b> <b>Prefer</b> <b>a</b> Milder Comedian, Please Ask For One' EP Faber & Faber 2012 ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{also had}} a show at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, named Stewart Lee: If <b>You</b> <b>Prefer</b> <b>a</b> Milder Comedian, Please Ask for One in which he {{performed}} {{his own version of}} the song [...] "Galway Girl". In December 2009 Lee was nominated for Best Live Stand-up at the British Comedy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Lee caused {{controversy}} on his If <b>You</b> <b>Prefer</b> <b>a</b> Milder Comedian {{tour with}} a routine about Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond. Referring to Hammond's accident while filming in 2006, {{in which he}} was almost killed, Lee joked, [...] "I wish he had been decapitated". The Daily Mail termed this an [...] "extraordinary attack" [...] and, having been doorstepped by a Mail journalist, Lee quoted the routine by replying [...] "It's a joke, just like on Top Gear when they do their jokes". Lee subsequently explained the joke: ...|$|E
6000|$|Kennicott chuckled, [...] "Well, child, {{how about}} it? Do <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>an</b> artistic guy like Raymie to stupid boobs like Sam Clark and me?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The Cloudster is a powered {{sailplane}} or an airplane that soars, whichever <b>you</b> <b>prefer.</b> <b>As</b> a touring airplane, it cruises at 135 mph (75-percentpower) using just 6 gph {{to yield a}} range of 690 miles. At lower power settings, the range can be greatly increased. Only 20-percent power is required to keep the Cloudster in level flight.” ...|$|R
50|$|But, to my disgrace, <b>you</b> have <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> dark planet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine {{place of}} yours, Mr. Courage," [...] he declared. [...] "Very fine place indeed. No wonder <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> country life. Finest {{thing in the}} world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good! Hee-haw! Excellent!" [...] cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased. [...] "You shall {{all have}} fine suppers and good beds. What food would <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> <b>a</b> bran mash or ripe oats in the shell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then be a Montacute Jones-ite; or a Boncassenite, if, as is possible, <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> {{young woman}} {{to an old}} one." [...] At this moment Isabel Boncassen was {{standing}} close to them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Highness," [...] {{replied the}} officer, [...] "nothing, I am certain, {{could be further}} from the {{intention}} of the Prefect. You will observe that he has not granted a warrant. It is mere formality, or call it, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> <b>an</b> obligation that your Highness lays on the authorities." ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{despatch}} of to-day received. I am {{very sorry}} to have offended you. I appointed the collector, as I thought, on your written recommendation, and the assessor also with your testimony of worthiness, although I know <b>you</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> different man. I will examine to-morrow whether I am mistaken in this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can quite {{understand}} that," [...] Captain Keppel said. [...] "Poor relations seldom get a warm welcome, {{and as you}} were born in Alexandria, they may be altogether unaware of your existence. You have certainly been extremely fortunate, so far; and if <b>you</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>a</b> civil appointment, <b>you</b> would be pretty certain of getting one when the war is over.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not necessary," [...] the Professor answered. [...] "You {{can enter}} me," [...] he added, {{as he held}} {{open the door for}} her, [...] "as a friend--or would <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> pseudonym?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all, Sir Robert." [...] Then {{she looked}} at him and, coming to a sudden decision, added, [...] "If you like I will play you nine holes this {{afternoon}} and give you a stroke a hole, or would <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> foursome?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I, my dear sir? In one way I am--yes, I am {{the world}} itself, come {{to pay you}} a visit. In another sense I am an outcast--almost an outlaw. If <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> less materialistic view, I am a sort of fate--the {{retribution}} that waits its time." ...|$|E
60|$|And if, {{with these}} dainties {{to drink and}} eat, <b>You</b> <b>prefer</b> not <b>a</b> vestige of grass or tree, And a chronic state of wet in your feet, Then--I {{recommend}} the Sea.|$|R
60|$|Having melted it, {{he poured}} {{it into the}} mould, where it assumed a dull, half-solid appearance, {{as if it were}} a liquid only half frozen--or, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> it, <b>a</b> solid in a half molten state.|$|R
6000|$|... "Murder will--but this isn't murder. Quite the {{contrary}} perhaps! I verily believe," [...] {{she had her}} moments of adding, [...] "that, for the amusement of the row, <b>you</b> would <b>prefer</b> <b>an</b> explosion." ...|$|R
6000|$|He answered: 'I am called Blow-Blast, I {{come from}} Wind-town, {{and with my}} mouth I can make any winds you please. If you wish a west wind I can raise it for you in a second, but if <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> north wind I can blow these houses down before your eyes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Holmes {{replaced}} {{the bill in}} his notebook. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> public explanation, it must come sooner or later," [...] said he. [...] "I have already told you that I can hush up that which others will be bound to publish, and you would really be wiser to take me into your complete confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean Demosthenes, sir; and, gentlemen, I beg you {{to remark}} that this orator was a republican: but {{there can be}} no {{question}} that liberty is favourable to the encouragement of all the higher qualities. Would <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> few notes on Paris, ladies, or shall I commence with some extracts about the Rhine?" ...|$|E
40|$|Earlier this spring, {{we at the}} OEP were {{fortunate}} {{to sit down with}} three of the candidates vying to become the next Governor of Arkansas. The candidates were generous enough to give us their time and allow us to post the full interviews on YouTube. If <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>an</b> abridged version, this policy brief summarizes the candidates’ views on a range of important education policy issues. We hope that these interviews will be informative for your vote on May 20 th in the party primaries...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, if <b>you</b> all <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> French {{prison to}} a few days' hard marching, you {{have good reason to}} grumble at being baulked in your wishes; that is all I have to say about it." ...|$|R
50|$|Different {{people seem}} to be entertained by {{different}} things. For some, an hour of juggling and trained animal acts is a fine evening's entertainment. Others <b>prefer</b> <b>an</b> evening with Mort Sahl, Lenny Bruce or Shelley Berman. The success of these performers seems to indicate that entertainment and socio-political themes do mix. It's simply a matter of taste as to what <b>you</b> <b>prefer.</b> <b>As</b> for becoming messagey, satire has been a traditional art form for hundreds of years, and by definition ridicules a social or political point of view or event. We are simply {{following in the footsteps of}} the goliards of the Middle Ages, the Jonathan Swifts of the post-Restoration era and the Julius Monks of the 1960s.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will not}} even drink absinthe," [...] Henri continued, helping himself from a little carafe which stood between them, [...] "absolutely the most artistic of all drinks. <b>You</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> thing you call a pipe to my choicest cigarettes, and you have upon your cheeks a color of which a ploughboy should be ashamed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the fox-trot," [...] he said. [...] "The {{old ones}} were no good. Have a cigarette? These are Armenian, or would <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> Honolulan or a Nigerian? Now," [...] he resumed, {{when we had}} lighted our cigarettes, [...] "what {{would you like to}} do first? Dance the tango? Hear some Hawaiian music, drink cocktails, or what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|ANN.[ignoring the correction] Yes, for yours. You {{had better}} marry {{what you call}} a hypocrite, Jack. Women who are not hypocrites go about in {{rational}} dress and are insulted and get into all sorts of hot water. And then their husbands get dragged in too, and live in continual dread of fresh complications. Wouldn't <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> wife you could depend on? ...|$|E
6000|$|MORE. [Trying {{to take in}} {{the exact}} sense of her words] Good! <b>You</b> <b>prefer</b> that to <b>an</b> hotel? [KATHERINE nods. [...] Gently] Will you let me say, Kit, how terribly I feel for you--Hubert's---- ...|$|R
2500|$|During {{a speech}} at Brandeis University, he stated, [...] "Political {{correctness}} is tyranny with manners". In {{a speech to the}} National Press Club in 1997, Heston said, [...] "Now, I doubt any of <b>you</b> would <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> rolled up newspaper as a weapon against a dictator or a criminal intruder." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of suprathermal proton {{bremsstrahlung}} a suprathermal proton, or if <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> simply <b>an</b> energetic proton, strikes a relatively motionless electron in a background plasma and causes the electron to radiate. The differential cross section {{as a function of}} energy of the emitted photon calculated was believed to be superior to the conventional one in the case of relativistic collisions...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you look}} upon it in that light," [...] he remarked, still without the least sign of discomposure. [...] "We will, {{if you do not}} mind, waive the {{discussion}} for the moment. Do <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> small restaurant or a corner in a big one? There is music at Frascati's but there are not so many people in the smaller ones." ...|$|E
60|$|ACIS. I am in {{my fourth}} year; and I have got on very well without your dolls. I had rather walk up a {{mountain}} and down again than {{look at all}} the statues Martellus and Arjillax ever made. <b>You</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> statue to an automaton, and a rag doll to a statue. So do I; but I prefer a man to a rag doll. Give me friends, not dolls.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly we descend a brow {{into the}} Yale of Tarbes: a good land and large; a {{labyrinth}} of clear streams, water-meadows, cherry-orchards, and crops of every kind, {{and in the midst}} the pleasant old city, with its once famous University. Of Tarbes, you may read in the pages of Froissart--or, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> <b>a</b> later authority, in those of Dumas, 'Trois Mousquetaires;' for this is the native land of the immortal Ulysses of Gascony, the Chevalier d'Artagnan.|$|E
6000|$|... "Later," [...] the Baron said, with {{a meaning}} look, [...] "I will make myself clear. In the meantime, let me {{recommend}} this soufflé. Mr. Mabane, you are drinking nothing. Would <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> your wine <b>a</b> shade colder?" ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the prizes}} {{are exactly the}} same, it follows that <b>you</b> will <b>prefer</b> Gamble <b>A</b> to Gamble B {{if and only if}} you believe that drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball (according to {{expected}} utility theory). Also, there would be no clear preference between the choices if you thought that a red ball was as likely as a black ball. Similarly it follows that <b>you</b> will <b>prefer</b> Gamble C to Gamble D if, and only if, you believe that drawing a red or yellow ball is more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. It might seem intuitive that, if drawing a red ball is more likely than drawing a black ball, then drawing a red or yellow ball is also more likely than drawing a black or yellow ball. So, supposing <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> Gamble <b>A</b> to Gamble B, it follows that <b>you</b> will also <b>prefer</b> Gamble C to Gamble D. And, supposing instead that <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> Gamble B to Gamble A, it follows that <b>you</b> will also <b>prefer</b> Gamble D to Gamble C.|$|R
6000|$|Winterbourne {{wished that}} Mrs. Walker would tuck in her {{carriage}} rug and drive away, but this lady {{did not enjoy}} being defied, as she afterward told him. [...] "Should <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> being thought <b>a</b> very reckless girl?" [...] she demanded.|$|R
