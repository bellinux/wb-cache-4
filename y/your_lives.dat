Ochi was inspired to write the lyrics for the song after reading the scrift for the drama, and decided to sing about rebirth, around a mofit {{of the sun and}} the moon. Ochi described the song as being like a letter of thanks to important people in <b>your</b> <b>lives.</b> The song's release as a double A-side single was announced on June 21, 2012.|$|E

25|$|The Argumenty i Fakty {{articles}} {{prompted a}} response from Pravda observer Viktor Kozhemyaka {{in the form of}} an article titled Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again. In the article, Kozhemyaka criticized Sinyavskaya's theory and upheld the official expert conclusion about the identity of the executed partisan. Later the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation issued an official conclusion stating that the family photographs of Kosmodemyanskaya belong to the same person as the Pravda photograph of the hanged partisan. The article ended in emotional sentences Let your names be sacred for centuries, Tanya, Zoya, Lila! So many of you gave for us the most precious thing you had; <b>your</b> <b>lives.</b> And we cannot, should not, and indeed have no right to forget or betray you.|$|E

So that no shadow of suspicion shall remain between prince and ministers, we will ally our families with marriages, and thus, ruler and subject linked in friendship and amity, we will enjoy tranquility'...The following day, the army commanders all offered their resignations, reporting (imaginary) maladies, and withdrew to the country districts, where the emperor, giving them splendid gifts, appointed them to high official positions.|$|E
500|$|Crossing the Sahara was {{considered}} particularly perilous {{at the time}} because of guerilla forces hiding in the mountains. The medicines carried by the truck would have been valuable loot for these groups, {{and for the first}} part of the desert the expedition was accompanied by the French Foreign Legion. The instruction the men received was [...] "No stops, drive for <b>your</b> <b>lives,</b> even if you get a flat tire." [...] The crossing passed without violent incidents, however, and greater problems were presented by the elements. There were no roads in the desert, and the truck was heavily loaded and not especially adapted to the conditions. Several times it got stuck in the desert sand; the crew had to place steel plates underneath for traction and spend hours digging out the sand from under the wheels. This took a great toll on the men, who had a limited supply of water, in temperatures approaching 50°C. The crew spent most nights in oases along the way, but on occasion also slept in sleeping bags in the sand.|$|E

The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that one {{overrides}} the Shabbat {{as well as other}} commandments (except for idol worship, incest, and murder) if there is danger to life and one who hastens to disregard the Sabbath for an ill person who is in danger is praiseworthy.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch {{read the}} words of [...] "And surely your blood of <b>your</b> <b>lives</b> will I require," [...] to support the {{proposition}} that one who commits suicide is considered an evildoer of the highest degree. For God created {{the world for a}} single individual, Adam, so anyone who destroys a soul destroys a whole world. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch therefore taught that Jews should not carry out for one who committed suicide anything to honor that person, but Jews should bury the body after cleansing and dressing it in a shroud. The principle is that everything for honoring the living relatives should be done for them, as opposed to for the honor of the person who committed suicide.|$|E
