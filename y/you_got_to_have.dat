6000|$|They {{talked to}} the {{secretary}} of the Zenith Foundry Company about an interesting artistic project--a cast-iron fence for Linden Lane Cemetery. They drove on to the Zeeco Motor Company and interviewed the sales-manager, Noel Ryland, about a discount on a Zeeco car for Thompson. Babbitt and Ryland were fellow-members of the Boosters' Club, and no Booster felt right if he bought anything from another Booster without receiving a discount. But Henry Thompson growled, [...] "Oh, t' hell with 'em! I'm not going to crawl around mooching discounts, not from nobody." [...] It was one of the differences between Thompson, the old-fashioned, lean Yankee, rugged, traditional, stage type of American business man, and Babbitt, the plump, smooth, efficient, up-to-the-minute and otherwise perfected modern. Whenever Thompson twanged, [...] "Put your John Hancock on that line," [...] Babbitt was as much amused by the antiquated provincialism as any proper Englishman by any American. He knew himself to be of a breeding altogether more esthetic and sensitive than Thompson's. He was a college graduate, he played golf, he often smoked cigarettes instead of cigars, and when he went to Chicago he took a room with a private bath. [...] "The whole thing is," [...] he explained to Paul Riesling, [...] "these old codgers lack the subtlety that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to-day." ...|$|E

Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies. Good bunch of live wires. Some class! I'm rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now, where before I didn't hardly make more 'n twenty-six or twenty-eight hundred. Keeps me on the jump alrightee. Fact. I got so tired and run-down-- I hadn't planned to take any vacation at all, but the boss himself says to me, 'Eddie, we can't afford to let you get sick; you're the best man we've got,' he says, 'and you {{got to take a}} good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks.' 'Well,' I says, 'I was just wondering if you was smart enough to get along without me if I was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl'--and I guess that must be you, Miss Golden!--and he laughs and says, 'Oh yes, I guess the business wouldn't go bust for a few days,' and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair-cut and a singe and a shampoo--there ain't as much to cut as there used to be, though--ha, ha!--and here I am." ...|$|E

We brought with us a grinding tool, the RAT and we ground away 2-4 mm and found even more sulfur. Too much to explain by other than that this rock is full of sulfate salts. That's a telltale sign of liquid water. Mini-TES also found evidence of sulfate salts. Most compelling of all, the Mössbauer spectrometer in the RATted space showed compelling evidence of jarosite, an iron-(III) sulfate basic hydrate. Fairly rare, found on Earth and had been predicted that it might be found on Mars some day. This is a mineral that <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> water around to make." ...|$|E

In an {{economic}} emergency, {{to avoid a}} general reduction of wages he favoured a tariff on foreign manufactured goods and 'a policy of Imperial insulation'; but mostly he appealed to governments to observe different priorities. Two forces were responsible for Britain's economic decline, the 'orthodox Free Trade View' and the 'orthodox Treasury View'. Industrial interests should be put before financial interests, and Mond advocated an extension of credit to rationalized industries by squeezing the unrationalized. The whole taxation system, in his opinion, was wrong: if taxation was used to redistribute wealth industrial progress would be halted by the injury to capital and effort. 'What you want to arrive at', Mond thought, 'is not national redistribution, but national prosperity, with high wages, {{and in order to}} get high wages <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> good prices and low taxes'.|$|R
