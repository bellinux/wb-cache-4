We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's something <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with– but to say people {{stormed out of the}} show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Conway Studios in Los Angeles, {{and the band}} stayed at the Sunset Marquis Hotel during the sessions. [...] Nimrod took four months to record; Armstrong partially attributed the lengthy recording time to spending [...] "a little too much time" [...] playing pool and foosball during the sessions. [...] The recording schedule, which lasted from noon to {{two in the morning}} every day, became frustrating for the group members, who began drinking heavily. [...] Bassist Mike Dirnt recalled, [...] "One night one of us was walking down the halls knocking on people's doors while naked." [...] Another incident involved drummer Tre Cool throwing his hotel room television set out of his window. [...] Armstrong noted, [...] "There was a lot of glass. [...] <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> that arrogant lifestyle every now and then." [...] To keep the band focused, Cavallo enlisted his father and manager Pat Magnarella to supervise the group.|$|E
500|$|The rivalry, {{which is}} the oldest in the sport, is fueled by history, competitiveness, and {{cultural}} implication. Both schools {{are located in the}} state of Maryland, a historical hotbed for lacrosse, and have traditionally been two of the sport's powerhouses. Many of the opposing players have had past associations in grade school, high school, or youth club sports. Hopkins' current coach and former player Dave Pietramala said, [...] "Everybody knew each other; we had all played together at some point or another. It was a fierce, intense game and there was no love lost on the field." [...] Additionally, Johns Hopkins is a private university, while Maryland is a public institution. Former Terrapins coach Dick Edell said:"To get the juices flowing before the game, [...] kids that it was the blue-collar guys against the future executives—that this was their only chance to get them before they got into the real world. Plus, you have all the kids who came from the same high school, or worked the camps together, so there was that closeness that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with for the other 364 days, no matter who wins." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Rangel rose {{rapidly in}} the House, due to his {{political}} skills, hard work, knowledge of legislative matters, and genial manner. [...] In 1974, {{he became the first}} black ever named to the House Committee on Ways and Means, a position he assumed in 1975 (and left the Judiciary Committee), and by 1979 had become the chairman of its important Subcommittee on Health. [...] In 1976, he was named to the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. [...] By 1979, Rangel {{was a member of the}} influential House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. [...] Rangel combined his solidly liberal views–interest group ratings in 1978 indicated he was the most liberal member of the New York State congressional delegation–with a pragmatic approach towards finding political and legislative compromises. [...] Rangel built alliances with others in Congress (collaborating for example with Michigan Republican Guy Vander Jagt on welfare reform measures), with people in governmental agencies, and with the Carter administration. [...] In some cases Rangel was criticized for being too pragmatic, such as when he switched his position on natural gas deregulation; Rangel denied that he did so in exchange for the authorization of a new federal building in Harlem. [...] Rangel said of himself, [...] "I guess I'm practical, but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> with yourself and make sure you are not so practical that you sell out a part of yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The fifth track, [...] "The Other Side", has churning, chunky guitars, a double-bass {{drum and}} Lee's [...] "ethereal, widescreen" [...] vocals with {{elements}} of R. Lyrically, the song's theme is death. [...] "Erase This", formerly titled [...] "Vanilla", was noted by Mary Ouellette of Loudwire as an [...] "uptempo rocker" [...] similar to [...] "What You Want" [...] which would sound better played live {{rather than through}} earphones. [...] "Lost in Paradise" [...] is a symphonic rock ballad which begins with piano, strings and Lee's unlayered vocals before adding the band for the song's climax; its lyrics reflect Lee's past struggles, apologizing to her fans for the band's five-year absence. The song's musical structure was compared to [...] "Jóga", by the Icelandic recording artist Björk. [...] "Sick" [...] has a loose, lazy melody and a chanted chorus; {{one of the first}} songs written for the album, it [...] "set a heavy direction {{for the rest of the}} record." [...] "End of the Dream" [...] begins [...] "full bore with chunky guitar, then falls into a brooding grove with piano underpinning Lee's unmistakable vocals." [...] In the chorus, Lee sings [...] "Follow your heart 'til it bleeds," [...] evincing the track's [...] "seize the day" [...] message. Lee said about the song, [...] "It's about understanding that this life isn't forever, and how <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> it, embrace even the pain, before it's all over. As much as it hurts, it just means you're alive. So don't be so afraid to get hurt that you miss out on living." [...] "Oceans" [...] begins with a big, low synth and a vocal before the band joins in. According to Lee, [...] "It's big and lush. We've been having a lot of fun playing that one especially." [...] "Never Go Back" [...] (originally called [...] "Orange") examines [...] "loss from the perspective of someone losing someone in a tragedy". Lee said that the song, with the lyrics [...] "It's all gone, the only world I've ever known", was inspired by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. [...] "Swimming Home" [...] is an electro-pop song with grinding guitars and a [...] "weeping" [...] piano.|$|E
