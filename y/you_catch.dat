25|$|An {{interesting}} {{consequence of}} the difference between these two distributions is that you will get more of the heavy fish, on average, if <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> n fish one by one than if <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> all n at the same time.|$|E
25|$|These {{examples}} {{show that}} {{the distribution of the}} types of fish <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> depends on the way they are caught. Many situations will give a distribution that lies somewhere between Wallenius’ and Fisher’s noncentral hypergeometric distributions.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "West Coast" [...] {{was directed by}} Vincent Haycock, and shot at Marina del Rey, California and in Venice, Los Angeles, in early April 2014. Aside from Del Rey, the clip also features Hollywood tattoo artist Mark Mahoney who plays the singer's love interest in the clip's chorus segment, and American model Bradley Soileau who plays the same role in another scene. Del Rey described Mahoney as her confidante, lover and procurer in the video. In an interview with Clash, the singer mentioned, [...] "Like the record, [...] atmospheric, and <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> a directional vibe, but it's not that pointed, and it's {{hard to tell what}} is going on". She attained inspiration for the clip from the Chet Baker documentary Let's Get Lost (1988), and her love of the red dress effect. The singer also wanted the video to be mood-driven, and for its final scene, to transcend from black-and-white imagery to a [...] "HD color dream scene".|$|E

500|$|...

Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life {{going to get the}} best of you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|E
500|$|From Harbor Springs on, M-119 is the Tunnel of Trees Scenic Heritage Route, {{one of the}} Pure Michigan Byways in the state. Bluff Drive becomes Lake Shore Drive {{near the}} Harbor Point Golf Course, and M-119 turns northward to follow the Lake Michigan {{shoreline}} {{at the mouth of}} Little Traverse Bay. The roadway meanders through oaks, maples, birch and cedars along an old Ottawa trail. The writers at National Geographic said that [...] "only sometimes can <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> glimmers of Lake Michigan through the trees, but the dense foliage lends beauty to the winding road." [...] Along this area of the routing, the highway narrows in width and continues through the forest without a centerline most of the remainder of the way. As the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) states on their website, [...] "M-119 is not a road for those in a hurry." [...] the trunkline continues through the community of Good Hart up the Lake Michigan shoreline to the community of Cross Village. M-119, and state maintenance, end at the intersection between Lake Shore Drive and C-66/C-77 (State Road) in the middle of town.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{was a man}} of high {{ideals and}} was popular with his fellow players. Pelham Warner commented on his {{pleasant}} nature and Robert Trumble, an author and son of Hugh Trumble, recalled him as honest, direct and without guile. [...] An anecdote told about Hill had him hitting a low shot into shadows where Warren Bardsley was fielding. He completed one run and then asked the umpire if the ball had been caught. [...] The shadow made it impossible for the umpire to see, so Hill then asked Bardsley, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> it?" [...] When Bardsley replied in the affirmative, Hill immediately walked to the pavilion. When England won four Tests in a row in 1911–12, Hill managed to retain the confidence of his players. [...] Frank Iredale wrote that Hill was a cheery skipper whose men were happy under his leadership. Despite breaking many records, Hill showed little awareness of them. [...] When watching Jack Hobbs break his record for the most runs in Test cricket at Headingley in 1926, it was Hobbs' wife sitting nearby who had to remind Hill that the record was previously his.|$|E

500|$|Noé {{initially}} {{asked the}} Daft Punk member Thomas Bangalter, who had composed {{the music for}} Irréversible, to create an original soundtrack for Enter the Void. Bangalter was occupied with work on [...] and had to decline. As a compromise, he provided Noé with an arrangement of ambient sounds and samples from existing experimental music, from which Noé compiled what he envisioned as [...] "a maelstrom of sounds." [...] Bangalter is billed in the credits as sound effects director, and the film features his track [...] "Désaccords" [...] originally composed for Irréversible. One {{of the sources of}} inspiration for the soundtrack was [...] "Revolution 9" [...] by The Beatles, a sound collage which Noé describes as a work [...] "where <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> the beginning of a note, or of a melody and then it's already somewhere else." [...] The two main musical themes of the film are [...] "Freak" [...] by the British electro artist LFO, which is played during the opening credits, and a recording by Delia Derbyshire of Johann Sebastian Bach's [...] "Air on the G String", which serves as the theme for Oscar's childhood and his relationship with Linda. The beginning of [...] "ANS" [...] by the British band Coil is heard during Oscar's first DMT trip. The Throbbing Gristle song [...] "Hamburger Lady" [...] plays as Oscar tries to deliver drugs to Victor at the bar. The soundtrack notably includes excerpts from nearly every part of Jean-Claude Éloy's two compositions, Shânti and Gaku-no-Michi. Other songs on the soundtrack include Toshiya Tsunoda's [...] "Music for Baby", Alvin Lucier's [...] "Music for Gamelan Instruments, Microphones, Amplifiers and Loudspeakers", and works by Denis Smalley, Lullatone, and Zbigniew Karkowski.|$|E

2500|$|A Da'if Hadith {{is found}} in Abu Dawud – Buraidah said: In the {{tradition}} telling that people with small eyes, i.e. the Turks, will fight against you, the prophet (ﷺ) said: You will drive them off three times till <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> up with them in Arabia. On the first occasion when you drive them off those who fly will be safe, on the second occasion some will be safe and some will perish, but on the third occasion they will be extirpated, or he said words to that effect.

2500|$|Ragtime {{is not a}} [...] "time" [...] (meter) in {{the same}} sense that march time is 2/4 meter and waltz time is 3/4 meter; it is rather a musical style that uses an effect that can be applied to any meter. The {{defining}} characteristic of ragtime music is a specific type of syncopation in which melodic accents occur between metrical beats. This results in a melody that seems to be avoiding some metrical beats of the accompaniment by emphasizing notes that either anticipate or follow the beat ("a rhythmic base of metric affirmation, and a melody of metric denial"). The ultimate (and intended) effect on the listener is actually to accentuate the beat, thereby inducing the listener to move to the music. Scott Joplin, the composer/pianist known as the [...] "King of Ragtime", called the effect [...] "weird and intoxicating." [...] He also used the term [...] "swing" [...] in describing how to play ragtime music: [...] "Play slowly until <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> the swing...". The name swing later came to be applied to an early style of jazz that developed from ragtime. Converting a non-ragtime piece of music into ragtime by changing the time values of melody notes is known as [...] "ragging" [...] the piece. Original ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, four being the most common number. These themes were typically 16 bars, each theme divided into periods of four four-bar phrases and arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Typical patterns were AABBACCC′, AABBACCDD and AABBCCA, with the first two strains in the tonic key and the following strains in the subdominant. Sometimes rags would include introductions of four bars or bridges, between themes, of anywhere between four and 24 bars.|$|E
