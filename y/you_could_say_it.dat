The other was a more traditional Neumann-Neve chain. The 251 chain sounded amazing and worked really well with the 1176, which I don't typically use for cutting vocals.

5000|$|In 2002 {{he began}} Nefisa, a {{somewhat}} amorphous arts collective which featured frequent updates {{and comment on}} creative, spiritual and political topics by Misdaq. It also featured the early work of many other artists including Julia Clark-Lowes {{who went on to}} form The Pipettes and later The Indelicates, San Francisco graffiti artist Daniel Cordani, avante-garde musician and erstwhile Hollywood film composer MichL Britsch amongst others. Misdaq frequently used the website to comment upon immediate news-events such as the Iraq War, the 7/7 bombings of London and the Danish cartoon controversy - for which Misdaq wrote a combined short-story and article which was spread widely across the internet in the days following the initial reaction. It was similarly a small creatively tinged hub for community action such as annual soup-drives for the homeless of the city of Brighton and anti-war marches in both Brighton and London alike. Misdaq spoke at length about Nefisa in a 2011 interview with the UK's Radical Middle Way. [...] "It was also pretty special in that it was a precursor to myspace and facebook, each artist I featured would have their own profiles, one photograph only; they listed their influences and such, but crucially, they also had their own galleries of ongoing work… So that gave certain artists the feeling that their creative output had a potential audience, and this in itself was a meaning-giver for a lot of those artists, crucial to a few of them. So, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a committedly non-commercial variant of a social network, with deeper social implications. If all of today's trendy technologies truly encouraged people's innate creativity, instead of just talking like they do, then that would be great." [...] In 2007, after five years of operation, Nefisa UK ceased as a blog/showcase and energies were focused solely on its capacity as a media label.|$|E
5000|$|The Nemuri Kyoshirō {{series of}} films, {{which began in}} 1963 and are known as Sleepy Eyes of Death in the west, are {{considered}} to be the representative work of Raizō's later years. According to Tokuzō Tanaka, playing the part of the protagonist, Kyoshirō, was an extreme challenge for Raizō. Speaking of the first film in the series, Sappōchō, even Raizō himself said that [...] "the characteristic 'hollowness' of Kyoshirō simply didn't come out at all" [...] and deemed the film a failure. It wasn't until the fourth film, Joyōken, that Raizō succeeded in bringing the hollowness, dandyism and nihilism of the character to life. The actor Shintarō Katsu described Raizō's performance in the Nemuri Kyoshirō films, saying [...] "When he was playing Kyoshirō he had a real animal magnetism about him, didn't he. Maybe <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> came from this sense of the shadow of death hanging over him. It really is the face people make when they die, that expression." [...] “When he’d walk by, Rai-chan would cut you with his face. Not with a sword, with his face,” he reminisced, “Rai-chan didn’t become Kyoshirō through his fight scenes or the delivery of his lines, he did it through his face; that’s my opinion, anyway.” Kazuo Ikehiro said, “without speaking, without any kind of facial expression, simply by the way he walked around as though he were carrying his past on his back” Akira Inoue, director of the seventh film in the series, Tajōken, said that there were other actors who played Kyoshirō, but none of them could compare to Raizō when it came to portraying Kyoshirō’s soul. Raizō went on to hold the starring role in 12 films in the series, which represents a majority of the starring roles for which Raizō was cast.|$|E

Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and let you escape your normal life for a few minutes.

40|$|The {{territory}} {{known as}} Flevoland {{was created in}} the twentieth century after land was reclaimed from the sea. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was a pioneer in its field. A special place where time is encapsulated in modernity, accelerated and compressed between two sheets of glass. But nevertheless, what we see today is not moving towards homologation. Globalisation appears to be separating the destinies of cities and territories that have developed based on the same institutional and infrastructural conditions. We believe that the genealogy of these urban formations (especially Nagele, Lelystad and Almere) has become more complicated; in fact, their legacies seem to multiply, shatter and become non-univocal. The pioneers appear reborn in the inhabitants who settle in this new, maiden land, sparking a real estate supply determined to support this oneiric projection. Nagele with its exemplary aura is clearly occupied by inhabitants who ignore the intellectual travail leading to its creation; a little like Chandigarh: "authentic" delimited modernity that have not influenced the real settlement dynamics of our contemporary age, in short a "niche" product. Lelystad poses questions that remain extemely urgent, e. g., how to create new urbanity and social cohesion. However, the process appears doomed to irreversible failure because it involves new designs which, although they add aesthetically beautiful objects, are incapable of eliminating the sense of abandonment and stagnation communicated by the city. Although Almere appears to have followed in Lelystad's footsteps, it later developed in a discontinuous polycentric manner. It was reborn in the nineties when the influence of the urban dimension of Randstad and its priority in the Dutch and European urban agenda led to investments and a successful outcome. The current crisis lifts the lid on earlier interrelated conditions. Seen from Flevoland, the twentieth century looks like an uninterrupted series of crises that cannot be solved because they are all structurally diverse, immeasurable and randomly enhanced by certain works, trends and autorial figures. The crisis that began in 2007 initially appears to have acted as a simple multiplier of ongoing trends and later became a sort of basis on which to elaborate more and different scenarios...|$|E
