500|$|Context is {{one other}} element to framing that is essential. [...] "The {{participants}} will be bound by norms of good manners: through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through circumspection in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly-through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due." [...] Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social framings is critical, just as is {{an awareness of the}} audience. Depending on who you’re speaking with (a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc.) you will curve <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "Khrushchev {{attempted}} to transform the Bucharest Conference into a communist summit meeting {{for the purpose of}} securing the condemnation of the Chinese" [...] with Kapo being the only representative of a European party [...] "to refrain from criticizing Peking, to attack Yugoslav revisionism, and to refuse to alter his stand on the Chinese and Yugoslav issues despite Soviet pressure. Khrushchev's hopes of bringing the Albanians to heel by means of peaceful persuasion were certainly shattered by the time the Bucharest Conference had come to an end." [...] During the Conference Hoxha communicated with Kapo via radiogram, stating for instance on June 24, in response to a lengthy document distributed at the Conference by the Soviets attacking the Chinese, [...] "When you make <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> at the meeting you should declare: 'I am not authorized to make statements on these matters because our leadership knows that these matters will be discussed at the forthcoming Meeting of representatives of the parties, as we have all agreed.'... We understand your difficult situation, but don't worry at all, for we are on the right road." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burke {{wrote on}} 16 December: [...] "I read with the {{greatest}} possible satisfaction some account of <b>your</b> <b>Speech</b> in the House of Lords". Fitzwilliam replied to Burke's first letter on 17 December: [...] "Your letter came most opportunely to decide a wavering mind to {{the thing that was}} right" [...] and he said of the Seditious Meetings Act 1795: ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{pictured the}} scene in [...] using the Song of Songs as an inspiration. The Midrash said, [...] "Your lips are like a thread of scarlet and <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> is comely," [...] (in the words of [...] ) when the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh said to Joshua (in [...] ), [...] "All that you have {{commanded}} us we will do, and we will go wherever you send us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1874, Ferry gave {{a speech}} against the future Civil Rights Act of 1875. After speaking, Senator Charles Sumner, both a friend of Ferry's and the {{proposer}} of the bill, stood up and said, [...] "Mr. Ferry, <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> is far the most damaging blow my measure has yet received". The Civil Rights Act would eventually pass, but was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, {{on the basis that}} Congress did not have the power to regulate the conduct of individuals. His last speech in Congress was considered an uncommonly eloquent dissertation on his former friend, William Alfred Buckingham.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not to do anything that interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E

6000|$|Miss Barrington {{looked at}} him steadily. [...] "Lance," [...] she said, [...] "there is {{something}} about you and <b>your</b> <b>speeches</b> that occasionally puzzles me. Now, of course, {{that was the only}} rejoinder you could make, but I fancied you meant it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Two days later, on the {{afternoon}} of May 22, Brooks confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber: [...] "Mr. Sumner, I have read <b>your</b> <b>speech</b> twice over carefully. [...] It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine." [...] As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor, but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner ripped the desk from the floor. [...] By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks beat the motionless Sumner until his cane broke, at which point he continued to strike Sumner with the remaining piece. Several other Senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt who brandished a pistol and shouted, [...] "Let them be!" ...|$|E

60|$|I shall {{hope to see}} {{you soon}} after you come back. <b>Your</b> <b>speeches</b> at Aberdeen are most admirable, manful, and earnest.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} its seriousness, sir," [...] was Mr Powell's frank answer. [...] "But {{if you think}} you have been telling me {{something}} very new you are mistaken.
