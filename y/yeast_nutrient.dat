50|$|There {{are various}} {{techniques}} that a winemaker can employ {{to minimize the}} chances of a stuck fermentation happening. The most common is to use a cultured yeast strain with a high alcohol and high temperature tolerance coupled by diligent control of the fermentation temperature. Another technique is to add yeast nutrients like nitrogen to the must. The ammonium salt diammonium phosphate, or <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient,</b> is a popular inexpensive means of ensuring the must has sufficient nitrogen. Whatever technique the winemaker uses, each has the potential to subtly or drastically affect the resulting flavor and quality of the wine.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen supplements, {{particularly}} DAP, stimulates yeast {{reproduction and}} can greatly increase the biomass. This {{could have the}} consequence of speeding up the fermentation rate faster than what a winemaker may desire and will also increase the fermentation temperature due to the heat being generated by the yeast.

50|$|Once the must is in a {{fermentation}} vessel, yeast naturally {{present on}} the skins of the grapes, or in the environment, will sooner or later start the alcoholic fermentation, in which sugars present in the must are converted into alcohol with carbon dioxide and heat as by-products. Many winemakers, however, prefer to control the fermentation process more closely by adding specially selected yeasts usually of the species Saccharomyces ellipsoideous. Several hundred different strains of wine yeast are available commercially, and many winemakers believe that particular strains {{are more or less}} suitable for the vinification of different grape varieties and different styles of wine. It is also common to add <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> at this stage, often in the form of diammonium phosphate.|$|E
50|$|Dunder is {{the liquid}} {{left in a}} boiler after distilling a batch of rum. It is a {{traditional}} flavor source used in the fermentation of the wash of Jamaican rum. Similar in process to sour mash in Bourbon whiskey, it is a crucial step in achieving an authentic rum flavor.Dunder contains many by-products that help in future fermentations, including dead yeast cells, which are an excellent <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient.</b> Subsequent fermentations using dunder must be carefully controlled to prevent stress on the yeast which will cause a greater amount of mutations. Also if planning to store dunder before use it is advised to refrigerate the dunder to suppress cell division as to prevent mutations. These mutations change flavor, alcohol content, and overall effect consistency of the finished product. Dunder, if not used to re-pitch the yeast colony, can also be applied as fertilizer.|$|E

Other than the grape varieties traditionally used for wine-making, most fruits naturally lack either sufficient fermentable sugars, relatively low acidity, <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrients</b> needed to promote or maintain fermentation, or a combination of these three characteristics. This is probably one of the main reasons why wine derived from grapes has historically been more prevalent by far than other types, and why specific types of fruit wine have generally been confined to regions in which the fruits were native or introduced for other reasons.|$|R
40|$|Icewine is an {{intensely}} sweet, unique dessert wine fennented from the juice of grapes that have frozen naturally on the vine. The juice pressed from the frozen grapes is highly concentrated, {{ranging from a}} minimum of 35 ° Brix to approximately 42 ° Brix. Often Icewine fennentations are sluggish, taking months to reach the desired ethanol level, and sometimes become stuck. In 6 addition, Icewines {{have high levels of}} volatile acidity. At present, there is no routine method of yeast inoculation for fennenting Icewine. This project investigated two yeast inoculum levels, 0. 2 gIL and 0. 5 gIL. The fennentation kinetics of inoculating these yeast levels directly into the sterile Icewine juice or conditioning the cells to the high sugar levels using a step wise acclimatization procedure were also compared. The effect of adding GO-FERM, a <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient,</b> was also assessed. In the sterile fennentations, yeast inoculated at 0. 2 gIL stopped fennenting before the required ethanol level was achieved, producing only 7. 8 % (v/v) and 8. 1 % (v/v) ethanol for the direct and conditioned inoculations, respectively. At 0. 5 gIL, the stepwise conditioned cells fennented the most sugar, producing 12. 2 % (v/v) ethanol, whereas the direct inoculum produced 10. 5 % (v/v) ethanol. The addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> GO-FERM increased the rate of biomass accumulation, but reduced the ethanol concentration in wines fennented at 0. 5 gIL. There {{was no significant difference in}} acetic acid concentration in the final wines across all treatments. Fennentations using unfiltered Icewine juice at the 0. 5 gIL inoculum level were also compared to see if the effects of yeast acclimatization and micronutrient addition had the same impact on fennentation kinetics and yeast metabolite production as observed in the sterile-filtered juice fennentations. In addition, a full descriptive analysis of the finished wines was carried out to further assess the impact of yeast inoculation method on Icewine sensory quality. At 0. 5 gIL, the stepwise conditioned cells fennented the most sugar, producing 11. 5 % (v/v) ethanol, whereas the direct inoculum produced 10. 0 % (v/v) ethanol. The addition of the <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> GO-FERM increased the peak viable cell numbers, but reduced the ethanol concentration in wines fennented at 0. 5 gIL. There was a significant difference 7 in acetic acid concentration in the final wines across all treatments and all treatments affected the sensory profiles of the final wines. Wines produced by direct inoculation were described by grape and raisin aromas and butter flavour. The addition of GO-FERM to the direct inoculation treatment shifted the aroma/flavour profiles to more orange flavour and aroma, and a sweet taste profile. StepWise acclimatizing the cells resulted in wines described more by peach and terpene aroma. The addition of GO-FERM shifted the profile to pineapple and alcohol aromas as well as alcohol flavour. Overall, these results indicate that the addition of GO-FERM and yeast acclimatization shortened the length of fermentation and impacted the sensory profiles of the resultant wines...|$|E

30|$|In {{the context}} of ethanol {{production}} from alternative sources, {{as well as the}} possibilities to agregate technologies in the process, not only cellulase but also the protease activities were screened in the bacteria evaluated in this study.

40|$|Pollen is the {{reproductive}} agent of flowering plants; palynology is utilized by archaeologists because sporopollenin, {{a major component}} in the exine of pollen grains, is resistant to decay and morphologically distinctive. Wine, beer, and mead {{have been identified in}} the archaeological record by palynological assessment due to indicator species or due to a pollen profile similar to that recovered from honey, a common source of sugar in a variety of fermented beverages. While most palynologists have assumed that pollen grains are resistant to alcoholic fermentation, a recent study in food science implies that pollen is a <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> because pollen-enriched meads produce more alcohol. The experiment presented here explores the potential distortion of the pollen record through fermentation by brewing a traditional, pollen-rich mead with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this experiment, the pollen grains did not undergo any discernible morphological changes nor were distorted in the pollen profile. Any nutrition that the yeast garners from the pollen therefore leaves sporopollenin intact. These results support palynological research on residues of alcoholic beverages and confirms that the fermentation process does not distort the pollen profile of the original substance. The paper concludes with the potential and limits of palynological study to assess fermentation within the archaeological record. </p...|$|E

This survey on Protosteloid Amoebae is the first from Central Africa; the previous records for the African continent were restricted to Egypt, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. Methods - Aerial litter samples, collected in 2010 during the "Boyekoli Ebale Congo" expedition in the Congo River basin between the cities of Kisangani and Bumba, were put into culture on wMY medium, a weak malt <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> agar medium. Results - The aerial litter cultures revealed 23 species representing 70 % {{of the total number of}} species described worldwide. Two of these taxa, Schizoplasmodiopsis reticulata and Schizoplasmodium seychellarum, are new records for the African continent. The isolate LHIO 5 was observed for the first time on a substrate collected outside Hawai'i. In addition, 5 unknown taxa were observed. A selection of micrographs is presented of the new recorded species, the unknown taxa and all their related species observed in this study.

30|$|In many viticultural regions {{the natural}} {{nutrient}} composition of grape juice is considered suboptimal and {{may lead to}} a variety of fermentation problems including slow or stuck fermentations and formation of undesirable off-flavours (Blateyron and Sablayrolles 2001; Henschke and Jiranek 1993; Mendes-Ferreira et al. 2009; Sablayrolles et al. 1996; Schmidt et al. 2011; Torrea et al. 2011; Ugliano et al. 2010). To alleviate these deficiencies, various <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrient</b> preparations are often added to the juice prior to or during alcoholic fermentation, to contribute to the production of a quality wine. Among the nutrient supplements allowed by wine regulatory authorities in many countries are vitamins, inorganic nitrogen, usually in the form of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and organic nutrient preparations. The latter are typically prepared from inactive or autolysed yeast and are therefore usually composed of lipids, micro- and macro-elements, amino nitrogen, mannoproteins and insoluble material (for example see Pozo-Bayón (2009). Effects of these nutrients on the formation of key aroma groups in wine have been studied widely. The concentration of esters and higher alcohols, which impart fruity and fusel aromas respectively, were found to be influenced mostly by nitrogen availability (reviewed by Bell and Henschke (2005). Nitrogen is also considered a key modulator in the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, including H 2 S, a highly potent compound which possesses an odour reminiscent of rotten egg (Rauhut 1993).|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that flies respond to dilute food solutions by compensatory feeding. The existence of compensation mechanisms calls for a reconsideration of the relationships between diet, feeding behaviour and longevity. This study shows that flies fed on liquid diets, sense sucrose and <b>yeast</b> <b>nutrients</b> and adapt to changes in the quantity and presentation of the two nutrients. They have a marked preference for sucrose and regulate their sucrose intake more tightly than their yeast intake. These preferences are not modified as fly age from 1 day to 30 days. Compensatory feeding suppresses the beneficial action of dietary restriction on longevity when flies are fed on liquid diets supplemented with yeast extracts. Flies which are given the choice to feed on separate yeast and sucrose food sources were longer lived than flies fed on nutrient mixtures. We conclude that flies sense and respond to specific nutrients and that food presentation is a major factor which determines the sensitivity of flies to dietary restriction...|$|R
