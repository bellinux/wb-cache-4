5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was a need for technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox <b>yokes</b> or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control <b>yokes</b> rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: seeing something that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of <b>yokes</b> together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yoke</b> valves {{are rated}} between 200 and 240 bar, and {{there does not}} appear to be any {{mechanical}} design detail preventing connection between any <b>yoke</b> fittings, though some older <b>yoke</b> clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke cylinder valve as the <b>yoke</b> is too narrow.|$|R
40|$|MHWirth {{has given}} the thesis of {{designing}} a new lifting <b>yoke</b> as a multidisciplinary project. The new <b>yoke</b> is required to lift more than the parallel <b>yoke</b> currently supplied by the company. The necessary instrumentation and hydraulic components to operate it safely and efficiently is required. A cost estimation from both disciplines on the <b>yoke</b> parts will be done. The project group has through a concept phase, designed a new lifting <b>yoke</b> approved by the company. The design {{is based on a}} design of a pallet fork. In the pre-engineering phase the group was divided into the respective disciplines. A complete mechanical design and a hydraulic system have been developed, along with a through selection of electrical components. The hydraulic system, together with the mechanical movements has been analyzed to compare the new <b>yoke</b> with the parallel <b>yoke,</b> in terms of operational efficiency. The new <b>yoke</b> is potentially more efficient than the parallel <b>yoke</b> due to the amount of pipes transported simultaneously. An analysis of the time used on mechanical movements has shown that the <b>yoke</b> is able to compete on an equal level of efficiency as existing equipment. The new <b>yoke</b> fulfills the requirements of lifting capabilities set from the company. The project group has done a cost estimation based on NOK/kg, and a supplied parts list for the electrical and hydraulic equipment on the parallel <b>yoke.</b> The total cost of 443 kNOK for the new <b>yoke</b> will act as a recommendation to continue the engineering of the <b>yoke...</b>|$|R

50|$|A <b>yoked</b> {{control design}} is a {{research}} design used in experiments in which matched research subjects are <b>yoked</b> (joined together) by receiving the same stimuli or conditions. In operant conditioning the <b>yoked</b> subject receives the same treatment in terms of reinforcement or punishment.|$|R
25|$|The control <b>yokes</b> also {{vary greatly}} amongst aircraft. There are <b>yokes</b> where roll is {{controlled}} by rotating the yoke clockwise/counterclockwise (like steering a car) and pitch {{is controlled by}} tilting the control column towards you or away from you, but in others the pitch is controlled by sliding the yoke {{into and out of}} the instrument panel (like most Cessnas, such as the 152 and 172), and in some the roll is controlled by sliding the whole yoke to the left and right (like the Cessna 162). Centre sticks also vary between aircraft. Some are directly connected to the control surfaces using cables, others (fly-by-wire airplanes) have a computer in between which then controls the electrical actuators.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{breeding}} {{horses and}} introducing improved machinery, the earl was keen to continue using draught-oxen {{when they were}} going out of favour elsewhere. Young records that by experiment traditional wooden <b>yokes</b> {{were found to be}} superior to horse-style collars.|$|E
25|$|Fruits can {{be eaten}} raw as pulp when fully ripe. The wood {{can be used}} for spoons and tool handles, poles and <b>yokes,</b> but also {{provides}} fire wood and can be made into charcoal. A potion to treat stomach-ache can be produced by boiling the roots.|$|E
25|$|Most {{instruments}} are suspended or {{supported by a}} U-shaped <b>yoke,</b> fixed at two points {{to the sides of}} the instrument, providing an axis of rotation. The base of the <b>yoke</b> is typically a single bolt around which the <b>yoke</b> can be rotated, providing a second axis of rotation. Combined together, these two axis allow the fixture to point nearly anywhere in a spherical range of motion encircling the <b>yoke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Yoke</b> front boxers {{are similar}} to gripper boxers in that the wide {{waistband}} <b>yoke</b> can be opened up completely, and the <b>yoke</b> usually has three snaps to close it while the fly itself, below, has no closure mechanism. There {{are two types of}} <b>yoke</b> boxers: one {{in which there is a}} short piece of elastic on each side of the waistband which snugs up the <b>yoke</b> to fit the waist; and [...] "tie-sides" [...] which have narrow cloth tapes on each side of the waist <b>yoke,</b> like strings, which are tightened and knotted by the wearer to make an exact fit. This style of underwear was very common during World War II, when the rubber needed for elastic waistbands had to be used for military purposes.|$|R

25|$|An early {{example of}} an {{aircraft}} shot down in a dogfight whilst on a World War I bombing raid occurred near Frinsted on 19 May 1918. A German Gotha GV 979 heavy bomber was engaged by British fighters and crashed in fields near the village with one survivor who was captured. At {{least one of the}} German airmen killed was initially buried in Frinsted churchyard before being moved to a military cemetery at Cannock Chase. Previously fields at <b>Yokes</b> Court near the village had been used as a Royal Air Force airfield between February 1917 and November 1917. A private airfield for light aircraft still operates on the <b>Yokes</b> Court site and a second private airstrip exists at The Glebe, a collection of fields immediately to the east of the village.|$|E

25|$|John Ford hired Canutt on John Wayne's {{recommendation}} for Stagecoach, where Canutt supervised the river-crossing scene {{as well as}} the Indian chase scene, did the stagecoach drop, and doubled for Wayne in the coach stunts. For safety during the stagecoach drop stunt, Canutt devised modified <b>yokes</b> and tongues, to give extra handholds and extra room between the teams. Ford told him that whenever Ford made an action picture and Canutt wasn't working elsewhere, he was on Ford's payroll. Also in 1939, Canutt doubled Clark Gable in the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind; he also appeared as a renegade accosting Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) as she crosses a bridge in a carriage driving through a shantytown.|$|E
40|$|Two {{magnetron}} sputtering devices have been numerically analyzed {{and the results}} have been experimentally validated. For the first device it has been inferred that a ferromagnetic <b>yoke</b> is not present, while the second one has a ferromagnetic <b>yoke.</b> It is shown numerically that either the adding of the <b>yoke,</b> in the first case, or the removal of the <b>yoke,</b> in the second one, has limited effects in the magnetic configuration over the cathode. The same result has been obtained with a dummy case study, where a parametric analysis for considering devices with different sizes, with and without <b>yoke,</b> has been performed...|$|R

25|$|The Katana {{provides}} excellent {{external visibility}} to its pilots via {{the use of}} an one-piece bubble canopy, which its hinged at the rear, enabling easy entry using the built-in steps. The cockpit features a comprehensive six-unit instrumentation panel on the left-hand side, the majority of avionics-related controls and displays {{in the center of the}} console, and engine-specific elements are allocated to the right-hand panel. The Katana makes use of individual stick-type flight control, as opposed to <b>yokes,</b> along with key engine controls on a centrally-positioned pedestal. There has been positive reports on the aircraft's comfort, the crew accommodated on fixed-position reclined seats with a small personal stowage area located directly behind; the noise levels are so low that headsets are typically unnecessary for voice communication, although an intercom system is integrated for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 1836, Ward and King were {{attacked}} by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as {{they were about to}} leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to Victoria. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria. Other dispatches were intercepted by the Centralista forces, informing them of Fannin's plans. Fannin needed means of transport and had sent Albert C. Horton and his men to Victoria, to bring carts and 20 <b>yokes</b> of oxen from Army quartermaster John J. Linn, who did return around March 16. Horton's men would later form Fannin's advance guard during the retreat to Victoria. Fannin finally received the news of King and Ward's defeat from Hugh McDonald Frazer on March 17.|$|E
