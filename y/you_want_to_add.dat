40|$|In the {{original}} version of this book {{the founders of the}} Taos Institute pooled their substantial resources to create a vision of a powerful and humanly nourishing form of organization and to share practices for bringing this organization into being. Today, The Appreciative Organization has been revised and updated. Based on the authors 2 ̆ 7 diverse experiences in organizational life, they are unanimous in their view that the appreciative construction of meaning is essential to the efficacy of an organization and the fulfillment of its participants. In clear and direct language, the volume treats the challenges of decision making, leadership, group functioning, personnel evaluation, and the relationship of the organization to its context. Bold ideas are developed, examples described, and multiple suggestions developed for creating the appreciative organization. The revised edition of the book builds upon the ideas, concepts and characteristics of the Appreciative Organization. Now included in the book is a section on helpful resources, a chapter on “valuation”, and much more. <b>You</b> will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> this new “gem” to your personal library.

It could be that you need to reinforce, repair or renovate your exisng fence or maybe you have a new area that needs to be fenced. Fencing is a major expense for livestock managers, and takes considerable me and labor. It is important to plan wisely to achieve the desired results. Objec!ve Where to begin? First, be clear about your objecves. Fencing is designed to keep animals in and o 1 en mes to keep predators out. If this is your goal, choose a fencing system that will do this. It is much easier to select the correct fencing system in the beginning rather than modify it a 1 er it is in place. Important consideraons for a fencing system include: single or mulple species use, budget, maintenance requirements, longevity, safety for people and animals, availability of materials, potenal impact on wildlife, cultural norms and building ordinances or covenants.

40|$|The use of haptics in {{scientific}} visualization has barely begun, yet it already shows great promise. While haptics {{may be useful}} for pure visualization tasks, its true power comes from its ability to allow the user to simultaneously push on and be pushed by the computer. This allows direct and immediate control and sensing of parameters in a simulation. Somewhere {{in the not-too-distant future}} … your simulation has been running for days on the supercomputer. You decided to step in and take a peek to make sure it is going in the right direction. Stepping into the VR station, you bring up a 3 D, tracked view of isosurfaces on the data set. To your surprise, a bubble has formed in the wave front. You can't see anything obvious, so you use your force probe to feel the area around the bubble. Tiny vibrations at the site indicate instability in the simulation due to the simulation grid spacing being too sparse. You can fix the instability by re-meshing, but the bubble is still there. You need to push it back up to match the wave, but <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> too much energy at any time step in order to avoid introducing more instability. By mapping the derivative of <b>added</b> energy <b>to</b> force, you feel the amount you are adding and are able to smoothly pull the simulation back on track. These musings give glimpses of where haptic visualization may lead us. Let’s take a look as where we are and how we got here.

Some changes in requirements can be anticipated by software devel opers, but unanticipated changes of requirements occur repeatedly in practice, and they cannot be prepared for by definition. Furthermore, changes to software can usually be made e#ective only by stopping an old version of a program and starting the new one.

50|$|Re-potting: Potting Terrestrial Orchids Good {{drainage}} is important. Mix 3 parts fibrous peat, 3 parts coarse grit, 1 part perlite, and 1 part charcoal. Select a pot {{that will}} accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make {{sure that it}} has a drainage hole. Hold the orchid over the pot so that the crown is just below the rim of the pot. With your other hand, fill pot with moistened soil mix, tamping to firm. There really is no need <b>to</b> <b>add</b> crockery <b>to</b> the bottom of the pot, but <b>you</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>add</b> a small square of wire mesh or other permiable fabric over hole in bottom of pot. Potting Epiphytic Orchids Epiphytes prefer conditions where roots can be exposed, therefore, tight pots and close-contact soil mixes do not work well and will induce rot. Mix 3 parts dust-free, medium-grade bark, 1 part coarse grit or perlite, 1 part charcoal, and 1 part peat moss together, OR use a commercial orchid mix. As with the terrestrial orchid, select a pot that will accommodate roots and about 2 years growth, but no more. Make sure {{that it has a}} drainage hole. Even better, select an orchid pot, which has vertical slits down sides. Hold orchid over pot so that crown is just below the rim of the pot. With other hand, fill pot with moistened bark mix, tamping to firm. Some epiphytes {{do not need to be}} potted and prefer to grow on a mound or slab of bark. Until roots attach, tie orchid in place with fishing line. Constant humidity is a must. Support Orchids that have long flower stalks will need staking. Staking is best done as stem grows and before buds open. Many growers prefer to insert stake when potting orchid, but it is up to you.|$|R
