5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how I think every woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E

But I think I’ve become pretty good at sussing out when people's opinions of my work are coming from {{what they think of}} me personally. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to do your thing and then let it go out into the world. The rest, you're not in control.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} {{attempted to}} recreate the films' characters and events in a [...] "cute" [...] way. Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker [...] "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker [...] "performs an all-out acrobatic routine {{with all sorts of}} jumps from the plank. It's hilarious". LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, [...] "unless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of [...] the first time you see them – <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to. They're so darn cute!" ...|$|E
500|$|Shearer's pitch {{featured}} Vash, who {{had last}} been {{seen at the}} end of [...] "QPid" [...] leaving with Q, but the pitch did not include Q himself. Executive producer Michael Piller explained that they had already been {{looking for a way to}} introduce Q into DS9, and felt that bringing Vash onto the show would be a good way to seamlessly introduce Q. There were concerns about shoving Q into an episode but the idea of [...] "Q-Less" [...] alleviated them. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> him come on and say 'Look, is this the new show?' it's silly, but this seemed to be a justifiable way", Piller recalled.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} campaign's launch, Party Committees {{provided}} instruction to judges reminding {{them of the}} political goals that their work must uphold. According to one document issued to judges in Zhejiang and quoted by Human Rights Watch, [...] "Recently, some judges have started to believe {{that to be a}} judge <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to strictly apply the law in a case. In fact, this kind of concept is erroneous [...] all the legal formulations have a clear political background and direction [...] We must stamp out the kind of narrow viewpoint that thinks that you can also do court work by having judicial independence." ...|$|E

He instructed the graduating class that [...] "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you've not fooled yourself, it's easy not to fool other scientists. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to be honest in a conventional way after that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27–20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run the way we wanted them to. They were a little impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too soon. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to give the play a chance and let it go where it's supposed to." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 13–15, 2009, Keenan debuted Puscifer at the Pearl Concert Theater in Palms Casino Resort in Paradise, Nevada, with a cabaret-style show so {{abstract}} it is {{not easily}} described. In {{an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times, Keenan stated [...] "we didn't really have any clue what to call it, so we just kind of called it cabaret." [...] Keenan—who has had previous experience with this type of entertainment, having fronted a similar show in Los Angeles before achieving fame with Tool—went on to add that [...] "you just can't really describe it, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to see it, then it makes sense." [...] Featuring an ever-changing lineup of artists including Milla Jovovich and Primus drummer Tim Alexander, the show was originally said to have a long-term residency at the Pearl; however, Keenan later revealed that it was to be only a two-show performance.|$|E
500|$|After {{everyone}} {{finds out}} about Martha's situation, {{they try to}} stop her working in the club. Kate Ritchie who plays on-screen friend Sally Fletcher discussed how Martha would not take any advice from those closest to her and how Sally and Alf {{have to pick up}} the pieces for her in the end. She compared Martha's pole dancing to many real life experiences ordinary people go through. Sally's interference made Martha's situation worse, of this Ritche added: [...] "It's been hard for Sally to realise and Alf as well, just that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to stand back and let it run its course and be there at the end." [...] Of Martha's downward spiral and pushing her friends away, Gordon stated: [...] "Now she's found herself in this hole, she ruined all these relationships with her family, her friends, Jack, everyone's trying to help her and she's really against everyone, she's in a really bad place at the moment".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> got to keep on top of that." ...|$|E

[...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
500|$|Having {{experienced}} both {{avenues of}} recording {{on a major}} label and later choosing to be an independent artist, a combination of musicianship with business know-how has helped give Joseph staying power in the notoriously competitive world of music. [...] He {{spends most of his}} time writing songs, composing arrangements, making recordings, and publishing and distributing his works. [...] "I'm my own boss. I can do what I want. I can change directions", he told West Central Tribune's Anne Polta. [...] As an independent, business is a prime concern and can take over if not controlled, Joseph said. [...] "A lot of musicians don't learn the business. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to be well-rounded in both areas. You have to understand publishing. You have to understand how you make money, what's in demand, what helps you make the most out of your talent." [...] "I couldn't license my music if it wasn't mine", he said. [...] "It has allowed me to create CDs. It separates you from the million other great players." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E

500|$|The brawling {{continued}} in 1990. During an August 9 game at Shea, Gooden hit Phillies hitters Dickie Thon and Tommy Herr. When Gooden came to bat {{in the fifth}} inning, Phillies pitcher Pat Combs hit Gooden in the knee with a fastball. Phillies outfielder Von Hayes defended Combs after the game, [...] "Gooden better expect retaliation if he keeps hitting guys with [...] fastballs. We've got to protect our players." [...] Gooden charged the mound and tackled Combs. Phillies catcher Darren Daulton followed Gooden and landed a series of punches {{on the back of}} Gooden's head. Darryl Strawberry had been in the Mets clubhouse and rushed the field after Daulton but was himself blindsided by Hayes. Of Daulton, Gooden later said, [...] "Daulton was the guy we wanted most. He's a cheap-shot artist. We learned that about him last year", referring to the September 1989 fight. Six players and Phillies coach Mike Ryan were ejected from the game. Eight players were later fined, including the Mets' Tim Teufel, who said, [...] "It was money well spent. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to defend yourself and your teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lola" [...] {{was written}} as a {{critique}} of mainstream societal treatment of romantic love and heartbreak society. [...] "A wife’s just a whore with a diamond ring", Ndegéocello's sang. She drew inspiration from matchmaking reality television shows that presented love as a [...] "really clear exchange". [...] "I hear young women going 'well if he can buy me something'", Ndegéocello explained. [...] "That song—'Put It in the Bag'—which is based on 'can you buy me some things?' And then the male counterpart, all he can really talk about is sex and if the woman can cook. And it’s funny to me. That you're {{no more than a}} whore, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> a wedding ring." [...] "Bright Shiny Morning" [...] was titled after the book of the same name by James Frey. Ndegéocello wrote the song after reflecting on her past lies and misrepresentations, particularly those she made in an attempt to be accepted in the music industry. [...] "People change themselves", she said. [...] "Almost in the sense of creating mental anguish in order to make other people happy and to obtain celebrity and fame. That's why the lyric is 'you do anything.' Some people do anything for their big dreams of sunshine." ...|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t quite make it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
