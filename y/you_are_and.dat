Attach yourself to someone smarter, prettier, more fashionable, hipper, funnier than <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> you will automatically acquire these missing qualities by osmosis.

25|$|NBC's {{broadcast}} of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, in February of that year, generated a ratings increase of 21% over its {{broadcast of}} the 2006 Winter Games in Torino. The network was criticized for repeatedly showing footage of a crash occurring during practice for an Olympic luge competition that killed Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. NBC News president Steve Capus ordered the footage not to be shown without his permission and Olympics prime time host Bob Costas promised on-air that the video would not be shown again during the Games. NBC Universal was on track to lose $250 million in advertising revenue on that year's Winter Olympics, failing {{to make up the}} $820 million it paid for the U.S. television rights. Even so, with its continuing position in fourth place (although it virtually tied with ABC in many demographics on the strength of NBC's sports broadcasts that year), the 2009–10 season ended with only two scripted shows – Community and Parenthood, as well as three unscripted shows – The Marriage Ref, Who Do You Think <b>You</b> <b>Are?</b> <b>and</b> Minute to Win It – being renewed for second seasons, while other series such as Heroes and veteran crime drama Law & Order (the latter of which ended after 20 seasons, tying it with Gunsmoke as the longest-running prime time drama in U.S. television history) were cancelled.|$|E

500|$|Gaga {{said the}} song [...] "was just me {{trying to figure}} things out", and she later stated that she [...] "was {{doing a lot of}} drugs" [...] when she wrote the song.

The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with.

500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard."

[...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} for its variety {{of weapons and}} enemies.

Maximum PC reviewer Josh Norem praised the levels for their interesting objectives, stating that the missions [...] "vary widely, ranging from finding lost colleagues to defending strategic structures against enemy assaults". Computer Games Magazine praised {{the fact that the}} developers replaced the wire-frame automaps of previous Descent games with flat-shaded polygons because they [...] "provide more detail and make it easier to recognize where <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> how to get where you want to go". The multiplayer was highlighted positively due to its replay value and variety of game types. Computer Games Magazine also credited its [...] "rock-solid performance on standard dialup modems and easy connectivity", while GameSpot praised it for being [...] "fun and stable". The game was a runner-up for GameSpy's Action Game of the Year and a nominee for GameSpot's PC Action Game of the Year. Despite the positive reviews, the game did not perform well in sales. As a result, Daily Radar awarded the game a [...] "System Shock Award", named after the Looking Glass Studios 1994 game of the same name, implying that Descent 3 is a [...] "game that the critics loved but is over-shadowed by lesser or greater games".|$|E
500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard".

[...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself".
