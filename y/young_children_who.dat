5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E

25|$|The Bhotiyas have {{distinctive}} funerary traditions. <b>Young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> die {{of cholera}} or snakebite are buried {{while others are}} cremated. There is no fixed burial ground, and no ceremonies are performed {{at the time of}} burial. The wealthy keep the ashes for lowal to several streams, while others bury them. After cremation, a stalk of kusha (grass) is fixed in the ground near a tank of water and sesamum is poured on it for ten days. This makes it a refuge for the deceased's spirit until the rites are completed.|$|E
25|$|Psychiatrist Ian Stevenson, {{from the}} University of Virginia, {{investigated}} many reports of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> claimed {{to remember a}} past life. He conducted more than 2,500 case studies {{over a period of}} 40 years and published twelve books, including Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation and Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect. Stevenson methodically documented each child's statements and then identified the deceased person the child identified with, and verified the facts of the deceased person's life that matched the child's memory. He also matched birthmarks and birth defects to wounds and scars on the deceased, verified by medical records such as autopsy photographs, in Reincarnation and Biology.|$|E
25|$|During late 2015, {{work being}} done on St Peter's Burial Ground in advance of road {{construction}} involved the disinterment of the remains of nearly 2,000 individuals who had been buried there during the cemetery's period of operation (1821-1945). The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter's Church, a large one which seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists found that {{nearly half of the}} bodies were those of <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and gastrointestinal system. The numbers are taken as reflecting the massive increase in the city's population during that period due to its booming textile industry, which led to unhealthy living situations among the working classes.|$|E

25|$|Proper {{nutrition}} {{is important}} for health and functioning, including the prevention of infectious diarrhea. It is especially important to <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> {{do not have a}} fully developed immune system. Zinc deficiency, a condition often found in children in developing countries can, even in mild cases, {{have a significant impact on}} the development and proper functioning of the human immune system. Indeed, this relationship between zinc deficiency and reduced immune functioning corresponds with an increased severity of infectious diarrhea. Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea, severe diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with fever. Similarly, vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes. However, there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease. While some argue that a relationship does not exist between the rate of disease and vitamin A status, others suggest an increase in the rate associated with deficiency. Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient, this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V.

He thus complimented [...] "Web Weirdos" [...] for exploring this topic through the idiosyncratic tale of two married but ultimately unhappy spiders, calling this decision one of [...] "the reason why Adventure Time has such crossover appeal". Sava also complimented the performances of both Essman and Goldthwait, noting that the two [...] "make a great pair, capturing the stakes of the couple’s fight without sacrificing the comedy of the situation." ...|$|E
500|$|Gavin Fuller, {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraphs website, {{described}} the episode as [...] "a rollercoaster ride of thrills and spills". He praised the forest scenes, {{saying they were}} [...] "easily {{the highlight of the}} episode, taking in a whole range of emotions as the nature and scale of the threat facing the Doctor, Amy, River and the clerics shifted as the episode progressed." [...] However he expressed uncertainty over Amy's [...] "attempted seduction of the Doctor", claiming that it [...] "did seem out of keeping with the usual tone of the series", and that [...] "Given the number of <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watch, {{it may not have been}} the most appropriate of scenes to screen".|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of Lee's death, instead of {{recasting}} the role, or explaining his departure by saying he had moved, quit or retired, the writers and producers of Sesame Street decided to create an episode that taught their young audience about the difficult topic of death. [...] Research was conducted to ascertain the messages they wanted to convey about the topic, {{as well as the}} effect the episode would have on the <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> watched it. [...] They were advised by experts in the fields of child psychology, child development, and religion. [...] Studies conducted after the episode was produced showed that most children understood its messages about death, and that they experienced no long-term ill effects. [...] The episode, written by head writer Norman Stiles, aired on Thanksgiving Day 1983; the cast and crew reported that filming it was an emotional and touching experience. [...] The episode, which set the standard for dealing with difficult topics on children's television, was called heartbreaking yet affirming, and one of the proudest moments in the show's history.|$|E
500|$|The mass killings {{continued}} unabated as Indonesian forces advanced on the Fretilin-held mountain {{regions of}} East Timor. A Timorese guide for a senior Indonesian officer told former Australian consul to Portuguese Timor James Dunn {{that during the}} early months of the fighting TNI troops [...] "killed most Timorese they encountered." [...] In February 1976 after capturing the village of Aileu - to the south of Dili - and driving out the remaining Fretilin forces, Indonesian troops machine gunned most of the town's population, allegedly shooting everyone over the age of three. The <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> were spared were taken back to Dili in trucks. At the time Aileu fell to Indonesian forces, the population was around 5,000; by the time Indonesian relief workers visited the village in September 1976 only 1,000 remained. In June 1976, TNI troops badly battered by a Fretilin attack exacted retribution against a large refugee camp housing 5-6,000 Timorese at Lamaknan near the West Timor border. After setting several houses on fire, Indonesian soldiers massacred as many as 2,000 men, women and children.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} episode aired, {{a copy of}} the Pawnee Summer Catalog 2010 that was {{featured}} in the episode was made available for download on the official Parks and Recreation website. The map of Pawnee contained within the catalog is based off the map of central Christchurch, New Zealand. Within a week of the episode's original broadcast, two deleted scenes from [...] "Summer Catalog" [...] were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website. In the first, a two-minute clip, April and Andy flirt while walking along a trail to set up Leslie's picnic. When April complains about her feet hurting, Andy volunteers to give her a piggyback ride. Later, Leslie tries to write her summer catalog letter based on the picnic, but struggles due to how rude the four men acted. The second clip, which lasted two minutes and 15 seconds, includes further scenes of Tom leading Ann and Mark through a photo shoot at the park. Tom forces them to enter into unusual, avant-garde poses, and yells at <b>young</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> {{get in the way of}} the shot while playing.|$|E

500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. {{sought to}} {{maintain}} Selena's image clean and family-oriented. In 1989, she was offered sponsorship from beer companies {{but her father}} turned them down. Selena was often refused gigs at Tejano venues {{because she was a}} female singer in a male-dominated music scene. Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena's popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her [...] "beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene". Selena said she never wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of <b>young</b> <b>children,</b> <b>who</b> regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will [...] "stay the same" [...] and that her English-language recordings will refrain from foul language and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena's death that the singer was a [...] "sweet and charismatic girl". According to Arrarás, Selena [...] "trusted everyone"; she often went shopping alone, despite her father's concerns over her safety.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} of [...] "My Love" [...] was aired {{for the very}} first time on television on 31 August 2008, during the 43rd annual MDA Labor Day Telethon.

On 1 December 2008, she performed [...] "My Love" [...] on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. On 13 December 2008, her official website posted a behind-the-scenes clip of Dion in the recording sessions for the song, [...] "There Comes a Time."
