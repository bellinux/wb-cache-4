Then she trots away, planning her hunt, till she disappears down by the brook. When she is gone, eyes and noses draw back; only a dark silent hole in the bank is left.

The role of manganese in the prevention of perosis and certain manganese interactions were also considered in this research. The specific objectives of this investigation were: (1) to determine the quantitative requirements of manganese for <b>young</b> <b>turkeys,</b> 0 - 4 weeks of age, (2) to study the effects of manganese and manganese interactions on growth and hock development of turkey poults, (3) to study the need for supplemental manganese in practical corn-soybean meal diets for <b>young</b> <b>turkeys.</b> Five experiments were conducted with day-old Broad Breasted Bronze turkeys. Four of the experiments were of four weeks duration, while experiment III was continued to eight weeks. Straight-run poults were used in experiments I, III, and V; female poults were used in experiments II and IV. In each experiment the poults were selected at random, wingbanded, weighed and assigned to dietary treatments. The birds were maintained in electrically heated battery brooders on raised wire floors. The experimental diets and water were supplied ad libitum. Individual body weights were recorded at weekly intervals. The feed consumption of birds assigned to each dietary treatment was determined at the termination of experiments I, II, III, and V. Samples of the basal diet from all experiments were analyzed for manganese content. The basal diets used in experiments II and V were also analyzed for zinc and sodium content. The analyses of the diets from the first four experiments were run by the Calcium Carbonate Company, Quincy, Illinois.

Supplementing feed with probiotics has shown to enhance the Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT) development of chickens and turkeys.

However, the effect of this probiotic on GIT development has not been studied.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of {{vasoactive}} intestinal peptide (VIP) in prolactin (PRL) release in <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> poults. Poults obtained from hens immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) -chicken VIP (cVIP-KLH) conjugate or with KLH alone were used in this study. Plasma VIP antibody was tested by means of monoiodinated cVIP. Plasma samples were prediluted (1 : 100) in 0. 05 EDTA PBS and used as a source of primary antibody in a cVIP-binding assay. Antibody levels averaged 50. 8 ± 10. 3 % at hatch and then declined with age to a level of 5. 0 2. 1 % after 3 wk. Plasma PRL concentration was lower in cVIP-KLH-immunized poults (p < 0. 05) than in KLH-immunized birds. Exogenous VIP administration at 7 days of age (7. 8 ag/kg) increased plasma PRL level (p < 0. 05) to a peak value of 359 + 32 ng/ml in the KLH-immunized birds. A smaller increase (p < 0. 05) was obtained when the KLH-immunized poults received injections at 2 and 3 wk of age. The PRL response to cVIP administration was not observed in 1 - and 2 -wk-old poults maternally immunized with cVIP-KLH. Similarly, electrical stimulation of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, at 1 and 8 days of age, induced a significant increase in the plasma PRL level of maternally KLH-immunized birds but not in maternally cVIP-KLH-immunized birds. These findings suggest that cVIP is a PRL-releasing factor in <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> poults, similar to the finding in adult turkey hens...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Day-old turkey poults were {{obtained}} from a commercial hatchery which hatched eggs from a particular flock of breeders that produced a considerable num-ber (5 - 10 %) of culls. These cull poults showed symptoms almost classical for polyneuritis. Injection of the poults with a combination vitamin mixture containing thiamine, or of thiamine alone, caused decreased mortality and a remission of symptoms. Poults injected with thiamine grew and developed normally when fed a practical type diet. The addition of 2 mg. /kg. of thiamine to the breeder ration caused the condition to disappear in newly-hatched poults from the particular flock involved. Classical symptoms of polyneuritis were noted in newly-hatched quail from breeding flocks fed turkey breeder rations. These quail responded positively to thiamine injection. POULTKY SCIENCE 51 : 419 - 423, 1972 THE thiamine requirement for maxi-mum hatchability in chickens has been reported by Polin et al. (1963). These workers reported that a minimum yolk level of 0. 63 p. p. m. of thiamine was neces-sary for maximum hatchability. Their data indicated that a normal dietary level of 0. 68 p. p. m. would produce this level of thi-amine in the yolk. Sullivan et al. (1967) and Robenalt, (1960), reported the thia-mine requirement of <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> poults to be between 1. 2 and 2 p. p. m. Armintrout et al. (1964), suggested that the require-ment for thiamine by the <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> in-creases with age. Little is known of the fre-quency of thiamine deficiency among com-mercial turkey flocks. The natural abun-dance of thiamine in feed ingredients sug-gests that the condition is rare. However, borderline cases may occasionally go unrec-ognized. The present studies were initiated to in-vestigate a field problem apparently related to thiamine deficiency in newly-hatched tur-key poults and a polyneuritis condition ob-served in Coturnix quail.

Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not thoroughly evaluated the performance {{of each of the}} pilot projects over time even though the agency stated it would do so when it announced the pilot projects. For example, in 2011, USDA completed a report evaluating the pilot project at 20 young chicken plants concluding that an inspection system based on the pilot project would ensure equivalent, if not better, levels of food safety and quality than currently provided at plants not in the pilot project. However, among the limitations of its evaluation was the use of snapshots of data for two 2 -year periods instead of data {{for the duration of the}} pilot project, which has been ongoing for more than a decade. In addition, USDA did not complete an evaluation on or prepare a report evaluating the pilot project at 5 <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> plants and has no plans to do so because of the small sample size. Nevertheless, in publishing a proposed rule that includes an optional new poultry (chicken and turkey) inspection system, USDA stated that the new system was based on its experience with the pilot projects at young chicken and <b>young</b> <b>turkey</b> plants. As a result, USDA may not have assurance that its evaluation of the pilot project at young chicken plants provides the information necessary to support the proposed rule for both chickens and turkeys. However, the agency will not complete another evaluation before it issues a final rule. USDA has begun drafting a preliminary report evaluating the pilot project at young hog plants using analyses similar to those presented in the report evaluating young chicken plants, suggesting that similar limitations may apply. Agency officials stated that when USDA develops a proposed rulemaking to modify its slaughter inspection system for hogs, the agency will need to decide whether to collect additional data. Without collecting and analyzing additional data, it will be difficult for USDA to draw conclusions about whether the pilot project at young hog plants is meeting its purpose.

To address this, the complete nucleocapsid gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli.
