5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the <b>young</b> <b>male</b> heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with {{small groups of}} birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the <b>young.</b> <b>Male</b> wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an American {{film crew}} disappears in the Amazon {{rainforest}} while filming {{a documentary about}} indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a <b>young</b> <b>male</b> hostage {{in order to help}} negotiate with the natives.

5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the United Kingdom, Middlewich's <b>young</b> <b>male</b> {{population}} was decimated during the First World War. The cenotaph, near to the parish church, lists the names of the 136 men who died in that conflict, representing around 10% of the male population of the town aged between 15 and 45. Forty-two of Middlewich's inhabitants lost their lives in the Second World War, with a further fatality in the Korean War. The Brunner Mond salt works in Brooks Lane also erected a cenotaph in memory of the 16 men from the works killed in the First World War, and the two who died during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the <b>young.</b> <b>Male</b> walruses may help inexperienced young {{as they learn}} to swim, and have even been recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{and critics}} have also often {{associated}} {{the production of}} recent all-female metal acts to the sound and music of Girlschool, identifying them as a band that, just like The Runaways before them, helped in paving {{the way to the}} presence of women in rock music. However, Williams remembered in 2004 how, in her experience, Girlschool were more inspirational for <b>young</b> <b>male</b> musicians than for female ones in starting rock bands. Moreover, important female metal bands of the 2000s, such as Crucified Barbara and Drain STH, denied even of knowing the music of Girlschool. Only the American all-female rock band The Donnas publicly acknowledged the influence of Girlschool on their music.|$|E

5|$|The birds breed {{easily in}} captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, {{she will not}} lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin {{feathers}} at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to <b>young</b> <b>male</b> birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.|$|E

5|$|When {{it reaches}} the pouch, the {{underdeveloped}} joey suckles the teat {{of one of the}} four mammary glands while the others recede. The joey remains attached to the teat for 100–125 days, after which it ceases its attachment but remains in the pouch and continues to suckle, but more intermittently. The joey begins to leave the pouch and eat grass at around 200 days when it is more developed. It still suckles, more forcefully but less regularly. By 250 days, the joey no longer needs the pouch, and it is fully weaned at around 300–350 days.

40|$|Suicide is a {{major cause}} of death among <b>young</b> <b>males</b> on the island of Ireland. Over the past ten years, the rate of deaths from suicide has been five times higher in males than in females. Although the rate of male suicide in Ireland is {{relatively}} low within the overall European Union (EU) context, the rate among <b>young</b> <b>males</b> is amongst the highest in the EU. The recent spike in suicide rates among <b>young</b> <b>males</b> in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland coincides with the economic downturn and increasing levels of unemployment. On the island of Ireland, hanging is the most frequent method of suicide; particularly among young men.

5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark out their own area. A <b>young</b> <b>male</b> acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed {{to learn from the}} trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a <b>young</b> <b>male,</b> a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E
5|$|In late 2005 the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) {{threatened}} action {{over the}} holding in captivity of Mercedes, then Britain's only polar bear. The zoo had initially planned to retire their polar bear exhibit after Mercedes died. When zoo officials {{announced plans to}} create a new attraction, citing their responsibility to ensure the survival of the species, the ALF threatened damage to zoo workers' property and other scare-tactics. Edinburgh's treatment of polar bears had often been subject to criticism, punctuated by incidents like the death in 1997 of Mercedes' partner Barney, who choked on a plastic child's toy thrown into his enclosure. In 2009 the zoo carried out their plans {{to create a new}} exhibit and improve conditions for Mercedes, moving her to the Highland Wildlife Park, where she was joined by a <b>young</b> <b>male</b> polar bear named Walker. Mercedes was euthanized on compassionate grounds in 2011, suffering from severe arthritis.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{evolution}} of sexual dysfunctions among <b>young</b> <b>males</b> after an average of 15  months follow-up to determine the predictive factors for this evolution and the characteristics differentiating <b>young</b> <b>males</b> who continue reporting a sexual dysfunction from those who do not. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study in two Swiss military recruitment centers mandatory for all Swiss national males aged 18 - 25  years. A total of 3, 700 sexually active <b>young</b> <b>males</b> filled out a questionnaire at baseline (T 0) and follow-up (T 1 : 15. 5  months later). Main outcome measures were self-reported premature ejaculation (PE) and erectile dysfunction (ED). RESULTS: Overall, 43. 9 % of <b>young</b> <b>males</b> who reported (PE) and 51 % of those reporting (ED) at T 0 still reported it at T 1. Moreover, 9. 7 % developed a PE problem and 14. 4 % developed an ED problem between T 0 and T 1. Poor mental health, depression, and consumption of medication without prescription were predictive factors for PE and ED. Poor physical health, alcohol consumption, and less sexual experience were predictive factors for PE. ED persistence was associated with having multiple sexual partners. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first longitudinal study to examine sexual dysfunctions among <b>young</b> <b>males.</b> Our results show high prevalence rates among <b>young</b> <b>males</b> for maintaining or developing a sexual dysfunction over time. Consequently, when consulting with <b>young</b> <b>males,</b> health professionals should inquire about sexual dysfunctions {{as part of their}} routine psychosocial assessment and leave the subject open for discussion. Future research should examine in more detail the relationship between sexual dysfunctions and poor mental health...|$|R

5|$|Little Busters! story {{revolves}} around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a <b>young</b> <b>male</b> high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke {{who is in his}} third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.|$|E
5|$|Red {{follows a}} {{familiar}} scent and is reunited with her sister, {{a single mother}} with three chicks. The two hunt together and bring food back to the nest for the young. A white pterosaur, one Red has seen since she hatched, helps the two by finding carrion and prey {{in exchange for a}} helping of meat. On one hunting expedition, when the two adult Utahraptor are stalking a herd of Iguanodon, Red spies a <b>young</b> <b>male</b> Utahraptor that is watching their prey. He begins a courtship dance for Red, but Red's sister chases him off, hissing. Her growls agitate the Iguanodon, who stampede; the male hastily leaves. After climbing into a tree to escape a flash flood, Red encounters the male raptor again, who performs a courtship dance while hanging onto the tree branches. Red's sister begrudgingly allows the male to stay with them, provided he steers clear of her chicks.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM {{involved}} both {{musicians and}} fans who were largely <b>young,</b> <b>male</b> {{and white and}} shared class origin, ethic and aesthetic values. American sociologist Deena Weinstein, in her book Heavy Metal: The Music and Its Culture, describes the rise and growth of the movement as the achievement of maturity for heavy metal, after its birth in the early 1970s and before branching out into various subgenres in the following years. British heavy metal fans, commonly known as muthas, metalheads or headbangers for the violent, rhythmic shaking of their heads {{in time to the}} music, dismissed the simplistic image of rebellious youth inherited from the counterculture of the 1960s and the psychedelic attachments characteristic of heavy rock in the 1970s, updating the shared principles and codes of the heavy metal subculture and definitely separating it from mainstream society.|$|E

5|$|Tito came to Drvar {{at the end}} of January 1943, {{during a}} major Axis {{offensive}} against the Partisans (code-named Fall Weiss in German). After consulting with Đuro Pucar, the head of the KPJ regional committee for Bosanska Krajina, Tito decided to form a Partisan brigade around a battalion of experienced fighters from Drvar. Additional manpower would consist of recovered Partisans who had been wounded or ill, older men not previously in combat units and <b>young</b> <b>male</b> and female volunteers. The four-battalion 10th Krajina Brigade, intended to play a primarily-defensive role at this stage, was established on 4February 1943; its 800 members included about 120 women. Bursać, one of the volunteers, was assigned to the 2nd Battalion and was transferred to the 3rd Battalion's 3rd Company the following month. Until September 1943, she fought the Ustaše, Germans, Italians, and anti-communist Chetniks around Grahovo, Knin, Vrlika, Livno and Mount Dinara, was commended for her courage and skill in combat, and served as a nurse. In February and March 1943, during the Axis offensive, the brigade experienced constant enemy attacks, food shortages, cold, deep snow and outbreaks of typhus. Emaciated, Bursać was transferred to the military kitchen at brigade headquarters at the beginning of spring; after a month, she was returned to her company at her insistence. When she became ill some time later, Bursać was sent home to recover.|$|E
