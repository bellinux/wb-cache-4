500|$|In addition, Tessa {{shares with}} MacLeod the {{consequences}} of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa [...] "...always thought that she [...] die before [...] ", but when he told her about the Game during [...] "The Gathering", [...] "she [...] that he [...] be killed", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in [...] "The Gathering", by the time of [...] "Band of Brothers", she is able to face Grayson: [...] "If you think [...] will stand by, ...you have misjudged him terribly. So you'd better kill me, now, and be done with it." [...] Grayson releases her and calls her [...] "...a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive." [...] Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in [...] "Eyewitness" [...] that [...] "I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want to. I won't run. I'm not the little woman and I'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine." [...] However, she finds it difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.|$|E

2500|$|Harold Holt {{disappeared}} while swimming on 17 December 1967 and {{was declared}} presumed drowned two days later. His presumed successor was Liberal deputy leader William McMahon. [...] However, on 18 December, the Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister John McEwen announced that if McMahon were named the new Liberal leader, {{he and his}} party would not serve under him. [...] His reasons were never stated publicly, but in a private meeting with McMahon, he said [...] "I will not serve under <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do not trust you". McEwen's shock declaration triggered a leadership crisis within the Liberal Party; even more significantly, it raised {{the threat of a}} possible breaking of the Coalition, which would spell electoral disaster for the Liberals. [...] Up to that time, the Liberals had never won enough seats in any House of Representatives election to be able to govern without Country Party support. [...] Indeed, since the Coalition's formation in 1923, the major non-Labor party had only been able to govern alone once, during Joseph Lyons' first ministry—and even then, Lyons' United Australia Party had come up four seats short of a majority and needed confidence and supply support from the Country Party to govern.|$|E

On April 29, 2017, President Trump called Duterte to inform him of his planned visit to the Philippines in November for the East Asia Summit. Trump also extended an invitation to Duterte to visit him at the White House.

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for <b>you</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
