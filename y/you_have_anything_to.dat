2500|$|On December 2, 2013, Christie {{said at a}} {{press conference}} that Democrats were just playing {{politics}} by holding hearings into lane closures. [...] "Just because [...] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [...] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do," [...] Christie said. Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved. When reporter Matt Katz asked, [...] "Governor, did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--" [...] Christie dismissively joked [...] "I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question." ...|$|E

If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> show, {{we are ready to}} look at it. If you have nothing to say, and nothing to show--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We are {{interested}} in learning something," [...] Franks said. [...] "Before I question you, do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> report on surface conditions?" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. Why? I shan't disturb anything. Good gracious! I had no {{idea that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with so many sick horses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] she cried; [...] "you disreputable scarecrow! You're not fit for select society. And {{how long}} is it since <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> eat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You little rascal," [...] said he, shaking me, [...] "how am I to {{look out}} for an army and <b>you</b> besides? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> eat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{doubt you}} are--with the result," [...] said Mrs. Jansenius, hardly. [...] "I wish {{to know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{complain}} of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, mistress," [...] {{says the}} lawyer, tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, say it, say it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The clock said nothing. Larry {{walked up}} in front of it. [...] "Isn't that right?" [...] he demanded. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{a comfort}} {{to know that}} they are all gone. I hope we shall have peace and quiet now. I hope no one knows that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I must go now, Teddy, but I'll see {{you again}} before night. If you'll do all you can to help find them scoundrels I'll never say that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the crime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have heard}} Miss Murdstone,' said Mr. Spenlow, turning to me. 'I beg to ask, Mr. Copperfield, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say in reply?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> eat?" [...] {{questioned}} Dora. [...] "If you didn't, {{come right}} in, and I'll make you an omelet and some coffee." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you say, Samway?" [...] asked Boldwood, {{somewhat}} sharply. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, speak out; if not, get {{up another}} dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Farebrother {{has just}} sent up {{a message to}} say that he wants to speak to me. He is below. I thought you might like to know he was there, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{in so far}} as he says he is innocent," [...] {{added the}} elderly broker, hastily. [...] "Of course, I believe he is mistaken in supposing that either of <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with this robbery." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "this is a {{spot that}} could be easily {{described}} and located by anybody {{who happened to be}} told about it. That rock would make a first-class mark. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> bury for somebody else to dig up, where would you put it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear man, everything's going splendidly. Couldn't be better." [...] The doctor's eyes {{searched his}} face. [...] "When did <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> eat last?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Sit down,” Clay said, {{taking out}} his cigar-case. “I wrote to Mr. Farquhar, but I’m {{glad to see}} you all. Will <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> drink?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is getting better," [...] said Fred. [...] "You always say so, but I don't think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> show for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|The ranger smiled. [...] "Oh, it's got to {{all come}} out, Busby. I {{saw the man}} on the sorrel horse fire that shot--don't forget that. And I know who made the tracks in the flour. But I am {{beginning}} <b>to</b> wonder if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with warning the Kauffmans to get out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did not say}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with it. But don't take up that {{habit of}} holloing from Miss Todd. I suppose {{the truth was that}} he found out what he wasn't meant to find out. Men shouldn't be too inquisitive; should they, Miss Todd? You are quite right, Miss Gaunt, don't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with it; it's a bad affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "you wrote it, and {{you know}} about it. It was wrong to send such a letter, {{it was wrong to}} frighten Miss Fairlie. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say that it was right and {{necessary}} for her to hear, <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> gone yourself to Limmeridge House--you should have spoken to the young lady with your own lips." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's like {{lying in}} a well,' said Mrs Sparkler, {{changing}} her position fretfully. 'Dear me, Edmund, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, why don't you say it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, what DO {{you know}} of him?' inquired the old gentleman. 'Speak out, my friend, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say. What DO {{you know of}} him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> say, {{you must}} say it plainly. There {{never was a}} woman worse than I am at the reading of riddles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I am no man {{to force}} a girl to a match against her will; but never trust to that, man. I know what women are; and let a fantastic {{stranger}} come across them, there's an end of old friends. But yours is an honest purpose, {{and you are a}} good youth; and if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> keep her with, <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> Lucy to-morrow, with all my heart.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{understand}} that generalization,' answered her uncle; then, {{as she did}} not answer, he added, 'I am sure your Aunt Lily is very anxious to make <b>you</b> happy. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> complain of?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "A grinning, {{information}} fellow," [...] {{said the}} voice of old Hagberd, up in the darkness. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with him. It will spoil everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{see that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> crow about,' said a zealous junior {{civilian}} acidly. 'The Government {{is not exactly}} pleased with your work when you relieved Sanders.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I ask," [...] {{said the}} examiner, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> further <b>to</b> say that bears {{directly}} upon {{the question of}} those abstracted securities?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{answered}} a rueful sob. [...] "But I wish <b>you</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her. I know she'll make trouble for you, somehow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> say, O Kalubi-that-is-to-be? Now of {{a sudden}} the god puts it into my mouth <b>to</b> ask if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> say?" ...|$|R
