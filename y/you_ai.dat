2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} game 4 out of 10, accusing it of [...] "strangely lacking in soul, and {{consistently}} failing {{to make you}} care about what you're doing and why." [...] He also found the game too easy; [...] "there's rarely any requirement {{to play the game}} skillfully. You just charge in all-guns-blazing, snap between targets with the hugely generous auto-aim facility and blitz one obliging enemy after another. At the core there remains an enjoyably precise combat system, but EA has predictably pandered to the mysterious demands of the audience of players who want games to be played for them and want zero challenge [...] the sight of <b>you</b> and your <b>AI</b> buddies charging around getting raked with gunfire and sprinting away unharmed is a pathetic sight, and smacks of game designers not even bothering to try anymore." [...] He concluded [...] "this is a stark return to the EA of old, where a treasured licence is butchered irredeemably. Lacking both a challenge and soul, and failing to even engage on a narrative level, what you're left with is an overly forgiving shooter with weak strategy elements." ...|$|R
40|$|This set of {{lecture notes}} gives {{a brief summary}} of the basic ideas and {{principles}} underlying the lectures given in the course Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. The basic idea underlying the course is that in <b>AI</b> <b>you</b> {{need to be able}} to precisely represent knowledge in order to explore that knowledge to solve problems. This is because, in contrast to humans, computers can only manipulate knowledge that has a precise syntax and semantics, and even if the requirements are somewhat loosened, there must be still some underlying language that is precise. Although knowledge representation can be done using different formal languages, the two languages that have become dominant in AI in the course of time are predicate logic and probability theory. In contrast to the usual way logic and probability theory are used in mathematics and computing science, AI researchers have a tendency to be creative with logic and probability theory, and play a bit with these languages in order to better understand the problem—how to represent particular types of knowledge and to reason with it—they are tackling. To be able to use logic and probability theory in this fashion, an AI researcher needs a really good understand of these languages; it is not enough only being able to reproduc...|$|R
40|$|Where {{should you}} invest your money to obtain highest net returns? How can <b>you</b> use the <b>AI</b> sire {{selection}} decision {{to increase your}} profit? More and more beef producers are using artificial insemination (AI) sires {{in order to increase}} profit. Increased profit is obtained only if speeding the rate of genetic progress in their herds translates into higher returns or lower costs. Beef producers face a complex decision-making process when selecting semen from AI sires. AI semen varies widely in price and quality (reported as expected progeny difference (EPD) for various traits). While individual producers vary in specific production goals, their goal in genetic improvement is generally motivated by potential profit. Due to the complexity of the sire selection decision, economically optimal choices are not always clearly evident. Purchasing AI semen is an investment in future returns due to genetic improvement. It is an investment because the expenditure does not earn income until a later date when offspring (or the offspring’s descendants) are sold. To assist the producer in this decision, AI service sires have been ranked according to their net present value (NPV). This is achieved for an AI sire by discounting the future net income stream from genetic improvement to identify its value at the time the investment is made (breeding). The difference between the value of the discounted net income earnings from genetic improvement and the cost of semen is the estimated NPV o...|$|R
500|$|The {{reception}} of the Arbiter's elimination as a main playable character in Halo3 was similarly mixed. Hilary Goldstein of IGN decided the change took away the [...] "intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites", in the process reducing the character's role to that of [...] "a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword". Likewise, Steve West of Cinemablend.com stated that the one important event in the game for the Arbiter would be lost on anyone for whom Halo3 was their first game in the series. IGN's reviewer took issue with the poor artificial intelligence (AI) of allies in the game, and singled out the Arbiter in particular; [...] "The Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original Halo," [...] Hilary Goldstein said. Describing the AI of the character, Goldstein felt players could [...] "enjoy watching your supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. What {{is the point of}} sticking <b>you</b> with an <b>AI</b> compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?" [...] The New York Times Charles Herold found that in comparison to Halo2, where the character played a central role, the Arbiter in Halo3 was [...] "extraneous". On {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum were reviewers like G4tv, who argued that the Arbiter was more likeable, not to mention more useful, as an AI sidekick instead of the main player. In a list of the top alien characters in video games, MSNBC placed the Arbiter at the number two ranking.|$|R
