[...] "I don't care what <b>your</b> <b>color</b> is, you are fine fellows too much, both of you, and now we'll go on while we have {{strength}} left to reach them factory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is utter nonsense," [...] {{declared}} Polychrome impatiently. [...] "You're so dreadfully pink {{here that}} <b>your</b> <b>color,</b> which {{in itself is}} beautiful, had become tame and insipid. What you really need is some sharp contrast to enhance the charm of your country, and to keep these three people here would be a benefit rather than an injury to you." ...|$|E

[...] Having stated this formula with an air of great importance, he addressed himself to me. [...] "I appeal to you," [...] he said. [...] "Suppose you had lost <b>your</b> <b>color</b> here" [...] (he touched his cheek), [...] "and <b>your</b> <b>color</b> there" [...] (he touched his hair); [...] "and suppose it had happened at the University--would you" [...] (he stood on tip-toe, and whispered the next words in my ear) [...] "would you have stopped there, to be poisoned again? No!" [...] he cried, raising his voice once more, [...] "you would have drifted away like me. From Germany to France; from France to England--and so to London, and so under the feet of her Highness's horses, and so to Bedlam, and so to Mistress. Oh, Lord help me, I'm forgetting the bell! good-bye, all of you. Let me be in my corner till the bell rings." ...|$|E

"You might manage, lad, with a {{dark night}} to hide <b>your</b> <b>color,</b> and {{with the aid of}} a native dress, for you can speak their tongue; but as for me, the idea is hopeless, and not to be thought of. No, no, lad, I do not delude myself. My time has come; and I shall bear it, I hope, like a man, and a Christian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you are. Your {{legs are}} too short and your neck is nothing at all. <b>Your</b> <b>color</b> is most peculiar, but there isn't a shade of blue {{about any of}} you, except the deep-blue color of the clothes the old ape that choked me wears. Also, you are ignorant because you know nothing of Sky Island, which is the Center of the Universe and the only place anyone would care to live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{did you do}} it? You {{who refused}} me even {{friendly}} recognition in the first hour of my peril! And now you risk your life and kill one of your companions for my sake. I cannot understand. What strange manner of man are you, that you consort with the green men, though your form is that of my race, while <b>your</b> <b>color</b> is little darker {{than that of the}} white ape?

No, I can't consent to your {{marriage}} with my son. I must save you from corruption. Go back to the ranch. I can see already signs of your deterioration. Except for <b>your</b> <b>color</b> and that grip you already look like upper Broadway. The next thing will be a slit skirt and a diamond garter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 176. Next, {{respecting}} general tone. I said, just now, that, for {{the sake}} of students, my tax should not be laid on black or on white pigments; but if you mean to be a colorist, you must lay a tax on them yourself when you begin to use true color; that is to say, you must use them little, and make of them much. There is no better test of <b>your</b> <b>color</b> tones being good, than your having made the white in your picture precious, and the black conspicuous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but I {{speak of}} a time much more distant than that. Of a time when your prophets stood {{face to face with}} God, and talked with the Creator. Since that day a great change has come over your people. Then <b>your</b> <b>color</b> was light, like that of the fairest and handsomest of the Circassian race; now, it has become red. When even the color is changed, it is not {{wonderful}} that men should no longer be the same in other particulars. Yes; once all the races of men were of the same color and origin." ...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{rely upon}} a color {{system in which the}} colors are divided into four groups of {{harmonious}} colors which are said to match with the four seasons of the year. The seasons are, to some degree, arbitrary, and it sometimes happens that someone will be on the cusp of two seasons. But, as Carole Jackson insists, [...] "with testing, one palette will prove to be better harmonious than the other." [...] Jackson also acknowledges, however, that the reference to the four seasons {{is nothing more than a}} convenient artifice: [...] "We could call <b>your</b> <b>coloring</b> 'Type A,', 'Type B,' and so on, but comparison with the seasons provides a more poetic way to describe <b>your</b> <b>coloring</b> and <b>your</b> best colors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know, my own love, I thought I {{detected}} an alteration in you yesterday evening? I {{never saw}} you so serious. And then your attention often wandered; and, besides, {{you looked at}} me once or twice quite strangely, Mary.--I mean strangely, because <b>your</b> <b>color</b> {{seemed to be coming}} and going constantly without any imaginable reason. I really fancied, as I walked home--and I fancy still--that you had something to say, and were afraid to say it. Surely, love, you can have no secrets from me!--But we shall meet to-night, and then you will tell me everything (will you not?) without reserve. Farewell, dearest, till seven o'clock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 180. Notice {{also that}} nearly all good {{compound}} colors are odd colors. You shall look at a hue in a good painter's work ten minutes before {{you know what to}} call it. You thought it was brown, presently you feel that it is red; next that there is, somehow, yellow in it; presently afterwards that there is blue in it. If you try to copy it you will always find <b>your</b> <b>color</b> too warm or too cold--no color in the box will seem to have an affinity with it; and yet it will be as pure as if it were laid at a single touch with a single color.|$|E
6000|$|... 29. When {{you have}} done the squares all over again, do them a third time, always trying to keep your edges as neat as possible. When <b>your</b> <b>color</b> is exhausted, mix more in the same proportions, two teaspoonfuls {{to as much as}} you can grind with a drop; and when {{you have done}} the {{alternate}} squares three times over, as the paper will be getting very damp, and dry more slowly, begin on the white squares, and bring them up to the same tint in the same way. The amount of jagged dark line which then will mark the limits of the squares will be the exact measure of your unskillfulness.|$|E

5000|$|Amoral's fourth studio {{album was}} {{announced}} in November 2008 when the band announced Ari Koivunen as their new vocalist. The album was also the debut of bassist Pekka Johansson. On January 21, their first single Year of the Suckerpunch was put up the band's MySpace account. At the first single and also at the total album Amoral replaced the previous growling vocals with clean vocals and big choruses. [...] "Year of the Suckerpunch" [...] was on the Finnish national radio Ylex´s playlist with the highest hopes of receiving song {{of the year for}} 2009. The album, Show <b>Your</b> <b>Colors,</b> was released May 6, 2009. Show <b>Your</b> <b>Colors</b> has also been released in Great Britain, Germany, USA, Canada and Japan. The album was ranked by public voting as the fifth best domestic metal album at the Finnish Metal Awards 2009.|$|R
