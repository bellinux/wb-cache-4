500|$|... "My First Kiss" [...] {{was written}} by Sean Foreman and Nathaniel Motte {{alongside}} Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco. The song was produced by Dr. Luke and Benny Blanco with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. While being interviewed by MTV, Foreman explained the song's inspiration: [...] "The song is about a girl <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> and the story line of going through your first kiss with a girl to exploring further parts of the relationship." [...] While composing the song, Foreman and Motte decided {{that they needed to}} add a female to the song. Kesha, who had worked with Blanco and Luke, was asked to participate in the song and later came into the studio to contribute her lines.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, your conversation is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E
500|$|BBC Radio 1 {{announced}} the chart across three programmes, presented by DJ Nihal, between 29 December and 31 December 2009. The list of best-selling albums {{of the decade}} in the UK was also announced in a show on 28 December 2009. As it was broadcast {{during the last week}} of December, the chart did not include sales from the final week of the year. An updated chart, including sales up to 31 December 2009 was published in the UK trade magazine Music Week in the issue dated 30 January 2010. Apart from some unsurprising rises in the positions of songs from 2009, this updated chart included some major changes to the one broadcast on Radio 1. [...] "Gotta Get Thru This" [...] by Daniel Bedingfield dropped from 61 to 71, [...] "Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)" [...] by Gareth Gates fell from 57 to 61, [...] "Angel" [...] by Shaggy fell from 44 to 54, [...] "A Little Less Conversation" [...] by Elvis vs JXL was moved from 31 to 38, and most notably, the Black Eyed Peas' [...] "Where Is the Love?" [...] dropped from 25 to 42. [...] "How You Remind Me" [...] by Nickelback and [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Like</b> It?" [...] by DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies dropped out of the top 100 altogether.|$|E

2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was half asleep when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|The first single, [...] "It's Alright, It's OK", Tisdale said, [...] "is a strong, {{empowering}} {{song that}} kind of helps you move on" [...] and continued to say: I have definitely [...] on and with someone <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>like,</b> if they are cheating on you, you don't want to believe it. But, unfortunately, you either stay in the relationship and keep getting hurt because it keeps happening or you get up and you move on. You don't look back. Tisdale said the song [...] "Hot Mess" [...] is [...] "about hanging out with a motorcycle bad boy that makes life more interesting" [...] and the song [...] "How Do You Love Someone" [...] written by Porcelain Black (Alaina Beaton) is [...] "about a girl who deals with the split of her parents". Tisdale also said, the song could be about [...] "When you have been cheated on or you're in a relationship". Black was initially reluctant to let Tisdale record the song, but eventually green-lit the track. However, she recorded her RedOne-produced version which will feature guest vocals by Eminem for her upcoming debut album. Tisdale co-wrote several songs on the album such as [...] "What If", which was co-written with Kara DioGuardi. Tisdale described [...] "What If" [...] as the most personal song on the album, she said the song [...] "is about when you’re in a relationship and you say 'If I really needed you, would you actually be there?’" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Friday" [...] was {{revealed}} as YouTube's No. 1 video of 2011, with Black hosting a short video called [...] "YouTube Rewind" [...] in the year-end recap. Despite the over 167 million views {{during its first}} four months, prior to its temporary removal, [...] "Friday" [...] had amassed more than 3,190,000 [...] "dislikes". After the fallout with Ark Music Factory, Black started an independent record label named RB Records. She released a self-produced single titled [...] "My Moment" [...] on July 18, 2011, the first on her label, with an accompanying music video published to her YouTube channel the same day. In the video, director Morgan Lawley features real life footage of Black from {{both before and after}} her fame. In late October 2011, production began on the music video for Black's third single, [...] "Person of Interest". About the song, Black stated [...] "The basis of it is that it's a love song but it's not a love song. It's about almost teenage crushes – when you're not in love yet but <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>like</b> a guy – which I'm really excited about because I don't think there are too many out like that. It's very much a dance type song. It will make you get up and dance and sing along in your car." [...] The single and its accompanying music video were released on November 15, 2011. Black released two more singles in 2012: [...] "Sing It" [...] in May, and [...] "In Your Words" [...] in November. Black was planning to release her debut album in late 2011, which she said would include [...] "a bunch of different kinds of stuff." [...] The album was being recorded at a studio belonging to music producer Charlton Pettus. However, the album was never released. Black was featured in an ABC Primetime Nightline: Celebrity Secrets special entitled Underage and Famous: Inside Child Stars' Lives.|$|E
