5|$|Freshmen were {{expected}} to build the early Bonfires to help prove their worth. For almost two decades, the students constructed Bonfire from debris and wood acquired through various, sometimes illicit, means, including appropriating lumber intended for a dormitory in 1912. In 1935, a farmer reported that students carried off his entire barn as fuel for Bonfire. To prevent future incidents, the university made Bonfire a school-sanctioned event. The following <b>year,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, the school provided axes, saws, and trucks for the students and pointed them toward a grove of dead trees {{on the edge of}} town.|$|E

5|$|Since 1990, {{only four}} {{pitchers}} {{have joined the}} 300win club: Roger Clemens, Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and Johnson. Changes in {{the game in the}} last decade of the 20th century have made attaining 300career wins difficult, perhaps more so than during the mid 20thcentury. The four-man starting rotation has given way to a five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins.

5|$|A {{resurgence}} of both economy and rugby union {{followed in the}} 1930s and, in 1931, Wales won their first championship for nine years.

Then, in 1933, captained by Watcyn Thomas, Wales defeated England at Twickenham. In 1935, Wales beat the touring All Blacks by 13–12, with Haydn Tanner making his first appearance. Although the Five Nations Championship was suspended during the Second World War Wales did play a Red Cross charity match against England at Cardiff in 1940, which Wales lost 18–9.|$|E

5|$|Established on 25 March 1941 in {{response}} to lobbying by women wanting {{to serve in the}} war, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, the WAAAF was the first uniformed women's branch of an armed service in Australia, predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy. Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June; this number would grow to around a thousand {{by the end of the}} <b>year.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three months of its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell, wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women's Air Training Corps, an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force. Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson's appointment, rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity; she later rejoined at Wrigley's request, on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer.|$|E
5|$|In {{her next}} title defense on August 29, 2008, Kentikian met Hager Finer of Israel, Halmich's last {{opponent}} before retiring. Following a close opening round, the boxing match {{turned into a}} brawl and Finer scored {{during the first half}} of the fight. From round five onwards, Kentikian managed to take over the bout by landing the cleaner punches and she won by unanimous decision. On December 5, 2008, Kentikian faced Anastasia Toktaulova of Russia, the reigning GBU Flyweight Champion, although the GBU title was not on the line. During the uncharacteristic tactical fight, Kentikian managed to control her opponent from the middle of the ring in most of the rounds. The three judges all scored the bout in favor of Kentikian.

After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 2002–03 season, Juventus won the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana against Parma. Buffon had a dominant year, totalling 47 appearances in all competitions, of which 32 were in Serie A. He helped Juventus to the UEFA Champions League Final, only for his team to lose in a penalty shoot-out to Milan after a 0–0 draw. Buffon managed to save two penalties, but Milan won the shootout 3–2. Buffon drew praise, however, for making a reaction save on a close-range header by Filippo Inzaghi in the final during regulation time. Buffon saved a Luís Figo penalty in the second leg of the semi-finals, against defending champions Real Madrid, in Turin. Juventus progressed to the final, winning 4–3 on aggregate. Juventus managed to celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title that season, finishing the season with the best defence yet again, as Buffon conceded only 23 goals in 32 appearances. In 2003, Buffon received the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the fourth time. He also became the only goalkeeper ever to win the now defunct UEFA Most Valuable Player or UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award. He also won the UEFA Best Goalkeeper award, and was elected to the UEFA Team of the <b>Year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. He was also named the IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper {{for the first time in}} his career. Buffon was also nominated for the 2003 Ballon d'Or that season, finishing in ninth place.|$|E

5|$|Buffon {{made his}} Juventus debut {{during the opening}} match of the 2001–02 Serie A season, on 26 August 2001, keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 home win over Venezia. He kept two more clean sheets until he was beaten by Massimo Marazzina in a 3–2 home win over Chievo on the fourth match-day. He made his Juventus Champions League debut on 18 September, in a 3–2 home win over Celtic. In his first season with Juventus, Buffon {{appeared}} in 45 official matches, helping his team to the Serie A title, as Juventus finished the season with the best defence in Italy, with Buffon only conceding 22 goals in 34 Serie A matches. Juventus also finished as runners-up in the Coppa Italia that season to Buffon's former club, Parma; Buffon only made one appearance in the competition that season. Juventus were, however, eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Despite coming under criticism in the media for some errors {{early on in the}} season, in particular against Chievo, Buffon was awarded his third Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award {{at the end of the}} season for his performances throughout the year, and he was nominated for the UEFA Team of the <b>Year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time in his career, losing out to Rüştü Reçber.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the Big Four {{held the}} top four places in the rankings for a whole {{calendar}} <b>year</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. This also prompted the first uses of the term 'Big Four' {{to refer to the}} players, although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who themselves were still regarded ahead {{of the rest of the}} tour. At the Australian Open, Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5-set epic, obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer, while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on. Nadal continued to dominate early in the season, but suffered from injury in June, allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season. Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins, taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open, thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments, and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively. Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007.|$|E
