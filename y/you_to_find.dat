500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever {{figure out how to get}} us out of here, I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E
500|$|Seldom hesitating to use {{herself as}} the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for {{practicing}} self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock. In an article ranking Fey's six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer's work continues to feature her [...] "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts." [...] Fey's self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller's successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey's use of self-deprecating humor, {{and its effect on}} women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey's performance in 30 Rock because [...] "I'm torn between being sad that she apparently doesn't see [...] in herself and being pissed off that she's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Fey's performance is [...] "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy." [...] Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey's intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation [...] "is precisely what makes her relatable", elaborating that [...] " [...] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect." [...] Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: [...] "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most interesting thing about us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them." [...] Caldecott concluded, [...] "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one." [...] Observing that Fey's material lacks [...] "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey's comedy [...] "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults." [...] Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to [...] "opt out" [...] of the culture of demanding apologies.|$|E
2500|$|The Courant quoted Rowland {{as saying}} that [...] "when <b>you</b> start <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{yourself}} only concerned with yourself" [...] that's the point when <b>you</b> need <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a [...] "grounding force."

2500|$|Tallchief {{graduated}} from Beverly Hills High School in 1942. She {{had given up}} piano and {{wanted to go to}} college, but her father was against it. [...] "I've paid for your lessons all your life", he said. [...] "Now it's time for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a job." [...] She won a bit part in Presenting Lily Mars, an MGM musical with Judy Garland. Dancing in the movie was [...] "not gratifying" [...] and Tallchief decided against making a career of it. [...] That summer, family friend Tatiana Riabouchinska asked if Tallchief would like to go to New York. With Riabouchinska chaperoning, she set off for the big city at age 17.|$|E
2500|$|Trevor Morris was {{revealed}} to be composing the music for Iron Fist in late October 2016. The producers of the series wanted a [...] "modern" [...] sounding score, so Morris focused on synthesizer sounds and made a rule that traditional orchestral instruments, such as strings and horns, would {{not be used for}} the series. He said that by [...] "taking those heavy-hitters off the table, it leaves <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a unique way to solve these problems. That sound is also very fashionable right now, which I think is great." [...] Some of the synthesizer sounds were intended to acknowledge the title character's childhood iPod on which he listens to music from the 1990s. In terms of Asian influences on the score, Morris attempted to use several instruments to represent Asian culture, particularly for scenes set in a dojo or featuring Kung Fu, but [...] "the producers didn’t like it. They thought it was too traditional." [...] He ultimately used some Japanese flutes throughout the show, but after they were [...] "heavily affected" [...] digitally.|$|E
2500|$|The families' lawyer, Des Collins, said: [...] "Prior to the trial, {{the council}} {{maintained}} that {{a thorough investigation}} had led it {{to the conclusion that}} there was no link between the reclamation work and the children's birth defects. It also maintained that had any convincing evidence been shown that the children had good claims then the council would have wanted to compensate them appropriately without going to trial. Today that link has been established and the evidence provided. The children now call upon the council to fulfil their pre-trial promises without delay." [...] Collins said of the legal battle: [...] "I've been made out to be a shyster and an ambulance-chaser. The council has stonewalled, obstructed and prevaricated all the way through this. They didn't need to. If they'd ever said to us, 'Look, we're not admitting liability, but we'll co-operate with <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out what really happened', I wouldn't have minded. Instead, they tried to shut us out and paint us as the baddies... They've tried at every turn to stop us getting at the truth. Now they claim they can't afford to pay. I'm not impressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1711 Queen Anne gave {{royal assent}} to the 1712 Stamp Act, which imposed new taxes on newspapers. [...] The Queen {{addressed}} the House of Commons: [...] "Her majesty finds {{it necessary to}} observe, how great license is taken in publishing false and scandalous libels, such as are a reproach to any Government. [...] This evil seems to be grown too strong for the laws now in force. [...] It is therefore recommended to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a remedy equal to the mischief." [...] The passage of the Act was partly an attempt to silence Whig pamphleteers and dissenters, who had {{been critical of the}} then Tory government. [...] Every copy of a news-carrying publication printed on a half-sheet of paper became liable to a duty of a halfpenny, and if printed on a full sheet, a penny. [...] A duty of a shilling was placed on advertisements. [...] Pamphlets were charged a flate rate of two shillings per sheet for each edition, and were obliged to include the name and address of the printer.

2500|$|During Guo Yuan's {{tenure in}} Wei Commandery, {{there was an}} {{incident}} where an anonymous person wrote libelous pamphlets and circulated them. Cao Cao, who hated defamatory behaviour, ordered Guo Yuan to investigate and find out who the culprit was. Guo Yuan kept the pamphlets and ordered his subordinates to keep it secret. After examining the pamphlets, he realised that they contained lines from the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies". He instructed one of his subordinates: [...] "Wei Commandery is a big commandery. Even {{though it is a}} capital city, there are few scholars living here. These pamphlets can serve as something for the young to study. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> three persons to study under the scholars." [...] After his subordinate found him three young men, Guo Yuan told them, [...] "You still have much to learn. The two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] are important works of literature, yet they are often neglected and very few scholars understand them. You should find a scholar who understands the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies" [...] and ask him to teach you." [...] He then secretly gave them other instructions. The three men found a scholar who was well-versed in the two [...] "Metropolis Rhapsodies", got him to write an article, and passed it to Guo Yuan. Guo Yuan compared the scholar's handwriting with the handwriting in the pamphlets and saw that they were similar. He then arrested and questioned the scholar, who admitted that he was the culprit and confessed everything.|$|E
