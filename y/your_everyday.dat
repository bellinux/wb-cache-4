500|$|Green {{was raised}} in France and {{attended}} the American University of Paris, an English-speaking institution. She also spent time between Ramsgate, London and Ireland growing up. Green was quiet in school, and developed an interest in Egyptology when she visited the Louvre at age seven. At age 14, after seeing Isabelle Adjani in The Story of Adele H., Green decided to become an actress. Her mother initially feared that an acting career {{would be too much}} for her sensitive daughter, but later came to support young Eva's ambitions. Green continued her studies at St. Paul Drama School in Paris, and took an acting course at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Around this time, Green returned to Paris, where she performed in several plays. Green stated that in drama school, [...] "I always picked the really evil roles. It's a great way to deal with <b>your</b> <b>everyday</b> emotions." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote {{a very positive}} review of the episode, writing, [...] "'Signs and Wonders' is a clever episode whose serpentine plot twists will leave many viewers genuinely surprised. Although a bit overly reliant on the alleged shock value of snakes, the episode establishes, more firmly than any before it, the demonic nature {{of some of the}} powers at work in The X-Files." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and called the episode, [...] "one of the scariest episodes of season 7" [...] before noting that the episode [...] "really creeped me out." [...] However, other reviews were more mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that, despite several very [...] "cool" [...] images—such as Gracie birthing snakes and a man oozing reptile venom—the episode [...] "doesn't really seem to stand for anything." [...] Shearman and Pearson further criticized putting [...] "religion in the crosshair" [...] and concluded that the episode was [...] "just <b>your</b> <b>everyday</b> sliver of supernatural hokum." ...|$|E
500|$|Man on the Moon: The End of Day {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 71, based on 15 reviews. The Boston Globe praised the experimental {{quality of the}} album: [...] "It's spacey, adventurous, and ridiculously intriguing if only because it's so different". Complimenting Cudi's [...] "introspective persona, ear for melody, and eclectic taste in beats," [...] Entertainment Weekly music reviewer Simon Vozick-Levinson called him [...] "a hyped upstart who really does represent a promising new phase in the genre's evolution." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic called it [...] "a soul searcher [...] may require more patience than <b>your</b> <b>everyday</b> debut", but [...] "perfects the futuristic bleak-beat hip-hop Kanye purposed a year earlier, and rewards the listener with every tripped-out return." [...] Greg Kot, writing in the Chicago Tribune, believed that the album {{had the potential to}} turn heads as well as [...] "bum-rush the charts." [...] Slant Magazines Paul Schrodt wrote that the album attempts to be [...] "both a bigger pop platform and indie credibility", and felt that Cudi's verses [...] "are too good to ignore" [...] so long as you do not take them too seriously. Ann Power of the Los Angeles Times called Man on the Moon a [...] "standout release" [...] in spite of [...] "Cudi's voice". Billboard magazine's Michael Menachem said that the album is [...] "anything but a traditional hip-hop recording" [...] and that Cudi's [...] "delivery is confident in a poetic and artful way". David Bevan of The A.V. Club said that, despite its filler, Cudi's [...] "thick layer of open, intense self-loathing is a clever way of unifying Man On The Moon as pure mood piece, a stream-of-consciousness pop voyage that’s more Phil Collins than rap." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{are empty}} now; and I wonder how came they here? How came the show- case of Dr. Merrifield, Surgeon-Chiropodist here? How came here yon Italian painting?--a poor, silly, little {{affected}} Madonna, simpering {{at me from}} her dingy gilt frame till I buy her, a great bargain, at a dollar. From what country church or family oratory, in what revolution, or stress of private fortunes,--then from what various cabinets of antiquities, in what dear Vicenza, or Ferrara, or Mantua, earnest thou, O Madonna? Whose likeness are you, poor girl, with <b>your</b> <b>everyday</b> prettiness of brows and chin, and your Raphaelesque crick in the neck? I think I know {{a part of your}} story. You were once the property of that ruined advocate, whose sensibilities would sometimes consent that a valet de place of uncommon delicacy should bring to his ancestral palace some singularly meritorious foreigner desirous of purchasing from his rare collection,--a collection of rubbish scarcely to be equaled elsewhere in Italy. You hung in that family-room, reached after passage through stately vestibules and grand stairways; and O, I would be cheated to the bone, if only I might look out again from some such windows as were there, upon some such damp, mouldy, broken-statued, ruinous, enchanted garden as lay below! In that room sat the advocate's mother and hunchback sister, with their smoky scaldini and their snuffy priest; and there the wife of the foreigner, self-elected the taste of his party, inflicted the pang courted by the advocate, and asked if you were for sale. And then the ruined advocate clasped his hands, rubbed them, set his head heart-brokenly on one side, took you down, heaved a sigh, shrugged his shoulders, and sold you--you! a family heirloom! Well, at least you are old, and you represent to me acres of dim, religious canvas in that beloved land; and here is the dollar now asked for you: I could not have bought you for so little at home.|$|E

[...] She took a doubtful step and then undid it [...] To raise herself and look again. He spoke [...] Advancing toward her: [...] "What is it you see [...] From up there always--for I want to know." [...] She turned and sank upon her skirts at that, [...] And her face changed from terrified to dull. [...] He said to gain time: [...] "What is it you see," [...] Mounting until she cowered under him. [...] "I will find out now--you must tell me, dear." [...] She, in her place, refused him any help [...] With the least stiffening of her neck and silence. [...] She let him look, sure that he wouldn't see, [...] Blind creature; and a while he didn't see. [...] But at last he murmured, [...] "Oh," [...] and again, [...] "Oh." [...] "What is it--what?" [...] she said. [...] "Just that I see." [...] "You don't," [...] she challenged. [...] "Tell me what it is." [...] "The wonder is I didn't see at once. [...] I never noticed it from here before. [...] I must be wonted to it--that's the reason. [...] The little graveyard where my people are! [...] So small the window frames the whole of it. [...] Not so much larger than a bedroom, is it? [...] There are three stones of slate and one of marble, [...] Broad-shouldered little slabs there in the sunlight [...] On the sidehill. We haven't to mind those. [...] But I understand: it is not the stones, [...] But the child's mound----" [...] "Don't, don't, don't, don't," [...] she cried. [...] She withdrew shrinking from beneath his arm [...] That rested on the banister, and slid downstairs; [...] And turned on him with such a daunting look, [...] He said twice over before he knew himself: [...] "Can't a man speak of his own child he's lost?" [...] "Not you! Oh, where's my hat? Oh, I don't need it! [...] I must get out of here. I must get air. [...] I don't know rightly whether any man can." [...] "Amy! Don't go to someone else this time.

[...] I thought, Who is that man? I didn't know you. [...] And I crept down the stairs and up the stairs [...] To look again, and still your spade kept lifting. [...] Then you came in. I heard your rumbling voice [...] Out in the kitchen, and I don't know why, [...] But I went near to see with my own eyes. [...] You could sit there with the stains on your shoes [...] Of the fresh earth from your own baby's grave [...] And talk about <b>your</b> <b>everyday</b> concerns.

God, if I don't believe I'm cursed." [...] "I can repeat the very words you were saying. [...] 'Three foggy mornings and one rainy day [...] Will rot the best birch fence a man can build.'
