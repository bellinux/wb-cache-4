[...] "Part of {{the idea is to}} create an element of visible language," [...] Idol explained during an interview with the New York Times, [...] "so that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you're being talked to through images. I think you have to start looking to get to the future of what rock-and-roll concerts should be like. We're working; we're pushing the technology to the edge." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Taubin of Film Comment {{described}} The Hurt Locker as [...] "a structuralist war movie" [...] and [...] "a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety {{experience from}} beginning to end." [...] Taubin praised Ackroyd's [...] "brilliant" [...] cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, [...] "Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides." ...|$|E
500|$|At Game Revolution, Devin Charles wrote a very {{positive}} review, awarding the game a 4.5/5 score. He felt that the game was very replayable, praising the amount of content that the game delivered {{as well as its}} online play. [...] "The game's overall presentation is solid, with the commentary and action cutscenes always making <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you {{are a part of the}} heated battles and help keep the game flowing and relevant," [...] Charles stated in his review. His only criticism was the HUT mode and how little it was altered from the previous year.|$|E

5000|$|In the past, on a full-moon night, {{when there}} were still many fishing boats out on the sea towards the east, <b>you</b> would <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were part of the}} starry sky; thus such view was named [...] "Starry Kuibi".|$|R
500|$|Likewise, in the New York Daily News, David Bianculli {{states that}} the episode is [...] "a true tour de force, and another inventive triumph for this vastly underrated series" [...] Brian Courtis in Australia's Sunday Age agrees, and writes that [...] "Hush" [...] is [...] "(c)lever, well-written and brightly {{directed}} ... Buffy at its best." [...] Robert Hanks from The Independent in the UK writes that [...] "Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in most weeks the funniest and cleverest programme on TV, reached new heights" [...] with [...] "Hush". Noel Murray in The A.V. Club calls it an [...] "episode unlike any other, with a lusher score {{and some of the}} most genuinely disturbing imagery I've yet seen on Buffy." [...] The episode was included among 13 of the scariest films or television shows by Salon.com, and justified by Stephanie Zacharek, who states it [...] "scans just like one of those listless dreams in which you try to scream, and can't. Everybody's had 'em—and yet the way the eerie quiet of 'Hush' sucks you in, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the experience is privately, and unequivocally, your own." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming Worlds Allen Greenberg in 1992 {{described}} it as [...] "an ambitious project" [...] but [...] "not without its share of problems." [...] He praised the game's [...] "enjoyable story and well-crafted puzzles", but disliked its [...] "robotic" [...] controls and [...] "confusing" [...] perspectives, and stated that [...] "far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games". He summarized the game as [...] "an enjoyable challenge with a unique game-playing engine to back it up." [...] Scorpia was also positive, stating that despite flaws [...] "Ultima Underworld is an impressive first product. The meticulous construction of a real-world dungeon environment is outstanding. [...] may be a dungeon trek, {{but it is certainly}} the dungeon trek of the future". In 1993 she praised the [...] "superb graphics" [...] of [...] "a definite must for game players". [...] The magazine later awarded the game [...] "Role-Playing Game of the Year". Computer Shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters, and believed that the game [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you've entered a virtual reality". Despite describing its interface as [...] "not truly intuitive", the reviewer finished by calling the game [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "a fine value". The Chicago Tribune awarded it Best Game of the Year, and called it [...] "an amazing triumph of the imagination" [...] and [...] "the creme de la creme of dungeon epics".|$|E
2500|$|Kris Graft for Gamasutra {{commented that}} many players and journalists had both high {{expectations}} for the game as well as wide expectations, with some believing that it would be, among other aspects, the [...] "best space sim", the [...] "best multiplayer action shooter", and the [...] "best pure exploration game". Ars Technicas Kyle Orland found that unlike Spore or Fable which had [...] "saturation PR campaigns that promised revolutionary and industry-changing gameplay features" [...] which failed {{to be present in}} the final releases, Hello Games' statements about No Man's Sky were [...] "relatively restrained and realistic about what they were promising". Orland surmises that many players and journalists [...] "layer their own expectations onto the game's gaps" [...] from what Hello Games actually claimed. Vlambeer's founder Rami Ismail considered the strength of the marketing campaign by Hello Games and Sony to generate interest in the game, calling the pitch using the concept of magnitudes and scale rather than absolutes as [...] "a little masterclass in explaining an abstract concept to the largest possible audience"; Polygons Ben Kuchera agreed on this point, but considered that the marketing may have gotten away from Sony and Hello Games since players did not have a concrete understanding of the game's limitations prior to launch. Murray himself was aware of the [...] "unrealistic, intangible level of excitement" [...] that fans had of the game and given that they had been waiting three years to play it, would be expecting it to be perfect. He countered that he felt he and Hello Games tried to be [...] "reasonably open and honest about what the game is" [...] all throughout the marketing cycle to set expectations. On the day before the official release, Murray cautioned players that No Man's Sky may not have been [...] "the game you imagined from those trailers" [...] and instead that the title was meant as a [...] "very very chill game", giving players a universe-sized sandbox that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you [...] "stepped into a sci-fi book cover"; Murray believed the game would have a [...] "super divisive" [...] response from players due to some of these expectations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, exactly," [...] said de Vere, writing {{rapidly in}} his note-book {{as he sat}} in one of the deep leather {{armchairs}} of the luxurious office of Mr. Overgold. [...] "So <b>you</b> sometimes <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the whole thing were not worth while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Jane!" [...] exclaimed Elizabeth, [...] "you are too good. Your {{sweetness}} and disinterestedness are really angelic; I {{do not know}} what to say to <b>you.</b> I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve." ...|$|R
60|$|One great {{obstacle}} to {{your understanding of}} him is your having been forced to construct Latin verses, with introduction of the word 'Jupiter' always, at need, when you were {{at a loss for}} a dactyl. <b>You</b> always <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Horace only used it also when he wanted a dactyl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no, doctor. It's {{not like}} that. But when <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you'd sink through the bed, an' you don't {{know what to}} do with yourself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{in reading}} it <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were {{far away from}} England--really in Italy--under another sort of sky--that blue sky of the south which {{travellers}} describe." ...|$|E

5000|$|Davis said of {{his work}} at ESPN, [...] "I don't think of my job as being hard. I know I'm the luckiest guy around. I get to watch {{basketball}} and talk about it. When <b>you</b> never <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go to work, it's really easy and fun to do the homework." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, you shan't do that,' {{cried the}} king, 'or if you do, {{it will be}} your own fault. You shall come with me into my palace, and <b>you</b> will <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in Paradise, I promise you.

6000|$|... "I'll tell you. When you've landed {{and crossed}} up from Liverpool, and struck London, <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you'd gone to sea again. It's an ocean--a whole Atlantic of houses." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Little did {{we think}} {{where we should}} meet again, and why, Mr. Ogilvie. Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you had got into 'Tales of the Alhambra,' or into the 'Tempest'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Margaret, [...] "it's so very nice, every way; {{it makes}} <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{you did have}} a country, after all. It's as chic--that detestable little word!--as those new French books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never fear me," [...] said Sally. [...] "But, Mara, I wish I {{felt sure}} that Moses {{could make you}} happy. Do you really, now, when <b>you</b> think seriously, <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he would?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{agree with}} <b>you,</b> Dimchurch. I <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were melting away. If I were {{to put a}} bit of food in my mouth I believe the heat would bake it in no time.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Haven't {{made up my}} mind. It is such {{an entire}} change, I don't know <b>you,</b> and <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I ought to be introduced. You {{certainly}} look much more tidy, and I fancy I shall like it when I'm used to seeing a somewhat distinguished-looking man about the house instead of my old friend Orson," [...] answered Rose, with her head on one side to get a profile view.|$|R
6000|$|... "And isn't it jolly {{when you}} discard furs and winter {{garments}} {{for the first}} time and sally forth, like this, in spring attire?" [...] laughed Priscilla. [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you had been made over new?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Jenny. 'But it's so high. And you see {{the clouds}} rushing on above the narrow streets, not minding them, and {{you see the}} golden arrows {{pointing}} at the mountains in the sky from which the wind comes, and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were dead.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you satisfied? Does it {{seem like}} home, and do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you should be happy here?" [...] asked Mrs. March, as she and her {{daughter}} went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{those who}} disliked the film were Mike Hale of The New York Times, who {{described}} it as a [...] "dorm-room argument masquerading as a drama", the characters as [...] "empty vessels for McCarthy’s language and notions", and the debate on the existence of God and the absurdity of the human condition [...] "so purely rhetorical and dramatically inert that <b>you</b> never <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were in the room with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|I might {{answer to}} this; Well, what else should he do? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were in a}} shower, cannot you go and get wet without help from Constable? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were walking in the fields, cannot you go and walk in them without help from De Wint? But {{if you want to}} sit in your room and look at a {{beautiful}} picture, why should you blame the artist for giving you one? This was the answer actually made to me by various journalists, when first I showed that Turner was truer than other painters: [...] "Nay," [...] said they, [...] "we do not want truth, we want something else than truth; we would not have nature, but something better than nature." ...|$|R
5000|$|MARCAS! {{say this}} two-syllabled name again and again; do <b>you</b> not <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{it had some}} {{sinister}} meaning? Does it not seem to you that its owner must be doomed to martyrdom? Though foreign, savage, the name {{has a right to}} be handed down to posterity; it is well constructed, easily pronounced, and has the brevity that beseems a famous name ... Do you not discern in that letter Z an adverse influence? Does it not prefigure the wayward and fantastic progress of a storm-tossed life? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{saw him on}} {{the street}} in Ripton the other day, and he came right up and spoke to me. He hadn't {{forgotten}} my name. Now, he'd be my notion of a candidate. He makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> your presence in the world meant something to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{might be}} a sort of {{protection}} for me, if you remained in it,' said Mr Boffin; 'you might stand betwixt him and me, and take the edge off him.

6000|$|Henrietta {{was silent}} a little; {{there was a}} chance he was not sincere.

6000|$|... "No, my dear. I {{am sorry}} to give you pain; but I don't like it. You should have {{consulted}} me before you settled it.
