50|$|Devices {{with many}} {{switches}} (such {{as a computer}} keyboard) usually arrange these switches in a scan matrix, with the individual switches on the intersections of x and <b>y</b> <b>lines.</b> When a switch is pressed, it connects the corresponding x and <b>y</b> <b>lines</b> together. Polling (often called scanning in this case) is done by activating each x line in sequence and detecting which <b>y</b> <b>lines</b> then have a signal, thus which keys are pressed. When the keyboard processor detects that a key has changed state, it sends {{a signal to the}} CPU indicating the scan code of the key and its new state. The symbol is then encoded, or converted into a number, based on the status of modifier keys and the desired character encoding.|$|R

50|$|The {{next step}} is to draw a {{straight}} line from the origin of the graph to the point where x and y both equal 1.0, which is the x = <b>y</b> <b>line</b> in Figure 1. This 45 degree line is used simply as a graphical aid for drawing the remaining lines. Then draw the equilibrium line using the VLE data points of the lower boiling component, representing the equilibrium vapor phase compositions for each value of liquid phase composition. Also draw vertical lines from the horizontal axis up to the x = <b>y</b> <b>line</b> for the feed and for the desired compositions of the top distillate product and the corresponding bottoms product (shown in red in Figure 1).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> is {{the longest}} line on the Coastal Line. It {{operates}} between Helsinki and Siuntio with very few intermediate stops. The services run quite infrequently, with three to seven daily departures in each direction, depending {{on the day of}} the week. The train has scheduled stops at Pasila, Huopalahti, Leppävaara, Masala, and Kirkkonummi. When Finland's first electrified line (from Helsinki to Kirkkonummi) was opened, the first service was Y. In 1987 the former Y train service ended and was replaced by S and U trains in 1988. In 2002, the route designation Y was introduced again, as after the Leppävaara city tracks were finished, there was a possibility to add a fast commuter train connection to Karis. Before this, a few of the S and U services continued from Kirkkonummi to Karis. In March 2016 the <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> was shortened to Siuntio.|$|E

50|$|Twistor {{was similar}} in concept to core memory, but {{replaced}} the circular magnets with magnetic tape {{to store the}} patterns. The tape was wrapped around one set of the wires, {{the equivalent of the}} X line, {{in such a way that}} it formed a 45-degree helix. The Y wires were replaced by solenoids wrapping a number of twistor wires. Selection of a particular bit was the same as in core, with one X and <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> being powered, generating a field at 45 degrees. The magnetic tape was specifically selected to only allow magnetization along the length of the tape, so only a single point of the twistor would have the right direction of field to become magnetized.|$|E

5000|$|... "Multi-key rollover" [...] is {{considered}} essential for quality keyboards and for English-language touch typing. This {{is where the}} most common key sequences have been studied, and keys in the same common sequence are placed in the electrical switch matrix such that three keys down cannot produce a fourth [...] "phantom" [...] key by shorting out the matrix. The simplest way to accomplish this is to put all keys in the same common sequence on the same X or <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> of the switch matrix. As long as the electronics does not see more than two keys on different X and Y lines, which would create a phantom key, {{it will continue to}} process the next key depressed. This typically produces four- to five-key rollover for the most common key sequences.|$|E
50|$|Testes in {{androgen}} insensitivity are {{a special}} case: {{if there is}} any degree of responsiveness to testosterone, they should be removed before puberty. On the other hand, if androgen insensitivity is complete, the testes may be left to produce estradiol (via testosterone) to induce breast development, but there is a slowly increasing risk of cancer in adult life. Streak gonads without a Y chromosome cell line need not be removed but will not function. Finally, the gonads in true hermaphroditism must be directly examined; atypical gonads with <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> or potential testicular function should be removed but in rare instances a surgeon may try to preserve the ovarian part of an ovotestis. Potential surgical problems: A lifetime of hormone replacement will be required, to avoid osteoporosis and enable sexual functioning.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} is to draw the {{operating}} line for the rectifying section (the section above the feed inlet) of the distillation column, (shown in green in Figure 1). Starting at the intersection of the distillate composition line and the x = <b>y</b> <b>line,</b> draw the rectifying operating line at a downward slope (Δy/Δx) of L / (D + L) where L is the molar flow rate of reflux and D is the molar flow rate of the distillate product. For example, in Figure 1, assuming the molar flow rate of the reflux L is 1000 moles per hour and the molar flow rate of the distillate D is 590 moles per hour, then the downward slope of the rectifying operating line is 1000 / (590 + 1000) = 0.63 which means that the y-coordinate of any point on the line decreases 0.63 units for each unit that the x-coordinate decreases.|$|E
5000|$|Core {{relies on}} the [...] "square loop" [...] {{properties}} of the ferrite material {{used to make the}} toroids. An electric current in a wire that passes through a core creates a magnetic field. Only a magnetic field greater than a certain intensity ("select") can cause the core to change its magnetic polarity. To select a memory location, one of the X and one of the <b>Y</b> <b>lines</b> are driven with half the current ("half-select") required to cause this change. Only the combined magnetic field generated where the X and <b>Y</b> <b>lines</b> cross (a logical AND function) is sufficient to change the state; other cores will see only half the needed field ("half-selected"), or none at all. By driving the current through the wires in a particular direction, the resulting induced field forces the selected core's magnetic flux to circulate in one direction or the other (clockwise or counterclockwise). One direction is a stored 1, while the other is a stored 0.|$|R

As-grown ZnO displays the expected thermal decay of bound excitons with increasing temperature from 7 K, while we observed an anomalous behaviour of the excitonic emission in H-doped ZnO, in which its intensity increases with increasing temperature in the range 140 - 300 K.

40|$|Atmel QTouch Peripheral Touch Controller (PTC) offers {{built-in}} hardware for buttons, sliders, and wheels. PTC supports both mutual {{and self}} capacitance measurement {{without the need}} for any external component. It offers superb sensitivity and noise tolerance, as well as self-calibration and minimizes the sensitivity tuning effort by the user. The PTC is intended for acquiring capacitive touch sensor signals. The external capacitive touch sensor is typically formed on a PCB, and the sensor electrodes are connected to the analog charge integrator of the PTC using the device I/O pins. The PTC supports mutual capacitance sensors organized as capacitive touch matrices in different X-Y configurations, including Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) sensor grids. In mutual capacitance mode, the PTC requires one pin per X line (drive line) and one pin per <b>Y</b> <b>line</b> (sense line). In self capacitance mode, the PTC requires only one pin with a Y-line driver for each self-capacitance sensor. The PTC supports two sets of libraries, the QTouch Library and the QTouch Safety Library. The QTouch Library supports both mutual and self capacitanc...|$|E

There exist three peaks of the photon energy at 3.21 eV, 3.35 eV, and 3.45 eV which correspond to Y 7, Y 4, and NBE, respectively. The 3.35 eV or Y 4 peak observed in GaN has been assigned to the excitons bound to the stacking faults in the as-grown GaN samples [17]. Additionally, the Y 4 and <b>Y</b> 7 <b>lines</b> are reported to simultaneously appear among the GaN epilayers. For low-temperature CL measurements (T = 20 K), we can compare the CL spectra performed at different locations: {{the top of the}} GaN nanorod cluster and the side of the GaN nanorod cluster. The results show that the intensity ratio of the Y 7 /NBE as shown in Figure 2 c became larger than that measured in the GaN nanorod cluster (shown in Figure 2 a). Accordingly, we could suggest that the <b>Y</b> 7 <b>line</b> arises from the junction between the GaN nanorods and Si substrate because the junction contains more defects, owing to the broken GaN nanorods or randomly aligned short GaN nanorods.
