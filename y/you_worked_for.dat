From where I lay on my cot I could look through the window and see the consul's old ragged Stars and Stripes hanging over his shack. 'You're all kinds of a fool, Billy Casparis,' I says to myself; 'and of all your crimes against sense it does look like this idea of celebrating the Fourth should receive the award of demerit. Your {{business}} is busted up, your thousand dollars is gone into the kitty of this corrupt country on that last bluff you made, you've got just fifteen Chili dollars left, worth forty-six cents each at bedtime last night and steadily going down. To-day you'll blow in your last cent hurrahing for that flag, and to-morrow you'll be living on bananas from the stalk and screwing your drinks out of your friends. What's the flag done for you? While you were under it <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> what you got. You wore your finger nails down skinning suckers, and salting mines, and driving bears and alligators off your town lot additions. How much does patriotism count for on deposit when the little man with the green eye-shade in the savings-bank adds up your book? Suppose you were to get pinched over here in this irreligious country for some little crime or other, and appealed to your country for protection--what would it do for you? Turn your appeal over to a committee of one railroad man, an army officer, a member of each labour union, and a coloured man to investigate whether any of your ancestors were ever related to a cousin of Mark Hanna, and then file the papers in the Smithsonian Institution until after the next election. That's the kind of a sidetrack the Stars and Stripes would switch you onto.' ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliography, {{appendices}} and figures. Try {{this thought}} experiment. Imagine <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> eight hours, {{and then you}} had to help a relative cut their lawn. At {{the end of the}} day you find yourself tired and hungry. Where do you go? For most individuals they will answer that they will go home for rest and recovery. Now imagine that you have no home to find repose, now what do you do? Unfortunately there are many individuals who do not own or rent a home. Shelter is a basic human need; often we can forget the importance our homes means to us, unless it is taken away. In this paper we will discuss the homeless problem in Madison, WI. Specifically we will look at how the aid offered by the city (both private and public) is directly related to the perception individuals have. First we will briefly discuss the definition of homelessness as well as the broad and diverse causes. Next we will connect perception to aid availability through previous academic research. After the connection is made apparent we will look at the collective Madison perception by analyzing individual perceptions we have obtained through personal interviews, participate observations, and a survey. Finally we will tie all of our individual perceptions together to discuss how they lead to the aid offered by Madison. Aid that is reliant on results, increasing funds, and maintaining basic human needs, which we will show is less effective than an aid style of one?on?one case management...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) is a costly condition that frequently causes permanent work disabilities. Little information exists regarding {{the impact of}} COPD on work force participation and the indirect costs of the disease in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To examine the frequency of paid employment and factors influencing it in a Latin-American population-based study. METHODS: Post-bronchodilator FEV(1) /FVC < 0. 70 (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity) was used to define COPD. Information regarding paid work was assessed by the question 'At {{any time in the}} past year, have <b>you</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> payment?'RESULTS: Interviews were conducted with 5571 subjects; 5314 (759 COPD and 4554 non-COPD) subjects underwent spirometry. Among the COPD subjects, 41. 8 % reported having paid work vs. 57. 1 % of non-COPD (P < 0. 0001). the number of months with paid work was reduced in COPD patients (10. 5 +/- 0. 17 vs. 10. 9 +/- 0. 06, P < 0. 05). the main factors associated with having paid work in COPD patients were male sex (OR 0. 33, 95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 47), higher education level (OR 1. 05, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 09) and younger age (OR 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 88 - 0. 92). COPD was not a significant contributor to employment (OR 0. 83, 95 % CI 0. 69 - 1. 00, P = 0. 054) in the entire population. CONCLUSIONS: Although the proportion of persons with paid work is lower in COPD, having COPD appears not to {{have a significant impact on}} obtaining paid employment in the overall population of developing countries.
