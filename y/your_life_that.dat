500|$|Zappa {{stated that}} he tried smoking {{cannabis}} ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and [...] "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin {{or any of that}} other stuff." [...] Zappa stated, [...] "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> you don't want to have happen to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." [...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E
500|$|... 'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you {{in your life and}} how I believe that it's the darkness in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E

5000|$|... "Pen & Paper", {{otherwise}} known as [...] "Pen & Paper (Something Typical)", is the second single released from The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus' second album, Lonely Road. The song charted at #75 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the music video of the song Ronnie Winter describes the song as [...] "Taking someone in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that's</b> fake and removing them".|$|R
500|$|... "This idea of The Fame {{runs through}} and through. Basically, {{if you have}} nothing—no money, no fame—you can still feel {{beautiful}} and dirty rich. It's about making choices, and having references—things you pull from <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> you believe in. It's about self-discovery and being creative. The record is slightly focused, but it's also eclectic. The music is intended to inspire people to feel a certain way about themselves, so they'll be able to encompass, in their own lives, a sense of inner fame that they can project to the world, and the carefree nature of the album {{is a reflection of}} that aura. I like to funnel interesting ideas {{to the rest of the}} world through a pop lens." ...|$|E
500|$|Musical {{performances}} in the episode attracted praise. Aly Semigran of MTV called Riley's rendition of [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] "goose bump-inducing", while Goldman commended: [...] "Riley absolutely killed it as Mercedes belted out that song". In contrast, Poniewozik wrote {{that it was the}} one song choice he didn't like, feeling that it is overused, thus diminishing its impact. Abrams deemed Rachel's solo performance at sectionals [...] "amazing", and Flandez recommended: [...] "Watch it again if you ever want to take back three minutes of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> you’ve wasted on something else." [...] Pardue called the group performance of [...] "You Can't Always Get What You Want" [...] "energetic [...] casual [...] and very Glee", but felt it [...] "would have been nice" [...] to feature different singers. Dan Snierson for Entertainment Weekly similarly noted that he would have preferred [...] "more vocal interplay between all group members". In December 2012, TV Guide named the rendition of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] one of Glee best performances, commenting: [...] "Glee has done Broadway many times, but rarely better than this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hüsker Dü {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the key bands to emerge from the 1980s American indie scene. Music writer Michael Azerrad asserted in his 2001 book Our Band Could Be <b>Your</b> <b>Life</b> <b>that</b> Hüsker Dü was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, [...] "Hüsker Dü played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lead singer, Mike Vennart, {{notes that}} the title: “evokes {{strength}} and structure, and kind {{of a sense of}} time as well - every second is like a frame of <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that’s</b> ticking away and then it’s gone. You can try and remember to try and look at it. But you’ll probably only remember it as a snapshot, you won’t remember the whole movement of the thing.” ...|$|R

2500|$|Lewis {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song in an interview with Entertainment Weekly: [...] "e felt like happiness is something everyone strives to have, and sometimes it's not just about being happy, but if you have obstacles in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>that</b> you have to get over to be happy. And it's just about that striving to get there. t was kind of like looking back at all of the things I've been through, just kind of putting that into the song." [...] The song was released with two B-sides: [...] "Let It Rain" [...] in Europe and Japan, and [...] "Fly Here Now", only in Japan.|$|E

A new single, [...] "Jerk Ribs" [...] premiered online the same month.
