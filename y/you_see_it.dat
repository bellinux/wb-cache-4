25|$|Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> is an American {{television}} {{game show}} created by Frank Wayne for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. The object of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> was to answer general knowledge trivia questions by finding the answers which were hidden on a grid {{similar to a}} word search puzzle.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{counteract}} affiliate preemption, CBS scuttled Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> {{and brought in}} the daytime Wheel of Fortune following NBC's cancellation of it on June 30.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, but the new Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E

25|$|NBC's {{resurgence}} in its morning lineup in early 1975 {{with the likes}} of Wheel of Fortune prompted CBS to clean house, canceling The Joker's Wild along with Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It.</b> Gambit (the show actually facing Wheel), which had begun in 1972 at 11/10, returned to that slot after Now You See Its departure from the lineup.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} format meant that episodes of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> {{were no longer}} {{self-contained}} and could straddle between episodes, and an episode could end with a game in progress {{that would have to}} be continued on the next program. Also, if a champion won the jackpot in the Solo Game and retired, the opponent he/she had defeated in the Championship Round came back to play again in the Championship Round of the following game.|$|E
25|$|In the Solo Game, the {{champion}} was given sixty seconds to find ten {{words on a}} brand new board. The champion viewed the board on a telestrator screen. On the original Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> the Solo Game board was the same one used in the Semi-final/Qualifying Round and the screen was embedded in Jack Narz's podium. On the revival series, a separate podium was used and, as {{in the rest of}} the show, the board was computer-generated.|$|E

25|$|On both series, the Solo Game's jackpot {{started at}} $5,000. For each {{unsuccessful}} {{playing on the}} original Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> the jackpot increased by $1,000 and, if the pot reached $25,000, it froze there until it was won. Any contestant that won the Solo Game retired immediately as champion and the loser of the final round became the champion-designate for the next show/match (depending on the format; as noted above the change resulted in games that straddled episodes). A contestant was not limited as champion otherwise; champions played until they were defeated or won the Solo Game.|$|E
25|$|Bravery, {{self-reliance}} {{and strength}} {{are the greatest}} virtues. Underhandedness of any kind are dishonorable and at odds with Ulric's nature of directness and honor. Obey your military superiors and never refuse an order unless doing so would break another of Ulric's tenets. Never refuse a direct challenge. Modern weapons, such as gunpowder weapons, artillery, crossbows and fire-bombs, {{because they do not}} rely any physical strength are shunned. Followers of Ulric must never allow one of the fires of a shrine or temple to go out. Oppose Chaos wherever <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Never flee a fight unless facing overwhelming odds and the greater good would be served by such a flight.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} ran from April 1, 1974 to June 13, 1975 at 11:00 AM (10:00 Central) with Jack Narz hosting, {{replacing}} The $10,000 Pyramid, which moved to ABC {{one month after}} its CBS cancellation. Initially, it did well against Alex Trebek's American debut on NBC (The Wizard of Odds) but, three months later, NBC gave Trebek a new show called High Rollers at that slot and Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> began to struggle while the producers altered the format several times. The show was taped at CBS Television City in Studio 33, currently home to The Price Is Right. Some episodes used Studio 41, {{which at the time}} was the stage of CBS's Tattletales.|$|E

25|$|Like {{the second}} {{portion of the}} {{original}} run, the 1989 edition of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It</b> pitted two competitors in a qualifying round to determine who would advance to the championship round to face the returning champion or a champion-designate {{if there was no}} returning champion. The game, however, was conducted in a different manner. The most notable change was that made to the scoring system, as the contestants no longer had to name the correct line and position to score. Instead, the contestants only had to name the line and then the word. There was also no physical game board as there had been on the previous series, with the producers opting instead for a computer generated game board.|$|E
25|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn Cathy Davidson {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} attention blindness: humans perceive {{only a fraction of}} everything going on around us, particularly when we're focusing intently on one specific task, and that this attention blindness does not properly prepare us for the multi-task oriented digital age. According to Davidson, attention blindness is a basic neurological feature of the human brain. In the introduction of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> Davidson describes attending a lecture on attention blindness which addressed the tendency of the human brain to concentrate intensely on one task at the expense of missing almost everything else. To demonstrate this tendency, the lecturer showed a video of six people passing basketballs back and forth, and instructed viewers to count the number of tosses only between those wearing white shirts. Many people correctly counted fifteen tosses, yet nearly everyone failed to see someone in a full gorilla suit stride in among those tossing basketballs, then walk away. Davidson, who is dyslexic, didn’t even try to keep count, but instead decided to relax as she watched the tape, and thus, she noticed the gorilla.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics in {{the song}} are cryptic; The ending lines of the third verse emphasise in belief and assurance: [...] "If {{you could see it}} then you'd understand/ah, when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> then you'll understand," [...] and [...] "Some things you have to believe/others are puzzles puzzling me."

You understand more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division–how he feels about it and why he does what he does." ...|$|E
500|$|Wark {{played as}} a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; {{he was able to}} play as a {{defensive}} midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: [...] "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. If <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you." ...|$|E

500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask.

500|$|The novel {{has been}} noted for its poignant {{exploration}} of different forms of courage. Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt {{to stand up for}} him and defend him. [...] Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem {{one of the most significant}} lessons of courage. [...] In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is [...] "when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> through no matter what".|$|E
