25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.|$|E
500|$|York Park {{has often}} been criticised for its large playing surface, which is blamed for {{producing}} unattractive low-scoring football. Prior {{to the start of}} 2009, only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points. For a pre-season match in 2009, 13metres of width was removed from the outer wing [...] "in a bid to produce more attractive games." [...] Before the match, Groenewegen said, [...] "Because that outer wing was so wide, once they [...] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> far away from the goals." [...] The ground is also known for its strong wind, which hinders the accuracy of long-distance kicks that are propelled high into the air.|$|E
500|$|In early July 1778, the Prussian general Johann Jakob von Wunsch (1717–1788) {{crossed into}} Bohemia near the {{fortified}} town of Náchod with several hundred men. The local garrison, commanded by Friedrich Joseph, Freiherr (Baron) von Nauendorf, then a rittmeister (captain of cavalry), included only fifty hussars. Despite the poor numerical odds, Nauendorf sallied out to engage Wunsch's men. When his small force reached Wunsch's, he greeted the Prussians as friends; {{by the time}} the Prussians were close enough to realize the allegiance of the hussars, Nauendorf and his small band had acquired the upper hand. Wunsch withdrew; the next day, Nauendorf was promoted to major. In a letter to her son, the [...] Empress Maria Theresa [...] wrote: [...] "They say <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> pleased with Nauendorf, a rookie from Carlstadt or Hungary, who killed seven men, that you gave him twelve ducats." ...|$|E
