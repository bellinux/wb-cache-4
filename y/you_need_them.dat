500|$|Cisneros {{shows how}} Chicanas, like women {{of many other}} ethnicities, {{internalize}} these norms starting at a young age, through informal education by family members and popular culture. In The House on Mango Street, for example, a group of girl characters speculate about what function a woman’s hips have: [...] "They’re good for holding a baby when you’re cooking, Rachel says... <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> to dance, says Lucy... You gotta know how to walk with hips, practice you know." [...] Traditional female roles, such as childrearing, cooking, and attracting male attention, are understood by Cisneros's characters to be their biological destiny. However, when they reach adolescence and womanhood, they must reconcile their expectations about love and sex with their own experiences of disillusionment, confusion and anguish. Esperanza describes her [...] "sexual initiation"—an assault {{by a group of}} Anglo-American boys while awaiting her friend Sally at the fairground. She feels stricken and powerless after this, but above all betrayed; not only by Sally, who was not there for her, but [...] "by all the women who ever failed to contradict the romantic mythology of love and sex". Cisneros illustrates how this romantic mythology, fueled by popular culture, is often at odds with reality in Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories, where multiple references to romantic telenovelas obsessively watched by the female characters are juxtaposed with the abuse and poverty they face in their own lives.|$|E
2500|$|On her homepage, Pierce states {{she gets}} most ideas from things she stumbles upon. Her concept of magic as a {{tapestry}} of threads comes from her experiences in crocheting, {{and in her}} world, all mages are somehow based on British naturalist David Attenborough after watching his nature documentaries. Fantasy novels and Arthurian legend were {{the base of the}} worlds she thought up as a girl, and later she added contemporary issues like youth crime, cholera outbreaks in Africa. In general, Pierce states: [...] "The best way to prepare to have ideas when <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> is to listen to and encourage your obsessions." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{song with}} a brassy {{synthesised}} instrumental, {{the title and}} lyrics were inspired by the character Judge Dredd from the British comic book 2000 AD. The song's subject matter included sympathy and authority, and inspiration also came from an experience where Oakey {{was working as a}} hospital porter and encountered an injured bouncer. Wright states that it was the first song that the band wrote after the 1980 split, and was played live on the October 1980 tour. He goes on to say, [...] "It's specifically written from a policeman's point of view. It's very easy to run the police down until <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them.</b> There's very often a change of heart when you get your car stolen." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{believe in}} a better state of things, {{that there will be}} no more nurses, and that every mother will nurse her own offspring; for what can be more {{hardening}} and demoralising than to call forth the tenderest feelings of a woman's heart and cherish them yourself as long as <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them,</b> as long as your children require a nurse to love them, and then to blight and thwart and destroy them, whenever your own use for them is at an end? This may be Utopian; but it is always a little thing if one mother or two mothers can be brought to feel more tenderly to those who share their toil and have no part in their reward.|$|E

I had emptied my revolver, and my cartridges, Government ones, were all in a parcel--a confounded Government parcel--fastened with a strong brass wire. Where's the good of giving you cartridges, which you need in a hurry if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> at all, in a case you can't open without a special instrument? Well, as I ran, and the spears whizzed round me, I tore at the wire with my teeth. It gave at last, or my head would now be decorating a stake outside the chief's pah. But my teeth gave when the brass cord gave, and I'll never lift a heavy table with them again." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{shopping}} {{here is not}} so enslaving {{as it is with}} us--I mean, with you--because the fashions do not change, and you {{get things}} only when <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them,</b> not when you want them, or when other people think you do. The costume was fixed long ago, when the Altrurian era began, by a commission of artists, and it would be considered very bad form as well as bad morals to try changing it in the least. People are allowed to choose their own colors, but if one goes very wrong, or so far wrong as to offend the public taste, she is gently admonished by the local art commission. If she insists, they let her have her own way, but she seldom wants it when she knows that people think her a fright. Of course the costume is modified somewhat for the age and shape of the wearer, but this is not so often as you might think. There are no very lean or very stout people, though there are old and young, just as there are with us. But the Altrurians keep young very much longer than capitalistic peoples do, and the life of work keeps down their weight. You know I used to incline a little to over-plumpness, I really believe because I overate at times simply to keep from thinking of the poor who had to undereat, but that is quite past now; I have lost at least twenty-five pounds from working out-doors and travelling so much and living very, very simply.|$|E

40|$|What are antibiotics? Antibiotics are {{medicines}} used {{to treat}} infections caused by bacteria. Antibiotics don’t work against infections caused by viruses, such as colds and flu. So there’s no point taking antibiotics to treat a cold or flu, and no point asking your doctor to prescribe them for a cold or flu. Taking antibiotics when <b>you</b> don’t <b>need</b> <b>them,</b> like for a cold or flu, is a waste. It can also mean that they won’t work when <b>you</b> really <b>need</b> <b>them</b> for a serious infection. This is called antibiotic resistance and it happens when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics and learn to resist them. Taking antibiotics {{when they are not}} <b>needed</b> also puts <b>you</b> at risk of side effects, like a rash, upset stomach or diarrhoea...|$|R

They have the minds of little children--that is why they remain what they are." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{if you do}} forgive {{men that}} offend, Your heavenly Father will to you extend Forgiveness; but if not, nor will he spare, At any time when you {{offenders}} are. Moreover when you fast beware lest you Look sad, as hypocrites are wont to do; For they disguise their faces, that they may Appear to fast: they've their reward I say. But thou, when thou dost fast, anoint thine head And wash thy face, that undiscovered Thy fasting may be unto men, but rather That thou be seen in secret of thy Father: And then thy Father, who in secrecy Beholds thee, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up treasure for yourselves in store Upon the earth, where moth and rust devour, And where by thieves you may be quite bereaven. But lay up treasure for yourselves in heaven, Where neither moth, nor rust, nor thieves can enter: For where's your treasure there your hearts will centre. The eye's the light o' th' body, which if right Then thy whole body will be full of light: But if thine eye be evil, then there will A total darkness thy whole body fill. If therefore all the light that is in thee Be darkness, how great must that darkness be? No man can serve two masters, either he Will hate one, and love t'other, or will be Faithful to one, and t'other will forego. Ye cannot serve both God and mammon too. Take no thought therefore for your life, I say, What you shall eat or drink; or how you may Your bodies clothe. Is not the life much more Than meat; Is not the body far before The clothes thereof? Behold the fowls o' th' air, Nor sow nor reap, nor take they any care; How they provision into barns may gather; Yet they are nourish'd by your heavenly Father: Are ye not worth much more? Which of you can By taking thought add to his height one span? And why for raiment are ye taking thought? See how the lilies grow; they labour not, Nor do they spin; yet Solomon, I say, In all his pomp, had no such gay array. If in the field God so doth clothe the grass, Which is to-day, and doth to-morrow pass Into the oven, shall he not therefore O ye of little faith, clothe you much more? Take no thought therefore, saying, What shall we eat, Or drink, or where shall we our raiment get: (For thus the heathen people use to do) For that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>them</b> doth your Father know. But seek God's kingdom, and his righteousness First, and then all these things you shall possess. Be not then exercis'd with care and sorrow, In making preparation for the morrow; The morrow shall things for itself prepare: Sufficient to the day is each day's care.|$|E
