5|$|As with film, {{the rivalry}} between the clubs' {{hooligan}} firms has been covered in {{books such as}} Congratulations <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Just</b> Met the ICF by Cass Pennant, leader of the Inter City Firm. No One Likes Us, We Don't Care: True Stories from Millwall, Britain's Most Notorious Football Hooligans by Andrew Woods focuses on the fights between the two firms, {{from the perspective of}} Millwall's Bushwackers. Sunday Mirror columnist Michael Calvin spent the 2009–10 season covering Millwall, writing the book Family: Life, Death and Football. The beginning extensively features the rivalry and the stabbing of a Millwall supporter before the 2009 Upton Park riot game.|$|E

500|$|The {{narrative}} {{moves back}} and forth in time, with each new section leaping forward 10 to 30 years, and then backtracking, in [...] "fits and starts" [...] to fill in the missing details. Michael Berry said in the San Francisco Chronicle that this [...] "hopscotching strategy allows for multiple layers of suspense and irony". Rodriguez said these [...] "sudden shifts in points of view that give new meaning to the passage <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> read and leaps in chronology that keep crucial incidents offstage" [...] makes it an [...] "agile, sometimes tricky novel", and the closest Irving has come to writing metafiction.|$|E

500|$|The Oliviers filmed That Hamilton Woman (1941) with Olivier as Horatio Nelson and Leigh as Emma Hamilton. With the United States not yet having {{entered the}} war, {{it was one}} of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British {{sentiment}} among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States and an outstanding success in the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill arranged a screening for a party that included Franklin D. Roosevelt and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, [...] "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> been taking part." [...] The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request {{for the rest of his}} life; and, of Leigh, he was quoted as saying, [...] "By Jove, she's a clinker." ...|$|E

500|$|Roosevelt was {{impressed}} by some models Saint-Gaudens had prepared for the cent showing a head of Liberty. [...] In early 1907, he wrote to Saint-Gaudens proposing that a Native American or Indian headdress {{be added to the}} obverse of the cent: [...] "I feel very strongly that on at least one coin we ought to have the Indian feather headdress. [...] It is distinctly American, and very picturesque. [...] Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> such a head as you have now, but with the feather headdress?" [...] Numismatic historian Walter Breen described this as [...] "the absurd addition of a feathered warbonnet, such as neither Ms. Liberty nor any Native American woman would ever have worn". [...] Art historian Cornelius Vermeule stated that the Indian Head eagle [...] "missed being a great coin because Roosevelt interfered with the choice of headdress (or no headdress) for Liberty".|$|E
500|$|At the World Science Fiction Convention in 1965, held in London, Bonfiglioli persuaded several {{well-known}} {{writers to}} appear in an [...] "all-star issue ... with specially written stories round the theme of 'sacrifice. The issue in question {{was the first one}} under the new title of Impulse, in March 1966; it included fiction by James Blish, Brian Aldiss, Harry Harrison, J.G. Ballard, Poul Anderson, Jack Vance, and Keith Roberts, who contributed [...] "The Signaller", the first story in his Pavane sequence. The second issue was also high quality, with another Pavane story and a short story by John Brunner from his [...] "Traveller in Black" [...] series. Subsequent issues did not sustain this high level, but overall, in Ashley's opinion, the twelve issues of Impulse contained [...] "some of the best SF and fantasy ever published in British magazines". Christopher Priest's first story, [...] "The Run", appeared in the May 1966 issue, and Chris Boyce's second story, [...] "George", was published in June 1966. Two novels were serialised in Impulse, both well-received: Harry Harrison's Make Room! Make Room! (later made into the movie Soylent Green), and Moorcock's The Ice Schooner. Other notable stories listed by Ashley include Thomas Disch's [...] "The Roaches" [...] and [...] "The Number <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Just</b> Reached", and Aldiss's [...] "The Eyes of the Blind King". Stableford also praises the covers for the last few issues, which were mostly done by Keith Roberts in a semi-abstract style unlike conventional genre art.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles' second {{recording}} {{session with}} Martin was on 4 September 1962, when they recorded [...] "How Do You Do It", heavily modified by The Beatles which Martin {{thought was a}} sure-fire hit, even though Lennon and McCartney {{did not want to}} release it, not being one of their own compositions or style. Martin was correct: Gerry & the Pacemakers' version, which Martin produced, spent three weeks at No. 1 in April 1963, before being displaced by [...] "From Me to You". On 11 September 1962, the Beatles re-recorded [...] "Love Me Do" [...] with session player Andy White playing drums. Ringo Starr was asked to play tambourine and maracas, and although he complied, he was definitely [...] "not pleased". Due to an EMI library error, a 4 September version with Starr playing drums was issued on the British single release; afterwards, the tape was destroyed, and the 11 September recording with Andy White on drums was used for all subsequent releases. Martin would later praise Starr's drumming, calling him [...] "probably... the finest rock drummer in the world today". As [...] "Love Me Do" [...] peaked at number 17 in the British charts, on 26 November 1962 Martin recorded [...] "Please Please Me", which he did only after Lennon and McCartney had almost begged him to record another of their original songs. Martin's crucial contribution to the song was to tell them to speed up what was initially a slow ballad. After the recording Martin looked over the mixing desk and said, [...] "Gentlemen, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> made your first number one record". Martin directed Epstein to find a good publisher, as Ardmore & Beechwood had done nothing to promote [...] "Love Me Do", informing Epstein of three publishers who, in Martin's opinion, would be fair and honest, which led them to Dick James.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed response upon its original release, but {{has earned a}} better reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy. It currently holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a [...] "watered down J. R. R. Tolkien ... without charm as well as interest." [...] Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Unlike many screen fantasies, The Dark Crystal casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that it's over before you realize it. You're left with the feeling that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> awakened from a dream." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Radwańska's main {{weaknesses}} is {{her lack}} of power in her serve. Her serve, especially her second serve, is generally slow and vulnerable to attack. Her shots sometimes lack penetration on court, posing little threat to power hitters. [...] "I don't think I can ever serve 200 kilometers per hour, it's just not my body," [...] Radwańska said. [...] "I {{have to do something}} else. I was just born to play like this. I have so many ideas. In your mind it's like, 'OK, I go down the line, then crosscourt, maybe drop shot.' But <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> one second, or even not one second, it just has to be automatic." [...] Radwańska merely exhales when she strikes the ball, rather than loudly grunting like many of her peers. She bounces the ball no more than four times before serving. She says she can play with any racket and likes to use one for an entire match, unlike most players, who routinely grab frames with fresh strings.|$|E

50|$|A {{second example}} in no-limit Texas hold'em: The board is 5♠ 6♠ 7♣ 8♦ 2♣ {{and the first}} player bets. Assume that this player will only bet any 9 (a 9-high straight) or 9-T (a Ten-high straight) for value, and {{otherwise}} is bluffing. Raising his bet with any 9 (a nine-high straight) is a negative freeroll because the betting player has no hands that lose to a 9-high straight with which to call. The bettor either folds (in which case you win the same as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> called), calls with a 9 (you split the pot, {{which is the same}} as if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> called), or calls with 9-T (you lose more than if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> called). Raising with a 9 would only have merit as a bluff if you believed this player capable of folding any hand but 9-T.|$|R
