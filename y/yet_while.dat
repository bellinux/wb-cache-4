5|$|During this period, Prime Minister Menzies {{recommended}} that Playford be bestowed with {{a form of}} honours. Playford's wish was to be made a privy councillor, <b>yet,</b> <b>while</b> entirely possible, if granted {{it would lead to}} demands from other state Premiers. Playford's grandfather had declined a KCMG, and Playford himself did initially, but under the influence of Menzies he eventually accepted the honour and was knighted in 1957, but this time a class above the KCMG; the GCMG.|$|E
5|$|Pyrrhus {{lost much}} of his support among the Macedonians in 273 BC when his unruly Gallic mercenaries plundered the royal {{cemetery}} of Aigai. Pyrrhus pursued Antigonus II in Greece, <b>yet</b> <b>while</b> he was occupied with {{the war in the}} Peloponnese, Antigonus II was able to recapture Macedonia. While battling for control over Argos in 272 BC, Pyrrhus was killed while fighting in the city's streets, allowing Antigonus II to reclaim Greece as well. He then restored the Argead dynastic graves at Aigai by constructing a massive tumulus. Antigonus II also secured the Illyrian front and annexed Paeonia.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. <b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> historians often dismissed it {{as the last of}} the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|E

5|$|Trimmer's {{works are}} {{dedicated}} to maintaining {{many aspects of the}} social and political status quo. As a high church Anglican, she was intent on promoting the established Church of England and on teaching young children and the poor the doctrines of Christianity. Her writings outlined the benefits of social hierarchy, arguing that each class should remain in its God-given position. <b>Yet,</b> <b>while</b> supporting many of the traditional political and social ideologies of her time, Trimmer questioned others, such as those surrounding gender and the family.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} X-Men films and Deadpool set opening records in North America: X-Men {{had the highest}} July opening <b>yet,</b> <b>while</b> X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand earned the fourth-highest opening {{weekends}} yet and Deadpool got the largest opening weekend in February. The records {{for the first three}} films have since been surpassed. The next three X-Men films after X-Men: The Last Stand opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records. In North America, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series, and it also has the highest opening weekend. Outside North America, X-Men: Days of Future Past has the highest opening weekend and is the highest-grossing film in the series. Worldwide, Deadpool is the highest-grossing film in the series and the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became increasingly clear that the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} {{represented a}} watershed {{in the campaign}} for the Australians, and while they had deployed outside Phuoc Tuy Province previously, they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength, rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas. With 1 ATF deploying astride the communist lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong {{had been forced to}} respond, resulting in a set-piece battle far removed from the counter-insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused. <b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF, they had come close to suffering defeat {{at the hands of the}} North Vietnamese. Inexperienced at large air-mobile operations, poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly-in to FSB Coral, leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night. The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers, with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam, forcing them to refine their tactics. Later, the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the constant movement of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength, which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol.|$|E

25|$|Giraud's escape {{was soon}} known all over France.

In retaliation, Heinrich Himmler ordered the Gestapo to try to assassinate him and to arrest any members of Giraud's family that could be found, who would be held hostage in order to discourage Giraud from cooperating with the Allies. Seventeen members of Giraud's extended family were arrested.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the losses}} {{suffered}} at Binh Ba forced the NVA {{to move out}} of Phuoc Tuy into adjoining provinces and although the Australians did encounter main force units in the years to come, the Battle of Binh Ba marked the end of such clashes. <b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> the Viet Cong had largely been forced to withdraw to the borders of the province by 1968–69, the situation in Phuoc Tuy was challenged on several occasions in the following years, including during the 1968 Tet Offensive, as well as in mid-1969 following the incursion of the North Vietnamese 33rd Regiment, again in mid-1971 with further incursions by the 33rd Regiment and several Viet Cong main force units, and finally during the Easter Offensive in 1972. Attacks on RF outposts and incursions into the villages had also continued.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, it {{appeared}} increasingly problematic to {{find room for}} a nuclear weapons program in the defense economy; secondly, the situation was proving that future wars would be likely waged with conventional weapons (especially, after studying the NATO's flexible response doctrine); thirdly, it was decided (yet unclear how) that Sweden was covered by the US nuclear umbrella. Just before the Government's position became known, the Defense Ministry announced that Sweden's security would be undermined if the country joined the non-proliferation agreement, because the treaty addressed small countries that hadn't acquired any nuclear weapons <b>yet,</b> <b>while</b> the US and the Soviet Union's nuclear possessions remained untouched. Thus, Sweden was under risk to yield its Freedom of action to nothing in return, while the nuclear threat against the country would remain.|$|E

25|$|Barks's stories (whether humorous adventures or {{domestic}} comedies) often exhibited a wry, dark irony born of hard experience. The ten-pagers showcased Donald as everyman, struggling against the cruel bumps and bruises {{of everyday life}} with the nephews often acting as a Greek chorus commenting on the unfolding disasters Donald wrought upon himself. <b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> seemingly defeatist in tone, the humanity of the characters shines through in their persistence despite the obstacles. These stories found popularity not only among young children but adults as well. Despite the fact that Barks had done little traveling his adventure stories often had the duck clan globe-trotting to the most remote or spectacular of places. This allowed Barks to indulge his penchant for elaborate backgrounds that hinted at his thwarted ambitions of doing realistic stories in the vein of Hal Foster's Prince Valiant.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, {{players from}} the AAFC's defunct teams – {{including}} the Bills – went into a dispersal draft. Gibron, however, was sold along with halfback Rex Bumgardner and defensive tackle John Kissell to the Browns in a deal that gave Bills owner James Breuil a 25% share in the team. In the Browns, Gibron joined a team that had won all of the AAFC's four championships behind an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli. <b>Yet</b> <b>while</b> the Browns had been the league's best team, many sportswriters and owners doubted that the team would continue its string of success against NFL teams starting in 1950. Cleveland started the season by beating the previous year's NFL champion Philadelphia Eagles {{and went on to}} win the NFL championship over the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of refrigeration {{and evolution of}} additional technologies drastically changed agriculture in the United States. During {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, farming was a common occupation and lifestyle for United States citizens, as most farmers actually lived on their farm. In 1935, there were 6.8 million farms in the United States and a population of 127 million. <b>Yet,</b> <b>while</b> the United States population has continued to climb, citizens pursuing agriculture continue to decline. Based on the 2007 US Census, {{less than one percent of}} a population of 310 million people claim farming as an occupation today. However, the increasing population has led to an increasing demand for agricultural products, which is met through a greater variety of crops, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved technology. Improved technology has decreased the risk and time involved if agricultural management and allows larger farms to increase their output per person to meet society’s demand.|$|E
