A complete list of the ingredients includes: soybean oil, water, egg yolk, gluconic acid, <b>yeast</b> <b>extract,</b> stabilizer (microcrystalline cellulose, modified food starch, xanthan gum, guar gum, gum arabic), cultured dextrose, salt, sugar, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, spice, natural smoke flavor, natural flavors, tocopherols, calcium disodium EDTA, and autolyzed <b>yeast</b> <b>extract.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD {{was first}} {{discovered by the}} British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered <b>yeast</b> <b>extract</b> greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a coferment. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor {{was identified as a}} nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.|$|E

500|$|Eduard Buchner {{submitted}} {{his first}} {{paper on the}} study of <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> in 1897. In a series of experiments at the University of Berlin, he found that sugar was fermented by <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture. He named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose [...] "zymase". In 1907, he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for [...] "his discovery of cell-free fermentation". Following Buchner's example, enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out: the suffix -ase is combined with the name of the substrate (e.g., lactase is the enzyme that cleaves lactose) or to the type of reaction (e.g., DNA polymerase forms DNA polymers).|$|R
30|$|Three clonies {{containing}} of pPICZα-D 12 -UTI {{showed the}} highest expression level in shake-flask expression than other recombinant plasmids (Data not shown). The effects of pH value and carbon sources on the expression level of rh-UTI in P. pastoris/pPICZα-D 12 -UTI {{were also investigated}} by shake-flask fermentation. The pH value of BMGY media was adjusted to the desired value. The {{results showed that the}} expression levels of rh-bikunin were different when pH of medium varied from 4.0 - 7.0. When the pH value was 6.0 - 6.5, the expression level of rh-UBI was higher than those of other pH values. In order to determine the effect of feeding mode on the expression level of rh-UBI, inorganic salt, peptone, <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> and glycerol was used as the carbon sources in BMGY media by continuous fed-batch mode, respectively. The results displayed that when the inorganic salt, peptone and <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> were used as the carbon sources in BMGY media, the expression level of rh-UBI was higher than that of glycerol. Therefore, the optimal pH (6.0 - 6.5) and carbon sources (inorganic salt, peptone or <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts)</b> were selected as shake-flask condition and further fermentation (data not shown).|$|R
25|$|Arthur Harden and William Young {{along with}} Nick Sheppard determined, {{in a second}} experiment, that a {{heat-sensitive}} high-molecular-weight subcellular fraction (the enzymes) and a heat-insensitive low-molecular-weight cytoplasm fraction (ADP, ATP and NAD+ and other cofactors) are required together for fermentation to proceed. This experiment begun by observing that dialyzed (purified) yeast juice could not ferment or even create a sugar phosphate. This mixture was rescued {{with the addition of}} undialyzed <b>yeast</b> <b>extract</b> that had been boiled. Boiling the <b>yeast</b> <b>extract</b> renders all proteins inactive (as it denatures them). The ability of boiled extract plus dialyzed juice to complete fermentation suggests that the cofactors were non-protein in character.|$|E

40|$|The SIR 2, SIR 3, and SIR 4 silent {{information}} regulator proteins {{are involved}} in the assembly of silent chromatin domains in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a series of biochemical experiments, we have studied protein–protein interactions involving these proteins. We found that <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> contained a SIR 2 /SIR 4 complex that was associated with little or no SIR 3. However, truncations of the N-terminal two-thirds of the SIR 4 protein allowed it to efficiently associate with SIR 3, suggesting that the N-terminal domain of SIR 4 inhibited its interaction with SIR 3. We propose that the SIR 3 and SIR 4 proteins interact only during the assembly of the SIR protein complex at the silencer and that an early step in assembly unmasks the SIR 4 protein to allow its association with SIR 3. To test whether the interactions observed in <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> were direct, we tested these SIR-SIR interactions using bacterially expressed SIR proteins. We observed direct interactions between SIR 4 and SIR 2, SIR 4 and SIR 3, SIR 2 and SIR 3, SIR 2 and SIR 2, and SIR 4 and SIR 4, indicating that the associations observed in <b>yeast</b> <b>extracts</b> were direct...|$|R
