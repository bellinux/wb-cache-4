[...] The book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers used him as an example while discussing how the [...] "party members don't need to be human". In 2008, UGO Team stated this [...] "undisputed champion of Fallout characters" [...] is not [...] "only our favorite Fallout character, he's also one of gaming's greatest dogs." [...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d even {{go so far as to}} say we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so he could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided <b>you</b> <b>protect</b> him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN chose Dogmeat as the top feature he wished to return in Fallout 4.|$|E

[...] During a May 15, 2007, appearance on the Fox News talk show Hannity and Colmes, Paul argued that his pro-life position was consistent with his libertarian values, asking, [...] "If you can't protect life then how can <b>you</b> <b>protect</b> liberty?" [...] Furthermore, Paul argued in this appearance that since he believes libertarians support non-aggression, libertarians should oppose abortion because abortion is [...] "an act of aggression" [...] against a fetus, which he believes is alive, human, and in possession of legal rights.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the record}} of Daoxin’s teachings (The Five Gates of Daoxin) did not appear until the second decade of the eighth century, after Hongren’s record, its {{historical}} accuracy is in some doubt. The Chronicle of the Lankavatara Masters, {{which appeared in the}} early eighth century, has Daoxin quoting from the Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom) and Pure Land sutras [...] but whether study of these sutras formed part of Daoxin’s teachings is unlikely. It is clear, however, that Daoxin taught meditation. The Zen scholar Seizan Yanagida stated that the expression “samadhi of one practice” was the heart of Daoxin’s practice. The Five Gates of Daoxin quotes him as saying “Buddha is the mind. Outside of the mind there is no Buddha.” [...] In a later chronicle he is quoted exhorting his students to “Sit earnestly in meditation! Sitting in meditation is basic to all else….Do not read the sutras, discuss with no one!” (ibid) On his deathbed, the Compendium of Five Lamps records that Daoxin said, “All of the myriad dharmas of the world are to be dropped away. Each of <b>you,</b> <b>protect</b> this understanding and carry it into the future.” ...|$|E
