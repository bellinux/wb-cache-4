500|$|Clayton's {{findings}} did {{not have}} any practical application {{until the end of the}} 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?" [...] Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.|$|E

Powell, state prisoners could only appeal Fourth Amendment claims to the U.S. Supreme Court on a writ of certiorari from the state's supreme court. Rice's appellate counsel, Father William Cunningham, a Jesuit priest, said to the U.S. Supreme Court during oral arguments, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> my client, after all this time, that he has pursued the wrong legal avenue?" ...|$|E
