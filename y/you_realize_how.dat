Koppett said that Alston's loyalty and subdued nature contributed to the stability that the team enjoyed. O'Malley once commented that Alston was [...] "non-irritating. Do <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> {{important it is to}} have a manager who doesn't irritate you?" ...|$|E
500|$|Cher {{was named}} the number-one dance artist of 1999 by Billboard. At the 1999 World Music Awards, she {{received}} the Legend Award for her [...] "lifelong contribution to the music industry". Her next film, Franco Zeffirelli's Tea with Mussolini (1999), got mixed reviews, but she earned critical acclaim for her performance as a rich, flamboyant American socialite whose visit to Italy is not welcome among the Englishwomen; one reviewer from Film Comment wrote, [...] "It is only after she appears that <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> sorely she's been missed from movie screens! For Cher is a star. That is, she manages the movie star trick of being at once a character {{and at the same}} time never allowing you to forget: that's Cher." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman later {{admitted}} {{that while the}} band was listening to Metallica and Megadeth at the time, they were finding the repetition of guitar riffs tiring. He said, [...] "If we do a verse two or three times, we're already bored with it. So we weren't {{trying to make the}} songs shorter—that's just what we were into," [...] which resulted in the album's short duration of 29 minutes. King had stated that while hour-long records seem to be the trend, [...] "ou could lose this part; you could cut this song completely, and make a much more intense record, which is what we're all about." [...] When the record was completed, the band met with Rubin, who asked: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> short this is?" [...] Slayer members looked at each other, and replied: [...] "So what?" [...] The entire album was on one side of a cassette; King stated it was [...] "neat," [...] as [...] "You could listen to it, flip it over, and play it again." [...] The music is abrasive and faster than previous releases, helping to narrow the gap between thrash metal and its predecessor hardcore punk, and is played at an average of 220 beats per minute.|$|E

500|$|The {{prevailing}} critical {{view of the}} Beach Boys' {{early music}} changed after the 1970s, as academic Andrew Flory writes, [...] "Today , the group’s legacy in the rock press is contingent almost entirely on their experimental music ... while earlier surf-oriented albums receive little canonical attention." [...] Since the 1990s, the band has undergone a process of critical reevaluation. C.W. Mahoney of The Washington Free Beacon characterizes Wilson's appeal to the millennial indie music landscape as [...] "a Daniel Johnston who made listenable music". Love feels that the [...] "formula" [...] quote [...] "crystallizes" [...] a false theme that runs throughout the writings of Wilson's [...] "awestruck biographers": [...] "the morality tale of the tormented genius who was undone by his own family—putting commerce ahead of art—that tale was too great to resist." [...] Mahoney comments that in the 2016 memoir I Am Brian Wilson, [...] "Wilson takes the opportunity to elaborate his victim narrative, airing grievances about Mike or Murry or Carl or Dennis not always liking his creative decisions and how deeply it wounded him ... While Wilson deserves pity for his struggles with sanity, that pity is stretched {{to the breaking point}} when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> [...] he could afford to throw away." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making {{a big deal out}} of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
500|$|Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network {{described}} Dragon Balls setting as [...] "a {{melting pot}} of sci-fi, fantasy, and folklore". Santos praised its quick {{development of new}} characters and storylines, and claimed that the series' crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes. However, he did not enjoy the cliché training and tournament segments, nor its crude humor. His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga's story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation {{one of the best}} of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. Animerica felt the series had [...] "worldwide appeal," [...] using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to [...] "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans". Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux described Toriyama as a [...] "super-cartoonist," [...] a blend of Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, and Peyo. He gave Dragon Ball a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read. Ridwan Khan of Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a [...] "chubby" [...] art style, but as the series continued the characters became more refined, leaner, and more muscular. He cited one slight problem in Viz's release; the translation uses informal language to capture Goku's country accent, but it ends up feeling [...] "forced and odd". Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations. Ollie Barber writing for Forbes echoed Khan stating with a lot less padding, the manga's [...] "pacing is a lot tighter and makes <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> talented Dragon Ball's creator Akira Toriyama truly is when he chooses to flex his storytelling muscles".|$|E

2500|$|The House in Paris {{was first}} {{published}} in 1935 by London-based Victor Gollancz for English audiences. Perhaps thinking of them, Gollancz {{wrote in a letter to}} Bowen, [...] "I wonder if <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> un-English it is?" [...] Alfred A. Knopf published the novel for American audiences one year later. In 1972, Penguin released an edition of the novel with an introduction by A.S. Byatt, and re-released it in 1987; this edition was republished in 2002 by Anchor Books.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Once Upon a Time's {{trend of}} setting up the next season in the finale {{continued}} with the final installments of Season 5. Regina thankfully didn't {{go back to her}} Evil Queen ways and they, in fact, put a fresh spin on her turmoil and tied it nicely to the Jekyll/Hyde mythology. The only hiccup – and it was a big one – was Henry's all over the map behavior that caused all sorts of action. Two jam-packed episodes after a somewhat sleepy half season in the Underworld was jarring and made <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> much story the show can churn through when it's not stretching out a [...] "themed" [...] plot."

2500|$|Mahoney {{considers}} that [...] "While Wilson deserves pity for his struggles with sanity, that pity is {{stretched to the}} breaking point when <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> [...] he could afford to throw away." [...] In the revised 1985 edition of his book, Leaf wrote that he [...] "no longer indict the world of 'being bad to Brian,' when it’s apparent that Brian has been hardest on himself." [...] After a jury ruled that Love was owed credit to 39 songs previously credited solely to Wilson and that Wilson or his agents had engaged in promissory fraud, the potential damages were estimated to range between $58 million and $342 million. According to Love, [...] "To Brian’s fans, he was beyond accountability. ... By now, the myth was too strong, the legend too great. Brian was the tormented genius who suffered to deliver us his music—the forever victim, as his lawyer said." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called it [...] "an articulate, acutely observant film [...] makes <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> starved Hollywood movies are for great {{ensemble}} acting [...] [...] [...] {{the movie has}} such finely woven performances that the best scenes project a convincing illusion of spontaneity [...] [...] [...] Ms. Leigh and Mr. Cumming's screenplay does an amazing job of creating about a dozen fully rounded, nuanced characters {{with a minimum of}} words. The dialogue, though it comes quickly and in scraps, is so juicy that the zest with which the actors bite into it suggests they invented it themselves [...] [...] [...] This isn't Chekhov, {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn't all-embracing. Yet despite its shortcomings, this smart, caustic movie is easily the most incisive and realistic comedy of manners to emerge from Hollywood in quite a while, and that's saying a lot." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half stars, finding that the film [...] "makes up" [...] for the 1998 version and praised Edwards, stating, [...] "The {{director}} thinks visually, which sounds redundant until <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>how</b> many monster movies are flat, effects-dependent factory jobs. Edwards knows how to use great heights for great effect." [...] Phillips also praised the film's build-up, stating, [...] "director Gareth Edwards lays the expository groundwork nicely and hands the audience what it craves in the second half" [...] and defended the amount of screen-time Godzilla received, stating, [...] "Is there enough Godzilla in Godzilla? Folks, there is. There is just enough." [...] David Blaustein of ABC News Radio called the film [...] "very good, but not great", criticizing the film for not having enough screen-time for Godzilla, stating, [...] "There’s not enough Godzilla. When the monster’s away, the movie drags. It’s clear what Edwards and company are trying to do here. i.e. less is more. The issue is, this Godzilla is so much fun to watch, we never want it leave the screen and when he/she/it's not there, it's a letdown." [...] Regardless, Blaustein stated that the film's finale, [...] "more or less, makes it all worth the wait", and awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of five.|$|E
2500|$|On January 6, 2010, it was {{reported}} that the White House was considering two dates for Barack Obama's annual State of the Union address, which is typically on the last Tuesday of January at 9:00: January 26 and February 2. [...] Were the latter date selected, the Lost premiere would be preempted and have to air at a later date, sabotaging months of promotion by ABC for [...] "The Final Season" [...] and forcing some awkward rescheduling of the season, which had no leeway for interruptions. [...] This prompted an online protest among fans and the story was picked up by dozens of media outlets. [...] On January 8, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs announced [...] "I don't foresee a scenario in which millions of people who hope to finally get some conclusion with Lost are preempted by the president", to which Damon Lindelof responded via his Twitter account with [...] "OBAMA BACKED DOWN!!!! [...] Groundhog Day is OURS!!!!!!! [...] (God Bless America)". [...] Ben East of the United Arab Emirates The National newspaper summed up the story with [...] "confirmation of just how important [...] is came with an almost unbelievable communiqué from the White House last week … That's right.
