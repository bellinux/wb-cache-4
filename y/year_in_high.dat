5|$|The pupal cocoon is spun from silk, {{but like}} the larval case, often has other {{materials}} attached. When pupating, species that build portable cases attach them to some underwater object, seal {{the front and back}} apertures against predators while still allowing water to flow through, and pupate within it. Once fully developed, most pupal caddisflies cut through their cases with a special pair of mandibles, swim up to the water surface, moult using the exuviae as a floating platform, and emerge as fully formed adults. They can often fly immediately after breaking from their pupal cuticle. Emergence is mainly univoltine (once per year) with all the adults of a species emerging at the same time. Development is within a year in warm places, but takes over a <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> latitudes and at high elevation in mountain lakes and streams.|$|E

40|$|Student-centredness is {{a central}} concept in the {{literature}} and practice associated with the first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education.
