500|$|Formby was {{the first}} comic to use a delayed {{entrance}} as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as [...] "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would {{say that he was}} [...] "Coughin' well tonight!" [...] He also created the phrase [...] "It's not the cough that carries <b>you</b> <b>off</b> – it's the coffin they carries <b>you</b> <b>off</b> in!" [...] One of Formby's nicknames, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale" [...] was coined {{because of the way he}} used his bronchial cough in his act.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Beast {{journalist}} John Batchelor {{called the}} book [...] "raucous, trenchant, knee-slapping". The New York Times reviewed the work, with John Williams observing, [...] "Matt Taibbi didn’t see much moderation while covering {{the most recent}} campaign season for Rolling Stone." [...] Williams pointed out the work {{did not make a}} pretense of having an objective viewpoint, writing, [...] "If his title (or familiarity with his previous work) didn’t tip <b>you</b> <b>off,</b> Taibbi doesn’t aim for a neutral tone." [...] Bustle writer Kerri Jarema observed, [...] "Matt Taibbi tells the story of Western civilization's very own train wreck, from its tragicomic beginnings to its apocalyptic conclusion." [...] Jarema described the author's writing as [...] "dead-on, real-time analysis".|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} Italian father Tony {{was played}} by Frank H. Crane. Crane was {{involved}} in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. In the role of Tony's wife was Anna Rosemond, who was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Marie Eline, played the role of Tony's son, was concealed in masculine make up and black hair for the role of the Italian boy. The Moving Picture World said, [...] "aybe you'd never recognize her if we did not tip <b>you</b> <b>off.</b> Don't pass the tip to others in your place, but see if their little favorite doesn't fool them completely in her masculine makeup."

500|$|...The Take Over, the Breaks Over"" [...] was {{released}} in August 2007 in the US as the third single and failed to chart on the Hot 100, although it did reach number 48 on the UK Singles Chart, with its highest position at number seventeen in Australia, becoming the third consecutive top twenty hit from Infinity on High in that region. The fourth and last single, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get <b>You</b> <b>Off</b> (Me & You)" [...] managed to reach number 68 in the US and made the top 30 in Australia. [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] was not an official single but it {{was released}} online by the band before Infinitys release and was later given as an exclusive download to iTunes; it managed to reach number eighty-one on the Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. We hate to tip <b>you</b> <b>off</b> as to WHAT it is. When you see the picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman revealed that she was attracted to the mesh of sexuality and humour in the personality of Chrissie, declaring, [...] "What I really like is she's got the sex and dry sarcasm". Speaking to the official EastEnders website, she expanded on the importance of Chrissie's sense of humour and wit to her [...] "feisty" [...] characterisation: [...] "What I love about Chrissie is that she's a good strong, funny female character... she's got a really good sense of humour which is necessary to deal with Den. She's very good at wisecracks. Den has the one-liners, but Chrissie bats them right back." [...] Chrissie's barbed and biting remarks became a prominent feature of the character; even when cornered by Den's adopted daughter Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) after attempting to flee the country, she remarks: [...] "You really are your father's daughter, Sharon. No shaking <b>you</b> <b>off</b> either." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses <b>you</b> <b>off.</b> It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and all you want to do is get more drunk".|$|E
500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep <b>you</b> <b>off</b> my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to take someone home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Grand Unification (2006), Vik Bansal of MusicOMH wrote about their varied dynamics: [...] "Where others are happy to be one-dimensional, Fightstar are not content unless a song moves fluidly through {{seemingly}} incongruous but ultimately coherent moods and musical dynamics. The interspersion of thoroughly heavy metal sections within the otherwise widescreen rock of 'Grand Unification Pt I' and 'Sleep Well Tonight' encapsulates this perfectly". One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours showed the band expanding their sound and pushing further into both lighter and heavier territories, {{with a mixture of}} more melodic soundscapes and heavier metallic styles. According to Q magazine, [...] "The intricate instrumental passages, multi-tracked vocal harmonies and pounding riffs hint at Muse-scale ambition and intellect". The Sun described One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours sound as [...] "heavier, slicker and as focused as ever, tracks such as '99' and 'We Apologise For Nothing' embrace an epic, panoramic sound that sweeps <b>you</b> <b>off</b> your feet. It’s aggressive but emotive, with heaps of melody among the huge riffs." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Fall Out Boy began searching for {{potential}} producers. The band sought out R singer/producer Babyface, as they admired {{his work on}} the soundtrack to the 2001 film version of Josie and the Pussycats. Babyface saw one of the interviews in which the band discussed its desire to work with him and contacted the group. Babyface produced two of the songs, [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get <b>You</b> <b>Off</b> (Me & You)" [...] and [...] "Thnks fr th Mmrs". Neal Avron, who also produced the band's previous album, handled production for eleven of Infinity on Highs fourteen tracks. Before recording, the band began with six weeks of pre-production, which was encouraged by Avron. This period included both rehearsals and writing, as well as working out all the sounds and arrangements. It began in Chicago before the group relocated to the Swing House studios in Los Angeles. Additionally, some rough recordings of songs were created {{to be used in the}} studio as a future reference.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Ardai {{stated that}} [...] "Unlike many recent CD-ROM upgrades, {{which have been}} embarrassing and amateurish", the CD-ROM version [...] "has the stamp of quality all over it", with the added dialogue and sound effects [...] "like taking a silent film and {{turning it into a}} talkie ... It's hard to go back to reading text off a monitor after experiencing a game like this". He concluded that [...] "LucasArts has done an impeccable job ... a must-see". In 1992 the magazine named the title as one of the year's four best adventure games. Andy Nuttal of Amiga Format wrote, [...] "The puzzles are very well thought-out, with some exquisite, subtle elements that give you a real kick when you solve them." [...] He noted that the game is [...] "littered with elements that are genuinely funny". His sole complaint was about the game's linearity compared to Monkey Island 2; but he finished by saying, [...] "It's a minor point, anyway, and it shouldn't put <b>you</b> <b>off</b> buying what {{is one of the best}} Amiga adventures ever." [...] In 2008, Retro Gamer Magazine praised it as [...] "a masterful piece of storytelling, and a spellbinding adventure".|$|E
500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] Take This to Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get <b>You</b> <b>Off</b> (Me & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what the boys have become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{critical}} {{reception for}} {{the album was}} mostly positive, praising its experimental tendencies. Critic Lester Bangs of Creem declared it [...] "Incredible", while Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave it an [...] "A" [...] rating, stating that [...] "The idea of this record—top of the pops from quasi-dadaist British synth wizard—may put <b>you</b> <b>off,</b> but the actuality is quite engaging in a vaguely Velvet Underground kind of way." [...] Billboard wrote a positive review, stating that [...] "...while it all {{may be a bit}} unpredictable, and may be a longshot to do much in the U.S. market, it is an excellent LP." [...] The album was also placed in Circus magazine's section for [...] "Picks of the Month". Cynthia Dagnal of Rolling Stone wrote an article on Eno, calling the album [...] "a very compelling experiment in controlled chaos and by his own self-dictated standards a near success." [...] The next month, Gordon Fletcher wrote a negative review for the album in the [...] "Records" [...] section of Rolling Stone, stating [...] " [...] record is annoying because it doesn't do anything... the listener must kick himself for blowing five bucks on baloney."Here Come the Warm Jets review] |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/here-come-the-warm-jets-19741024 |publisher=Wenner Media |accessdate=21 December 2014}} In 1974, Here Come the Warm Jets was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for that year.|$|E
500|$|The clean {{version of}} [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from music critics who noted the effective melding {{of the intense}} vocal delivery of Hilson with the rapid pace and banging beat of the song. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that all the five songs Hilson penned for No Boys Allowed, {{with the exception of}} the [...] "frantic electronic firework 'The Way You Love Me', are too featureless to make an impression." [...] Ben Hatliff of The New York Times commented that Hilson [...] "gets a certain energy out of bossiness" [...] on [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] which according to him, goes far for a mainstream female singer in its boasting and sexual hunger. He also added that [...] "it sometimes seems as if it were not a man at all she wants to boss around but Rihanna." [...] Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Hilson moves [...] "to a gritted-teeth half-rapped, half-sung approach" [...] for [...] "The Way You Love Me". He went on complimenting the heavy beat of the song which according to him, matches the [...] "shouted vocals" [...] of the singer on the song. Andy Kellman of Allmusic called [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] the most emblematic track on No Boys Allowed. He praised the line [...] "I got the kinda lovin' that'll keep <b>you</b> <b>off</b> the streets" [...] and describing the song as rowdy and sexually direct, he concluded that it could be ideal for [...] "the soundtrack to a straight-to-DVD Showgirls sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake <b>you</b> <b>off</b> / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on and you lose the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've {{just come out of}} an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and at the ends of some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E
