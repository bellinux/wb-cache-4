Carroll described the importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness in the following quotation: [...] "If you are willing to be open minded, accept that reasonable probabilities rather than absolute certainties are the best information in many things that matter. And hold your most precious beliefs tentatively, then you can overcome some of the hindrances to critical thinking {{at least some of the}} time. And also that one's world view can be a major hindrance to being fair minded. The minimum requirement of fair mindedness is a willingness to take seriously viewpoints opposed to your own.

30|$|Open-minded {{individuals}} are receptive to different beliefs and ideas without feeling challenged or threatened. Those with {{the attitude that}} their own or their nation’s way is inherently superior face difficulties in working internationally. According to Seelye (1996), “The beginning of wisdom {{is the ability to}} see at least two sides of a story,” Rhinesmith (1993) said “The first lesson in an international assignment is that your perspective is just one side of the elephant. To adjust to the new culture and be effective, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to crawl around the elephant, understand how it looks from all sides, and be able to communicate and empathize with the people who are looking at it from the other side.” This competency includes the capacity to be non-judgmental of others’ spiritual and political beliefs. According to Harris and Moran (1991), “The ability to express respect for another {{is an important part of}} effective relations in every country. All people like to believe and feel that others respect them, their ideas and their accomplishments” Harris and Moran (1991). Global leaders who demonstrate a willingness and ability to respect and be interested in beliefs of other cultures are more likely to establish meaningful intercultural relationships.|$|E
40|$|This {{course is}} an {{introduction}} to Semantics, the study of meaning in human language. We will explore semantic issues that arise from the lexicon, the sentences, and the discourse. Along the way, we will investigate not only the semantic structure of natural language but also pragmatic factors that affect our interpretation of language use. Much emphasis is put on developing skills in observing and analyzing semantic patterns, making generalizations, and forming sound arguments. Students will learn the basic semantic theories, especially some formalism, to explain the semantic structure of language. This is a participation intensive course. No prerequisites. To help you decide {{if this is the}} right course for you, {{let me tell you what}} we will NOT do in this course: [...] This is NOT a course on the etymology of words. [...] We will not spend time on social/cultural aspects of meaning even though that would be a great focus in a different course. (Our Tri-Co department has some great sociolinguistic courses at Swarthmore. You’re welcome to explore them.) You must understand from the very outset that this is a course that stresses the foundation of Formal Semantics. I am by no means saying that Formal Semantics is the only way to understand meaning; far from it. But it has proven to be a very insightful way of uncovering some deep underlying patterns of meaning. Thus it will be our focus. I hope ￼￼that you will come to understand what I mean by the end of the course. To benefit from this course, you should set up your linguistic antenna, if you don’t have the habit yet, throughout the semester, so as to collect interesting expressions that are used by you or around you every day. Your observations will help you understand the topics covered in class better, and also allow you to explore new topics for the final project. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> to spend a lot of time THINKING about semantic issues in ways that are unfamiliar to you (particularly in ways that involve formalism) and APPLYING the formalism in the assignments you will be required to do...|$|E
