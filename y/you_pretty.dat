500|$|The scenes {{featuring}} {{shots of}} beetles crawling out of corpses were shot and filmed using real insects {{as well as}} real actors. In particular, during the scene wherein the Complaining Man is discovered dead, over 3,000 live bugs were shot crawling {{on the body of}} Mike Hungerford, the portraying actor. Producer Harry Bring noted that the bug scenes were tedious and hard to film because [...] "bugs don't take directions very well, so <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> much have to wait until they decided to get it right." [...] Although the shots of the bugs were considerably brief in the final episode, the scenes required a full day of shooting to get perfect. The shots of bugs crawling out of Daniel Brimley's mouth and the shots of the bugs being sucked out of Mulder were created via a combination of CGI and [...] "dummy bugs".|$|E
500|$|With Internationalist, Powderfinger {{first set}} their sights overseas, {{appearing}} at numerous music festivals in the U.S., including South by Southwest in Texas. While in the U.S., Powderfinger played several showcase performances to record-label representatives in Los Angeles and New York City. In a later interview in Australia, Fanning said these shows were difficult {{due to the}} lack of any homegrown fan support. [...] He also said the band were not focused at the shows, and thus they did not go as well as he had hoped. Coghill, however, described the showcases, and the performances in Austin, as [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "fun". After performing in the United States, Powderfinger completed a tour of Canada. Fanning described the band's overseas outlook as a necessity for an Australian-based band, as [...] "people [...] are going to get sick of <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> quickly if you're going to do five tours a year, so that you can sustain yourself financially." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Serial Killers Know How to Party" [...] is tongue-in-cheek and {{somewhat}} comical in nature, heavily influences by horror films. Donnelly shouts [...] "your screams could raise the dead" [...] over a fast-paced guitar riff. [...] "Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle" [...] is reinforced with a double-bass panel, {{a technique that}} allows the drumming to sound more clear. Both [...] "Centaur: Half-Man Half-Motorcycle" [...] and [...] "Battlestar Anorexia" [...] channel some of the thematic similarities as the act Betty Blowtorch. On [...] "They Live", Donelly boasts the line “come with me, <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> thing, and we’ll celebrate with amputations.” The song is named from the John Carpenter film, They Live. [...] "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet" [...] features a foreboding atmosphere, fueled by a progressive math-rock style of production, with some disco influences as well.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but I think it just naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never really a good ska band anyway".|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} the Titan's Training Camp in Clarksville & Nashville, Tennessee which started July 25. Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> much know how to read a defense and know how to run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ... (It's) just making sure I let him know some of the things I did to learn the playbook quickly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Den of Geek {{affirmed that}} [...] "Doctor Who hits top form with 'Kill the Moon'. [...] And Jenna Coleman {{has never been}} better". They also praised Harness' script as [...] "impressive" [...] and said that Wilmshurst [...] "fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count {{is the key to}} {{crawling}} under people's skins". [...] They closed their review by saying [...] "The best Doctor Who episodes have something to say, get under your skin, and keep <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch {{as soon as it was}} done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences". The A.V. Club also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. They said [...] "'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that Doctor Who has genuinely surprised me. That fact, above all else, is why tonight’s episode rates as an instant classic" [...] and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that [...] "Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor". They ended their review by claiming that [...] "This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before West Indies {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Australia in November to December 2009; senior players such as Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul returned to the squad, but Roach had sufficiently impressed selectors during the dispute that he retained his place. The West Indies lost the first Test in three days; Adrian Barath's century on debut and Roach's bowling performance were the main positives for the West Indies; in the opinion of former Australia captain Ian Chappell, Roach's bowling was [...] "exceptionally good" [...] but he lacked support from more senior bowlers. Although the West Indies drew the second Test, Roach (who was regularly bowling over [...] ) and Dwayne Bravo took the West Indies close to levelling the series {{on the final day of}} the match. Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, commended Roach for his control and accuracy and said [...] "Someone who is pretty short at that pace can get the ball to skid onto <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> quickly off the wicket with not much bounce. We've played him pretty well here [...] The ball reverse-swung for them in both innings. He's a handful, there's no doubt about that. He's someone who could play a fair bit of Test cricket for them in the future." [...] It was the opinion of Tony Cozier that in the absence of experienced fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards, Roach was the leader of the bowling attack in Australia. Roach, who was fastest of the West Indies' bowling line-up, troubled the Australian batsmen with his pace through the series, and a rivalry emerged between Roach and Ponting. In the first innings of the third and final Test, Roach struck Ponting on the elbow, who was forced to retire hurt. However, he was forced to bowl into the wind, which surprised Australian batsmen Shane Watson as it reduced Roach's pace.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove it from your mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where <b>you</b> <b>pretty</b> much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
