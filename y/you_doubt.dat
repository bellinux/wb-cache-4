500|$|The serious losses {{sustained}} in maintaining a static defence during June led to fractures in the German high command. On 1 July, Panzer Group West commander Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg {{had been replaced}} by Heinrich Eberbach, following disagreements with Hitler over how the campaign should be conducted. Gerd von Rundstedt, soon followed, that evening, in a telephone conversation with Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel, head of OKW, von Rundstedt said [...] "Make peace, you fools." [...] Taken to task over his endorsement of von Schweppenburg's recommendation for a withdrawal, he replied [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> what we're doing, get up here and take over this shambles yourself". The following morning, informed that perhaps his health was [...] "no longer up to the task", von Rundstedt resigned and was succeeded as OB West by Günther von Kluge. The costly battles in and around Caen and Saint-Lô convinced both Eberbach and von Kluge that their predecessors had been correct. The Germans had suffered heavily, leading Hitler to order Army Group B to temporarily abandon big counter-attacks and go over to the defensive until more reinforcements could arrive to bolster the front.|$|E
2500|$|Hakuin deeply {{believed}} that {{the most effective way}} for a student to achieve insight was through extensive meditation on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and doubt that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the [...] "great doubt", writing, [...] "At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> fully, you will awaken fully".|$|E
2500|$|James P. Allen commented [...] "Sometimes you weren't {{sure whether}} Omm Sety wasn't pulling your leg. Not {{that she was}} a phoney in what she said or {{believed}} – she was absolutely not a con artist – but she knew that some people looked on her as a crackpot, so she kind of fed into that notion and let you go either way with it...She believed enough to make it spooky, and it made <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> your own sense of reality sometimes." [...] Barbara Lesko wrote, [...] "She was a great help to Egyptian scholars, especially Hassan and Fakhry, correcting their English and writing English language articles for others. So this poorly educated Englishwoman developed in Egypt into a first rate draughtswoman and prolific and talented writer who, even under her own name, produced articles, essays, monographs and books of great range, wit and substance." [...] William Golding wrote of the Egyptologists he met in his travels through Egypt in the 1980s who were [...] "as well disposed to the Mystery as any child could have wished." [...] When [...] "the question arose of a dear lady who believed herself to have been a priestess of a particular temple, they did not dismiss her as a crackpot but agreed that she had something." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Jacinta is {{not often}} rash. I expect <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> my willingness, but after your extravagant talk in the alameda, you felt you ought to ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Why didn’t you {{scrap the}} blamed {{condenser}} if <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> it?” Clay broke in. “I haven’t cut your bills, and this boat {{has got to}} go when I want her.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a moment," [...] said Lagune, and {{produced}} a piece of folded printed paper from his pocket. [...] "Here is a review from Nature {{of the work of}} no less a person than Professor Greenhill. And see--a convenient pin is introduced in the apparatus for the demonstration of virtual velocities! Read it--if <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{confronted him}} in a final appeal. [...] "Oh, Victor, I can't bear to have <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me even for an hour. Stay with me to-day. Stay and let me talk with you. I've had so little of you. Just think! for more than twelve years I've kept you away from me--I've starved myself--my mother-self--in order that you might grow to manhood untroubled by my faith, and I can't bear to have <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{has said}} stupidities to you, that <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me?" [...] and Casimer assumed an injured look, though his eyes danced with merriment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] cried Bonnet, [...] "that shall I do, {{for there}} is naught else I can do. And then you shall see, <b>you</b> <b>doubting</b> Greenway, whether I am a pirate or no." ...|$|R
60|$|Emp. Even these reproaches I {{can bear}} from you; <b>You</b> <b>doubted</b> of my love, believe it true: Nothing but love this {{patience}} could produce, And I allow your rage that kind excuse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} to tell me that <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> it?" [...] Harding returned. [...] "You haven't the {{reputation}} of being a fool. Would you have lent money on a note you suspected was forged?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Maccario {{laughed a}} little. “Can <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> it—while the hacienda of San Cristoval stands? There are many burnt sugar mills in Cuba, my friend.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Just so, Ivor, my friend. That `if' {{shows that}} <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> Him! Moreover, He has put into our mouths that prayer, `lead us not into temptation,' and you {{proposed}} to keep temptation always before your eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am. How {{could it}} be {{otherwise}} with me? Don't {{you think there are}} turns in a person's life when she must do something rash. Think of yourself. If everybody crushed you; if you were ill-treated beyond all belief; if the very people who ought to trust <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> <b>you,</b> wouldn't you turn upon somebody and rend him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But little, my lord," [...] replied Roland Graeme boldly, [...] "which met my apprehension, saving that {{it seemed}} to me as if in {{something}} <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> the faith of the Knight of Avenel, under whose roof I was nurtured." ...|$|R
60|$|Father Roubeau {{breathed a}} swift, silent prayer, {{and rose to}} his feet. 'If <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> me, why--' He made as though to open the door.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't {{put it in}} that way!" [...] Mr. Gallilee interposed. [...] "It {{sounds as}} if <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> her ever getting well--you see it {{yourself}} in that light, don't you? Be a little more positive, Mool, in mercy to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mind," [...] Corp went on, [...] "how {{when you}} was little you couldna see a bairn without rocking your {{arms in a}} waeful kind o' a way, and we could never thole the meaning o't.

6000|$|... "Really, Austin, I do {{not know}} what is the matter with you this morning. One would almost think that <b>you</b> <b>doubted</b> my word. If my boots are dusty, it must be, of course, that I have put on a pair which the maid had not cleaned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True again," [...] said Scaramouche. [...] "And what is more, {{that is what}} it will be; that is what {{it already}} is. Do <b>you</b> <b>doubt</b> it?" ...|$|E
