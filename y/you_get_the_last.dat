5000|$|After the {{independent}} {{release of a}} self-titled cassette album in 1985, Edwards released ...and He's Not Gonna Take It Anymore through local label St. Valentine in 1986. A second LP album, titled Peace, Love and Murder came out a year later on Birth Records. Edwards was signed onto Homestead Records in early 1988, and released three albums through them: The Best Defense, Let's Skip The Details, and finally The Taller You Are, the Shorter <b>You</b> <b>Get,</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the three being released in 1989. Let's Skip The Details also marks as the first release by the project to feature musicians other than Edwards, allowing for My Dad Is Dead to tour as a full band.|$|E

5000|$|Joey Logano {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 35.697 and a speed of 201.698 mph. Logano said {{afterwards}} that he was [...] "excited (about the pole). I thought our car was really good in race trim earlier. … In qualifying trim, I didn’t think we would make it happen today, but on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> run, Todd Gordon (crew chief) made some good adjustments and gave me a pep talk, and game on. I was ready to go. I was going to drive the heck out of it and hope for <b>the</b> best. Once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into <b>the</b> <b>last</b> round (of qualifying) and you are eighth on the board, {{what is the difference between}} eighth and 12th? You might as well hammer down.” He also added that Michigan [...] "is very unique. For one, you're going 220 mph. That's freaking insane. But it's a lot of fun." ...|$|R

You in Saxony too could make nothing out. The reason was, {{we had not}} men to fight against, but cannons! I might have done a thing or two; but I should have sacrificed more than the half of my Army, and shed innocent human blood. In that case I should have deserved {{to be taken to}} the Guard-house door, and to have got a sixscore there (EINEN OFFFENTLICHEN PRODUKT)! Wars are becoming frightful to carry on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't matter," [...] he said; [...] "it's {{only for}} three or four years. At the end of three or four years we'll move. That's the way to live in New York--to move every three or four years. Then <b>you</b> always <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> thing. It's because the city's growing so quick--you've got to keep up with it. It's going {{straight}} up town--that's where New York's going. If I wasn't afraid Marian would be lonely, I'd go up there--right up to the top--and wait for it. Only have to wait ten years--they'd all come up after you. But Marian says she wants some neighbours--she doesn't want to be a pioneer. She says that if she's got to be the first settler she had better go out to Minnesota. I guess we'll move up little by little; when we get tired of one street we'll go higher. So you see we'll always have a new house; it's a great advantage to have a new house; <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all <b>the</b> latest improvements. They invent everything all over again about every five years, and it's a great thing {{to keep up with the}} new things. I always try and keep up with the new things of every kind. Don't you think that's a good motto for a young couple--to keep 'going higher'? That's the name of that piece of poetry--what do they call it?-- Excelsior!" ...|$|R
5000|$|I find it gobsmacking {{that some}} people see the play as misogynistic. I {{believe that it is}} a moral tale. I believe that it is saying - [...] "do not be like this" [...] and [...] "do not do this." [...] "These people are objectionable." [...] By <b>the</b> time <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> scene all of the men - {{including}} her father are saying - it's amazing how you crushed that person. It's amazing how you lobotomised her. And they're betting on the women as though they are dogs in a race or horses. It's reduced to that. And it's all about money and the level of power. Have you managed to crush Katharina or for Hortensio and Lucentio, {{will you be able to}} control Bianca and the widow? Will you similarly be able to control your proto-shrews? It is so self-evidently repellent that I don't believe for a second that Shakespeare is espousing this. And I don't believe for a second that the man who would be interested in Benedict and Cleopatra and Romeo and Juliet and all these strong lovers would have some misogynist aberration. It's very obviously a satire on this male behaviour and a cautionary tale ... That's not how he views women and relationships, as demonstrated by the rest of the plays. This is him investigating misogyny, exploring it and animating it and obviously damning it because none of the men come out smelling of roses. When the chips are down they all default to power positions and self-protection and status and the one woman who was a challenge to them, with all with her wit and intellect, they are all gleeful and relieved to see crushed.|$|R
30|$|The Vietnam Veterans Memorial {{does not}} present (did not present!) any figure. Only names. The {{names of the}} 58, 000 people who died or {{disappeared}} in the war, in chronological order according to their casualty date, with no distinction of military ranks or corps. Moreover, {{the arrangement of the}} names in this (physically open, but symbolically closed) book seems strange at first sight. The list begins with the indication of the war’s beginning year (1959), and the first name is engraved in the right superior extreme of the angle’s vertex (in the “book’s” right “page”); the list continues from top to bottom and from left to right, to the western tip of the “page” (precisely the one pointing to the Lincoln Memorial). This is not casual. As in Chartres’ Cathedral, as in the Lincoln Memorial, the West symbolically means death and desolation: it is the place where the sun sets. But {{if you want to go}} on reading, you must undo your way to the tip of the “page” which points to the East (which obviously indicates resurrection, the rebirth of life) and approach the center again, until <b>you</b> <b>get</b> to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> date (1975) and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> name (in <b>the</b> right inferior extreme of the left “page” of this book made to be read backwards), thus ideally closing the list at the center of the Memorial, so that no name can be added to it later (that is to say, neither in this war, nor in any other one). The two dates, 1959 and 1975, are respectively followed by two brief inscriptions: the summary and the moral of this two page “book”. The first one reads: “In honor of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who served in the Vietnam War. The names of those who gave their lives and of those who remain missing are inscribed in the order they were taken from us”.|$|R
6000|$|... "I chose my Paul Veroner {{monoplane}} for the job. There's {{nothing like}} a monoplane when real work is to be done. Beaumont found that out in very early days. For one thing it doesn't mind damp, and the weather looks as if we {{should be in the}} clouds all the time. It's a bonny little model and answers my hand like a tender-mouthed horse. The engine is a ten-cylinder rotary Robur working up to one hundred and seventy-five. It has all the modern improvements--enclosed fuselage, high-curved landing skids, brakes, gyroscopic steadiers, and three speeds, worked by an alteration of the angle of the planes upon the Venetian-blind principle. I took a shot-gun with me and a dozen cartridges filled with buck-shot. You should have seen the face of Perkins, my old mechanic, when I directed him to put them in. I was dressed like an Arctic explorer, with two jerseys under my overalls, thick socks inside my padded boots, a storm-cap with flaps, and my talc goggles. It was stifling outside the hangars, but I was going for the summit of the Himalayas, and had to dress for the part. Perkins knew there was something on and implored me to take him with me. Perhaps I should if I were using the biplane, but a monoplane is a one-man show--if <b>you</b> want to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> foot of life out of it. Of course, I took an oxygen bag; the man who goes for the altitude record without one will either be frozen or smothered--or both.|$|R

60|$|This is how {{introversion}} begins. The lower sexual {{centers are}} aroused. They find no sympathy, no connection, {{no response from}} outside, no expression. They are dynamically polarized by the upper centers within the individual. That is, {{the whole of the}} sexual or deeper sensual flow goes on upwards in the individual, to his own upper, from his own lower centers. The upper centers hold the lower in positive polarity. The flow goes on upwards. There must be some reaction. And so <b>you</b> <b>get,</b> first and foremost, self-consciousness, an intense consciousness in the upper self of the lower self. This is the first disaster. Then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> upper body exploiting <b>the</b> lower body. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> hands exploiting the sensual body, in feeling, fingering, and in masturbation. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> a pornographic longing with regard to <b>the</b> self. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> obscene post cards which most youths possess. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> absolute lust for dirty stories, which so many men have.
