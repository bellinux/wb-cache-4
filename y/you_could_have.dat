Starting with 18 gold I aim to raise six gold each turn and spend nine gold in actions each turn.|$|E

500|$|Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute wrote a {{retrospective}} {{review of the}} album in 2011, regarding Enema of the State a seminal album of Generation Y and [...] "one of those rare records {{that allows you to}} relive , a record where every song conjures up a specific memory or emotion that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> only felt when you were a teenager."

However she pointed out that [...] "the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song", and respected that [...] "it's a brave song choice, but it's hap-hazard vocal line seems to scream...

500|$|King {{states the}} cover was odd; [...] "It {{took me a}} minute and a half to find a spot in the song where I knew where she was. It's so weird. If she had never told us, we would have never known. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> played it for us and we'd have been like, 'What's that?' Like {{a minute and a}} half through I heard a line and was like, 'I know where she's at!" [...] In response, Slayer sent some T-shirts to Amos, which she said was appreciated. Hanneman echoed similar sentiments as King, but noted that a few years later when Slayer was playing a festival before Amos, Amos would allow Slayer to play a full set when the band was late.|$|E

500|$|On Bataan, the {{reaction}} to MacArthur's escape was mixed, with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed.

One wrote to Roosevelt that [...] "Nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> done would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To Joseph Goebbels, MacArthur was a [...] "fleeing general", while Benito Mussolini labeled him a coward. Marshall decided {{that the best way}} to counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor.|$|E

500|$|Louis Virtel from HitFix called [...] "Living for Love" [...] as Madonna's [...] "best video since 'Hung Up'". He found {{references}} to older Madonna videos, like [...] "Express Yourself" [...] in the [...] "unusual choreography {{with all of}} its masculine posturing and grappling", [...] "Take a Bow" [...] with its bullfighting theme and playing on a familiar imagery from her career, and [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] during the sequences where Madonna fends off the Minotaur dancers. Virtel also commended the choreography, costumes, Madonna's looks and the cinematography of the video. Along with the [...] "Take a Bow" [...] reference, Billboards Joe Lynch called the video as incredible and [...] "lush, arresting" [...] but criticized for the misspelling of Nietzsche at the end." [...] Rita Kokshanian from InStyle said that the video was [...] "just as good as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> expected... And while we were completely transfixed by her killer moves and insane physique, we were equally in awe of her outfits." ...|$|E

[...] Television editor Michael Burkett of the Orange County Register commented, [...] "Monday night's 59th installment was very nearly everything <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> wished it to be: quite entertaining, relatively fast-moving, unusually short on tastelessness and tackiness drenched in nostalgia, and featuring enough superbly chosen film clips for a monster round of Visual Trivial Pursuit.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Goodlife, a {{professor}} of geological sciences at the University of Alabama, believes the state is at [...] "high" [...] risk from earthquakes. He claims that [...] "If there is an earthquake {{in one of the}} zone areas, North Alabama is certainly going to feel it. There's going to be damage and some perhaps major. If one occurred in the zone close to Memphis, it would be devastating because buildings are not made to withstand earthquakes. Places like San Francisco are aware of earthquake risks and structures are built to withstand them." [...] By his definition, the state's earthquakes are [...] "insignificant". Emergency planner Bill Thomison feels skeptical about a major earthquake, stating, [...] "I don't believe there are any major faults (interface of rocks) here. It depends on the magnitude of the earthquake and the Richter scale. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> a No. 4 (magnitude) earthquake in California and not damage anything, but the same type in New York could be devastating because the building codes don't factor in earthquakes." ...|$|E
