Witenbergica)) is a {{historical}} plant from Media, identified with Ferula persica L., Ferula scuntziana (Umbelliferae), or Ferula scowitziana, also denoting its <b>yellow</b> translucent <b>balsam,</b> which causes irritation of the skin and whose smell resembles that of asafoetida.|$|R

Vegetation Description Structurally, these uneven-aged forests {{were characterized by}} large volumes of coarse, woody debris lying beneath multi-storied canopies of different-aged cohorts, with supercanopies {{composed of}} trees centuries old (Tyrell and Crow 1994). The dominant tree species {{are among the most}} moisture and nutrient-demanding species in the eastern U. S. A., and their distribution is confined to glacial landforms underlain by fertile soils (Woods 2000, Whitney 1986). Composition of the ground flora and understory varies along a moisture-nutrient gradient, and typically consists of high densities of shade-tolerant tree species and mesophilic herbaceous species including blue cohosh, yellow violet, sweet cicely, various ferns, and ginseng. In the mid- 1800 ’s, there were 5. 8 million acres of northern hardwood ecosystems in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Cleland 2004 a, ongoing R- 9 /SRS/MTU study). Sugar maple, hemlock, <b>yellow</b> birch, <b>balsam</b> fir, cedar in swales, spruce, and beech were the dominant late-successional species recorded along section lines by GLO surveyors (figure 1). Early-successional aspen and white birch comprised only 2. 0 % of the GL...|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} European Americans to walk the six mile square that would become McKinley were the U.S. government's surveyors. In 1847 they surveyed {{the outline of the}} township on foot with chain and compass. Then others came back in 1855 to survey all the section lines. [...] When done, the deputy surveyor filed this general description:This Township contains several Swamps and some of considerable extent. They are all unfit for cultivation. The Meadow and Alder Bottoms are all subject to be overflowed to a depth of 1 too 2 feet And are good for Hay. The Surface is level apart is upland where the Soil is 2d rate. This Township is heavily timbered and is chiefly composed of Hemlock, <b>Yellow</b> Birch, <b>Balsam</b> and White Pine. The undergrowth is generally thick and is composed of Hemlock Balsam and Hazel. Balsam and Elm line the Margins of Meadow and Alder Bottoms. The River Enters the Township near the SE corner of Section 12 and flows a West SouthWesterly course, with a Rapid current and is from 2 too 4 feet deep, and is adapted to the forming of a good motive power for mills. There is no improvements in this Township.|$|R
40|$|Understanding tree {{physiological}} responses {{to climate change}} is critical for quantifying forest carbon, predicting species 2 ̆ 7 range change, and forecasting growth trajectories. Continued increases in temperature could push trees into conditions {{to which they are}} ill adapted [...] such as decreased depth of winter snow cover, altered water regimes, and a lengthened effective growing season. A complicating factor is that in the northeastern United States, climate change is occurring on a backdrop of acid deposition and land-use change. In this dissertation, I used three studies to investigate the spatiotemporal nuances of resultant tree and sapling physiology to environmental change. First, I compared annual growth of co-occurring tree species (sugar maple, red spruce, red maple, <b>yellow</b> birch, and <b>balsam</b> fir) along an elevational gradient on Vermont 2 ̆ 7 s tallest peak: Mt. Mansfield. I found baseline differences in growth among species, and many annual variations were associated with species-specific events. Yet, protracted growth patterns, such as recent increases for red spruce and red maple, were correlated with increased temperature and cooling degree days (a heat index). For most species, temperature was positively associated with current growth, but negatively associated with growth the following year. This work demonstrated species 2 ̆ 7 differences in response to change and the complex relationships between growth and temperature. Next, I analyzed how climate, environmental parameters, and site and tree factors related to recent, regional increases in red spruce growth. While there was variability in response to climate and acid deposition by elevation and location, site and tree factors did not adequately explain growth. Higher temperatures outside the traditional growing season were positively related to growth, while nitrogen deposition was strongly negative. However, if nitrogen inputs decline as projected then the strength of this relationship may decrease over time. These results suggest continued favorable conditions for red spruce in the near term as acid deposition declines and temperatures increase, provided precipitation remains adequate to support growth. Lastly, I used a replicated micro-catchment study to examine how four species of tree saplings (paper birch, quaking aspen, American chestnut and black cherry) responded to experimentally elevated temperature (2 - 4 C above control) and reduced early winter snow (first six weeks of winter), depending on soil type. Soil and species characteristics strongly influenced sapling response. However, natural weather patterns during the treatment period were highly variable and muted or exacerbated results. Heating increased the potential photosynthetic period in the fall, causing an overall increase in leaf area. Many two- and three-way interactions of treatment factors were also detected. These outcomes demonstrate the variability in sapling response to a changing climate, as well as the complex interactions that occur among soil, species, and weather parameters...|$|R
