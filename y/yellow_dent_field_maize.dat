40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 144 gilts (initially 110. 4 lb, PIC) {{was used in}} a {{commercial}} research facility to evaluate the effects of corn source (NutriDense™, BASF, or # 2 <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent)</b> and added fat (averaging 0, 3, and 6 %) on pig performance and carcass traits. Energy levels were based such that the higher energy (assuming 5 % greater ME than # 2 <b>yellow</b> <b>dent)</b> in NutriDense corn (with or without added fat) was calculated to be equal to that provided by <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn and added fat. In each phase, the first treatment diet contained <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn and no added fat. In the next dietary treatment, <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn was replaced with NutriDense corn, and then fat was added (2. 7 to 3. 2 % based on phase) to the <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn-based diet to equal the energy content of the NutriDense corn diet. This amount of added fat was then added to the NutriDensebased diet. The last <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn based diet used 5. 2 to 6. 2 % (based on phase) added fat to equal the energy content of the second NutriDense corn diet. This amount of fat was then added to the NutriDense-base diet to complete the treatment structure. For the overall study, pigs fed NutriDense corn had greater (P< 0. 04) ADG compared to pigs fed <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn. There was a corn source by fat level interaction (P< 0. 01) observed for ADFI and F/G. When fat was added to diets containing NutriDense corn, F/G decreased linearly, whereas when fat was added to <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn the greatest improvement in feed efficiency was observed with the first 3 % added fat. Adding fat to diets also increased (P< 0. 01) final and carcass weight, and tended (P< 0. 09) to increase backfat thickness. Using the known energy values of <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn and fat, we calculated NutriDense corn to have 5. 3 % more ME than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn. These results are similar to previous research in nursery pigs at Kansas State University showing 5 % more ME for NutriDense corn than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn. This also supports work done the University of Illinois which determined that NutriDense corn has 6. 5 % more ME than <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn. Increasing the dietary energy level above a <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn-soybean meal-based diet with 6 % added fat improved ADG and F/G in grow-finish pigs. Furthermore, pigs fed NutriDense corn had greater ADG than pigs fed <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn...|$|R
5000|$|Dent corn {{also known}} as <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn, Reid's <b>yellow</b> <b>dent</b> corn, white <b>dent</b> corn, or <b>field</b> corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content.

Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as [...] "Johnny Hopkins", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn.

40|$|The {{gene pool}} of Rumai 122, {{probably}} derived from Korai Arany (Early Golden, a name suggesting origin from Livingstone’s Early Golden or Early Golden Mastodon), {{appears to have}} arisen from genetic mixing between one or more Southern Dent varieties, probably of the Gourdseed type, imported from the Corn Belt in the 1890 s, and the local (improved) Korai Bánáti Flint (Early Bánáti Flint) variety (Caribbean type, Old Hungarian Yellow, 8 – 12 -row flint) grown on the Ruma estate. Ruma varieties were grown on around half the maize-growing area in Hungary for 30 years (1925 – 1955), and enjoyed much the same popularity in Yugoslavia. The varieties bred from the mother plant Rumai 122 in Yugoslavia were Rumai <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent,</b> Vukovár <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> and Béllyei <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent,</b> while those bred in Hungary were “F” Early <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent</b> and “F” Mczőhegyes <b>Yellow</b> <b>Dent.</b> (The latter was also popular in Yugoslavia under the name Novisadski Flajsman.)
