40|$|When tomorrow's historians chronicle the 20 th century, {{they will}} almost {{certainly}} highlight Mankind's increasing consciousness of Life and advances in medicine and surgery. If Medicine {{can be defined as}} the conscious attempt to fight disease and alleviate suffering, then it is old as human consciousness itself. Not infrequently the human ancient past is not clear and shrouded in the mists of antiquity. However in the light of research, some evidence from palaeontology shows that early Man did try to lessen suffering and alleviate pain. Survival of the fittest went on {{in all parts of the}} world, including our Islands. Infant mortality was indeed very high. In studying the past, we are given within limits an opportunity of correlating some aspects of Life and palaeontology. To a great extent, it was the success of simple tools that started the whole trend of the ascent of Man and led over the ages, to the civilizations which gradually went forward.

A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy, which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as though they were not interposed. And so on.|$|E

40|$|A LTHOUGH {{there is}} a {{considerable}} literature (U. S. A., 1945) on sea ice, its structure and behaviour is still very imperfectly known. Until twenty-five <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>ago,</b> study of the physical properties of ice was concentrated, for practical reasons, more upon freshwater ice. The greater {{part of the sea}} ice literature has been concerned with distribution, and description of the various sorts of sea ice and their classification. One may mention as one of the outstanding works Wright and Priestley's memoir (1922). Several notable contributions were also made to sea ice physics, particularly by Malmgren (1927). The remarkable growth of interest in the polar regions over {{the last two or three}} decades has led to greater attention to sea ice problems. The reason is of course that study of sea ice is fundamental to the movement of shipping into the polar regions, and this in turn is fundamental to development of almost all kinds. So the main application of sea ice studies is to shipping. There are other applications: to aircraft seeking to land on ice, to vehicles seeking to cross a frozen strait, to climatologists wishing to use ice conditions as an index to climatic change, and to synoptic meteorologists interested in the effect of ice on the dynamics of air masses. But none of these is likely in the foreseeable fvture to eclipse the need of the shipmaster, so that most research will be conducted with this end in view. Ice studies today tend to fall into several subdivisions. First of all there is pure research, which is concerned with the fundamentals of structure and behaviour. It is the direct continuation of the earlier work: description and classification, leading to detailed study of the physics of sea ice. This work has been carried out in many countries, notably the U. S. S. R., the Scandinavia...|$|R

Now in 1910 Fells continued:In reviews of succeeding editions of this book, as also in the reviews of the numerous other books, many of them most excellent in character, which have since been published dealing with the same subject, has been seen the growth of perception in the average professional mind that in the direction of cost accounting accountancy could do useful and remunerative work of the greatest service to the industrial and trading community. The need for scientific cost systems is being felt not only amongst industrial nations in the western, but also among those in the eastern hemisphere, and not the least pleasant incidents to me, in connection with the time and attention I have given to the subject, has been to advice with accountants in India thereon and to find Japanese accountants placing themselves in correspondence with me as to the best means of calling in Japan the importance of this subject.|$|R
