5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland.

The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E

40|$|Aboveground and belowground organisms {{influence}} {{plant community}} composition by local interactions, and their scale of impact may vary from millimeters belowground to kilometers aboveground. However, it still poorly understood how large grazers that select their forage on large spatial scales interact with small-scale aboveground– belowground interactions on plant community heterogeneity. Here, we investigate how cattle (Bos taurus) modify {{the effects of}} interactions between <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius flavus) and European brown hares (Lepus europaeus) on the formation of small-scale heterogeneity in vegetation composition. In the absence of cattle, hares selectively foraged on ant mounds, while under combined grazing by hares and cattle, vertebrate grazing pressure was similar on and off mounds. Ant mounds that were grazed by only hares had a different plant community composition compared to their surroundings: {{the cover of the}} grazingintolerant grass Elytrigia atherica was reduced on ant mounds, whereas the relative cover of the more grazingtolerant and palatable grass Festuca rubra was enhanced. Combined grazing by hares and cattle, resulted in homogenization of plant community composition on and off ant mounds, with high overall cover of F. rubra. We conclude that hares can respond to local ant–soil–vegetation interactions, because they are small, selective herbivores that make their foraging decisions on a local scale. This results in small-scale plant patches on mounds of <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ants.</b> In the presence of cattle, which are less selective aboveground herbivores, local plant community patterns triggered by small-scale aboveground– belowground interactions can disappear. Therefore, cattle modify the consequences of aboveground–belowground interactions for small-scale plant community composition. ...|$|R
40|$|Interactions between {{aboveground}} vertebrate herbivores and subterranean <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius flavus) {{can drive}} plant community patterns in grassland ecosystems. Here, we study {{the relative importance}} of the presence of ants (L. flavus) and ant mounds under different simulated grazing regimes for biomass production and species composition in plant communities. We set up a greenhouse experiment using intact soil cores with their associated vegetation. We found that plant biomass production in the short term was affected by an interaction between simulated grazing (clipping) and ant mound presence. Clipping homogenized production on and off mounds, while in unclipped situations production was higher off than on mounds. During the experiment, these differences in unclipped situations disappeared, because production on unclipped mounds increased. Plant species richness was on average higher in clipped treatments and patterns did not change significantly over the experimental period. Plant community composition was mainly affected by clipping, which increased the cover of grazing-tolerant plant species. The actual presence of <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ants</b> did not affect plant community composition and production. We conclude that the interaction between ant mounds and clipping determined plant community composition and biomass production, while the actual presence of ants themselves was not important. Moreover, clipping can overrule effects of ant mounds on biomass production. Only shortly after the cessation of clipping biomass production was affected by ant mound presence, suggesting that only under low intensity clipping ant mounds may become important determining plant production. Therefore, under low intensity grazing ant mounds may drive the formation of small-scale plant patches. ...|$|R
50|$|An insect {{survey found}} {{a wide variety}} of unusual insects, {{including}} rare solitary wasps. The site has a notable variety of grasshoppers and crickets. The most notable find was a rare species of chafer beetle last seen in Britain in the 1950s in Cheshire. Lesser stag beetles are common and volunteers are encouraging the Great stag beetle by building loggeries. Site volunteers leave logs in place to provide habitats for insects and fungi. A fine insect house has been built to provide winter homes for insects such as Ladybirds, Lacewings & Butterflies. There are also Bee nesting boxes. Butterflies include Peacock, Comma, Meadow brown, Small heath, Small skipper, Essex skipper, Green veined, Large and Small white, Small copper, Brimstone, Holly blue, Common blue, Speckled wood and Gatekeeper. Amongst moths Narrow-bordered Beehawk moth and Burnet moth have been recorded. An unwelcome recent arrival has been the Harlequin ladybird, which is a threat to native ladybird species.

5000|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ant</b> {{feeds on}} the {{honeydew}} from root aphids, which they breed in their nests. During winter, the aphids themselves are sometimes eaten. As {{a consequence of}} their feeding habits, the species is seldom seen, {{but it is possible}} that it forages outside the nest. Evidence of their underground lives is the size of their eyes. They are small and not adapted to foraging above ground. [...] Alates (winged ants) can be seen on warm days and evenings of July and August. This is one of the rare times that they are seen, as workers push the young winged ants out of the nest. Colonies are often founded by multiple queens (pleometrosis). Later on, fights between the founder queens will erupt, with only one queen left (monogyne).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{initially}} {{focuses on}} the chemical ecology of two species of ant which are common in the United Kingdom; Lasius flavus, the <b>yellow</b> <b>meadow</b> <b>ant</b> and Lasius niger, the common black ant. The first data chapter explores the constituent chemicals present in 3 major exocrine glands located in the gaster of L. flavus and discusses their potential functions. The work presented here also highlights {{the need for the}} comparative study of the chemical composition of glands. The second data chapter investigates how chemicals present in hindgut extractions of Lasius niger vary with the temporal caste they belong to (nurse or forager), and subsequently looks at how those chemicals may be suited to the tasks performed by that caste. The third data chapter describes the development of a highly sensitive methodology to identify low-concentration pheromones that uses a combination of analytical chemistry and behavioural bioassays. This methodology was used to identify two attractive pheromones of L. flavus, one is a trail pheromone used during foraging while the other is an alarm pheromone used to warn nest-mates of danger. The trail pheromone is the lowest concentration pheromone to be successfully identified in ants to date. This chapter also highlights the need to perform comparative behavioural bioassays to demonstrate the true function of putative pheromones. The final data chapter then investigates the source of alarm signals in Nasutitermes corniger termites and assesses the differential responses of workers and soldiers. This chapter then goes on to elucidate the colony-level effects of alarm on the regularity of repairs made to experimentally manipulated foraging galleries...|$|E
