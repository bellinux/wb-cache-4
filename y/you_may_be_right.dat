25|$|In 2006 Smith {{appeared}} on television gameshow <b>You</b> <b>May</b> <b>be</b> <b>Right,</b> hosted by Todd McKenney. The program pitches two teams of celebrities {{against each other}} as their knowledge of movies, music and television is {{put to the test}} in a series of fun trivia games.|$|E
6000|$|STRAMMFEST. Heaven grant <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right!</b> But {{that is not}} the worst. She had eloped with a young officer. Eloped, Schneidekind, eloped! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, your suspicions go {{a trifle}} farther than mine. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> though it's not nice to think so. But where {{does all this}} lead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And as to {{what you}} say about my seat at the board, Sir Gregory, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> {{probably}} <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> Perhaps it will be as well that I should see the Chancellor of the Exchequer myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Unwinking, cat-like, and intent, she {{presently}} adds: ‘Not so potent {{as it once}} was? Ah! Perhaps not at first. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> more <b>right</b> there. Practice makes perfect. I {{may have}} learned the secret how to make ye talk, deary.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't ask me," [...] {{replied the}} Head. [...] "For my part, I'm not anxious to claim {{relationship}} with any common, manufactured article, like <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> all <b>right</b> in your class, but your class isn't my class. You're tin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> after all," [...] {{returned}} the Moor slowly. [...] "I will {{go and see}} this father. At all events it can do no harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Archie, thoughtfully, [...] "he hasn't bitten me yet, so <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> But you've got {{to admit}} that he's {{a bit of a}} barker." ...|$|E
6000|$|Benson started. [...] "I {{believe he}} would stick at nothing; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> But I'm {{only one of the}} party; what would he gain if you and Blake came to grief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The hope is {{for next}} year, or next week, even, Mr. John," [...] {{returned}} Aristabulus, with a sly look, [...] "though <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> very <b>right</b> {{as to the}} reality. Great fortunes have been made on a capital of hopes, lately, in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, sir; {{you think}} all these inexplicable terms are connected with Sir Wycherly's religious feelings. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> for it exceeds my knowledge to connect them with any thing else. I wish, notwithstanding, he had not disowned this noble young lieutenant of ours! Is it quite certain the young man is a Virginian?" ...|$|R
60|$|It will be fair {{reasoning}} {{to argue}} thus. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> not <b>be</b> always <b>right</b> in your conclusion, but still {{you will be}} trying fairly to explain the unknown by the known.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hadn't you? Then I won't say {{but what}} <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> {{to try and}} begin now. But, law! what am I talking of? I am {{old enough to be}} your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> Caleb; but, before {{burning down}} my castle, either in jest or in earnest," [...] said Ravenswood, [...] "I think I {{had a right}} to be in the secret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have quick eyes, sir," [...] he said, {{as he did}} so; [...] "that is a cutter, certainly, {{standing}} in for the roads, and I believe <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> in taking her for the Active." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{think that}} the passage may imply a {{repetition}} of the words with which it begins, after 'nor'--thus--'nor am I used to prayer,' &c. Either <b>you</b> or I <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about it, and either 'or' or 'nor' <b>may</b> <b>be</b> grammatical. At least, so I pray.[51] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't {{expect you}} had, but I thought I would ask, to make sure; it's the way I've been raised. Now you mustn't take it unkindly if I {{remind you that}} as we don't know you, we must go a little slow. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> all <b>right,</b> of course, and we'll hope that you are; but to {{take it for granted}} isn't business. You {{understand}} that. I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just answer up fair and square, and don't be afraid. Where do you live, when you are at home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is just this," [...] Brooks said, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "just {{the thought}} of these people makes me afraid, {{positively}} afraid to argue with Henslow. <b>You</b> see--he <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> I tell <b>you</b> that in a healthily-governed country there should be work for every man who is {{able and willing to}} work. And in England there isn't. Free Trade works out all right logically, but it's one thing to see it all on paper, and it's another to see this--here around us--and Medchester isn't the worst off by any means." ...|$|R
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN. Oh, bother! <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> {{in these}} little details; {{but in the}} large we have managed to hold our own as a great race. Well, people who could do nothing couldnt have done that, you know.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, Dora, true. Be not indignant. I have {{admitted}} that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> Our detective will soon find out. He has the calm, self-confident, penetrating {{look of a}} man who could, if possible, screw something out of nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|To {{his final}} amazement Pendleton's brow cleared! [...] "An enemy? Gad! <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> I'll look into it; and, {{if that is}} the case, which I {{scarcely}} dare hope for, Mr. Hathaway, you can safely leave him to ME." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive you! Well--I do forgive <b>you.</b> Perhaps it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> that {{we should}} both forgive; though I have not wittingly brought {{unhappiness}} upon you. But what {{there is to be}} forgiven on my side, I do forgive. And--and I hope that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> happy." [...] They were the last words that he spoke; and then leading her back to her seat, he placed her there, and without turning to look at her again, he left the room.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} at Assumption University, {{which you can}} notice in almost {{every corner of the}} place, is similar to a development on all University Campuses. Your elders are making every sacrifice REV. E. C. LeBEL, C. S. B., M. A., CD. to provide adequate staff and facilities to give you every opportunity to develop into an educated person. In the days that lie ahead the problems of our complex world will be in your hands. Yours will be the responsibilities which lie so heavily on the shoulders of the men of today. To meet this challenge you must be thoroughly equipped intellectually and morally. May each one of you accept the burden of being serious students today so that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> the <b>right</b> kind of leaders tomorrow. [URL]...|$|R
6000|$|She {{pressed his}} arm again {{as she went}} on. [...] "You must judge between the two. What I want you to {{understand}} is this, that whatever <b>you</b> <b>may</b> judge to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> and best, I will agree to it, and will think that it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and best. If you say that we will get ourselves married and try it, I shall feel that not to get ourselves married and not to try it is a manifest impossibility; and if you say that we should be wrong to get married and try it, then I will feel that to have done so was quite a manifest impossibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A new {{thought to}} me," [...] {{observed}} his dragoman attentively; [...] "and yet <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> {{for there is}} nothing like being morally outcast to make you feel the intolerance of others. But that brings us to private morality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> Antoine. At {{all events}} if I take Fergus with me I shall {{send him back}} before {{reaching}} the Settlement, and say nothing whatever about my reason for going there. `Pressing business,' you know, will be sufficient." ...|$|E
6000|$|The lawyer listened gloomily; he did {{not like}} his friend's feverish manner. [...] "You seem pretty sure of him," [...] said he; [...] "and for your sake, I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> If it came to a trial your name might appear." ...|$|E
60|$|CHR. That is not like, {{said the}} other. Look, doth it not go {{along by the}} way-side? So Hopeful, being persuaded by his fellow, went after him over the stile. When they were gone over, and were got into the path, they found it very easy for their feet; and withal, they, looking before them, espied a man walking as they did (and his name was Vain-confidence); so they called after him, and asked him whither that way led. He said, to the Celestial Gate.[192] Look, said Christian, did not I tell you so? By this <b>you</b> <b>may</b> see we <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> So they followed, and he went before them. But, behold, the night came on, and it grew very dark; so that they that were behind, lost {{the sight of him}} that went before.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> Leach, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> right; do as foil {{would be}} done by is the golden rule after all. But, here comes Mr. John Effingham; so I fancy we may enter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How can we fight, man?" [...] Ogle stormed at him, furiously {{battling the}} {{conviction}} which Wolverstone's argument was imposing upon his listeners. [...] "You <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> wrong. We've got to chance it. It's our only chance...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's comforting, and I hope <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> Did Henry {{tell me you}} had {{travelled}} with them?' 'I travelled with {{my friend}} Mr Meagles, {{and his wife and}} daughter, during some months.' (Nobody's heart might have been wrung by the remembrance.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Alick," [...] she said, {{leaving the}} thought of herself for that of her child, [...] "I believe <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> about Una, for," [...] she added in low voice, [...] "she is like the most {{practically}} clever person I ever saw." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Egad!' cried Tigg, gravely nodding {{his head}} as if some ground of {{objection}} occurred to him at that moment for the first time, 'it's very possible <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right.</b> Would you entertain the same sort of objection to lending me five shillings now?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have left}} it all {{absolutely}} to your mother,' said Mr. Underwood. 'She will depend {{more and more on}} you, Felix; and I have made up my mind to expect that no help will come to you but from yourselves. Except that I hope some of <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> educated by clergy orphan schools, but you are too old for that now. Felix, I believe it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>right,</b> but it <b>is</b> very sore to break off your education.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For me, Remedy {{was always}} about togetherness, {{which is the}} appeal of house music. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> black; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> white; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> Jew; <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> gentile. It doesn’t matter in our house," [...] Buxton said.|$|R
60|$|And so it <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{with any}} of you here; whosoever <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> however poor, however humble. Though your {{opportunities}} <b>may</b> <b>be</b> small, your station lowly, your knowledge little; though <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> stupid in mind, slow of speech, weakly of body, yet if you but {{make up your mind}} to say the thing which is true, and to do the thing which <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> strong with the strength of God, and glorious with the glory of Christ.|$|R
