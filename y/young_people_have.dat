25|$|Adults and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{reported}} that the language of rights and responsibilities, based on the CRC, empowers them to {{relate to each other}} better and to engage in decision-making more collaboratively. The effects of the Rights Respecting School initiative can be seen not just through school councils but also through the inclusive, participative way the whole school works during lessons, meal times, play, class and through parents’ involvement.|$|E

25|$|English {{language}} is a required subject in many schools, {{and there are also}} many private English-teaching academies and institutions. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the {{language is}} also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).|$|E
25|$|It was {{eventually}} embraced, {{or at least}} accepted, by go-go fans both young and not so young. In a city that considers “swing” go-go the soundtrack of its story, this was no tiny feat. Even old-timers who deny the appeal of bounce beat understand why it exists. The brash style not only changed the way people danced and partied but became the music for {{a new chapter in}} D.C.’s story. If the swing sound carried a generation of Washingtonians through the rough ’70s and ’80s, a time when funk, jazz, and soul was a much-needed salve, bounce grounded them in the ’00s and ’10s, helped them keep their bearings at a time of shifting city demographics, when go-go’s epicenter realigned as the sound of black Washington, at least from the ’70s onward, was pushed to the suburbs. With its pummeling tone and tempo, bounce beat remains a perfect musical metaphor for what <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> experienced as they’ve watched their city be slowly replaced by something unrecognizable.|$|E
500|$|Because of the province's high {{prevalence}} of malaria and its distance from regional centers, Ratanakiri was isolated from Western influences {{until the late}} 20th century. Major cultural shifts have occurred in recent years however, particularly in villages near roads and district towns; these changes {{have been attributed to}} contact with internal immigrants, government officials, and NGO workers. Clothing and diets are becoming more standardized, and traditional music is being displaced by Khmer music. [...] Many villagers have also observed a loss of respect for elders and a growing divide between the young and the old. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> begun to refuse to abide by traditional rules and have stopped believing in spirits.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the last}} several decades, the {{population}} in many rural areas has declined in South Dakota, in common with other Great Plains states. The change has been characterized as [...] "rural flight" [...] as family farming has declined. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> moved to cities for other employment. This trend has continued in recent years, with 30 of South Dakota's counties losing population between the 1990 and the 2000 census. During that time, nine counties had a population loss of greater than 10%, with Harding County, in {{the northwest corner of}} the state, losing nearly 19% of its population. Low birth rates and a lack of younger immigration has caused the median age of many of these counties to increase. In 24 counties, at least 20% of the population is over the age of 65, compared with a national rate of 12.8%.|$|E
500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, if the old folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E
500|$|The Planet People's leader, Kickalong (Ralph Arliss), {{believes}} that the Planet People gathered at Ringstone Round have been transported—as promised—to the planet, {{but it is clear}} to Quatermass and Kapp that they have been reduced to ashes. One survivor – a girl called Isabel (Annabelle Lanyon) who deliriously talks about [...] "lovely lightning" [...] – is found and is brought back to the Kapps' cottage. Making contact with NASA scientist Chuck Marshall (Tony Sibbald), they learn that thousands of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> disappeared in similar incidents all around the world. Quatermass, aided by District Commissioner Annie Morgan (Margaret Tyzack), decides to bring Isabel to London for tests. As they make their journey, Quatermass speculates as to whether there is any connection between recent events and the decline in society. Reaching London, they are attacked by a gang. Quatermass is yanked from the car but Annie and Isabel manage to escape. Meanwhile, a large number of Planet People arrive at the radio telescope, congregating at the stone circle on its grounds. Working at a perimeter building, Kapp is horrified to see the light strike the area around his home – rushing home, he finds his family gone.|$|E

At {{the start of this}} time a lone bugler would play the Last Post and then concluded the service with Reveille. In more recent times the families and <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been encouraged to take part in dawn services, and services in Australian capital cities have seen some of the largest turnouts ever. Reflecting this change, the ceremonies have become more elaborate, incorporating hymns, readings, pipers and rifle volleys. Others, though, have retained the simple format of the dawn stand-to, familiar to so many soldiers.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2004, Ministry of {{education}} authorities rejected a proposal from a Beijing CPPCC political conference member {{that called for}} elementary schools to teach traditional Chinese characters {{in addition to the}} simplified ones. The conference member pointed out that most mainland Chinese, especially <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>have</b> difficulties with traditional Chinese characters; this is especially important in dealing with non-mainland communities such as Taiwan and Hong Kong. The educational authorities did not approve the recommendation, saying that it did not fit in with the [...] "requirements as set out by the law" [...] and it could potentially complicate the curricula. A similar proposal was delivered to the 1st Plenary Session of the 11th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in March 2008.|$|E

Research indicating that oral sex is less risky to teens' emotional and physical well being than vaginal sex has been advanced; researchers at the University of California do not believe this conclusion is warranted. They found that oral sex, as well as vaginal sex, was associated with negative consequences. Of adolescents engaging in oral sex only, girls were twice as likely as boys to report feeling bad about themselves and nearly three times as likely to feel used. Despite their behaviors, 90% of adolescents [...] "agree that most <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> sex before they are really ready." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 28,000 {{children}} and young people visit a Methodist service every week, and some Methodist churches work with young people in their communities.

Once a year, <b>young</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a chance to meet and discuss church issues at 3Generate (formerly Methodist Youth Assembly - 2010) and are represented throughout the year by the Methodist Youth President, a paid young person, and other representatives, who are elected to represent the Methodist Children and Youth at events such as the British Youth Council, the World Methodist Council, as well as the annual Methodist Conference. At the 3Generate conference in November 2015, more than 600 young people and leaders gathered for a weekend of different activities and training, which is double the number on the 2014 event.|$|E
2500|$|The sitar saw use in Western {{popular music}} when, guided by David Crosby's championing of Shankar, George Harrison played {{it on the}} Beatles' songs [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", [...] "Love You To" [...] and [...] "Within You Without You", {{recorded}} between 1965 and 1967. The Beatles' association with the instrument helped popularise Indian classical music among Western youth, particularly once Harrison began receiving tutelage from Shankar and the latter's protégé Shambhu Das in 1966. That same year, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones used a sitar on [...] "Paint It Black", while another English guitarist, Dave Mason, played it on Traffic's 1967 hits [...] "Paper Sun" [...] and [...] "Hole in My Shoe". These and other examples marked a trend of featuring the instrument in pop songs which Shankar later described as [...] "the great sitar explosion". Speaking to KRLA Beat in July 1967, he said: [...] "Many people, especially <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> <b>have</b> started listening to sitar since George Harrison, one of the Beatles, became my disciple … It is now the 'in' thing." ...|$|E
