500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, but when you do something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|Cagney's {{next film}} was Mister Roberts, {{directed}} by John Ford and slated to star Spencer Tracy. [...] Tracy's involvement ensured that Cagney accepted a supporting role, {{although in the}} end, Tracy did not take part. Cagney had worked with Ford before on What Price Glory?, and they had gotten along fairly well. However, as soon as Ford met Cagney at the airport, the director warned him that they would [...] "tangle asses", which caught Cagney by surprise. He later said, [...] "I would have kicked his brains out. He was so goddamned mean to everybody. He was truly a nasty old man." [...] The next day, Cagney was slightly late on set, incensing Ford. Cagney cut short his imminent tirade, saying [...] "When I started this picture, <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> we would tangle asses before this was over. I'm ready now – are you?" [...] Ford walked away, {{and they had no}} more problems, though Cagney never particularly liked Ford.|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause I was always there when you need/ <b>You</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ I {{never thought it would}} happen this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It is the second time that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E

500|$|In the song, {{the female}} protagonist feels that her love {{interest}} has underestimated her. This is {{demonstrated in the}} opening lines: [...] "You know I hate sleepin alone, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you will soon be home. But baby, {{that was a long}} time ago." [...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the female protagonist [...] "literally packs up her pussy" [...] and leaves the man who no longer seems interested in her, shown in the chorus lines: [...] "Let's go, little kitty kat / I think it's time to go / He don't want you anymore." [...] Similarly, Makkada B. Selah of The Village Voice noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was a threat for [...] "jetting" [...] and John Boone of E! Online commented that it was about Knowles' sex organ. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] warns all restless boys that they too, become restless. Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E
500|$|Stationed on {{the border}} with France, Bär {{achieved}} his first victory—a Curtiss P-36 Hawk—on 25 September 1939 during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l'Air (French air force), earning him the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 September 1939. During the Battle of France, he was credited with two more aerial victories before adding a further 10 during the Battle of Britain. During this time, he had several emergency landings in badly damaged aircraft and was shot down over the English Channel on 2 September 1940 by a Spitfire. Bär was summoned to appear before Hermann Göring and report on this battle. When Göring asked him what he was thinking about while in the water, Bär immediately replied, [...] "Your speech, Herr Reichsmarschall, in which <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> England is no longer an island!", alluding to an address that Göring had made before the German fighter pilots. Incidents like this are testimony to his often blatant disregard for higher authority. His outspokenness frequently landed him in trouble with Göring. In early 1941, he was credited with an additional four aerial victories against the Royal Air Force (RAF), bringing his total to 17.|$|E

2500|$|Early blackface minstrels {{often said}} that their {{material}} was largely or entirely authentic to African-American culture; John Strausbaugh, author of Black Like <b>You,</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> such claims {{were likely to be}} untrue. Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value. Constance Rourke, {{one of the founders of}} what is now known as cultural studies, largely assumed this as late as 1931. In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit. Starting no later than Robert Toll's Blacking Up (1974), a [...] "third wave" [...] has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on African-American culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters.|$|E

2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I think it might be best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 5 {{looks at}} the inanity of the society depicted, insofar as an {{intellectual}} discussion {{of the work of}} Chatterton between Obtuse Angle, Little Scopprell, Aradobo and Tilly Lally descends into farce; [...] "Obtuse Angle said in the first place you thought he was not [...] & then afterwards when I said he was not you thought he was not. Why I know that – Oh no sir I thought that he was not, but I ask'd to know whether he was. – How can that be said Obtuse Angle how could you ask & think that he was not – why said he. It came into my head that he was not. – Why then said Obtuse Angle <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> he was.

2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with your point of view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us."

2500|$|The {{following}} is a transcript provided by [...] from a [...] in which John Mueller of Google speaks about the Title tag {{and its relation to}} SEO:DANIEL PICKEN: I had a quick question. And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.
