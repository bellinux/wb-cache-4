He said the arrests proved that the {{security}} system had functioned properly, adding that [...] "whatever <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the humour of The Chaser... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way". The incident also generated debate during Question Time in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a visual style, when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praiseâ€” Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell {{was the only way to}} get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2009, Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy {{announced}} Havers {{had joined}} the cast of Coronation Street as Lewis, a potential love interest for Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). A writer for What's on TV said Havers {{was to make a}} one-off appearance in December before continuing in the role throughout 2010. The show's executive producer, Kim Crowther, told Gareth McLean of the Radio Times that while the team was planning the Audrey and Lewis storyline, they decided they wanted to introduce someone who was very charming, and slightly younger than Audrey. Casting director June West considered various actors for the part, including Anthony Head, but she suggested Havers for the role as she knew he was a big fan of the show. Crowther quipped, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Nigel, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> someone suave enough to charm you out of your high heels. Half the work is done." [...] Havers said he could not refuse the part because his character was fascinating and had an interesting story arc, and that being on the show had always been his ambition. Havers was initially contracted until July 2010 and he made his debut screen appearance as Lewis on 18 December 2009. In March 2010, Havers stated that he was keen to renew his contract, as he was enjoying his time with the soap.|$|E
500|$|John Sculley praised Jeff Daniels' {{portrayal}} of him, but claims the film misrepresented Apple's {{success with the}} Mac, and argues that Jobs was [...] "much nicer" [...] than depicted. Bill Atkinson denounced the film as [...] "not truthful at all. That wasn't his character, and the events didn't happen. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Jobs having a reality distortion field. I think of Aaron Sorkin as having ... a history distortion field". Atkinson said that [...] "the only thing he got right in that movie" [...] was the [...] "spot on" [...] depiction of Hoffman, including her accent and how she [...] "tried to rein in Steve from ... making an ass of himself".|$|E

500|$|Music Box is {{the third}} studio album by American singer Mariah Carey. It was {{released}} by Columbia Records on August 31, 1993, in North America. The album comprises ballads primarily co-written by Carey and Walter Afanasieff, {{with whom she had}} previously worked on Emotions (1991), and a few urban dance tracks. During the course of the album's development, Carey wanted to broaden her audience, choosing a more pop/R oriented sound. During this time frame, she experimented with different musical instruments, leading the album's sound away from her more contemporary previous two efforts. Two unused tracks from the album sessions were released as B-sides: [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> Me" [...] and [...] "Everything Fades Away".|$|E
500|$|... "Dreamlover" [...] {{marked the}} first time Carey was given {{creative}} control over remixing her songs.

[...] "Dreamlover" [...] B-side track ("Do <b>You</b> <b>Think</b> <b>of</b> Me") was written and produced by Carey, Afanasieff, Cory Rooney, and Mark Morales. Kelefah Sanneh from The New York Times complimented the remix, writing [...] " [...] is a revelation: after a long percussion break, he isolates a few of Ms. Carey's ad-libs; her ultrafalsetto vocals sound spookier than all of Basement Jaxx's sound effects combined." ...|$|E
