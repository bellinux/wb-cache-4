2500|$|Haye grew {{up among}} the town {{houses of the}} Peabody Estate, near the famous Tate Modern Gallery and {{around the corner from}} the South Bank tourist attraction, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. Haye went to school at Bacon's College. His College {{principal}} Tony Perry remembers Haye as a 'very athletic, very smart young man'. Haye started his ambition and passion for boxing at old-school boxing gym Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, South London, where he quickly impressed and confidently won his first amateur bouts. Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids. But that made it really hard to get him matches. When you've got three first-round knockouts on <b>your</b> <b>card</b> everybody runs for the hills." [...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, loving family. He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home. His family bestowed love and affection on him. Bermondsey might have been bad, but he, his brother and his sister were nice people from a nice family." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} Phase 10 Twist {{is to be}} the first player to {{complete}} phase 10 by moving around the game board. Every player starts with their pawn on phase 1 on the game board.

There are three pawn movements; move 3 spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of <b>your</b> <b>cards,</b> move 2 spaces if you complete the phase but do not discard all of <b>your</b> <b>cards,</b> or move 1 space if you don't complete the phase. If you land on a twist phase you can decide to play a twist phase or one of the phases {{on either side of the}} twist phase space. If you play a twist phase the pawn movements change to 6 spaces if you complete the phase and discard all of <b>your</b> <b>cards,</b> 4 if you complete the phase but do not discard all of <b>your</b> <b>cards,</b> or move back one space if you do not complete the phase.|$|R

50|$|The {{fundamental}} theorem of poker, {{introduced by}} David Sklansky, states: Every time you play your hand {{the way you}} would if you could see <b>your</b> opponents' <b>cards,</b> you gain, and every time your opponents play their cards differently from the way they would play them if they could see <b>your</b> <b>cards,</b> you gain. This theorem is the foundation for many poker strategy topics. For example, bluffing and slow-playing (explained below) are examples of using deception to induce your opponents to play differently from how they would if they could see <b>your</b> <b>cards.</b> There are some exceptions to the fundamental theorem in certain multi-way pot situations, as described in Morton's theorem.|$|R
