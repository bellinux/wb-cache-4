500|$|Bears, {{like other}} animals, may symbolize nations. In 1911, the British satirical {{magazine}} Punch published a cartoon about the Anglo-Russian Entente by Leonard Raven-Hill {{in which the}} British lion watches as the Russian bear sits on {{the tail of the}} Persian cat. The Russian Bear has been a common national personification for Russia from the 16th century onwards. [...] Smokey Bear has become a part of American culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message [...] "Only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prevent</b> forest fires". In the UK, the bear and staff feature on the heraldic arms of the county of Warwickshire. Bears appear in the canting arms of two cities, Bern and Berlin.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the middle}} of the 20th century, most forest {{managers}} believed that fires should be suppressed at all times. By 1935, the U.S. Forest Service's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10A.M. the morning after they were first spotted. Firefighting crews were established throughout public lands, and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons. By 1940, firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations. By the beginning of World War II, over 8,000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States. Though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting, three are still used each year in Yellowstone. Firefighting efforts were highly successful, with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of [...] during the 1930s, to between [...] and [...] by the 1960s. The need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable. In 1944, the U.S. Forest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental, using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear. This iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase [...] "Only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prevent</b> forest fires". Early posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human-caused. In Yellowstone, human-caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually, while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning.|$|E

2500|$|Gord {{has worked}} in his watch tower for more than {{eighteen}} years without a paycheck and claims {{to have been a}} forest ranger his entire life. His apparent reason for becoming a ranger was that he thought Smokey Bear was talking directly to him in one of his famous public service announcements ("Only <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>prevent</b> forest fires"). He frequently breaks out in tears during Red's visits as he talks about how lonely he is and/or how much of a sacrifice he makes at his job. During one visit, Gord claimed to have gotten so lonely that he ate the watch tower and then later moved on to another tower in season 7. Gord sometimes laments his lack of recognition. Once, he thought that someone had left him some honorary medallions only to learn from Red that they were beer bottle caps (Gord thought that a Budweiser cap was for being a [...] "bud of the forest"). On another occasion, Gord justified his lack of communication with his superiors as a sign that he was doing a [...] "good job protecting the forest," [...] to which Red suggested that his superiors most likely forgot about him. In truth, it turned out that he had been dismissed many years ago, but the message had never reached him.|$|E
