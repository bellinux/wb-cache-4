40|$|This paper {{outlines}} how {{a project}} {{conducted with the}} Home Office to develop educational resources about <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and organised crime was able to avoid reinforcing misleading myths. Three key myths about <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and crime are explored {{that emerged from the}} consultations with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and practitioners involved with the project. These myths are: that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> face a significant choice/dilemma moment before becoming involved with organised crime; that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> engage with organised crime {{out of a sense of}} entitlement; that there is such a thing as a typical organised crime offender among <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> In challenging these myths, the paper asserts that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> are vulnerable to exploitation rather than simply criminal, that <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> engagement with organised crime is more complex than simply stemming from greed or laziness and that it would be misleading to stigmatise <b>young</b> <b>people</b> from minority groups as typical offenders. The key argument of the paper is for the importance of collaboration with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and practitioners when developing resources for them.

5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in <b>younger</b> <b>people.</b> In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

5|$|As {{families}} have {{no means of}} preserving their music, or recording it, their creations are often forgotten owing {{to the absence of}} family members interested in ensuring their survival. The situation has been compounded by rules forbidding their support from outside the family environment. Concerned that the musical traditions of the country were vanishing, in 2006, Malouma urged the government to create a school to preserve the country's music heritage, even introducing a measure to Parliament. In 2011, she created the Malouma Foundation in support of the preservation of the national musical heritage. The foundation aims to protect and preserve the Arab, African, and Berber roots of music in Mauritania and, to that end, is collecting and storing music from throughout the country to both preserve it and make it available for other uses, including education.

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a discursive analysis of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> sexual health in contemporary Australia, engaging {{with data from}} health promotion, social sciences, and interviews with <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Data comprises: Australian sexual health websites for <b>young</b> <b>people</b> (N= 3); research papers on <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and chlamydia in Australia, published from 2005 - 2009 (N= 18); and interviews with <b>young</b> <b>people</b> aged 18 - 25, from Sydney (N= 12). Using Michel de Certeau’s theory of everyday practice (1988), I explore <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> experiences and knowledges of sexual health and how these exceed formal health understandings. I demonstrate how risk-based approaches typically deny <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> sexual health competencies and dismiss the value of friendship and social networks. I propose revision of this deficit understanding of <b>young</b> <b>people</b> through an everyday practice based approach to sexual health. This differs from behavioural science approaches that can abstract <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> sex practices from {{the context of their}} socio-sexual relations. Considering <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> competencies and tactics in negotiating sex, I argue that these can inform health promotion strategies, making them more relevant and useful to <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Early chapters analyse discourses of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> experience, risk and knowledge in these data, as key terms that justify <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> inclusion in Australian sexual health policy. Later chapters explore discourses of pleasure and intimacies, including friendship intimacies. These commonly feature in interview data where participants’ stories highlight the spatial aspects of sex practices and negotiations. These often extend beyond sexual scenarios and into friendships. My thesis demonstrates how <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> negotiations of safety encompass and exceed formal notions of ‘safe sex’, and draws a parallel between negotiations of safety and pleasure. I argue that a focus on safety is more useful than risk-based approaches, as it incorporates shared values of <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> health promotion, and sexual health research. <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> do not share a deficit understanding of their skills and practices, but are invested in sexual safeties, with common interview discussions of intimacy and its affordances. Finally, a case study of <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> social media practices is presented, further highlighting friendship’s value to <b>young</b> <b>people’s</b> sexual health negotiations...|$|R
