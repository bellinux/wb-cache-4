25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States and I look forward to working with you and your administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as <b>you</b> <b>prepare</b> to assume the presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in February 2017, Google Cloud Search {{enables a}} [...] "unified search experience" [...] in G Suite. Cloud Search lets users search for {{information}} {{across the entire}} G Suite product lineup. Users can also search for contacts, with results including the person's contact details, as well as events and files in common. The Cloud Search mobile app features [...] "assist cards", described by Google as [...] "a new way {{to help you find}} the right information at the right time. Using Google's machine intelligence technology, these cards can help <b>you</b> <b>prepare</b> for an upcoming meeting or even suggest files that need your attention". Google states that Cloud Search respects file-sharing permissions, meaning that users will only see results for files they have access to. The initial global rollout of Cloud Search introduced the functionality for G Suite Business and Enterprise customers, with Google stating that more functionality will be added over time, including support for third-party applications.|$|E
