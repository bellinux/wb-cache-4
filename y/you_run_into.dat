500|$|... "What's Your Name" [...] is an midtempo electro song, and bases its melody on {{thrusting}} new wave-influenced synths. It {{contains a}} [...] "whimsical" [...] beat that utilizes sirens and wind instruments. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune compared the song's synth riff {{to the music}} that was popular during the 1980s MTV generation, while John Soeder from The Plain Dealer noted its similarity to British duo the Eurythmics. Usher monotonously repeats the pick-up line hook, [...] "What's your name?", and thereby pays homage to his bachelor history. The song's lyrics describe [...] "the feeling you get when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a woman that makes you speak gibberish".|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Timing" [...] {{was written}} by Pendleton Ward and Kent Osborne. They {{previously}} collaborated with Jack Pendarvis and Adam Muto {{to come up with}} the idea for the episode, with the former duo adapting that to a storyboard. The creator of Adventure Time, Ward resigned from his occupation as its runner during production of the season. Osborne is the head of story. Alluding to the episode, for Hulu, Muto and Osborne summarized it as Lumpy confounding the concept of time travel. The writers related the episode to [...] "one of those situations where <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> someone from high school and you're like, 'Woah, why didn't I ever notice you before? Alluded to in this episode, the one it precedes involves time travel as well.|$|E
2500|$|... "Anytime I'm onstage or {{watching}} the music video, {{the first thing}} that comes into my mind is the person I wrote the song about. It's like {{the first thing that}} you think of is the moment that inspired the song, which is that excruciating, awful moment when <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> an ex for the first time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lillie Coney, Associate Director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (a {{civil liberties}} public {{interest}} research center), said: [...] "This definitely was not … a rational thing for the school to be engaged in," [...] and called it [...] "an outrageous invasion of individual privacy." [...] Ari Schwartz, Vice President and COO at the Center for Democracy and Technology (a civil liberties public interest organization), said: [...] "What about the [...] abuse of power from higher-ups, {{trying to find out}} more information about the head of the PTA ? If you don't think about the privacy and security consequences of using this kind of technology, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> problems." ...|$|E

It’s so nice that <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Smitty—I never did feel right about you and Jack loosing him in (Alaska) I mean Virginia.

6000|$|... "I know I'm {{making a}} mess of rescuing you, but I can't get head nor tail of the situation. It's all a mess. Every time we try to break out, {{something}} happens and we're turned back. We're {{only a couple of}} blocks now from where I got you out of that entrance. Friend and foe are all mixed up. It's chaos. You can't tell who is in those darned buildings. Try to find out, and you get a bomb on your head. Try to go peaceably on your way, and <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a mob and are killed by machine-guns, or <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the Mercenaries and are killed by your own comrades from a roof. And on the top of it all the mob comes along and kills you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't mind it. As {{a matter}} of fact, I had rather a good time. Saw one or two shows, you know. Got in on my face as your brother's representative, which was all to the good.

40|$|Try {{this simple}} experiment: {{close your eyes}} tightly, stand up, and walk {{to the other side}} of the room and back. You have just {{simulated}} for yourself what it is like to be blind. Well, not quite: there are several important factors missing. Firstly, you knew all along that you could open your eyes at any minute if <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> trouble (e. g., a large hard obstacle). A blind person does not have that option for recovering from a mistake...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! my carrier-pigeon!" [...] grated Spini's harsh voice, in what {{he meant}} to be an undertone, while his hand grasped Tito's shoulder; [...] "what did <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> hiding for? You didn't know it was comrades who were coming. It's well I caught sight of you; it saves time. What of the chase to-morrow morning? Will the bald-headed game rise?

6000|$|... "It {{must be a}} {{very heavy}} gun by its sound--as big as the largest of those we have heard fired from that fort above Johannesburg. Joubert must have started from Newcastle early to have managed to get it up there by this time, {{or it may be}} the force from Utrecht; anyhow, they must be strong to venture to attack us in this way. We may as well saddle up, though it is hardly likely the cavalry will be engaged. I shall not send to camp for orders; the general will have enough to think about, and it will make no matter where twenty men place themselves. However, I shall ride over to camp and see what is going on there; it is likely enough that there will be an attack by the Free Staters on the other side. Carmichael and Horrocks, do <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> the town and see what is going on there. I will not start till you get back; if any of the staff see me they may ask some {{questions}} about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got Prince and MacNeff figured exactly right," [...] replied Dale. [...] "Prince is the {{football}} captain, by-the-way. Be careful how <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> second base. If you ever slide into him head first--good-bye! He's a great player, {{and he can}} hit {{any kind of a}} ball. MacNeff now, just as you said, is weak on a high ball close in, and he kills a low ball. Kills is the word! He hits them a mile. But, Peg, I think you're a little off on Keene, Starke, and Martin, the other Place cracks. They're veterans, hard to pitch to; they make you cut the plate; they are as apt to bunt as hit, and they are fast. They keep a fellow guessing. I think Starke pulls a little on a curve, but the others have no weakness I ever discovered. But, Peg, I expect you to do more with them than I did. My control was never any too good, and you can throw almost as straight as a fellow could shoot a rifle. Then your high fast ball, that one you get with the long swing, it would beat any team. Only I'm wondering, I'm asking--can you use it right along, {{in the face of such}} coaching and yelling and hitting as you'll run against to-day? I'm asking deliberately, because I want to give you confidence." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good news," [...] he said. [...] "There is a {{through train}} going up this evening, and I have got {{permission}} {{for us and}} the horses to go; but they must {{be put in a}} truck by half-past six, and we may as well get them in at once. We still have our water-skins; the Kaffirs had better get them filled at once, and a good supply of mealies for the horses on the way; there is no saying how long we may be. Willesden, do <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> a store and get a supply of bread and a cold ham for ourselves; a good stock of bread for the Kaffirs, and a jar of water, and a hamper, with a lock, containing two dozen bottles of beer, the mildest you can get, for them. We are sure to get out for a few minutes at one of the stations, and can then unlock the hamper and give them a bottle each. It would never do to leave it to their mercy; they would drink it up in the first half-hour, and then likely enough quarrel and fight. For ourselves, we will have a small skin of water and, say, three bottles of whisky. The carriage is sure to be full, and it will be acceptable {{in the heat of the}} day tomorrow. The remainder of our supply of tea and so on, and the lamp and other things, had better all go in with the horses, and everything we do not absolutely want in the train with us; there will be little room enough. Get an extra kettle, then we can not only make ourselves a cup of tea or cocoa on the road, but give some to any friend we may make; besides, it is sure to come in useful when we get to the front." ...|$|E
