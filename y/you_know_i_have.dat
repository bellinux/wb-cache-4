500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested {{it was because the}} manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and that might be a shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E
500|$|Part of Whitman's {{role at the}} Attorney General's {{office was}} {{interviewing}} former Confederate soldiers for Presidential pardons. [...] "There are real characters among them", he later wrote, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a fancy for {{anything out of the}} ordinary." [...] In August 1866, he took a month off in order to prepare a new edition of Leaves of Grass which would not be published until 1867 after difficulty in finding a publisher. He hoped it would be its last edition. In February 1868, Poems of Walt Whitman was published in England thanks to the influence of William Michael Rossetti, with minor changes that Whitman reluctantly approved. The edition became popular in England, especially with endorsements from the highly respected writer Anne Gilchrist. Another edition of Leaves of Grass was issued in 1871, the same year it was mistakenly reported that its author died in a railroad accident. As Whitman's international fame increased, he remained at the attorney general's office until January 1872. He spent much of 1872 caring for his mother who was now nearly eighty and struggling with arthritis. He also traveled and was invited to Dartmouth College to give the commencement address on June 26, 1872.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2005, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Bryant Gumbel, Moss admitted that he has smoked marijuana during his NFL career [...] "every blue moon." [...] When asked whether he still used marijuana currently, Moss replied [...] "I might. I might have fun. And, you know, hopefully ... I won't get into any trouble by the NFL by saying that, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had fun throughout my years and, you know, predominantly in the offseason." [...] The interview drew criticism from the league office, and his agent tried to spin it that his words were taken out of context. In response, Moss said [...] "That was really me talking {{in the past tense}} of way back in the beginning of my career and my childhood â€“ especially in high school and college." ...|$|E
