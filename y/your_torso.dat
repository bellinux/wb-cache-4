5000|$|Without {{stopping}} after step 3 {{lower your}} right hand and use your right leg to force your body upwards into the air, while {{you are in the}} air shift your weight onto {{your right hand}} while twisting <b>your</b> <b>torso.</b> Extend your right leg forward and you should land at 180 degrees of your previous position.|$|E
5000|$|... 309: [...] "Open and Ground" [...] - A dynamic {{sequence}} {{for your}} upper body, Open and Ground will work <b>your</b> <b>torso</b> {{with a series}} of heart opening poses. By keeping a steady connection to the earth and lifting and opening the chest, the experience of feeling grounded while moving energy up and outward can be more fully explored.|$|E
40|$|Extended {{entities}} have {{boundaries of}} two different sorts: those that do, {{and those that do}} not correspond to physical discontinuities. Call the first sort (coastlines, the surface of your nose) bona fide boundaries; and the second (the boundary of Montana, the boundary separating your upper from <b>your</b> lower <b>torso)</b> fiat boundaries. Fiat boundaries are found especially in the geographic realm, but are involved wherever language carves out portions of reality in ways which do not reflect physical discontinuities. These ideas are applied to the treatment of cognitive categorization, of the semantics of vagueness, of Quine’s indeterminacy thesis, and of standard ontological problems such as Tibbles’ tail...|$|R

The position of your leading thigh is key in making this popular move successful ...|$|E
5000|$|International Film Festival Kratkofil Plus {{was held}} from 18 to 22 July {{and the main}} {{locations}} {{in the city for}} movie lovers were Youth Center and fortress Kastel. This year’s festival was held under the motto [...] "Motorso", with the following explanation: Because, while trying to discover traces of all those tendencies that appear in man’s head and which set in motion its controlling activity, one gets the impression that those tendencies move from downward to upward. Triggered by driving force of your heart, stomach and genitalia, the tendencies flood from torso into the head. One could say that the moving complex inside <b>your</b> <b>torso</b> gives drive to the controlling complex inside your head, like a motor, like “motorso”.|$|E

5000|$|In North America, Pitchfork {{gave the}} album an 8.4 {{out of ten}} rating, stating that [...] "The Richard D. James Album is 43.5 minutes of pure {{electronic}} genius" [...] and [...] "what really threw me was the damn beats which are all fucking over the place. Just when your brain starts to comprehend a rhythmic pattern, the beat shifts, turns left and crushes <b>your</b> <b>torso</b> under the steering wheel." [...] Rolling Stone gave the album {{three and a half}} stars out of five, commenting that [...] "Aphex Twin coaxes great emotional resonance from his machines. During the album's most lyrical moments - the delicately brooding [...] "Yellow Calx" [...] and the lusty [...] "Girl/Boy Song" [...] - the dance-floor Wunderkind seems poised to reinvent himself as techno's first poet." [...] He also commented [...] "Not all of Richard D. James goes down easy", explaining that there is [...] "menace lurking beneath the jerking beat of [...] "Peek 824545201". Entertainment Weekly awarded the album an A-, calling it James' [...] "quirkiest, most personal work" [...] and that [...] "tracks like 4 and Girl/Boy Song reveal a new warmth and wistfulness, thanks to synthesized string sections that sound radiantly real." [...] The Washington Post gave the album a negative review, referring to the music as [...] "sloppy offhand". The review compared the album to the style of the duo Spring Heel Jack, stating that [...] "where that duo achieves depth and sheen...James often prefers a noisy mess" [...] and that James' music [...] "too often sounds like a private joke".|$|E
5000|$|Forrest derived her {{practice}} from {{some aspects of}} Sivananda yoga, along with attention to alignment and use of props found in Iyengar yoga, and the heat and flowing sequences of Ashtanga vinyasa yoga. As the style evolved, she created a number of additional poses and sequences adapted to modern society,such as wrist stretches to prevent and relieve carpal tunnel syndrome. Forrest wrist stretches are also important [...] "to warm up and stretch out the hands and wrists before their usual yoga practice. First, stretch each finger open one at a time, by grasping the finger and pulling it back for one breath. You should feel the stretch in the fingers and across the palm and a little into the forearm. Next, place all of the fingers on the floor or a table with the fingertips facing toward <b>your</b> <b>torso.</b> Stretch the fingers, but not the palm of the hand, down toward the surface. From that position, {{see if you can}} stretch the whole palm down, though you may not make it the whole way. Finally, extend the arms straight out from your shoulders, parallel to the floor. Curl the fingers one by one into the palm, starting with the little finger and ending with the thumb, forming a fist. First, curl the fist in toward the underside of the wrist and then stretch it out. Repeat this exercise a few times before you put weight on your hands." [...] She also created shoulder shrugs to relieve tension and loosen the upper back, abdominal exercises to tone internal organs and strengthen the lower back, and a number of poses using a folded over and rolled up yoga mat.|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} point for our ontology {{is the concept of}} extended entity. Two sorts of extended entity are distinguished: objects, which are extended in space; and processes, which are extended in time. The outer boundaries of such entities are physical discontinuities (for example the exterior surface of your skin, the starting to move of this ball). However, there are also inner boundaries [...] here called fiat boundaries [...] such as the boundary between your head and <b>your</b> <b>torso,</b> or between the 3 rd and 4 th millennium...|$|E
30|$|We need to {{take another}} look at lung and {{thoracic}} (chest cavity) anatomy in order to understand this properly. Every organ in our bodies, such as those in the chest like the lungs and heart and those in the abdomen (stomach, intestines, liver etc.) are covered on their outer surfaces by a thin sheet of connective tissue known as the 'visceral pleura.' There is a second connective tissue sheet on the inner side of the chest and abdomen. The entire inside of <b>your</b> <b>torso</b> is lined by this second, thin sheet of tissue that is known as the 'parietal pleura.' In the chest, there is a small space between the lungs and the chest wall, thus between the visceral and parietal pleurae. We call this the 'interpleural space' and it is filled with fluid. This liquid acts to connect or 'couple' the lung to the chest wall. In other words, in a healthy and functioning human respiratory system, one could say the lung is 'stuck' to the inside of the chest and when the chest moves — either in or out with in-breath or out-breath — so does the lung.|$|E
40|$|Students are {{instructed}} on {{the proper}} technique used in distance running. When running, focus on a spot 40 - 50 yards in front of you, glancing up occasionally at a distance closer. “Maintain an upright posture with a 5 % lean. Try to focus on driving your elbows backwards, but keep movement in your lower arms to keep your muscles loose. Your elbows should be bent about 90 to 110 degrees and keep your hands loosely cupped. Don’t clinch your thumb in your hand, but rather place {{it on top of}} your index finger. Your arm movement should be rhythmic and easy. Your hands should stop at the midline of <b>your</b> <b>torso.</b> ” Utilizing the above teaching have students run laps focusing on each technique, focus first, then arm swing. OBJECTIVES(S) : Students will be able to: • Demonstrate proper running form and arm movements • Analyze proper running technique SUPPORT NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (NASPE, 2004) : 1 - Demonstrates competency in motor skills and movement patterns needed to perform a variety of physical activities. 2 - Demonstrates understanding of movement concepts, principles, strategies, and tactics as they apply to the learning and performance of physical activities. 3 - Participates regularly in physical activity. 4 - Achieves and maintains a health-enhancing level of physical fitness. 5 - Exhibits responsible personal and social behavior that respects self and others in physical activity settings. 6 - Values physical activity for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression, and/or social interaction. MATERIALS NEEDED: • Circular area or trac...|$|E
