Take charge and watch after the Indians {{in all the}} world." [...] Kimball saw the assignment as fulfillment of a prophecy given in the patriarchal blessing he received as an eight-year-old in 1903, which had stated that Kimball would [...] "preach the Gospel to many people, but more especially to the Lamanites." [...] That term refers to a people in the Book of Mormon believed by Latter-day Saints {{to be among the}} ancestors of modern Native Americans; another term was Nephites.|$|E

The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for {{me to look at}} you and <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 April 1801, Nelson began to advance into Copenhagen harbour. The battle began badly for the British, with , [...] and [...] running aground, {{and the rest of}} the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore {{batteries}} than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake. If he is in a condition to continue the action he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be attached to him. Nelson, directing action aboard , was informed of the signal by the signal lieutenant, Frederick Langford, but angrily responded: [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out on the Danish commodore and let me know when he surrendered. Keep your eyes fixed on him." [...] He then turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said [...] "You know, Foley, I have only one eye. I have a right to be blind sometimes." [...] He raised the telescope to his blind eye, and said [...] "I really do not see the signal." [...] The battle lasted three hours, leaving both Danish and British fleets heavily damaged. At length Nelson dispatched a letter to the Danish commander, Crown Prince Frederick, calling for a truce, which the Prince accepted. Parker approved of Nelson's actions in retrospect, and Nelson was given the honour of going into Copenhagen the next day to open formal negotiations. At a banquet that evening, he told Prince Frederick that the battle had been the most severe he had ever been in. The outcome of the battle and several weeks of ensuing negotiations was a 14-week armistice, and on Parker's recall in May, Nelson became commander-in-chief in the Baltic Sea. As a reward for the victory, he was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile and of Burnham Thorpe in the County of Norfolk, on 19 May 1801. In addition, on 4 August 1801, he was created Baron Nelson, of the Nile and of Hilborough in the County of Norfolk, this time with a special remainder to his father and sisters. Nelson had sailed to the Russian naval base at Reval (now Tallinn) in May, and there learned that the pact of armed neutrality was to be disbanded. Satisfied with the outcome of the expedition, he returned to England, arriving on 1 July.|$|E

[...] Speaking at the occasion of the reissue of Kindred for its 25th Anniversary by Beacon Press, African-American literature professor Roland L. Williams conjectured that the novel has remained popular over the years because of its crossover appeal, which [...] "continues to find a variety of audiences--fantasy, literary and historical" [...] and because [...] "it is an exceedingly well-written and compelling story… that asks <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back in time and at the present simultaneously." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the oldest}} and least {{complicated}} DRM protection methods for computer and Nintendo NES games was when the game would pause and ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up a certain page in the booklet that came with the game, if you did not have the book or entered the key wrong you could not continue. A product key, a typically alphanumerical serial number used to represent a license to a particular piece of software. During the installation process or launch for the software, the user is asked to input the key; if the key correctly corresponds to a valid license (typically via internal algorithms), the key is accepted, then the user who bought the game can continue. In modern practice, product keys are typically combined with other DRM practices (such as online [...] "activation"), as the software could be cracked to run without a product key, or [...] "keygen" [...] programs could be developed to generate keys that would be accepted.|$|E
