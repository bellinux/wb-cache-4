The model is parametrized by α, a dimensionless constant characteristic of the material, and n, the coefficient of work hardening.

5000|$|A {{serrated}} edge, such as on a saw or a bread knife, concentrates force {{onto the}} tips of the serrations which increases pressure as well as allowing soft or fibrous material (like wood, rope, bread, vegetables) to be expand into the spaces between serrations. Whereas pushing any knife, even a bread knife, down onto a bread loaf will just squash the loaf as bread has a low elastic modulus (is soft) but high <b>yield</b> <b>strain</b> (loosely, can be stretched or squashed by a large proportion without breaking), drawing serrations across the loaf with little downward force will allow each serration to simultaneously cut the bread with much less deformation of the loaf. Similarly, pushing on a rope tends to squash the rope while drawing serrations across it sheers the rope fibres. Drawing a smooth blade is less effective as the blade is parallel to the direction draw but the serrations of a serrated blade are at an angle to the fibres. Serrations on knives are often symmetric allowing the blade to cut on both the forward and reverse strokes of a cut, a notable exception being Veff serrations which are designed to maximise cutting power while moving the blade away from the user. Saw blade serrations, for both wood and metal, are typically asymmetrical so that they cut while moving in only one direction. (Saws act by abrading a material into dust along a narrow channel, the kerf, whereas knives and similar act by forcing the material apart. This means that saws result in a loss of material and the serrations of a saw also serve to carry metal swarf and sawdust out of the cut channel.) ...|$|E

Using a parabolic function to accurately describe the dependence of stress on strain, we derive a yield function relating the <b>yield</b> <b>strain</b> to temperature, strain rate and tube length. The activation energy and activation area are then determined from the MD results of the tensile <b>yield</b> <b>strain</b> {{as a function of}} temperature. We find that the activation energies for armchair SWCNTs range from 7. 18 to 11. 94 eV, depending on the radius of SWCNTs. Analyses of activation area and MD results reveal that the nucleation of a critical defect, which leads to the failure of SWCNTs, grows from a single bond size at 300 K to almost twice the size at 2100 K. On the basis of activation parameters, our model can be used to predict the <b>yield</b> <b>strain</b> of SWCNTs under experimental conditions. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this approach to colloidal hydrogel composite formation, imine bonds were formed by reaction between aldehyde groups of Dexox and the primary amine groups on the MG particles. The composite hydrogels contained MG particles that were externally cross-linked by Dexox to form an elastically effective network with high storage modulus (G′) values and low tanδ (=G″/G′, where G″ is the loss modulus) values. The G′ values for the MG–Dexox gels increased exponentially with increasing mass ratio (MR) of Dexox to MG. Interestingly, the <b>yield</b> <b>strains</b> determined from rheology also increased with MR and <b>yield</b> <b>strains</b> of up to 130 % were measured.

The evolution of positions and mutual arrangements of individual objects is taken into account through statistical quantities, such as the elastic strain of the structure, the <b>yield</b> <b>strain</b> and the yield function. The past history of the sample plays no explicit role, except through its effect on these statistical quantities. They suffice to relate the discrete scale with the collective, global scale.
