500|$|A {{number of}} critics cited the album as {{a return to}} the band's roots. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said, [...] "Nearly 15 years after Ten, Pearl Jam finally {{returned}} to the strengths of their debut with 2006's Pearl Jam, a sharply focused set of impassioned hard rock." [...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like to be an American these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially when <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the best of our experiments".|$|E

2500|$|On March 5, Stewart {{appeared}} on the Late Show with David Letterman, where he continued his criticism. Stewart said, [...] "The thing that upsets me the most, honestly, there are three 24-hour financial networks. All their slogans are like, 'We know what's going on in Wall Street.' But then <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on during the crisis, and they're like, 'We don't know what's going on!' It'd be like turning on The Weather Channel in a hurricane, and they're just doing this: 'Why am I wet? What's happening to me? And it's so windy! What's going on, I'm scared!' How do you not know, man?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{cover is}} {{a photo of}} Amos holding a large rifle, sitting {{in a rocking chair}} on the porch of an old wooden building. One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song [...] "Me and a Gun," [...] which appears on the album Little Earthquakes and recounts a rape she sustained. [...] "Well, it's [...] a {{reference}} to Me and a Gun, a song I wrote that was on Little Earthquakes. And the idea that there's a dead cock on my right and alive snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life... creation... what it's taken me to get here with men, and I don't want to be angry anymore. And <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> over and you put the gun down, but I'm not pretending what it's taken to get me here. But no more resentment." [...] It was taken by Cindy Palmano in October 1995 in New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|Ben Travers of IndieWire {{discussed}} the episode's approach to technology through Gloria's. He felt {{that while the}} episode made the viewer relate to Gloria's views on technology, showing Officer Hunt's obsession with Facebook as shallow, or with Unit MNSKY being deemed obsolete {{at the end of}} his journey just like Gloria's new chief makes her feel like; however, it also [...] "supported the advancement of society, to an admittedly lesser degree", with the absence of cell phones for Gloria and her son Nathan forcing her partner Donny to stop the school bus so she could talk to her son, or the fact that the WGA's records not being electronic forcing Gloria to wait a long time for the results. Questioning the symbolism of the mysterious useless box Gloria finds, he felt that it [...] "felt targeted: Who would build such a useless machine? Every time <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> on, it turns itself off. Does it represent Gloria’s feelings toward technology? That it’s more trouble than it’s worth? Is it a message left for her by someone — Ray Wise’s omnipresent frequent flier, Paul Marrane? Is it a reverse macguffin, a literal object meant to mean more to the show’s themes than the plot itself?" ...|$|E

60|$|That immobility and {{absence of}} {{elasticity}} which {{we find in}} the arts, we find with more pain in the artist. There is no power of expansion in men. Our friends early appear to us as representatives of certain ideas which they never pass or exceed. They stand {{on the brink of}} the ocean of thought and power, but they never take the single step that would bring them there. A man is like a bit of Labrador spar, which has no lustre as <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> in your hand until you come to a particular angle; then it shows deep and beautiful colors. There is no adaptation or universal applicability in men, but each has his special talent, and the mastery of successful men consists in adroitly keeping themselves where and when that turn shall be oftenest to be practised. We do what we must, and call it by the best names we can, and would fain have the praise of having intended the result which ensues. I cannot recall any form of man who is not superfluous sometimes. But is not this pitiful? Life is not worth the taking, to do tricks in.|$|E
60|$|How can I {{describe}} {{all that}} we saw and {{all that we}} did upon that lovely spring day? To me {{it was as if}} I had been wafted to a fairy world, and my uncle might have been some benevolent enchanter in a high-collared, long-tailed coat, who was guiding me about in it. He showed me the West-end streets, with the bright carriages and the gaily dressed ladies and sombre-clad men, all crossing and hurrying and recrossing like an ants' nest when <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> over with a stick. Never had I formed a conception of such endless banks of houses, and such a ceaseless stream of life flowing between. Then we passed down the Strand, where the crowd was thicker than ever, and even penetrated beyond Temple Bar and into the City, though my uncle begged me not to mention it, for he would not wish it to be generally known. There I saw the Exchange and the Bank and Lloyd's Coffee House, with the brown-coated, sharp-faced merchants and the hurrying clerks, the huge horses and the busy draymen. It was a very different world this from that which we had left in the West--a world of energy and of strength, where there was no place for the listless and the idle. Young as I was, I knew that it was here, in the forest of merchant shipping, in the bales which swung up to the warehouse windows, in the loaded waggons which roared over the cobblestones, that the power of Britain lay. Here, in the City of London, was the taproot from which Empire and wealth and so many other fine leaves had sprouted. Fashion and speech and manners may change, but the spirit of enterprise within that square mile or two of land must not change, for when it withers all that has grown from it must wither also.|$|E
