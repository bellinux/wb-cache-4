500|$|I saw the Statue of Liberty. And I said to myself, [...] "Lady, you're such a beautiful! You opened <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> {{you get all}} {{the foreigners}} here. Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it, to do something, to be someone in America." [...] And always that statue was on my mind.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{could not}} touch it. There is {{a pool of}} water out there, go <b>and</b> bathe <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> I will bind it up again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh with <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> {{that sort}} of thing, yes. But I may {{have to look to}} you for {{something}} more. I feel as if something were going to happen." ...|$|R

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1965, Berry Gordy was {{scouting}} to get {{the group}} signed to his fabled Motown Records label. Though the three Pips wanted to sign with the label, Gladys Knight initially refused, due to her fears that the label would overlook them over the more popular artists on his roster. They would sign with Motown in 1966, being assigned to Motown's Soul Records label, a label which featured acts who had more of an R flavor than a pop flavor. Their first Motown single, [...] "Just Walk in My Shoes", was a hit in England, but the group was disappointed in having The Andantes sing over the Pips in the song, resulting in the group demanding that the Andantes not be featured on the group's recordings. They also {{were one of the}} few Motown acts that didn't regularly perform on the label's Motortown Revues, with an exception being a Christmas showcase at the Fox Theater in Detroit, recorded for the album, Motortown Revue Live. A second single, [...] "Take Me In <b>Your</b> <b>Arms</b> <b>and</b> Love Me", also reached the charts in England.|$|E

5000|$|Reduction in {{the speed}} of the action: Can be quite {{effective}} as a [...] "different" [...] type of change of pace. Effectively you change only the rotation of <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> retain <b>your</b> action.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Ernest," [...] {{the marquis}} called as they approached, [...] "we {{thought you had}} lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the matter with <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> {{what have you got}} there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not so}} sure of that. Give me <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> let me {{get some}} supper. One always likes {{the idea of having}} done hard work, and one always likes to have been successful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't crawl through green brush {{without making}} some noise. If you watch <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> shoulders, you can't watch your feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You were lucky. Had I wanted, I {{could have}} torn your muscles out of <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> thrown {{them in the}} waste basket there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{gave me a}} fright," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "to wake up and see you waving <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> gibbering there. What on earth were you doing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a quirk in this," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "that I don't like. Take {{back your}} ring, lassie. Mr. Dishart, give Nanny <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> I'll carry her box to the machine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Throw up <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> look at {{the gauge}} under your armpit. Only mind how you steer while you're doing it, or you'll get ditched!" [...] I cried, as the car ran down the road.|$|R
6000|$|Shyly drew near, {{a little}} step, and mocking, [...] "Shall we {{not be too}} late [...] For tea?" [...] she said. [...] "I'm quite worn out with walking: [...] Yes, thanks, <b>your</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>And</b> will you--open the gate?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hold out <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> hands again [...] You {{were not}} so dumbfounded when [...] I was that bird of prey and yet [...] I am all woman now.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Estelle, 'that {{was when}} you took me in <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed me, and said you would follow Madame la Comtesse {{to the end of}} the world.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick, lads!" [...] he said; [...] "stamp {{your legs}} and swing <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> get the blood in motion. I will keep these fellows at bay a few minutes longer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because {{the herb}} only grows near {{the roots of}} {{chestnut}} trees,' replied Mimi; 'so let us lose no time in finding it. Take me under <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> put me down out of doors, and I'll hunt for it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you are {{thinking}} of," [...] the professor interrupted. [...] "Well, well, give me <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> we will walk down to the hall together. My friends," [...] the professor added, turning round, [...] "I wish you all a good-night!" ...|$|R
50|$|Keeping {{the point}} of the cane to the front, turn you upper body to the right {{slightly}} as you draw back your right hand. There should be a lifting of the left heel at the same time. Once your hand has passed the line of your spine (if viewed from the side), flip {{the point of}} your cane out behind you, so that <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> the cane is now in line, and fully extended out to the rear. Next, bring <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> the cane around from the rear to the front, along a horizontal line. If the target is the head, remain upright as you deliver <b>your</b> hit. <b>Your</b> <b>arm</b> should remain straight throughout the execution of the strike as the point travels through an 180 degrees arc from the rear to the front.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take up <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> follow me," [...] Jethro said, {{taking a}} heavy staff {{from the corner}} of the room, and, {{followed}} by the lads, he went outside the gate.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the name}} of my master, the High and Mighty Lord Gian Maria Sforza, Duke of Babbiano, I call upon you to yield, lady, laying down <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> {{throwing}} open your gates." ...|$|E
60|$|Benz. I see there's {{somewhat}} {{which you}} fear to tell; Speak quickly, Ozmyn, {{is my father}} well? Why cross you thus <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> shake your head? Kill me at once, and tell me he is dead.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the song}} [...] "L'argent ne fait pas le bonheur" [...] (Money does not buy happiness) (1966) {{from the group}} Les Parisiennes: [...] "Take all your clothes gaily under <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> leave without paying / We will bring you oranges at La Santé".|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{it is not}} a {{question}} of what you like best, but what the doctor thinks best for you. You had better go to him at once, he will examine <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> report to me, and of course we must act on his decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tush child!" [...] {{interposed}} Lady Eglinton in her harsh dry voice; [...] "have you {{not heard}} that Mlle. d'Aumont is not fatigued.

6000|$|... "I {{had better}} mount first. Then you, Surajah, can lift {{her up to}} me. I can stoop down, and take her from <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> put {{her in front of}} me. She is no weight to speak of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No more," [...] she muttered. [...] "There {{will be no}} more! Oh, my beloved," [...] {{she cried}} weakly, [...] "I've saved you! Why don't you take me into <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> carry {{me out of this}} lonely place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But is it possible, Philip," [...] {{the countess}} said in tones of horror, [...] "that {{you used to}} wrestle and to fight? Fight with <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> fists against rough boys, the sons {{of all sorts of}} common people?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "They would strip us naked, {{bend over}} us, {{and then start}} beating us. They took off all our clothes. One would hold <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> twist <b>and</b> drop you to the ground, while another would hold <b>your</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> twist, and another would step on your head and keep it down. Then the fourth person would take your clothes off and beat you with a stick. They did not tie us and hang us up, but they tied me against a wall and gave me shocks. They would prod us all over our backs. They would expose our breasts and prod us. They would make us sit on a chair and then slap our faces and push us off the chair so that we fell to the ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, as {{he rose to}} his feet. [...] "Now, let <b>your</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>your</b> legs <b>and</b> {{your head}} hang limply. Remember that you are dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{boys are}} very thoughtless. Come in {{and stay with}} me; {{you are such a}} mouse you won't disturb me.

[...] asked Psyche, who had the fever very strong upon her just then.|$|R
