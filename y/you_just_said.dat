2500|$|Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton {{auditioned for}} the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was {{eventually}} cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an [...] "accident", as she did not formally audition {{for the role}}. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer–director McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line [...] "I can't believe <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that." [...] The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: [...] "I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd love to get in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll never get a part where I have to speak really posh', – I'm not very good at accents." [...] Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca.|$|E

All the executives were happily running around and playing executive, getting corner offices—but very few of them had any concept about animation at all, about doing an animated film. It never occurred to anybody at the top that they had to start from the bottom and build that up. The problems were really coming at the inexperience of everyone involved. Those were people from Disney that had the idea that <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Do it,' and it gets done. It never occurred to them that it got done because Disney had an infrastructure in place, working like clockwork. We didn't have that." [...] Effects supervisor, Michel Gagné also said, [...] "People were giving up. The head of layout was kicked out, the head of background, the executive producer, the producer, the director, the associate producer—all the heads rolled. It's kind of a hard environment to work in." [...] Dalisa Cooper Cohen, producer of the film, said [...] "We made this movie in a year, basically. That was a lot of the problem.

The promos of the film were critically praised with Shaam signing on to appear on several projects before 12B even released. The film also brought together two of the Tamil film industry's leading actresses in the period in Simran and Jyothika. The pair had previously co-starred in S J Suryah's Vaali (1999) but had shared no scenes, for which Jeeva had been the cinematographer. Vivek also played a pivotal role of a mechanic while Hindi actors Sunil Shetty and Moon Moon Sen were also signed to appear in supporting roles. The film also featured Jeeva's assistant director, Srinath, in a minor supporting role; while Shiva who later appeared in the lead role in Chennai 600028 and Tamil Padam, makes a cameo appearance in a party scene. Shaam's voice was dubbed by television actor Vishwa, while Savitha Reddy dubbed for both Jyothika and Simran.|$|E

5000|$|Shaam {{began his}} career as a model in Bengaluru, {{modelling}} for various ads. Keen on pursuing an acting career, he was vainly searching for acting offers for four years. He then, following the recommendation of his model coordinator Biju Jayadevan, got to meet cinematographer Jeeva's, who was planning to make his directorial debut and was on the lookout for a new face for the film's lead role. Shaam was given the role for the film 12B. Shaam recollects that during his first meeting with Jeeva, he handed over his portfolio and introduced himself in English, when Jeeva heard him out, and then said, [...] "Repeat what <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> in Tamil" [...] and Shaam did, and was subsequently signed on the next day after a meeting with producer Vikram Singh. The promos of the film were critically praised with Shaam signing on to appear on several projects before 12B even released. His second feature film, however, the S J Suryah-directed Khushi, in which he appeared in a cameo role, released first, since 12B got stuck in production and released in 2001 only. The film which was a blatant rip-off of Sliding Doors, fetched rave reviews and was seen as a [...] "dream entry" [...] for Shaam, his performance was praised as [...] "apt" [...] His subsequent releases including Vasanth's Hey! Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke (2002), Bala (2002), Anbe Anbe (2003) and Priyadarshan's Lesa Lesa (2003), garnered only average or poor box office returns. His final release of 2003 was Iyarkai by debutant S P Jananathan, which also failed at the box office due to a delayed release, but opened to high critical acclaim, even winning the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.|$|E

Speaking about their experiences of working with Pinter in rehearsing director Carey Perloff's 1989 double bill of The Birthday Party and Mountain Language (for Classic Stage Company), American actors David Strathairn and Peter Riegert agreed with Jean Stapleton that [...] "Pinter's comments &hellip; 'freed' the cast from feeling reverential about his pauses," [...] and, while Strathairn [...] "believes pauses can be overdone," [...] he also [...] "thinks Pinter's are distinctive: 'The natural ones always seem to be right where he wrote them. His pause or beat comes naturally in the rhythm of the conversation. an actor, you find yourself pausing in mid-sentence, thinking about what <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> or are going to say.&hellip;' [...] " [...] Perloff said: [...] "He didn't want them weighted that much. &hellip; He kept laughing that everybody made such a big deal about it.'

Just sit down, get off Twitter; if you can't handle it, keep your opinions to yourself. Who is your publicist? Who is tweeting for you?" [...] Days after the release of Lil' Mo's interview, Keyshia Cole dissed Mo via her Twitter account, stating: [...] "You gotta be able to smile through the bullshit." [...] Mo then responded to Cole, [...] "If YOU can't take that, then the whole interview is gonna fuck the front of ya panties up." [...] Despite the exchanges, in May 2013, Mo addressed to The Breakfast Club that there was no beef between her and Cole. She added, [...] "I felt some type of way, she shaded Michelle first. I feel like when you try to attack (what you think is) the weakest link, be careful. Why are you tryin' to come for Beyoncé? She's at the Superbowl sic. Bitch you ain't there. It's not about what you said, it's all about how you delivered ... She's not gonna say it to nobody's face." [...] Additionally, Mo revealed via Twitter that she recently designed outfits with the caption, 'Who's your publicist?' Keyshia Cole, who was offended, perceived this as another attempt for Mo to take shots at her. Cole responded to Mo via Instagram in a captioned picture that read: [...] "The saddest thing about betrayal is, that it never comes from your enemies!" [...] Mo lashed at Cole's response, tweeting: [...] "I've been saying, 'Who's ya publicist?' for over 13 years.

40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Friday 2030 My Darling, Mail call at last! Oh honey {{it was so}} swell to {{get those}} letters from you at last. They were {{wonderful}} darling. You write a swell letter, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> exactly what I wanted to hear angel. Honey you think you’re lucky, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. Darling you were a wonderful fiancée, but you’re a much more wonderful wife. Every night I thank God {{for you and your}} love. Honey I miss you so much, those letters just made me miss you more, you’re so sweet darling, I wonder if I’ll ever {{be able to tell you}} how much I love you. You’re part of me and of my life now, I feel so much better now that we’re married, and there’s only a week to go and I promise you we’ll be together every possible minute we can darling. When I’m away from you I’m not at ease. Here always seems to be something missing. It’s so hard to describe that feeling, but it’s awful, and my Juda’s Priest I’m never going to have it again as long as I’m in this country if I can help it. I guess you could compare it to trying to paint a sunset in black and white. You’d have a pretty picture no doubt, but there would be something missing. That something would be color, beauty, and life itself, and without them the picture is meaningless and dull. Darling I love you so much that sometimes it hurts, I never thought I’d ever love anyone that way. Well today I got loads of mail. I’m sending you the ones that were intended for you or should I say us, seein’ as I opened them, but they were for us. Oh, the pictures came, and honey, they’re wonderful. You look marvelous in all of them. Always remember to hold your head up when you’re photographed. Gosh they’re swell honey. I hope you like them. I’ll try to send the [sic] to you if I can get an envelope. If I can’t you’ll have to wait until I get home. You sure have been busy baby, those people must be swell I’m glad you have met so many. I want to meet them too, darling, en. blondes you say? I’ve got so many questions to answer, but I guess I’ve answered most of them. But there’s one I want to answer again if I already have:- No honey I’m more sure now than I ever was that we haven’t made a mistake. In fat those few days proved to me more so, so much more so that we haven’t. Honey those “little complications” you spoke of weren’t our fault. We were just very disappointed about me having to live on the post and going to gunnery, and your condition, and – well, just circumstances. They were purely natural I think. I’ve never given it a second though. I hope you haven’t. If I stay in Selma I think we’ll get an apartment darling. I don’t think much of the idea of you living in one room flats, and I’d like it much better too. Then at least we could sort of have our own home. I mean place to live and we’d be alone too. I think we’d be thrown out of a rooming house anyhow, but quick. I flew again today fired only 200 rounds and scored seven hits. I told it was luck yesterday. Well anyhow I was highest in our flight, counting yesterday’s scores. But don’t go telling everybody that bow. I’ve still got 1400 rounds to go. This stuff is really hard too, I think I’ve shot my highest score. I wish I could see you this weekend. We’re not flying Sunday but they’ve got something planned for us at the main field. But I saw the C. O. again today and if we didn’t have to do anything I could have gone. Oh well only about a week darling and I’m growling already, must be suffering from that well known oriental disease “Lak-a-nookie. ” Seems to be an epidemic down here. The pictures are really wonderful darling. We’ll have some more made when I get back. The colored ones will be here soon he said. It’s getting late again beautiful, time to hit the sack. I love you angel. Gosh honey, I love you over so much, I wish I could tell you. I miss you terribly I hope this time goes fast. So until next Sunday angel I send you all my love and devotion and remain, always, Your devoted husband Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
