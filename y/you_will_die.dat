So God created Adam as a human and his body was from clay. God breathed his spirit into Adam. Then when God’s spirit entered his eyes he saw the fruits of Paradise and when it entered his stomach he was hungry, so before the spirit reached his feet {{he tried to get}} up in haste to have the fruits of Paradise. This is the meaning of God’s word: “Man was created in haste” (21:37) In regards to the testing of Adam and Eve, Ibn Ishaq writes, “Iblis started off by crying for Adam and Eve, and they became sad when they heard him. They asked him why he was crying and he said, “I am crying for you because <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> and be forced to give up the luxury and plenty you are enjoying.” Then Iblis went to them and whispered saying, “Adam, may I lead you to the Tree of Immortality and to a kingdom that does not decline?” (20:120) Meaning that they might become angels or live forever in Paradise. In the Qur'an it states, “When we took from the prophets their {{covenant}} from you, Noah, Abraham, and Jesus son of Mary. We took from them a solemn covenant” (Q 33:7) That covenant was, as quoted by Ibn Abbas “The Prophet Muhammad said, “God took a covenant from the back of Adam on the day of ‘Arafat. He caused all of his offspring to come out of him, and spread them out in front of him. In regards to Adam’s death, Tabari writes, “When Adam died it was Friday. The angels came to him, sent by God from Paradise, to embalm and wrap him, and they honored his son and heir Seth. Ibn Ishaq says: The sun and the moon were eclipsed for seven days and nights.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{also used}} without a {{predicate}} nominative, which is not very common in Koine Greek, thus some interpret it as Jesus' own self-declaration as God. In [...] Jesus states: [...] "For unless you believe that I am, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> in your sins", and later the crowd attempts to stone Jesus {{in response to his}} statement in : [...] "Before Abraham was, I am.". Many other translations including the ASV have rendered John 8:24 as something like [...] "... For unless you believe that I am , <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> in your sins.". Some consider the phrase in John 8:58 to be grammatically different from that in John 8:24, as the copulative verb can be used with any predicative expression and not only a predicate nominative, such as in [...] "ὅπου εἰμὶ ἐγὼ καὶ ὑμεῖς ἦτε" [...] ("where I am, you also may be") in [...] [...] "πρὶν Ἀβραὰμ γενέσθαι" [...] ("before Abraham was") can be taken as a predicative prepositional phrase, thus [...] "ἐγώ εἰμὶ" [...] ("I am") in John 8:58 does not grammatically require a predicate nominative, however it is rather unusual for a present tense verb to be used with a temporal adverb like πρὶν in a declarative statement, though there are rare exceptions outside the New Testament. Thus explanations of John 8:58 generally depend on theology and not Greek grammar.|$|E

2500|$|Belmonte and Pedrillo come to {{the garden}} with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: [...] "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" [...] – [...] "Love, only love, can now direct me"). [...] Pedrillo gets the {{attention}} of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: [...] "In Mohrenland gefangen war" [...] – [...] "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle. [...] As the Pasha and his guards come running in, Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: [...] "O, wie will ich triumphieren" [...] – [...] "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish Grandee and Governor of Oran, named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: [...] "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" [...] – [...] "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>die</b> because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: [...] "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" [...] – [...] "Your noble mercy passes measure").|$|E
