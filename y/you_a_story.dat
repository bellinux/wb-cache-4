2500|$|Last season, Murphy {{had spoken}} with Zachary Quinto about Dr. Oliver Thredson, who was {{revealed}} in [...] "Part 2" [...] {{as being the}} serial killer Bloody Face. Quinto stated the knowledge [...] "made {{it all the more}} fun for me to build the character {{in a way that made}} it seem like he was compassionate and supportive and concerned about the welfare of the patients at Briarcliff, but carrying these ulterior motives." [...] He added that Thredson [...] "carries a lot of secrets with him. He's very intelligent. But he's also very experienced at covering those sects and hiding them and maintaining them. There's a plan. He's fiercely intelligent, and obviously ruthless in his willingness to create this world he's making for himself. He's delusional within himself. He's not trying to sell <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> He's trying to believe it himself. You will learn more in the coming weeks about what motivated him to these horrific crimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writers Allan Prior and Robert Holmes {{returned}} {{for the new}} series. New to the series were Ben Steed, a short story writer who had also written for Coronation Street, and Crown Court; Tanith Lee, a successful fantasy novelist; James Follet, who had written science fiction serials for radio, notably Earthsearch; Trevor Hoyle, who had published two novelisations of Terry Nation's Series One scripts and John Fletcher. Chris Boucher intended to write two scripts, one {{of which would be}} City on the Edge of the World. This script was prompted by a request by Michael Keating, who later recalled, [...] "...my daughter, who was about five or six at the time, thought Vila was stupid; Chris Boucher said, 'I'll write <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> where you get the girl'". Difficulties arose with Robert Holmes' story, entitled Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying, and John Fletcher's story about Hell's Angels in space. Both scripts were abandoned. Ben Steed was commissioned to write the replacement for Sweetly Dreaming... Slowly Dying which became Moloch, while Boucher replaced the Fletcher script with Death-Watch.|$|E
