40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} biochar on the {{cracking}} of the tar from pyrolysis of a pine sawdust was experimentally studied. The pine sawdust was pyrolyzed in a {{fixed bed reactor}} at 1123 K with and without a pine sawdust biochar placed downstream of the pyrolysis process to crack the pyrolysis tar. The cracking temperatures tested were 923, 1023 and 1123 K and the vapour residence times of the tar passing through the biochar studied were 0, 1. 2, 2. 3 and 3. 8 s. The pyrolysis liquid <b>yield</b> <b>decreased</b> and pyrolysis gas yield increased with increasing biochar cracking temperature and the vapour residence time. The main pyrolysis gases were H 2, CO, CH 4 and CO 2. As the cracking temperature increased, the H 2 yield increased while CH 4 <b>yield</b> <b>decreased.</b> The CO concentration decreased when the cracking temperature increased from 973 K to 1023 K but then increased when the temperature continued to increase.

30|$|The future maize yields {{simulated}} at Melkassa show consistent decrease across RCPs (Fig.  6). The largest <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> is unanimously simulated under RCP 8.5 {{during the}} end of century period independently of fertilization or planting date. The rare and limited yield increases (up to +  4 %) are simulated under RCP 4.5 (near term and end-of-century) and RCP 8.5 (near term) only in combination with late planting and no or half recommended fertilizer application. While under RCP 8.5 yield projections decrease further with time (near term, then mid-century, then end-of century), projections under RCP 4.5 decrease further until mid-century and recover by the end-of-century to levels comparable to near-term. Independently of RCPs or time period, results suggest that late planting in combination with no or half recommended fertilization amounts are the best possible combinations, either improving yields under RCP 4.5 or limiting the <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> under RCP 8.5. Recommend fertilization application appeared to be detrimental for early or late planting. While yield changes vary largely {{in response to the}} planting date (early, mid- and late), fertilizer rates could have very limited effects.|$|E

40|$|The {{photolysis}} {{of chlorine}} nitrate was studied using broadband flash photolysis coupled with long-path ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy. Branching ratios for the Cl + NO 3 and ClO + NO 2 product channels were determined from time-dependent measurements of ClO and NO 3 concentrations. Yields of the ClO and NO 3 products displayed a {{dependence on the}} bath gas density and the spectral distribution of the photolysis pulse. Product <b>yields</b> <b>decreased</b> with increasing bath gas density regardless of the spectral distribution of the photolysis pulse; however, the <b>decrease</b> in product <b>yield</b> was much more pronounced when photolysis was limited to longer wavelengths. For photolysis in a quartz cell (lambda > 200 nm) the <b>yield</b> <b>decreased</b> {{by a factor of}} 2 over the pressure 10 - 100 Torr. In a Pyrex cell (lambda > 300 nm), the <b>yield</b> <b>decreased</b> by a factor of 50 over the same pressure range. When photolysis was limited to lambda > 350 nm, the <b>yield</b> <b>decreased</b> by a factor of 250. Branching ratios for the photolysis channels [ClONO 2 + h. nu yields ClO + NO 2 (1 a) and ClONO 2 + h. nu yields Cl + NO 3 (lb) ] were determined from the relative ClO and NO 3 product yields at various pressures. Although the absolute product yield displayed a pressure dependence, the branching between the two channels was independent of pressure. The relative branching ratios (assuming negligible contributions from other channels) are 0. 61 +/- 0. 20 for channel 1 a and 0. 39 +/- 0. 20 for channel lb for photolysis with lambda > 200 nm and 0. 44 +/- 0. 08 for channel 1 a and 0. 56 +/- 0. 08 for channel 1 b for photolysis with lambda > 300 nm.

40|$|A {{series of}} field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in winter wheat grown under organic conditions in Denmark on fields with different weed pressure. The treatments were sowing strategy (normal sowing time, late sowing and false seedbed), row distance (12 cm and 24 cm row distance) and weed control method (untreated, mechanical weed control (weed harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide weed control). Weed biomass was largest at the normal sowing time and was reduced by mechanical or chemical weed control. Row distance alone did not generally influence weed biomass, but mechanical weed control reduced weed biomass at a row distance of 24 cm. Normal sowing time gave rise to about 10 % higher yield. The effect of weed control on yield was dependent on the weed pressure. At low weed pressure, mechanical weed control caused a <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> of 11 % compared to untreated or herbicide.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important environmental concern due to its visible negative impact on human health. However, air pollution also affects agricultural crops or food security directly or indirectly, which has not so far received sufficient attention. In this overview, we take ozone (O 3) as an example to analyze the principles and extent {{of the impact of}} air pollution on food security in China based on a review of the literature. Current O 3 pollution shows a clear negative impact on food security, causing around a 10 % <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> for major cereal crops according to a large number of field studies around the world. The mean <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> of winter wheat is predicted to be up to 20 % in China, based on the projection of future ground-level O 3 concentration in 2020, if no pollution control measures are implemented. Strict mitigation of NO x and VOC s (two major precursors of O 3) emissions is crucial for reducing the negative impacts of ground-level O 3 on food security. Breeding new crop cultivars with tolerance to high ground-level O 3 should receive serious consideration in future research programs. In addition, integrated soil-crop system management will be an important option to mitigate the negative effects of elevated ground-level O 3 on cereal crop production and food quality...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{provided}} quantitative data regarding unusual animal behavior prior to earthquakes; however, few studies include long-term, observational data. Our previous {{study revealed that}} the milk yields of dairy cows decreased prior to an extremely large earthquake. To clarify whether the milk <b>yields</b> <b>decrease</b> prior to earthquakes, we {{examined the relationship between}} earthquakes of various magnitudes and daily milk yields. The observation period was one year. In the results, cross-correlation analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between earthquake occurrence and milk yields approximately three weeks beforehand. Approximately {{a week and a half}} beforehand, a positive correlation was revealed, and the correlation gradually receded to zero as the day of the earthquake approached. Future studies that use data from a longer observation period are needed because this study only considered ten earthquakes and therefore does not have strong statistical power. Additionally, we compared the milk yields with the subionospheric very low frequency/low frequency (VLF/LF) propagation data indicating ionospheric perturbations. The results showed that anomalies of VLF/LF propagation data emerged prior to all of the earthquakes following decreases in milk yields; the milk <b>yields</b> <b>decreased</b> earlier than propagation anomalies. We mention how ultralow frequency magnetic fields are a stimulus that could reduce milk yields. This study suggests that dairy cow milk <b>yields</b> <b>decrease</b> prior to earthquakes, and that they might respond to stimuli emerging earlier than ionospheric perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Extracellular {{electron}} transfer (EET) is a mechanism that allows energetic coupling between two microorganisms or between a microorganism and an electrode surface. EET is either supported by direct physical contacts or mediated by electron shuttles. So far, studies dealing with interspecies EET (so-called IET) have mainly focused on possible syntrophic interactions between microorganisms favoured by this mechanism. In this article, {{the case of}} fermentative bacteria receiving extracellular electrons while fermenting a substrate is considered. A thermodynamical analysis based on metabolic energy balances was applied to re-investigate experimental data from the literature. Results suggest that the observations of a decrease of cell biomass yields of fermentative electron-accepting species, as mostly reported, can be unravelled by EET energetics and correspond to parasitism in case of IET. As an illustration, the growth <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (− 14 %) observed in electro-fermentation experiments was fully explained by EET energetics when electrons were used by this species at a potential of − 0. 12 ± 0. 01 V vs SHE. Analysis of other cases showed that, in addition to EET energetics in Clostridium pasteurianum, biological regulations can also be involved in such biomass <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> (− 33 % to − 38 %). Interestingly, the diminution of bacterial biomass production is always concomitant with an increased production of reduced compounds making IET-mediated parasitism and electro-fermentation attractive ways to optimize carbon fluxes in fermentation processes...|$|E
40|$|Three field {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in organically grown winter wheat in Denmark. The treatments were sowing time (normal or late sowing) and false seedbed, row width (12 cm and 24 cm) and weed control method (untreated, mechanical weed control (weed harrowing at 12 cm supplemented with inter-row hoeing at 24 cm), and herbicide weed control). Weed biomass in mid-summer was greatest on plots sown at the normal sowing time (compared to delayed sowing) and was reduced by mechanical or chemical weed control (compared with untreated plots). Row width alone had no influence on weed biomass, but in the experiment with high weed pressure, the more intensive mechanical weed control used at a row width of 24 cm reduced weed biomass. Normal sowing time tended to give higher yields, but this was only statistically significant {{in one of the}} three experiments. Wide rows gave a <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> in the experiment with low weed pressure. The effect of weed control on yield was dependent on the weed pressure. At low weed pressure, mechanical weed control caused a <b>yield</b> <b>decrease</b> compared to untreated or herbicide treated. At intermediate weed levels there were no differences, whereas at high weed pressure, mechanical weed control and herbicide treatment caused a yield increase compared to untreated.
