500|$|Six {{years after}} {{cancellation}} of Police Squad!, the film [...] returned Nielsen to {{his role as}} Frank Drebin. It involved a ruthless drug king trying hypnosis to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Nielsen did many of his own stunts: [...] "You {{have an idea of}} how you're going to do something, and it's <b>your</b> <b>vision...</b> unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance." [...] This movie grossed over $78million and was well received by critics. Ebert's 3½–star review (out of four) noted, [...] "You laugh, and then you laugh at yourself for laughing." ...|$|E

500|$|Bhardwaj {{noted that}} he {{retained}} Bond's theme, but incorporated his own elements to make the film a dark comedy. He said, [...] "I had previously taken liberties with Shakespeare. Naturally, when you adapt a story, <b>your</b> <b>vision</b> also comes in it. But I have remained honest to its essence". He included Keemat Lal (who plays {{a police officer in}} all Bond's stories), although the character is not in the original story. Bhardwaj decided to include him in the film as an homage to Bond, explaining that he took liberties with characters' names and traits. Bond also had to devise Indian methods of killing the husbands, which he found challenging: [...] "The challenge was devising seven ingenious ways in which she could kill her husbands without being suspected. And she does it successfully, until towards the end".|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} received similar praise. GameSpot reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that Mass Effect 2 is more detailed and darker than its predecessor. He wrote that [...] "deep reds and glowing indigos saturate certain scenes, making them {{richer and more}} sinister; eerie fog limits <b>your</b> <b>vision</b> in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact." [...] Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and cutscenes for being better shot than the first game, stating that [...] "it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in Mass Effect 3". Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive cast of voices, in particular Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for [...] "steal the show". Andrew Reiner, writing for Game Informer, opined that the music [...] "flows beautifully" [...] in both the story and action sequences. The game's presentation and direction were considered [...] "miles ahead of the competition".|$|E
500|$|The game's visuals and {{atmosphere}} were highlighted positively. Polygon editor Arthur Gies felt that Alien: Isolation is [...] "a beautiful game, full of deep shadows and mystery around every corner," [...] while Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer praised the lighting and unusually compelling environment design. IGN's Ryan McCaffrey gave high marks to the game's retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, commenting: [...] "From wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure <b>your</b> <b>vision</b> when you rewire an area's life-support systems {{in order to}} aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like {{a part of the}} Alien universe." [...] Similarly, PC Gamer reviewer Andy Kelly said that the game's art design sets Alien: Isolation apart from the likes of System Shock or Dead Space and creates a [...] "convincing science-fiction world, with machines and environments that are functional and utilitarian, rather than overtly futuristic." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Castle Walls" [...] {{lasts for}} a {{duration}} of 5:29 (five minutes and twenty nine seconds) {{and is a}} hip hop and electro song. The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of [...] "Castle Walls" [...] "offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self-pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young, black, rich, famous, and a repeat felon." [...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / If I should tumble if I should fall/ Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no one here at all, behind these castle walls." [...] After the chorus, T.I. raps the verse [...] "See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity / <b>Your</b> <b>vision</b> jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses, {{you will see the}} agony" [...] over a [...] "warbling" [...] electronic background and hip hop beats. Towards the song's conclusion, there is a [...] "sad" [...] string arrangement and an electronica-influenced [...] "triumphantly striding beat." [...] An editor from HipHopDX compared [...] "Castle Walls" [...] to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] by Eminem featuring Rihanna, which was also produced by da Kid.|$|E
500|$|The glamorous {{world of}} Hollywood also {{reflected}} in her writing, especially in the second track of the same name. Describing it as a metaphor, Madonna said that [...] "in Hollywood you can lose your memory and <b>your</b> <b>vision</b> of the future. You can lose everything because you can lose yourself." [...] The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her, so Madonna could concentrate {{on the things that}} did matter. So, in contrast to the first three tracks, the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer's heart, like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track [...] "Mother and Father". When Madonna was five, her mother died of breast cancer and the track was [...] "a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on." [...] According to Lucy O'Brien, author of , another concept of American Life was about [...] "nothingness". This was evident in the titles of the songs like [...] "Nobody Knows Me", usage of [...] "no" [...] in [...] "Love Profusion", as well as [...] "Nothing Fails". Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love. But [...] "Nothing Fails", along with tracks [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] became the centerpiece of the album as a triptych of love songs for Ritchie. Beginning as a humble track that musician-producer Guy Sigsworth wrote for his wife, [...] "Nothing Fails" [...] also has lyrics by singer Jem Archer, who was asked to collaborate with Sigsworth and Madonna during the first collaborative sessions of American Life. The track is followed by the folk-inspired [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process," [...] both being reflective and emotional. Her reflective mood continued with the last track [...] "Easy Ride," [...] which was inspired by the imagery of a full-circle and symbolized life for the singer.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after The News of the World story broke, rival tabloid the Daily Star {{ran a story}} alleging Archer {{had paid}} for sex with Coghlan, {{something}} The News of the World had been careful to avoid stating directly. Archer responded by suing the Daily Star. The case came to court in July 1987. Explaining the payment to Coghlan as the action of a philanthropist rather {{than that of a}} guilty man, Archer won the case and was awarded £500,000 damages. Archer stated he would donate the money to charity. However, this case would ultimately result in Archer's final exit from front-line politics some years later. The description the judge (Mr Justice Caulfield) gave of Mrs Archer in his jury instructions included: [...] "Remember Mary Archer in the witness-box. <b>Your</b> <b>vision</b> of her probably will never disappear. Has she elegance? Has she fragrance? Would she have, without the strain of this trial, radiance? How would she appeal? Has she had a happy married life? Has she been able to enjoy, rather than endure, her husband Jeffrey?" [...] The judge then went on to say of Jeffrey Archer, [...] "Is he in need of cold, unloving, rubber-insulated sex in a seedy hotel round about quarter to one on a Tuesday morning after an evening at the Caprice?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors test <b>your</b> <b>vision,</b> you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers. (See Ship of Theseus for a similar thought experiment.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the coordinated action was {{generally}} considered to be significant. Yochai Benkler of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society stated that the January 18 blackout was [...] "a very strong public demonstration to suggest that what historically was seen as a technical system of rules that only influences the content industry has become something more," [...] further adding [...] "You've got millions of citizens who care enough to act. That's not trivial." [...] California House member Darrell Issa called the collective effort an unprecedented means for upsetting a backroom lobbying effort, and the immediate political efficacy of the widespread online protest was characterised in terms of a sleeping giant having awakened and of a new player being in town. [...] One Silicon Valley lobbyist said the content industry had [...] "a lot to learn," [...] noting that they don't have grassroots support: [...] "There are no Facebook pages to call your congressman to support PIPA and SOPA." [...] The New York Times, which framed the netizens' revolt in terms of the new economy versus the old economy, headlined the activism as a [...] "political coming of age for the tech industry." [...] (James Grimmelmann, an Associate Professor at New York Law School, opined two months later that [...] "Legal systems are like Soylent Green: they're made out of people. [...] If you want to protect civil liberties using law, you need to get people on your side who share <b>your</b> <b>vision</b> of what law stands for. [...] That's why the SOPA protests were so effective. They converted an argument about justice into real-world political power.") ...|$|E
