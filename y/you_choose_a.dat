2500|$|The {{argument}} {{was based on}} comments by K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: [...] "Yong Vui Kong is young. But if we say, 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: Just make sure <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore." [...] Commenting to the media, Ravi {{said that if the}} clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam {{was a member of the}} Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as [...] "incorrect" [...] Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a [...] "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.|$|E

6000|$|Don't suppose, however, that I was quit of Mr. Franklin on such easy {{terms as}} these.

In the twinkling of an eye, he burst in on me with his cigar-case, and came out strong on the one everlasting subject, in his neat, witty, unbelieving, French way. [...] "Give me a light, Betteredge. Is it conceivable that a man can have smoked as long as I have without discovering that there is a complete system for the treatment of women at the bottom of his cigar-case? Follow me carefully, and I will prove it in two words. <b>You</b> <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> cigar, you try it, and it disappoints you. What do you do upon that? You throw it away and try another.

6000|$|We walked {{together}} in the gardens and in the evening when I would have retired {{he asked me to}} stay and read to him; and first said, [...] "When I was last here your mother read Dante to me; you shall go on where she left off." [...] And then in a moment he said, [...] "No, that must not be; you must not read Dante. Do <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> book."

Tell me," [...] and she crept nearer, [...] "have I been like the dusk to you, like the warm dusk? Is there magic still? Listen to the ripple of water from your paddle.

[...] "Still, to fall in with the simile, there are no doubt plenty of sticks in both places, just as there are right here in this city. In fact," [...] and his eyes twinkled suspiciously, [...] "I'm not quite sure that isn't an excellent name for them. Quite a few are nicely varnished, and in a general way they've hall-marked gold or silver tops. The hallmark, however, guarantees only the trimmings, and from one or two specimens that I've come across I've a suspicion that in some cases the timber's rotten. When <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> stick you want a sound one--one that you can lean on when you face a hill, and I guess that's a thing my girl will have to do now and then." ...|$|E

Now, leaning {{a little}} over the window sill, bring {{the edge of the}} paper at p against the sky, rather low down on the horizon (I suppose <b>you</b> <b>choose</b> <b>a</b> fine day for the experiment, that the sun is high, and the sky clear blue, down to the horizon). The moment you bring your white paper against the sky you will be startled to find this bright white paper {{suddenly}} appear in shade. You will draw it back, thinking you have changed its position. But no; the paper is not in shade. It is as bright as ever it was; brighter than under ordinary circumstances it ever can be. But, behold, the blue sky of the horizon is far brighter. The one is indeed blue, and the other white, but the white is darkest,[16] and by a great deal. And you will, though perhaps {{not for the first time}} in your life, perceive that though black is not easily proved to be white, white, may, under certain circumstances, be very nearly proved black, or at all events brown.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] he explained, [...] "I {{consider}} that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, {{and you have to}} stock it with such furniture as <b>you</b> <b>choose.</b> <b>A</b> fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled {{up with a lot of}} other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones." ...|$|E

If the local constituent should have an interest or should form an hasty opinion evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community, the member for that place ought to be as far as any other from any endeavor to give it effect. I beg pardon for saying so much on this subject; I have been unwillingly drawn into it; but I shall ever use a respectful frankness of communication with you. Your faithful friend, your devoted servant, I shall be to the end of my life: a flatterer you do not wish for. On this point of instructions, however, I think it scarcely possible we ever can have any sort of difference. Perhaps I may give you too much, rather than too little trouble.|$|E
