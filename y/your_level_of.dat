40|$|Abstract Background Neurology is {{regarded}} as a difficult component of the medical curriculum. This has been so marked that the term neurophobia and its effects are being investigated. Given the impact of neurological disorders worldwide, neurophobia has the potential to affect the diagnosis and management of such cases. Methods A cross-sectional survey was done among clinical fourth and fifth year students at the Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, Trinidad & Tobago. A survey tool successfully used in other schools was adapted to assess perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> difficulty, knowledge and interest in various medical sub-specialties including, neurology, cardiology, psychiatry, geriatrics, endocrinology, respiratory medicine, gastroenterology and pediatrics. Questions asked included: "What is <b>your</b> current <b>level</b> <b>of</b> interest in the following medical specialties?"; "What is <b>your</b> current <b>level</b> <b>of</b> knowledge in the given medical specialties?"; "Do you think the subject is easy or difficult?" and "Why do you think neurology is difficult?" Students were required to answer using a Likert scale and results were tabulated into mean scores and standard errors. Results The response rate was 65 % (167 / 255). Neurology was identified as the subject which students found most difficult (score 3. 89 ± 0. 068) and had least knowledge of (2. 32 ± 0. 075). These scores were significantly different from those observed for the other disciplines (p Conclusion This study provides empirical evidence that 'neurophobia' may indeed exist among the student population of the school. It suggests the need to re-visit the approach to neuroscience and neurology education and is consistent with similar trends worldwide. </p...|$|R

Approximately 3, 190 (145  ×  22) effective responses were collected in this survey and were reserved for model validation purpose. To check the sufficiency of these numbers of perceived ratings for the model validation, Cochran’s sample size formula [25] was used and the allowed error in estimation of the mean perceived ratings (3.49) was calculated. The error in using this amount of data set was found to be limited to 1 % only (estimated at 95 % confidence level). Thus, the data set was reasonably sufficient for the model validation.|$|R

50|$|In an interview, author Scott Westerfeld {{addressed}} {{the subject of}} where {{to draw the line}} between steampunk and dieselpunk, arguing that his own work Leviathan (2009) still qualifies as steampunk despite the technology in it including diesel engines.I like the word dieselpunk if you are doing something like 'Weird World War II'. I think that makes perfect sense. But to me, World War I is the dividing point where modernity goes from being optimistic to being pessimistic. Because when you put the words machine and gun together, they both change. At that point, war is no longer about a sense of adventure and chivalry and a way <b>of</b> testing <b>your</b> nation's <b>level</b> <b>of</b> manhood; it's become industrial, and horrible. So playing around with that border between optimistic steampunk and a much more pessimistic dieselpunk, which is more about Nazis, was kind of interesting to me because early in the war we were definitely kind of on the steampunk side of that.|$|R
