5000|$|Vennart {{attempted}} {{to describe the}} sound of the new album in January 2010, saying [...] "In the most part it's a bit shorter, it's mainly heavier, there's one tune that we're just practising at the moment that is just the fucking loudest, most obnoxious, sludgy, horrible, heaviest thing we've ever done. I'm really looking forward to presenting that, it's going to be unbearable, that'll be quite interesting. I've never heard anything quite like it, so I don't quite know how people are going to take to it, it's not particularly catchy. It'll be good." [...] He added that [...] "Gambler is playing a little bit of keyboards in here or there. On the last album, 'Frames', Gambler's playing keyboards on virtually everything, so I think he's trying to keep that to a minimum this time. There's some stuff that's the fastest, most frantic stuff that we've ever done. The strange thing is that with every album that we do, we try to do something different and keep everybody on their toes, just to keep things interesting for us as well as the audience, but the thing is, it's really hard to change what <b>you</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> can bring in all these strange influences and get introduced to all kinds of new music that can instigate fresh ideas {{but at the same time}} you're still going to sound like your band." ...|$|E

It’s worse being so close to you, and not being able to see you. So near and yet so far. And the time we do have together is so damned short. There’s nothing much I can tell you because I’ll probably tell you everything I did this week on Saturday. But I have been busy, at least the first part of the week, and I must say I’ve been pretty good about writing. I didn’t write last night because Steve and myself got to talking to some WACs over at the P. X. after I called you, and it was ten before I knew it. It was swell talking to <b>you</b> hon, <b>you</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> had a cold, and that’s not good. Oh, by the way, my chapped lips are better, temporarily. It must be the cold weather in New York, (it says here). Well hon, I’m C. Q. today. I’ve got to go get the mail. Hope there’s a letter for me. I love you and still miss you. Give my best to your family. As everJudd[Transcription ends...|$|R

I don’t mean the kind of websites you have to hide from your children, I mean there are people in America, probably here too, who own pigs as pets and they write lots of articles about pigs and how pigs feel and what pigs like (besides other pigs)… Off the top of my head, I could not tell you how much a full-grown, male farm pig should weigh.
