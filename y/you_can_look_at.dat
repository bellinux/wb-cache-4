5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
500|$|The English {{version of}} First Departure {{received}} mixed to average reviews, earning a 77% rating on GameRankings and a 74 out of 100 average from Metacritic. Many reviewers felt {{that despite the}} updated graphics and sound, the game still felt less refined than more modern role-playing games. IGN found the game to have a [...] "bland, awkwardly-told narrative" [...] with [...] "weak characters", but that it would appeal to fans of older games, stating [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> First Departure and understand that it's based on a very old title, you'll likely be able to overlook the problems and get {{a fair amount of}} satisfaction". GameSpot also stated that the title had [...] "limited appeal" [...] in addition to providing little challenge. Andrew Fitch of 1UP.com, however, called First Departure an [...] "overlooked classic" [...] with [...] "ridiculously engrossing crafting minutiae" [...] and numerous character party combinations that increase its replay value. GameSpy would additionally declare that [...] "Despite a couple of minor hitches, Star Ocean: First Departure {{is one of the best}} remakes Square Enix has brought to portable consoles." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson saw King Kong as {{opportunity}} for technical innovations in motion capture, commissioning Christian Rivers of Weta Digital to supervise {{all aspects of}} Kong's performance. Jackson decided early on {{that he did not}} want Kong to behave like a human, and so he and his team studied hours of gorilla footage. Serkis was cast in the title role in April 2003 and prepared himself by working with gorillas at the London Zoo. He then traveled to Rwanda, observing the actions and behaviors of gorillas in the wild. Rivers explained that the detailed facial performance capture with Serkis was accomplished because of the similarities between human and gorilla faces. [...] "Gorillas have such a similar looking set of eyes and brows, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those expressions and transpose your own interpretation onto them." [...] Photos of silverback gorillas were also superimposed on Kong's image in the early stages of animation. Serkis had to go through two hours of motion capture makeup every day, having 135 small markers attached to different spots on his face. Following principal photography, Serkis had to spend an additional two months on a motion capture stage, miming Kong's movements for the film's digital animators.|$|E

2500|$|A {{stopping}} time {{with respect to}} a sequence of random variables X1,X2,X3,... is a random variable τ with the property that for each t, the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event τ = t depends only on the values of X1,X2,X3,...,Xt. The intuition behind the definition is that at any particular time t, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the sequence so far and tell if it is time to stop. [...] An example in real life might be the time at which a gambler leaves the gambling table, which might be a function of his previous winnings (for example, he might leave only when he goes broke), but he can't choose to go or stay based on the outcome of games that haven't been played yet.|$|E

2500|$|While {{similarities}} between the Visitors and the Obama and Bush administrations have been discussed in the media, Peters refuted that they were intentional. He has stated that {{the theme of the}} show is [...] "blind devotion", with no political or religious agenda. Peters commented: [...] "Watching any television show is a subjective experience. If you're looking for something in a show, you can find it, whether you're {{on one side of the}} political spectrum or the other. The central theme of this show is blind devotion, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that in two different ways. It's our job, as storytellers, to put some provocative things out there and leave some things open to interpretation." [...] Bell added: [...] "We're talking about metaphors and allegories here.

2500|$|Thirty-two {{years after}} she resigned, Vanessa Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize {{to you and to}} your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview with}} Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy.
