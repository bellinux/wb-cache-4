5|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this {{pandemic}} was that it mostly killed <b>young</b> <b>adults.</b> In 1918–1919, 99% of pandemic influenza deaths in the U.S. occurred in people under 65, and nearly half in <b>young</b> <b>adults</b> 20 to 40years old. In 1920, the mortality rate among people under 65 had decreased sixfold to half the mortality rate of people over 65, but still 92% of deaths occurred in people under 65. This is noteworthy, since influenza is normally most deadly to weak individuals, such as infants (under age two), the very old (over age 70), and the immunocompromised. In 1918, older adults may have had partial protection caused by exposure to the 1889–1890 flu pandemic, known as the Russian flu.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSmall airway closure in asthma is {{determined}} by a complex interaction of structural and functional characteristics including lung elastic recoil. Recently, we determined that loss of elastic recoil might be attributable to pentosidine level in the airways. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the influences of aging and smoking on small airway closure in asthma. MethodsSixty-one patients with asthma (20 non-smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult,</b> 23 non-smoking elderly, and 18 smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult)</b> and 36 control subjects (12 non-smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult,</b> 11 non-smoking elderly, and 13 smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult)</b> were included. We assessed airway responses during methacholine provocation and calculated the closing index. In addition, we measured pentosidine levels in induced sputum from all study subjects. ResultsPentosidine levels in induced sputum were markedly higher in asthmatic patients than in controls. In control subjects, the intergroup differences in pentosidine level among 3 subgroups were significant. Similarly, pentosidine levels were significantly higher in non-smoking elderly and smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics than in non-smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics. There {{was no significant difference in}} pentosidine levels between non-smoking elderly and smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics. The closing index was also significantly higher in non-smoking elderly and smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics than in non-smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics. Moreover, pentosidine levels in non-smoking elderly and smoking <b>young</b> <b>adult</b> asthmatics were closely correlated with closing index. ConclusionsWe determined the correlation of pentosidine level with susceptibility to small airway closure in elderly and smoking asthmatics. Our results might facilitate the understanding of elderly and smoking asthma...|$|R
