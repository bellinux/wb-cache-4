2500|$|In November 2013, Ranaldo said in {{response}} to the question of a possible reunion, [...] "I fear not. Everybody is busy with their own projects, besides that Thurston and Kim aren't getting along together very well since their split. I think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> cross behind Sonic Youth, same as you can put it behind the names Mike Kelley and Lou Reed. Let them all rest in peace." [...] In her 2015 autobiography Girl in a Band, Gordon refers several times to the band having [...] "split up" [...] for good.|$|E
2500|$|When heavy {{equipment}} operator, Julia Uberuaga, {{first went to}} Antarctica in the late 70s, early 80s, she recalled that [...] "the men stared at her, or leered at her, or otherwise let her know she was unwelcome on the job." [...] Rita Matthews, who went to Antarctica {{during the same period}} as Uberuaga said that the [...] "men were all over the place. There were some that would never stop going after you." [...] In 1983, Marilyn Woody described living at McMurdo station and said, [...] "It makes your head spin, all this attention from all these men." [...] Then she said, [...] "You realize <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> bag over your head and they'll still fall in love with you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antichrist {{started with}} the idea of making a horror film. Trier {{thought it was a good}} idea to start with a certain genre, and chose horror cinema because [...] "the genre [...] that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> lot of very, very strange images in a horror film". He had {{recently}} seen several contemporary Japanese horror films such as Ring and Dark Water, from which he drew inspiration. Another basic idea came from a documentary Trier saw about the original forests of Europe. In the documentary the forests were portrayed as a place of great pain and suffering as the different species tried to kill and eat each other. Trier was fascinated by the contrast between this and the view of nature as a romantic and peaceful place. Trier said: [...] "At the same time that we hang it on our walls over the fireplace or whatever, it represents pure Hell." [...] In retrospect he said that he had become unsure whether Antichrist really could be classified as a horror film, because [...] "it's not so horrific ... we didn't try so hard to do shocks, and that is maybe why it is not a horror film. I took [...] more as an inspiration, and then this strange story came out of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{positive}} review {{centering on}} the science fiction elements of the film was relayed by Janet Maslin of The New York Times. She praised the theme saying, [...] "Alien Nation has the best science-fiction idea this side of The Terminator." [...] However, Maslin was quick to admit the film [...] "settles down, with remarkable ease, into the routine of a two-cop buddy film, extraterrestrials and all. Matthew and Sam (whom Matthew refuses to address that way, renaming him George) {{go through all the}} familiar stages of forging a friendship between partners: cool antipathy, exchanges of insults, growing mutual respect on the job and, finally, an all-night drinking binge to solidify their buddyhood." [...] On a negative front, author Jay Carr of The Boston Globe commented on James Caan's performance viewing him [...] "Looking like a Paul Newman gone wrong, ..." [...] He went on further stating that [...] "the film's air of enlightenment is only makeup deep. And while [...] 'Alien Nation' [...] is no smarter than, say, a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' , it hasn't got the juice or the level of sensory jolt a [...] 'Lethal Weapon' [...] supplies." [...] Other critics such as Gene Siskel acknowledged the similarities between other police thriller movies, but still found the film to be a [...] "Genuinely entertaining version of that old reliable; a cop buddy picture with two very different detectives." [...] He explained, [...] "Now {{this is an example of}} how a <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>put</b> <b>a</b> nice twist on a familiar story, and it will work if it's been fully written. Caan and Patinkin have special characters to play." [...] Compelled by the acting, he felt [...] "The buddy combination here, worked for me." [...] He ultimately gave the film a [...] "Thumbs Up" [...] review. Not nearly as impressed with the film was author NF of TimeOut Magazine calling it, [...] "Worthy, predictable, and dull." [...] A summation of the negativity was described as being, [...] "Played hard and fast, the film might just have worked, but the decision to soft-pedal the violence merely emphasises the obviousness of the liberal point-scoring (parallels with Vietnamese or Nicaraguan refugees are so facile as to be crass)." [...] Critic Leonard Maltin bluntly referred to the film as [...] "A great concept that doesn't quite pay off." [...] But in a hint of commendation, he remarked how the film contains [...] "many clever touches and terrific performances by Caan and Patinkin." ...|$|E

Owin' to the {{freights}} that offered, he sailed for Alicant, an' made port just as the Spaniards were fittin' out an expedition against Algiers. The brig was chartered as transport, an' he earned big money for the owners, gettin' back to the mouth of the Chesapeake in '76, when the British sloop of war King Fisher hove him to an' took all his papers an' weapons; but let him keep on to Baltimore, where the brig was laid up. Then Barney had more money, an' considerable of it, for his mother." ...|$|E

I began forrard, Mistress Prettybones, and worked my way aft, like a man. I was six months aboard a Garnsey lugger, hauling in the slack of the lee-sheet and coiling up rigging. From that I went a few trips in a fore-and-after, in the same trade, which, after all, was but a blind kind of sailing in the dark, where a man larns but little, excepting how to steer by the stars. Well, then, d’ye see, I larnt how a topmast should be slushed, and how a topgallant-sail was to be becketted; and then I did small jobs in the cabin, such as mixing the skipper’s grog. ‘Twas there I got my taste, which, you must have often seen, is excel lent. Well, here’s better acquaintance to us.” Remarkable nodded a return to the compliment, and took a sip of the beverage before her; for, provided it was well sweetened, she had no objection to a small potation now and then, After this observance of courtesy between the worthy couple, the dialogue proceeded.|$|E
