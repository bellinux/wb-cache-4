5|$|Following {{the end of}} Bristol Community Festival, {{other groups}} emerged hoping to {{continue}} {{with some sort of}} summer festival in Bristol.

5|$|By early July the Chinese {{launched}} a major offensive in the ROK II Corps and US X Corps sectors. The Americans and South Koreans subsequently {{responded with a}} series of counter-attacks to regain the ground lost, yet these met with only limited success. On 6 July the Chinese attacked elements of the US 7th Division on Porkchop Hill on the US I Corps right flank, and succeeded in gaining the crest. The Americans were reinforced and counter-attacked over the following days, although again without success. Following another Chinese assault on 9 July the Americans again counter-attacked, yet neither side gained a clear advantage. The following day the Chinese {{launched a}} series of company and battalion-sized assaults, but were repulsed. <b>Yet,</b> <b>with</b> the Americans unprepared to accept further casualties for limited tactical gain, they evacuated Porkchop Hill on 11 July.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme in the years before the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. <b>Yet,</b> <b>with</b> the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} {{month of the}} war heavy {{fighting}} had occurred across the central and eastern fronts. Yet in the Commonwealth sector itself the only Chinese attacks had been made against 2 RAR holding The Hook on the nights of 24–25 and 25–26 July. The action {{was part of a}} larger attack against the US 1st Marine Division, with only diversionary assaults mounted against the Australians. 1st Commonwealth Division intelligence staff believed that the Chinese had been attempting to make a breakthrough to the Imjin River along the divisional boundary in order to turn the US 1st Marine Division's flank, <b>yet</b> <b>with</b> well-coordinated indirect fires from the divisional artillery and support from the British tanks, 2 RAR had been able to successfully thwart both assaults. Meanwhile, the US Marines had endured the brunt of a divisional-size attack, repelling the Chinese onslaught for the loss of 43 killed and 316 wounded over the two nights; total Marine casualties for July included 181 killed and 1,430 wounded. Indeed, with the Chinese determined to gain local territorial advantage prior to signing the ceasefire, the United Nations Command had suffered 65,000 casualties during the final three months of the war, while the Chinese lost at least 135,000.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the strong}} {{resistance}} {{exhibited by the}} Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives {{as part of the}} second phase of the divisional plan. <b>Yet</b> <b>with</b> the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they were destined to hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.|$|E

5|$|Grenada's debut {{was at the}} 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, {{where it}} entered six athletes (five men and one woman) across two sports; since its 1984 Los Angeles Olympics {{appearance}} {{and up to the}} 2008 Beijing appearance, Grenada sent athletes to seven consecutive Olympic games. Its appearance in Beijing marked its largest appearance <b>yet,</b> <b>with</b> nine Olympic participants; additionally, more women participated in the Beijing Olympics on behalf of Grenada than any previous year, with five female athletes. This accounts for slightly less than half of all women who have participated in the Olympics between the 2008 Games and the Grenadan debut. Although the majority of athletes competing on Grenada's behalf participated in track and field (athletics) events, Rolande Moses participated as a boxer in the welterweight category. Although Neisha Bernard-Thomas and Allison George progressed to the semifinals in their respective events, further than the seven other athletes, no Grenadans medaled during the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{assignments}} for Gemini8 {{were announced}} on September 20, 1965, with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot. Scott {{was the first}} member of the third group of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment. The mission launched on March 16, 1966; it was to be the most complex <b>yet,</b> <b>with</b> a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle, the second American extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10a.m. EST, the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02am EST, putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the US 1st Marine Division {{was holding}} firm against the Chinese 39th Army to the east, and the {{withdrawal}} of the South Koreans had left their flank exposed. However, with the Chinese 39th and 40th Armies only tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the 9th Army Group against possible counterattacks from the 1st Marine Division, the Chinese did not exploit this opportunity and the Americans remained relatively unmolested. <b>Yet</b> <b>with</b> the forward UN positions in both the US I Corps and US IX Corps sectors increasingly untenable as the Chinese exploited gaps between formations, Van Fleet ordered a withdrawal to the Kansas Line in the mid-morning. Hoge subsequently ordered the US Marines to form a new defensive position beyond the Pukhan River, between the Hwachon Reservoir and the new position to be occupied by the South Korean 6th Division. Hoge's plan relied on the South Koreans reforming and offering some resistance, and although a rearguard of 2,500 men was belatedly established it was in no condition to fight. Fearing a breakthrough, Hoge ordered the 27th Brigade, as the corps' reserve, to establish defensive positions north of Kapyong on the afternoon of 23 April as a precaution in the event the South Koreans were unable to hold, tasking them with blocking the two approaches to the village and to prevent the Chinese from cutting Route 17, a key route south to Seoul and an important main supply route.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{casualties}} on Hill 205 rendered the company ineffective, {{and for several}} weeks it was only capable of being used to conduct routine patrols or as a security force for divisional headquarters elements. Puckett was evacuated to recover from his wounds. On 5 December, Captain John P. Vann assumed command of the company, and Captain Bob Sigholtz, a veteran of Merrill's Marauders, was also assigned to the unit. <b>Yet</b> <b>with</b> the company's casualties being replaced by regular soldiers who had no Ranger training it {{did not return to}} full combat capability after the Hill 205 battle. The replacements were subsequently given cursory training between missions, but U.S. military historians contend that the inexperienced replacements dramatically decreased the usefulness of the company as a special forces unit. The company participated in a few isolated missions in late 1950 and early 1951, including the recapture of Ganghwa Island from Chinese forces while attached to the Turkish Brigade. It advanced with the 25th Division during Operation Killer in late February {{as part of an effort}} to push Chinese forces north of the Han River. During that operation the company was employed as a scouting force, probing the strength of Chinese formations as they launched raids and attacks on the 25th Infantry Division. The frequent scouting missions were also intended to draw Chinese fire and determine the locations of their units.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>with</b> the Phuoc Tuy {{province}} coming progressively {{under control}} throughout 1967, the Australians increasingly spent a significant {{period of time}} conducting operations further afield. 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 Tet Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968. At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength {{for the first time}} in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers joined US patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.|$|E
