40|$|This is {{study of}} {{morphological}} and physical characteristic of bamboo from species Schizostachyum brachycladum. The bamboo samples {{were taken in}} Pergau jungle area, next to Pergau Dam. Bamboo culm of aged 1, 2, 3 and 4 years were used in this study. For the morphological study, the investigations that were carried out were on the rhizomes, shoots,culms, culm sheaths, branches, clump formation and leaves. For physical characteristic study. the whole culm consisting of node 1 to node 12 were used. This study involves three characteristics which are internodes leght, diemeter of internodes length of 81. 38 cm, 2 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 88. 65 cm, 3 <b>years</b> old <b>has</b> 88. 82 cm and 4 <b>years</b> <b>has</b> 93. 26 cm.
