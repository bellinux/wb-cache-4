5|$|From early January 1941 until {{shortly after}} FDR's fourth inauguration in 1945, she {{lived at the}} White House. During her time there, Hickok's nominal address was at the Mayflower Hotel in DC, where she met most people. Also during this time, she formed an intense {{friendship}} with Marion Janet Harron, a United States Tax Court judge who was ten years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> and almost {{the only person to}} visit her at the White House.|$|E
5|$|In Madison Park, Seattle, {{a family}} are {{gathered}} around the television. The mother leaves to go to bed, and {{the atmosphere in the}} room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie runs out of the house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E
5|$|Madonna looks both {{older and}} <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> {{does in the}} photos and the videos: a little more lined and {{possibly}} tired, but also less mature and grand. Her manner is quite teenaged, not femme fatale. She seems up for mischief, and yet quite conscious of her power. At the same time, her very frankness is almost innocent. These combinations are odd, and they give her {{the air of a}} prematurely wise child. Her current style is 1930s Hollywood meets early 1970s flash: Jean Harlow and Angie Bowie. She is not bewitching, but is certainly beautiful. She wears the nose stud that so troubled Norman Mailer in a recent interview. If you saw her in the street, you'd think: she looks like a girl who looks a bit like Madonna.|$|E

5|$|Tubman {{spent her}} {{remaining}} years in Auburn, tending {{to her family}} and other people in need. She worked various jobs to support her elderly parents, and took in boarders to help pay the bills. One of the people Tubman took in was a 5-foot, 11 inch tall farmer born in North Carolina named Nelson Charles Davis. He was {{a veteran of the}} 8th United States Colored Infantry, serving as a private in the unit from September 1863 to the late summer of 1865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874, and lived together as a family; Nelson died on October 14, 1888 of tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{appears to}} have been unimpressed by this plan. She felt that marrying the son of a count diminished her {{imperial}} status and was probably also unhappy about marrying someone so much <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was; Matilda was 25 and Geoffrey was only 13. Hildebert, the Archbishop of Tours, eventually intervened to persuade her {{to go along with the}} engagement. Matilda finally agreed, and she travelled to Rouen in May 1127 with Robert of Gloucester and Brian Fitz Count where she was formally betrothed to Geoffrey. Over the course of the next year, Fulk decided to depart for Jerusalem, where he hoped to become king, leaving his possessions to Geoffrey. Henry knighted his future son-in-law, and Matilda and Geoffrey were married a week later on 17 June 1128 in Le Mans by the bishops of Le Mans and Séez. Fulk finally left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Bence filmed El tercer beso, {{directed}} by Luis César Amadori and co-starring Pedro López Lagar and Silvia Legrand. Though Bence {{was concerned about}} playing the mother of Legrand, who was only 13 years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was, the film was a success and she won her the Silver Condor Award for Best Actress from the Argentine Film Critics Association for the performance. The recognition led to her appearance frequently {{on the covers of}} magazines, and to an offer to appear in what would {{become one of the most}} important films in the history of Argentine cinema, La guerra gaucha. The film starred Bence and Sebastián Chiola, Ángel Magaña, Enrique Muiño, and Francisco Petrone and is set at the turn of the nineteenth century in northern Argentina. It was shot on location in Salta Province and was based on the novel of the same name by writer Leopoldo Lugones. Scriptwriters Hómero Manzi and Ulises Petit de Murat, wove the disparate stories of the characters into an overview of the gauchos' revolt against Spanish rule. The film, unlike Hollywood Westerns, neither portrayed colonization as progress, nor focused the action on the indigenous people, instead focusing on the patriotic pride of the gauchos. The film won seven awards and Bence won an award as best actress of the year from the City of Buenos Aires. It also earned her an offer from Paramount Pictures to come to the US and work in Hollywood, but she declined the offer.|$|E

25|$|Josephine Sarah Marcus {{was born}} in 1860 in New York City, the second of three {{children}} of immigrants Carl-Hyman Marcuse (later Henry Marcus) and Sophie Lewis. Her family was Jewish, and came from the Posen region in Prussia, current-day Poland, around 1850. Her mother Sophie was a widow with a 3-year-old daughter, Rebecca, when she married Marcuse, who was eight years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she.</b> Sophie and Carl had three children together: Nathan (born August 12, 1857), Josephine, and Henrietta (born July 10, 1864).|$|E

25|$|Germain's {{interest}} in number theory was renewed {{when she read}} Carl Friedrich Gauss' monumental work Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs {{for some of the}} theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. LeBlanc, to the author himself, who was one year <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she.</b> The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss' Disquisitiones and presented some of Germain's work on Fermat's Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for n=p–1, where p is a prime number of the form p=8k+7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss' reply did not comment on Germain's proof.|$|E
25|$|Seward was {{the eldest}} of two {{surviving}} daughters of Thomas Seward (1708–1790), prebendary of Lichfield and Salisbury, and author, and his wife Elizabeth. Elizabeth Seward later had three further children (John, Jane and Elizabeth) who all died in infancy, and two stillbirths. Anna Seward mourned their loss in her poem Eyam (1788). Born in 1742 at Eyam, a small mining village in the Peak District of Derbyshire where her father was the rector, she and her sister, Sarah some sixteen months <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was, passed nearly all their life in the relatively small area of the Peak District of Derbyshire and Lichfield, a cathedral city in the adjacent county of Staffordshire to the west, an area now corresponding to the boundary of the East Midlands and West Midlands regions.|$|E
25|$|Despite these successes, her {{brilliant}} {{career was}} fading. She lost {{tens of thousands}} in jewelry and cash in a robbery, and she had difficulties with the IRS. Her health suffered, and she worked only sporadically in the following years. In 1950–51 she wrote her autobiography His Eye Is on the Sparrow with Charles Samuels, in which she wrote candidly about her life. She explained why her age had often been misstated: her friends had to sign a paper claiming Waters was four years <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was to get a group insurance deal; she stated that {{she was born in}} 1900. His Eye Is on the Sparrow was adapted for a stage production in which she was portrayed by Ernestine Jackson. In her second autobiography, To Me, It's Wonderful, Waters stated that she was born in 1896.|$|E

[...] She lived there with her third husband and two of her daughters, and maintained a central position in New Orleans society.|$|E
500|$|Teresa Hsu Chih (7 July 1898 – 7 December 2011), or {{commonly}} known as Teresa Hsu (...) , was a Chinese-born Singaporean social worker, known affectionately as [...] "Singapore's Mother Teresa", in recognition for her active lifelong devotion in helping the aged sick and destitutes locally. The retired nurse was {{the founder of the}} non-profit charities—Heart to Heart Service and the Home for the Aged Sick, one of the first homes for the aged sick in Singapore. She had been a social worker in China and Paraguay and a nurse in England, before coming to Singapore to start similar non-profit charities since 1961. As a supercentenarian, Hsu was still involved in charity work and was one of very few supercentenarians who were recognised for reasons other than their longevity. She had spent almost all her savings on feeding and housing the poor and the elderly, all of whom are <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> was, but she herself led a simple and humble lifestyle. In 2005, she received the Special Recognition Award from the Singapore government in recognition of her contribution to the country.|$|E
500|$|Pfeiffer {{has long}} been {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} beautiful actresses in Hollywood, a designation The Daily Telegraph Mick Brown considers to be both [...] "a defining characteristic in her acting career" [...] and [...] "a curse". Pfeiffer initially struggled to convince casting agents and directors to take her seriously as an actress because they perceived her as little more than a pretty face during the early stages of her career. Pfeiffer's acting abilities continued to be overshadowed by her beauty even several years after her breakout performance in Scarface (1983); she responded by pursuing roles in which being blond is not a requirement. The Daily Beast Elizabeth Kaye recognized Pfeiffer among Hollywood's rare [...] "beautiful women" [...] who trust that it is possible to be physically beautiful and serious simultaneously. Kaye believes that the actress achieves this feat by [...] "grafting the sensibility of a modern woman onto the glamour of a '30s icon"; Rolling Stones Gerri Hirshey agreed that Pfeiffer's roles combine [...] "Nineties guts and Thirties glamour." [...] For Interview magazine, Peter Stone described Pfeiffer as a [...] "Blond, sultry, and ethereal" [...] actress with an [...] "unforgettable" [...] face. Nisha Lilia Diu, another The Daily Telegraph contributor, opined, [...] "It's not that she looks <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> is – she doesn't particularly – it's the symmetry of her bone structure, the flashing aquamarine eyes and those lips, the top one so much fuller than the bottom. It's the kind of beauty you find yourself involuntarily taking a moment to marvel at mid-conversation." [...] At least two of Pfeiffer's films, Stardust (2007) and Chéri (2009), in which she plays a 5, 000 year old witch obsessed with beauty and a courtesan fading into obscurity, respectively, explore themes of beautiful women struggling with the idea of aging. Pfeiffer personally identified with the topic of [...] "our obsession with youth and the ludicrous degrees to which women will go to reclaim it" [...] portrayed in the films. Pfeiffer claims to not want to appear <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> is and has yet to undergo plastic surgery, although she admits she would [...] "never say never" [...] to the procedure. Dismissing the claim that she is [...] "drop dead gorgeous", insisting that she is only [...] "conventionally pretty". Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, comparing herself to Howard the Duck.|$|E
