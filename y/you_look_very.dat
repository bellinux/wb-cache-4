500|$|It {{was during}} a train journey in Japan that Abbe first met Ueshiba. Abbe didn't {{know who he}} was and he reacted to Ueshiba looking at him, saying: [...] "What are you staring at, old man?" [...] Ueshiba replied: [...] "I know who you are," [...] to which Abbe {{modestly}} retorted: [...] "Everyone knows me, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Champion of All Japan." [...] Ueshiba then introduced himself as the Founder of Aikido, and was told by Abbe that he didn't look strong enough to be a martial arts master. Ueshiba then offered Abbe his little finger, and said: [...] "But young man, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> strong indeed. Please break my finger." [...] Abbe at first declined, but eventually accepted the challenge, presumably to shut the old man up. Abbe claimed that, as he took hold of the old man's finger and tried to break it, he found himself {{on the floor of the}} carriage and totally immobilised. Whilst on the floor Abbe asked Ueshiba for permission to study under him.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has also}} been criticized for her male characters’ “Sad Sack” nature and their “lack of testosterone.” [...] Tyler has {{disagreed}} with this criticism: “Oh that always bothers me so much. [...] I don’t think they are wimps. [...] People are always saying we understand you write about quirky characters, and I think, isn’t everybody quirky? If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> closely at anybody you’ll find impediments, women and men both.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} pretty"--she says, we will suppose, {{addressing}} the dolls--"and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> amiable. I suppose {{you are very}} amiable." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{title of}} track 3 {{literally}} means [...] "From the Back, <b>You</b> <b>Looked</b> <b>Very</b> Pretty".|$|R
6000|$|After in vain trying every {{indirect}} form, Miss Emily {{approached the}} subject more pointedly. [...] "I thought that <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> {{much interested in}} that poor woman to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But,' replied Bob, with hesitation, 'I thought I saw <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>very</b> sad, as if {{you were}} in love; I saw you take out a letter, in short. That's what it was {{disturbed}} me and made me come to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, dear. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> nice in it. After all, it {{was only}} thirty shillings. Can you show me any extravagance of mine?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you--pardon me, but <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> young, and a {{great deal}} too fresh and healthy for a town man--you don't know much of London life, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Quite true; {{the alarm}} was groundless. I'll {{tell you all}} about it. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> tired. You had better sit down a few minutes. Let us sit on this bank.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you came}} back, did you? Well, <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>very</b> proud of {{yourself}} this mawnin'. Gene Stewart, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like a coyote." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--I {{was awful}} foolish, of course, but I saw {{you when you}} went out this evening, and <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> so savage, and <b>you</b> didn't <b>look</b> <b>very</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{all been}} sitting here," [...] she said, [...] "for almost an hour, and you haven't noticed my figs, or my flowers, {{or the way}} the light comes through, or anything. I haven't been listening, because I've been <b>looking</b> at <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> beautiful; I wish you'd go on sitting for ever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Fanny, {{what can}} I do for you? I'm sure <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> nice in your bombazine; and it's very nicely made up. Who was {{it made it}} for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He said: [...] "That is all right, {{that is all}} right; <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> well on the outside, {{but when}} it comes to the inside you are not in it with the original." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{there you}} are up for the day--really <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> comfortable," [...] said Ethel, coming into the room where Margaret lay on her bed, half-raised by pillows, {{supported}} by a wooden frame.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear young lady, {{there was}} a great deal of truth, I dare say, in what you said, and <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> pretty while <b>you</b> said it, which is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us. The only point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline's brother, about poor Lord Henry. He is really such good company.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{big that}} beside him <b>you</b> would <b>look</b> <b>very</b> small," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "Have {{you ever seen}} Farmer Brown's Horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' cried Rupert, with a start, 'I see it all. I thought <b>you</b> all <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> queer at breakfast. I {{understand}} it all. You {{have been to}} the Mechanics' Institute.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> unwell, Lord Farintosh; indeed you do," [...] Miss Newcome said, gravely. [...] "I think late hours, and smoking, {{and going}} to that horrid Platt's, where I dare say you go----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, Reverend! How are you? <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> wet and miserable; taking {{refuge from}} the rain, I suppose, though it is {{clearing}} off now. Have a brandy and soda, or a glass of port?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> wet." [...] Captain Glomax and Ned Botsey were {{standing}} near the carriage; but the Captain {{as soon as he}} heard this, broke into a trot and followed the hounds.|$|E
6000|$|And Rachel departed, while Rose {{crept up}} to her aunt, asking, [...] "Aunt Ermine, why do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> so <b>very</b> funny? It was very tiresome. Are not you glad it is over?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When the {{children}} had gone, they brought you in here, mon enfant, and laid you on the paillasse where Felicite used to sleep. <b>You</b> <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> white, and stricken down, like one of God's lambs attacked by the ravening wolf. Your eyes were closed and you were blissfully unconscious. I was taken before {{the governor of the}} prison, {{and he told me that}} you would share the cell with me for a time, and that I was to watch you night and day, because..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told <b>you</b> he <b>looked</b> <b>very</b> {{much like}} Jerry Muskrat," [...] replied Old Mother Nature. [...] "His coat is brown, much {{the color of}} Jerry's, but his fur is not nearly so soft and fine." ...|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. No use. I daresay <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> majestic {{and very}} handsome; but I can't see you; and I am not intimidated. I am an Englishman; {{and you can}} kidnap me; but you can't bully me.|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> clever," [...] I said; {{and though}} {{divining}} with a child's cuteness {{that it was}} desired I should make a favourable impression upon him, I hoped this would please him, the words were yet spontaneous.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seems to me <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{well as you}} are. Isn't that {{a pretty}} enough frock?" [...] asked Mr. Bemis, quite {{unconscious}} that his own unusual interest in his daughter's affairs made her look so bright and winsome.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, Tom; your brow shows, {{as well as}} feels. Tell me, dear, {{have you}} often felt like this? <b>You</b> really <b>look</b> <b>very</b> ill. Sit here, dear, in the shade and tell me of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't succeeded then, for <b>you</b> <b>look</b> now <b>very</b> {{much like}} the young Augustus," [...] {{returned}} Rose, rather pleased on the whole {{to see what a}} finely shaped head appeared after the rough thatch was off.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{what has}} {{happened}} to <b>you?</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> so <b>very</b> strange. I have been expecting to see your marriage in the paper. Why, it's only a few days ago that you left to be married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I might reply {{by calling}} you Thaddeus of Warsaw, for <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> romantic and Polish with your pale, pensive face, and your splendid furs," [...] she answered, as she paused beside him with admiration very visibly {{expressed}} in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will, I will {{with heart}} and hand! Thank heaven for the hope, and trust me {{it shall be}} fulfilled. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> tired, Maurice. Why go in to dinner with all those people? Let me make you cozy here," [...] she added anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "My son {{tells me}} that Helen is asleep, and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>very</b> tired. Leave her to Hester, now; you have done enough to-day, so let me thank you heartily, and send you home for a quiet night before you {{continue}} your good work to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ross {{brought out}} a canvas coat, well worn but serviceable. [...] "Take this along with you. It's likely to storm before we reach the sheep-camp. And <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>very</b> strong. <b>You</b> must take care of yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't call me by that name," [...] she said, {{pressing}} his hand. [...] "You {{were always a}} good boy, Arthur; and it's kind {{of you to come}} now,--very kind. <b>You</b> sometimes <b>look</b> <b>very</b> like your ma, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, is {{that the}} reason!" [...] cried I, immensely relieved. [...] "I think, Edra, <b>you</b> would <b>look</b> <b>very</b> {{beautiful}} in any color {{that is on the}} earth, or in the rainbow above the earth. But am I so different from you all?" ...|$|R
