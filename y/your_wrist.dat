6000|$|Oakhurst (looking toward pillar). Pardon, my darling: {{there was}} a bracelet--a mere trifle--I once gave you. It is not on <b>your</b> <b>wrist.</b> I am a trifle superstitious, perhaps: {{it was my first}} gift. Bring it with you. I will wait. Go! ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR POLLY, Opydilldock is first-rate for sprains. You {{put a lot}} on the flannel and do up <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> and I {{guess it}} will be all right in the morning. Will you come a sleigh-ride tomorrow? I 'm awful sorry I hurt you.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay," [...] he {{answered}} gently, [...] "it would scratch <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> and break <b>your</b> stays. Hark at my hands"—he rubbed them together—"like sandpaper!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you oblige me, sir," [...] said Harry, [...] "by {{showing me}} <b>your</b> <b>wrist?</b> It is true I can't feel your pulse, owing {{to what you}} must {{acknowledge}} as a very unpleasant tenuity in your component tissues: but perhaps I may succeed in seeing it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose there}} is some {{understanding}} between you and Deronda about that thing you have on <b>your</b> <b>wrist.</b> If {{you have anything to}} say to him, say it. But don't carry on a telegraphing which other people are supposed not to see. It's damnably vulgar." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A little more--a little more," [...] said she, petulantly {{touching}} {{his hand with}} the forefinger, to make him incline the cup more generously and yieldingly. [...] "It smells of spice and sugar, but I can't taste it; <b>your</b> <b>wrist</b> is so stiff, and you are so stingy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Molly," [...] said Mr. Jaggers, {{not looking}} at her, but obstinately looking at the {{opposite}} side of the room, [...] "let them see both <b>your</b> <b>wrists.</b> Show them. Come!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{put that}} thing on <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> and hid {{it from me}} till you wanted him to see it. Only fools go into that deaf and dumb talk, and think they're secret. You will {{understand}} {{that you are not}} to compromise yourself. Behave with dignity. That's all I have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, nay, {{take your}} bradawl!' Saxon {{answered}} good-humouredly, kicking the sword towards his youthful opponent. 'But, mark you! {{when you would}} lunge, direct your point upwards rather than down, for otherwise you must throw <b>your</b> <b>wrist</b> open to your antagonist, who can scarce fail to disarm you. In quarte, tierce, or saccoon the same holds good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt you?" [...] {{repeated}} the veteran. [...] "I'm a deal too fond of you--and more shame {{for me at}} my age!--to hurt you. If I let go of <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> will you walk straight before me, where I can see you all the way? Will you be a good girl, and walk straight up to your own door?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} man wasn't you--all along. I {{tried to think}} it was. I tried to think perhaps the water had altered <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> and feet and the colour of your hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to kill you, Philippo. You have not been harsh to me, and I would spare your life if I could. Hold your hands back above your head, and put <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> {{together}} that I may fasten them. Then I will let you get up." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first sport-tourer {{is said to}} be {{the fully}} faired 1977 BMW R100RS. [...] Journalist Peter Egan defines the sport-tourer as a [...] "café racer that doesn't hurt <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> and a touring bike that doesn't feel like a tank," [...] and {{identified}} the R100RS as the first example he owned.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thrust not {{forward into}} danger too much, mon petit. In {{a little time}} <b>your</b> <b>wrist</b> will be {{stronger}} and your cut more shrewd. There will be some of us at the 'Rose de Guienne' to-night, which is two doors from the hotel of the 'Half Moon,' so if you would drain a cup with a few simple archers you will be right welcome." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good. Very good, indeed," [...] {{the marshal}} said, {{after the first}} rally. [...] "You have {{made the most of}} your opportunities. <b>Your</b> <b>wrist</b> is strong and supple, your eye quick. You are a match, now, for most men who have not worked hard in a school of arms. Like almost all our countrymen, you lack precision. Now, let us try again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hullo, Dreever," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "We've missed you. Hargate {{has been}} {{doing his best to}} amuse me with acrobatic tricks. But you're too reckless, Hargate, old man. Mark my words, one of these days you'll be spraining <b>your</b> <b>wrist.</b> You should be more careful. What, going? Good-night. Pleasant fellow, Hargate," [...] he added, as the {{footsteps}} retreated down, the passage. [...] "Well, my lad, what's the matter with you? You look depressed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dr. Joseph Maxwell, Deputy Attorney-General of the Court of Appeals at Bordeaux and Doctor of Medicine. He is a noted {{experimenter}} with psychic forces. Indeed, he has {{the power}} himself. Now, Mrs. Smiley, I wish to begin my tests by tying <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> to the arms of your chair. May I do so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{patience}} of the Patrician {{was at an}} end. [...] "Speak this instant, you rascal!" [...] he shouted angrily. [...] "Another minute, and I will have you dragged to the ergastulum, where, with your feet in the stocks and the gyves round <b>your</b> <b>wrists,</b> you may learn quicker obedience. Speak, I say, and without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "’You {{remind me}} o’ my boy very much,’ ses the landlady, shaking ’er ’ead; ’you’ve {{got the same}} {{coloured}} ’air, and, wot’s extraordinary, you’ve got the same tattoo marks on <b>your</b> <b>wrists.</b> Sailor-boy dancing on one {{and a couple of}} dolphins on the other. And ’e ’ad a little scar on ’is eyebrow, much the same as yours.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] she said. [...] "Ivy, with stems {{thicker than}} <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> climbs about {{the front of}} it, and a lawn mown until it looks like velvet slopes to the sliding water. A wall of clipped yews shuts it in, and the river slides past it silently without froth or haste, as though afraid that any sound it made would jar upon the drowsy {{quietness}} of the place. There is a big beech wood behind it, and one little meadow, green as an emerald, between that and the river----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Beckwith went on: 'Whenever {{you left}} here, I left here. Although I {{understood}} {{that you found}} it necessary to pause in the completion of that purpose, to avert suspicion, still I watched you close, with the poor confiding girl. When I had the diary, and could read it word by word, - it was only about the night before your last visit to Scarborough, - you remember the night? you slept with a small flat vial tied to <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> - I sent to Mr. Sampson, who was kept out of view. This is Mr. Sampson's trusty servant standing by the door. We three saved your niece among us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can," [...] {{replied the}} old gentleman, with a smile, and {{a twinkle in}} his eye; [...] "of course the style of grip and throw will vary {{according}} {{to the size of the}} man one has to deal with. Give me hold of <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> and plant yourself firmly on your legs. Now, you see, you must turn the arm--so, and use your toe--thus, so as to lift your man, and with a sudden twist--there! That's the way to do it!" [...] said the old gentleman, with a chuckle, as he threw Oliver head foremost into the middle of a haycock that lay opportunely near.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've led me a nice {{dance on}} a wrong scent," [...] {{answered}} the runner, sulkily. [...] "But I {{never was a}} hard man where women are concerned. Go upstairs, and leave the door open, so that I can see in through it if I like. Hold your hat over <b>your</b> <b>wrists,</b> if you don't want her to see the handcuffs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your stance was wrong, {{and your}} grip was wrong, and you moved your head, and swayed your body, and took your eye off the ball, and pressed, and forgot to use <b>your</b> <b>wrists,</b> and swung back too fast, {{and let the}} hands get ahead of the club, and lost your balance, and omitted to pivot on the ball of the left foot, and bent your right knee." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think violet, monsieur, and rosettes of {{the same}} colour on your shoes. It were best, I think, that the {{stockings}} should match the doublet. You will, of course, have a pointed lace collar for your cloak, and {{at the bottom of}} your breeches and at <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> to match. I think, sir, that a large collar and gold embroidery would go best with the costume." ...|$|R
6000|$|With a dim {{suspicion}} of her wish to cover some deception, he answered: [...] "My entrance was quite as unpremeditated, I assure you." [...] He spoke with returning humor. [...] "I really {{came to call}} upon you, to welcome you {{to the city and}} to talk of the West. The usher mistook me for one of the seekers and thrust me bodily into the circle. Please believe that I acted upon sudden impulse in seizing <b>your</b> <b>wrist.</b> I am heartily ashamed of myself. I was an intruder, and had no right, no excuse--although your 'guides,' as you call them, seemed eager to have me sit beside you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} an empty space behind!" [...] Harry shouted joyfully. [...] "However," [...] he went on in changed tones, [...] "we must see to José first. That blow may have {{fractured}} his arm. Let me look, José. No, I don't think anything is broken, {{but there is a}} nasty cut on the wrist. It is fortunate that you were not striking straight down, Dias, for I am sure we have not put anything approaching the strength into our blows, now we are hitting sideways, that we exerted before. You had better go up to Maria, José, and get her to bathe <b>your</b> <b>wrist</b> with cold water, and put on a bandage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{because you}} were not {{accustomed}} to it. Had you been an English boxer you would have leapt back as quickly as I leapt forward. I should have failed to grasp <b>your</b> <b>wrist,</b> and should in that case have leapt back again to my former position, for had I remained thus I should have been at your mercy. Had I succeeded in doing so before you struck me, {{we should have been}} as we began, and I should have tried some other trick. Certainly as long as I stood with my left arm extended and my knife pointed towards you, you could not have closed with me--for I am much quicker on my feet from the training that I have received--and I could have got back more quickly than your knife could fall, and even if the blades fell at the same moment you would but gash my shoulder, whereas I should pierce you at a vital point.|$|E
40|$|Have {{you ever}} written {{to a friend}} {{in a state of}} gloom, rage - or {{euphoria}} - describing whatever has made you that way? And have you then received a reply or even anxious phone call in response, days later, when the mood of that moment is long gone and you can 2 ̆ 7 t quite remember why you wanted to dance on the rooftops or, alternatively, slit <b>your</b> <b>wrists...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Softly, Mr. Pyncheon!" [...] {{said the}} {{carpenter}} with scornful composure. [...] "Softly, an' it please your worship, else you will spoil those rich lace-ruffles at <b>your</b> <b>wrists!</b> Is it my crime {{if you have}} sold your daughter for the mere hope of getting a sheet of yellow parchment into your clutch? There sits Mistress Alice quietly asleep. Now let Matthew Maule try whether she be as proud as the carpenter found her awhile since." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE [putting aside {{her books}} with cool decision] Well, let us drop the subject {{until you are}} better able to face it. [Looking {{critically}} at her mother] You want some good walks and a little lawn tennis to set you up. You are shockingly out of condition: you were not able to manage twenty yards uphill today without stopping to pant; and <b>your</b> <b>wrists</b> are mere rolls of fat. Look at mine.
