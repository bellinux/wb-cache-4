500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so {{that one of your}} creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add {{to the fact that}} they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E

She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Do {{you want me to}} be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't want to say that but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very aware of the fact that it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Transferred to Supreme Army Command as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General {{at the end}} of April 1918, Thaer {{reported}} to Hindenburg and Ludendorff on 1 May 1918. [...] He had already resolved that he would report openly on the frontline situation to the two men running the war. [...] By that criterion he failed. [...] The field-marshall hero of Tannenberg was sympathetic: [...] "My dear Mr von Thaer, your nerves have certainly been affected by the last few terrible weeks through which you have come. [...] I think that the good spirits at Supreme Army Command will soon set you right". [...] Thaer encountered a similar, if less avuncular, reaction a little later when he {{reported to}} First Quartermaster General Erich von Ludendorff: [...] "What's your game? [...] What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> [...] Should I now make peace at any price?" [...] Thaer replied: [...] "Excellence, I said nothing about that. [...] Ot is my duty - and it is a very painful duty - {{to point out that the}} condition of our troops is not going to improve, but will continue slowly to deteriorate". [...] Ludendorff persisted: [...] "If the condition of our troops is getting worse, if discipline is deteriorating, then that is your fault and the fault of all those field commanders who do not get it. [...] How else can it be that entire divisions can found too drunk to fight, unable to implement the necessary advances. [...] That is the explanation for the great March offensive, and now [...] Operation Georgette, not progressing further.|$|E
