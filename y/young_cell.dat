40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} is {{an important}} protective mechanism against cell proliferation and has critical roles in aging and aging-related disease. Recently, one interesting observation is that the protein abundance is higher in senescent cells than that in <b>young</b> <b>cells.</b> So far, some factors were presented to interpret this observation, such as active protein synthesis linked with autophagy, mTOR, and oxidative stress. Here, applying bioinformatic analysis of microRNA profiles in <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> and aging cells, we revealed that globally senescent cells show lower miRNA abundance than that in <b>young</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting that the repression of protein synthesis by miRNA in senescent cells could be largely attenuated.

5000|$|The {{construction}} of the new cell wall begins within the lumen of the narrow tubules of the <b>young</b> <b>cell</b> plate.

As the cell plate continues to mature and fuses with the parental plasma membrane, the callose is slowly replaced with cellulose, the primary component of a mature cell wall 6.

40|$|Since it {{was first}} shown that the actively-reproducing, <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> of the {{coliform}} and proteus groups of bacteria are killed {{by a number of}} mild inimical factors which are relatively or entirely without effect on mature cells, an extensive literature has de-veloped on the physiological differences between young and old bacterial cells. This subject has been admirably summarized and discussed in a recent review by Winslow and Walker (1939). It is known that such treatments as a sudden drop in tempera-ture from 370 to 2 °C., and the transfer to weak saline solutions containing only 2 to 5 per cent sodium chloride, which are without measurable effect upon mature cells, are lethal to a high percent-age of young cells; likewise, exposures to temperatures only slightly above the maximum for growth (500 to 53 °C.) kill a much larger percentage of the <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> than of the mature ones; and exposures to germicidal agents such as phenol also show the greater sensitivity of the <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> (Sherman and Albus, 1923).

Successive extractions of neutral and alkaline PME isoforms present in hypocotyl native cell walls (referred to as PE 1, PE 2, PE 3, PE 4, with increasingly basic isoelectric points) revealed that solubilization of PE 1, PE 2, and PE 4 did not induce any significant decrease in the cell-wall-bound PME activity. The in vitro de-esterification occurring when isolated cell walls were incubated with pectin resulted, then, from the activity of PE 3.

(1992) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1136, 155 – 160). An attractive hypothesis of cell aging suggests that oxidative stress is responsible for many age-related changes. To determine whether oxidative stress leads to increased intracellular Ca 2 + concentrations, we used the fluorinated calcium probe 5, 5 ′-difluoroBAPTA and fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19 F-NMR) to measure [Ca 2 +]i following mild hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) stress to <b>young</b> red <b>cells.</b> Cells were separated using density centrifugation, exposed to 815 μM H 2 O 2, loaded with the calcium probe, and [Ca 2 +]i measured. Intracellular [Ca 2 +] increased from 62 nM (± 4, S.

40|$|Shear {{deformation}} of {{young and old}} human red blood cells was examined over a range of shear stresses and suspending phase viscosities (eta o) using a cone-plate Rheoscope. The internal viscosities (eta i) of these cell types differ, and further changes in internal viscosity were induced by alteration of suspension osmolality and hence cell volume. For low suspending viscosities (0. 0555 or 0. 111 P) old cells tended to tumble in shear flow, whereas <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> achieved stable orientation and deformed. Changes in osmolality, at these external viscosities, altered the percentage of cells deforming, and for each cell type threshold osmolalities (Osm- 50) were determined where 50 % of cells deformed. The threshold osmolalities were higher for <b>younger</b> <b>cells</b> than for older cells, but the internal viscosities of the two cell types were similar at their respective Osm- 50. Threshold osmolalities were also higher for the higher external viscosity, but the ratio of internal to external viscosities (i. e., eta i/eta o) was nearly constant for both external viscosities. Deformation of stably oriented cells increased with increasing shear stress and approached a value limited by cell surface area and volume. For isotonic media, {{over a wide range}} of external viscosities and shear stresses, deformation was greater for <b>younger</b> <b>cells</b> than for older cells. However, deformation vs. shear stress data for the two cell types became nearly coincident if <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> were osmotically shrunk to have their internal viscosity close to that for old cells. Increases in external viscosity, at constant shear stress, caused greater deformation for all cells. This effect of external viscosity was not equal for young and old cells; the ratio of old/young cell deformation increased with increasing eta o. However, if deformation was plotted {{as a function of the}} ratio lambda = eta i/eta o, at constant shear stress, <b>young</b> and old <b>cell</b> data followed similar paths.

Apical growth occurs upon the mitosis of a <b>young</b> <b>cell</b> at one extremity and leads to a new tip cell followed by a cylindrical cell, whereas branching mainly occurs when a cylindrical cell becomes rounded and swells, forming a spherical cell. Given the continuous interplay between cell growth and swelling, a poroelastic model combining osmotic pressure and volumetric growth is considered for the whole cell, cytoplasm and cell wall. The model recovers the morphogenetic transformations of mature cells: transformation of a cylindrical shape into spherical shape with a volumetric increase, and then lateral branching. Our simulations show that the poro-elastic model, including the Mooney –Rivlin approach for hyper-elastic materials, can correctly reproduce the observations. In particular, branching appears to be a plasticity effect due to the high level of tension created after the increase in volume of mature cells...|$|E

40|$|The proliferative {{responses}} of cells to mitogens decrease during aging, {{and this may}} result from age-related defects in signal transduction in response to mitogens. In this study, we have investigated the age-related alteration of responses to epidermal growth factor (EGF) in cultured human keratinocytes that were senesced in vitro by repeated passage. The stimulation with EGF increased the DNA-binding activity of activator protein 1 (AP- 1), an important transcription factor for <b>cell</b> proliferation, in <b>young</b> keratinocytes, whereas the binding activity showed little or slight change in the senescent cells. The induced DNA-binding activity of AP- 1 in <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> was inhibited by PD 98059, an inhibitor of MEK, and partially inhibited by GF 109203 X, an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Western blot analysis demonstrated that EGF induced {{dramatic increase in the}} phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in <b>young</b> <b>cells,</b> while this phosphorylation was much less profound in senescent cells. Finally, the application of EGF to <b>young</b> <b>cells</b> resulted in increased phosphorylation of Fra- 2, a Fos protein component of the Jun/Fos heterodimer AP- 1 complex. This EGF-induced Fra- 2 phosphorylation was attenuated in senescent cells. Taken together, our study suggests that the signal transduction mediated by EGF/ERK pathway is altered in senescent human keratinocytes, and this change may be attributed, in part, to the decreased AP- 1 transcription activity observed in senescent keratinocytes...|$|R

Zhou et al. now show that newly synthesized proteins are particularly prone to aggregation and describe a mechanism that tethers aggregated proteins to mitochondria.
