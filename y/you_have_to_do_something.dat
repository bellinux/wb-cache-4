50|$|The {{encoding}} {{of explicit}} memory depends on conceptually driven, top-down processing, {{in which a}} subject reorganizes the data to store it. The subject makes associations with previously related stimuli or experiences. The later recall of information is thus greatly influenced by {{the way in which}} the information was originally processed. The depth-of-processing effect is the improvement in subsequent recall of an object about which a person has given thought to its meaning or shape. Simply put: To create explicit memories, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with your experiences: think about them, talk about them, write them down, study them, etc. The more you do, the better you will remember. Testing of information while learning has also shown to improve encoding in explicit memory. If a student reads a text book and then tests themselves afterward, their semantic memory of what was read is improved. This study - test method improves encoding of information. This Phenomenon is referred to as the Testing Effect.|$|E

To actually live a dream, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. Have faith in yourself first. Everything else will follow!” When asked by the press how she would differentiate Miss Universe from Miss Earth pageant, she says, “Beauty, body, and brains of the candidates are {{given a lot of}} emphasis in Miss Universe and it is more commercialized. On the other hand, Miss Earth is cause-oriented. If you can still recall, a lot of beautiful and popular candidates from countries that usually win in international pageants surprisingly didn’t make it in the semifinal round of Miss Earth last year. The judges, most likely, were looking for the ‘sincerity factor’ rather than the ‘X-factor’ in a candidate, which perhaps they saw in me.” ...|$|E

50|$|In Project Based Learning, or PBL, {{students}} learn {{both of their}} selves as learners and of their topic in depth.

However, the Heritage fair has not been done in some MACC classes, such as the one in Hillcrest Middle school. The Science Fair is a choice with any topic into an experiment, an innovative, or a research project. The experiment is a term long project when you just record the results, an innovative is where you research something then create it. And finally, the research project is just pure research on your topic. Heritage fair has the requirements that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> at least 20 years ago {{and it has to be}} Canadian. For eminent person project, the grade fives don't do it but the grade sixes do a Canadian and the grade 7's can anyone with proof of eminence.

5000|$|Connection with Lord Shiva in Dwapara Yuga :It is {{believed}} about Baba Balak Nath that he takes birth in every age (yug). He appeared as [...] "Skanda" [...] in Satya Yuga, as [...] "Kaul" [...] in Treta and as [...] "Mahakaul" [...] in Dwapara. In Dwapar age Baba Balak Nath {{was in the}} way to Kailash Dham with a wish to meet Lord Shiva. In the way he met with an old lady. The lady asked him where he is going. Then Baba Balak Nath who was Mahakaul {{told her that he}} is praying Lord Shiva since last three births but he had not been blessed by Lord Shiva with his appearance and so he was moving towards Kailash Dham with this very wish. The old lady told Baba that it was not easy to have a live appearance of Lord Shiva. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary. When Baba asked her what he should do,she told that Baba should stand {{in the foothills of the}} Kailash near Mansarovar and pray there. Mata Parwati used to come there on some occasions for bath. When Mata Parwati comes there he should pray her to fulfill her wish. Mata Parwati will surely try to give him something else but he should insist on his wish only. Baba Balak Nath stood for twelve gharis with the old lady and moved towards the Man Sarovar. He did the same as the old lady had advised him and finally Lord Shiva was pleased and blessed him to be Paramsidh in Kaliyug that he would remain as Balak (young) and age would not affect him. MahaKaul of Dwapar age got birth in Kaliyug at Kathiyawad in the house of Narayan Vishnu and Laxmi. Parent named him as [...] "Dev". Dev was very religious from his childhood and he used to pray all the times. His parents then tried to marry him so that he cannot leave the home. Dev was not ready for this. When he was so much under pressure for marriage he left home and moved towards Girnar Parwat in the search of Paramsiddhi. In Junagarh he met with Swami Dattatreya. Here at the ashram of Swami Dattatreya, he got divine knowledge and emerged as Sidh. As Lord Shiva had blessed him that age will not affect him he remained as a child and called [...] "Balak Nath".|$|E
