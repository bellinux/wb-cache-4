In {{most of the rest of}} sub-Saharan Africa, tenure private or communal ownership, access, laws and rights related to land are also much debated issues. Partly, this has historic reasons. Colonial rule also applying to land superposed local, often customary laws; in the post-independence era land was nationalised by various new governments to foster development, modernisation or re-distribution of resources. Since then, customary systems have been both denied as well as recognised and land has been both privatised as well as nationalised by post-independence governments. Evolving land rights, policy and tenure in Africa presents and discusses these issues and the ongoing land policy debates in various parts of the continent. It describes how different countries have approached this highly political and sensitive subject and explores possible future scenarios.

40|$|With almost {{three-quarters of}} the world s marine fish stocks {{thoroughly}} depleted, the question is very much alive. Not least in those ACP countries whose waters host rich shoals of fish. The islands of the Caribbean, and the Pacific and Indian Oceans, are highly vulnerable, as are African economies such as Mauritania, Namibia and Senegal. For Senegal, fisheries provide 15 % of employment, 30 % of exports, and 12 % {{of the gross domestic}} product. Some 60 % of landings are from artisanal fisheries. Overfishing is rife. Two in three fish consumed in Europe come from outside EU waters, often from ACP waters, usually through bilateral agreements which give access to 500 EU boats (20 % of the EU fleet). Mind you, not for nothing does the term IUU (Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported) feature in the jargon. Europe s capacity to fish and hence satisfy consumers and keep fishing communities intact exceeds by 40 % the capacity required to harvest fish sustainably. Do the sums, and <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> find that some very vested interests have to walk the plank. The dilemma is an ugly one, at least as ugly as some of the beasts now trawled up from the deep.

40|$|Ask a {{scientist}} about Hollywood, and <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> probably get eye rolls. But ask someone in Hollywood about science, and they ll see dollar signs: moviemakers know that science {{can be the}} source of great stories, with all the drama and action that blockbusters require. That s a huge mistake, says Randy Olson: Hollywood has a lot to teach scientists about how to tell a story and, ultimately, how to "do" science better. With "Houston, We Have a Narrative," he lays out a stunningly simple method for turning the dull into the dramatic. Drawing on his unique background, which saw him leave his job as a working scientist to launch a career as a filmmaker, Olson first diagnoses the problem: When scientists tell us about their work, they pile one moment and one detail atop another moment and another detail a stultifying procession of and, and, and. What we need instead is an understanding of the basic elements of story, the narrative structures that our brains are all but hardwired to look for which Olson boils down, brilliantly, to And, But, Therefore, or ABT. At a stroke, the ABT approach introduces momentum (And), conflict (But), and resolution (Therefore) the fundamental building blocks of story. As Olson has shown by leading countless workshops worldwide, when scientists eyes are opened to ABT, the effect is staggering: suddenly, they re not just talking about their work they re "telling stories" about it. And audiences are captivated. Written with an uncommon verve and enthusiasm, and built on principles that are applicable to fields far beyond science, "Houston, We Have a Narrative" has the power to transform the way science is understood and appreciated, and ultimately how it s done. ...|$|E

Barbados {{was just one of}} many nations with exhibits at this trade fair; as well as virtually the entire Caribbean, under the motto of seventeen nations, one destination. West African states, notably Nigeria, made their presence felt, celebrating Nigeria s strong historical ties with the Caribbean. Most of the several dozen exhibitors were small-scale food processing companies selling the spices, teas, sauces, relishes and rumcake for which the region is rightly famed, as well as horticultural producers. Paying {{a great deal of attention}} to presentation and packaging, the enterprises were clearly aiming at the quality markets of Europe, starting with the British Isles. Twenty-six were supported by the CTA and its sister organisation for small industry, the Brussels-based Centre for Development of Enterprise (CDE). Not a few made the point that the British market, with its very strong Caribbean diaspora market, is the soft underbelly of Europe, but it will take a lot more energy to make headway in the less familiar markets of continental Europe.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to diversify their {{agriculture}} and find niche markets to increase exports, several Pacific countries including Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu are betting on the cultivation of ginger (Zingiber officinale). The world s largest producers are India, Indonesia and China; the best quality of the annual world production of 250, 000 t {{is to be found}} in Jamaica. On Fiji, it is immature ginger that is most popular with both growers and processors. It is harvested in April and made into syrup for export. In 2001, 1, 700 t of immature ginger was harvested and sold at an average price of around 1 US$/kg. Mature ginger is harvested from July to September and despite high demand in local and export markets, its production dwindled from 500 t in the mid- 1990 s to a mere 180 t. One reason that farmers prefer immature ginger is that it is relatively free from pests and diseases. Mature ginger is subject to root rot caused by nematodes and bacteria. In Samoa, the ginger sector has targeted the organic market in New Zealand where it obtained an eco-label from the BIO-GRO certification body. Ginger was first grown in Samoa in the early 1980 s; exports started a decade later, and have steadily increased from a modest 3 tonnes in 1997 to an estimated 7 tonnes in 2001.

40|$|Don t worry, the {{headline}} is not another exhortation {{from on high}} to produce more. It is your own wish. Production of livestock, crops and vegetables are the subjects which our subscribers most want to read about, {{according to an analysis}} of the distribution of 66, 000 books ordered from CTA s Publications Distribution Service under the credit point scheme in 2002. Other top topics are information, training, marketing and organisation and management. These preferences confirm the responses to the Uses of Spore survey in 2002 which showed that more than one in four respondents wanted more coverage of livestock issues, and one in five more coverage of information and communication. The list (see table) of the Top 20 most ordered publications of which five from ACP publishers includes eight titles related to livestock, from beekeeping to animal breeding manuals. Top of the list is the manual Poultry, of which 960 copies were ordered, followed by Where there is no vet. Information and enterprise Another six titles relate to information skills, ranging from the specifics of Strengthening biometry (statistical analysis) to the broad overview of the Information revolutions taking place at community and national level throughout ACP countries; this group includes The ABC of book publishing and the Development of training materials. Of special note as the third most ordered book is the new guide to Setting up and running a small food business; its popularity has given new energy to the compilers of the series on food processing, of which this was the first to appear, in late 2001. Strong interest in sound agriculture practice is also clear: just creeping into the Top 20 is Producing food without pesticides, and the new survey of World markets for organic fruit and vegetables, published in mid- 2002, soon caught the interest of many subscribers. A similar picture exists in the parallel Top 20 French-language books, which is headed by L élevage de la volaille, the French edition of Poultry. There is a similar pattern of interests, but with some differences in titles: the popularity of a beekeeping book in English, for example, is matched by a book on duck rearing in French. Another common feature is the interest shown in series of publications. So many interests The Top 20 is, however, just the tip of a mass of titles for which there is a broad demand. If you ever wondered why the CTA Publications Catalogue is so thick, now you know. In all, orders were received for 650 of the approximately 680 titles on the CTA list, the difference due to some titles joining the list near the year s end, with the first orders coming in 2003. And, as in any shop, one or two items just did not get asked for. That idea of the shop holds true when it comes to special marketing efforts. When we draw attention in Spore to a new title, or to an old one whose sales are sagging, or do a special mailing to special interest groups you soon see the orders surge. But, once in the shop, people do like to have a good look around. Orders for the 20 favourite titles account for a quarter of the 36, 500 orders placed for English books, and a third of the 28, 500 orders for French titles. Most other orders were for the range of Portuguese-language titles in stock. Who wants to know? Two-thirds of all the publications ordered are intended for people who manage services or an enterprise (such as suppliers, traders and processors) and for communicators (such as extension and field workers). About a fifth are the hands-on, how-to manuals used by producer groups and their individual members. The remainder are publications for researchers and policy-makers on technical, political and socio-economic issues. This picture is the same for both French- and English-language titles, and reflects the composition of our subscribers list. Incidentally, this aspect of meeting needs is reflected by the fact that of the Top 20 titles, 18 English and 19 French are CTA s own publications or, predominantly, co-publications with another publisher. These are titles for which CTA identified a clear need from its constituency, and the demand has proved the Centre right. We shall not go into the detail of who is ordering which publications, because we all know that policy-makers keep chickens and farmers associations have an interest in following policy issues. If you re in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia or Nigeria, <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> be proud to know that your five countries often account for {{at least half of the}} orders for a title. There are, though, more than enough titles for every subscriber to get their fair share: in 2002, all subscribers together spent more than 1, 090, 000 credit points, but your kitty is not empty yet.

40|$|Alongside {{the many}} words of praise from {{respondents}} to the Uses of Spore Survey about CTA and Spore, some others asked about CTA activities and services. They {{wanted to know}} about seminars, training events, subscriptions and the credit points system and how they can join them. Some complained about the quality of CTA s services: publications not received; subscription requests denied; letters, sometimes a whole series, never answered. Spore held a Frequently-Asked-Questions session with CTA staff. Spore: How can people attend training sessions or seminars with CTA support? CTA: We sponsor the participation of ACP nationals in international and regional conferences, seminars and workshops relevant to their work in agricultural and rural development. In 2001, 189 individuals were supported. Detailed applications, preferably from event organisers, should reach CTA 6 months ahead. The Seminar Support Programme does not sponsor staff of international bodies, nor attendance at national meetings. CTA s training events are listed on its Website. Normally, candidates are nominated and selected by the regional organiser; applications to CTA are passed on to the organiser. Seminars which are (co-) organised by CTA are by invitation only. They too are listed on the CTA Website. Explain your subscription system Spore: Turning to the clients of your publications services, you use the word subscriber a lot. It s a bit confusing. CTA: For printed publications {{there are two types of}} subscribers. The full service subscription is to our Publications Distribution Service, known as PDS. A PDS subscriber (there are more than 30, 000) gets a copy of Spore, plus a number of credit points each year for ordering books and other materials from our Publications Catalogue. A Spore subscriber gets Spore, but no other services. Spore subscribers number about 3, 000. You have to apply to be a PDS or Spore subscriber and meet certain conditions. Spore: No other subscribers? CTA: Yes. You can subscribe to electronic services on the Internet, no questions asked; for example, to the Spore Email Ennouncement which summarises the latest edition and links to the CTA Website. That s very popular, with about 3, 000 subscribers. Or you can get the bi-monthly ICT Update about information and communication technologies in agriculture, or the quarterly Agritrade bulletin about agricultural trade negotiations. These two have about 1, 000 subscribers. The ICT Update is also available on demand in print. Spore: Who can subscribe to what? CTA: To be a PDS subscriber, you must be actively involved in agriculture and rural development in an ACP country. You should also be in a position, either as an individual or professionally, to share and pass on information. You must show this on your application form you can request one by mail, or get it from the CTA Website. We re strict about the criteria for PDS subscriptions because of the value of the publications we provide, the growing demand and our limited budget: two out of three applications get accepted. Basically, the more you do with the information (but you must show this, and not just say it), the more chance you have. We also encourage applications from women and people involved in small agricultural production and processing enterprises they are under-represented in our clientele. And, to be honest, we have had so many requests from some sectors in some countries that we introduced a queuing system, which we shall soon modify. To be just a Spore subscriber is easier. You must be based in either an ACP or an EU country and give details of your active involvement in agriculture and rural development. To remove any confusion between PDS and Spore applications, we are preparing a separate form for Spore. To subscribe to an electronic service, just follow the instructions given online. Who gets credit points? Spore: A lot of people want to know how to get credit points, or more of them. CTA: We give credit points only to PDS subscribers; the exact number given each year depends on your work and your information needs. The leader of a village co-op may get, for example, only 50 points, but this could buy perhaps 10 practical manuals. A researcher may get 100 points, because the two or three books s/he needs are much more expensive than manuals. We try to be fair to everyone and it seems to work in most cases. A few people, about 20 a year, present sound arguments for getting more points. When there are good reasons, such as moving to a more responsible or outreaching job, then we allocate more points. And we try to help everyone make the best selection: if you have wide responsibilities, we send you the Publications Catalogue and its supplements to choose from. Otherwise, we send special announcements about new publications which, as we all know, are always covered in Spore. By the way, credit points can be used only for ordering from this list, through CTA, and they cannot be transferred to another person. Spore: Why do most PDS subscribers get fewer points in their second and subsequent years? CTA: Simple! You get more in the first year to start off your collection. Later on, <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> have settled down and just be interested in new items and topping up the collection. Spore: But all this is only for people in ACP countries and, for Spore subscriptions, EU countries too. Why these limits? CTA: We operate under the Cotonou Agreement between ACP and EU countries, and we work for them. We know, of course, that our information is useful for people elsewhere, but they must buy our publications or a Spore subscription from our sales agent (see New commercial distributor on page 15). If you can use the World Wide Web, you can download all CTA s own publications, and all Spore issues since 1997, free, without geographical restrictions. And the complaints? Spore: Every information service gets complaints, and you perhaps fewer than many others, but what are you doing about yours? CTA: Some people do complain, it s true, and every complaint is one too many. Sometimes people want to know where their order is, or why they ve received only four out of five books ordered. Often, they are impatient since the mail can be very slow, or maybe they didn t notice our letter saying that some books are temporarily out of stock and will be sent later. Sometimes, books disappear en route. We can t use safer courier services, or replace books, because it would eat up a year s budget in a few weeks! So much is outside our control. Our goal is for an order to leave our distributor s warehouse within 10 days of receipt. Right now, the average turn-around is 6 days, not bad at all. We do have more serious delays with applications for subscriptions: in 2001, we had 3, 400 and our backlog is now 3 months. It s due mainly to staff shortage and the need to screen applications. Even at the best of times, there are less than five people working in PDS, including marketing and promotion. Even if distribution is done by outside companies, for us to deal with 33, 000 -plus subscriptions and orders for more than 81, 000 books in a year is quite an achievement. We hope we ll have a bit more breathing space soon. Maybe we ll even have time to draw up a Customer Service Charter, where all our service goals and procedures, including for complaints, will be there for all to see! Then there are occasional delays in getting Spore into the hands of subscribers. Earlier this year there was a crush of work, including some management changes and an unforeseen excess of work for the compilers, plus the Uses of Spore Survey which got more responses than expected; we regret these delays and hope that the delivery schedule will soon be back on course. Alongside the many words of praise from respondents to the Uses of Spore Survey about CTA and Spore, some others asked about CTA activities and services.

40|$|The smart market {{information}} service (MIS) combines market prices with the farmer s savvy. We {{look at some}} success stories which have made some farmers very happy indeed, but how long can it all last? We all have at least one, locked up in the cupboard of our memories. The Marketing Board. Remember it? It s not that long ago {{that they were being}} wound up, as part of the text-book practices and prescriptions of those fresh-faced visitors from somewhere out in outer space known as Structural Adjustment. How many shed a tear when their board folded? Did you? Not that the Marketing Boards were really theirs, for they did not belong in reality to the individual farmer or trader. No, it was more the other way around, or at least seemed to be, if the truth be told. Normally the boards for all sorts of commodities - were statal bodies, some with private participation at the beginning, and many of them being gradually, or abruptly, privatised as their numbers were being written ever more clearly on the wall. 'At least you knew where you were with the board, though' is a common refrain to be heard in any discussion of a group of farmers when the talk turns to nostalgia. In an way of life that must seem alien to people below the age of twenty, {{they were part of the}} cradle to grave philosophy of an overbearing top-down economic approach. The board provided the farmer with seeds and tools, set production quotas, fixed prices, made loans, paid out fixed earnings, provided training and extension services and settled scores. Not only did the farmer know where he stood (the board tended to deal more with men than women farmers), but so did traders, processors and the Minister of Finance, who were assured in advance of prices and revenues. At times, it seemed that the only uncertainty was the weather, since even the most powerful board could not regulate that, though some may have wanted to do so. Bye bye board, hallo market And then, one day, the marketing boards were gone, and the market place stood unfamiliarly empty. Producers literally scurried for cover, like beetles from an overturned stone, uncertain of where, and on what terms, to buy their inputs and sell their outputs. Traders, more flush with cash and confidence than most farmers, were able to dictate prices for a while. Gradually, market services were developed and put in place, often by enterprising former officers of the defunct boards or civil servants. In so doing they demonstrated yet again that wherever there is some sure supply and some tangible demand there is a market. And a market for {{market information}} services there surely was. It is a new way of organising what has to be one of the oldest professions in the world the middleman (or woman), the broker. Whether we are looking at the trade routes along the coast of West Africa, dominated for thousands of years by brokers from Benin and Phoenicia (Lebanon in today s terms), or the inroads made in the Horn of Africa all the way to the Great Lakes by traders from Oman and Gujarat, long before the first fresh-faced wave of European colonialism, or at the cattle and meat commodities markets in Brazil and the mid-West of America, <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> always find one on the first boat or bus in. For many producers, processors and purchasers on the ACP food chain, the last two decades have seen more changes to their use of markets and market information than just the loss of stable prices and certain supplies. The dropping of tariff barriers and duties, and the overall liberalisation of trade has led to increased competition from producers elsewhere in the world. In essence, to be able to compete fairly is a fairer system, but such was the effect of the ingrained protection of marketing boards that their removal has led to squeals of unfair and unjust. In a very real sense, the emergence of MIS has helped to lessen the pain. The rude awakening has led to the need for greater market alertness, and dealing with the associated practices of just-in-time delivery, and out-sourcing of products and services. With global, literally planet-wide, ordering networks and delivery chains now in place, it is possible for even a small and previously isolated ACP producer, or group of producers, to hook into distant markets. But you have to know how. To maximise these opportunities, a smart producer will also want to follow trends in hitherto unknown markets. It is no longer enough to know the dead certainties : for a Kenyan fruit grower to know that the British have a massive surge in strawberry consumption during the June weeks of tennis at Wimbledon, or the Zimbabwean horticulturist to know that the annual peak of all flower purchases in Austria is in the week in September that secondary school examination results are announced. These dates are known years in advance. More than that, a smart mango producer in, say, Mali, may want to know not only what fruits are in fashion in Europe this year, but what produce is being prepared for promotion next year? What are the Brazilians up to? A women s jam making cooperative in Grenada may want to know what the projected volumes of tourist arrivals are for the coming season not only in their own country but in neighbouring countries too. Is UNIDO helping a British supermarket owner set up a large jam factory that could spell doom for them? Any level, any produce, but not any price The task of an MIS is, therefore, much more than simply to provide price information to producers, and offers of supply to purchasers. As MISs establish themselves in most ACP countries, the first challenge is to define the scope of its coverage, in manageable amounts and periods. Scoring on the market place means exploiting your comparative advantage as a supplier, or being better informed than any other potential purchaser. An MIS can operate at any level, handle any type of produce or inputs, deal with any volumes; the more complex the demands of the trading parties, the greater the complexity of the system. The tendency is therefore to computerise, and to link up a local MIS with similar MISs in other localities, and with national and international networks. This can place an MIS under technical stress. The converse can be true too, with highly capitalised MISs following the sadly repeated path of many development projects of being excessively ambitious, over-manned, over-financed and under-used. Several services in the Caribbean and West Africa run the risk of being coffee-table exercises, of no use to farmers or to traders in the market place. Yet again, with a more measured and modulated approach to project design, some basic market research and an understanding of local conditions, many efforts could be much better focussed. Who pays in the end? The prime challenge to establishing and keeping an effective and sustainable MIS is not in getting the technical mix right: it is in achieving financial viability. This is going to have to rely largely on generating income from its users, along the age-old lines of the market place. In some MISs, such as that operated by KACE in Kenya, the standard fee for brokering a transaction is 2 % of the agreed sale price. With that sort of fee, there is obviously going to be a temptation for MIS operators to live from being a trading enterprise itself, or from sub-letting its facilities for other uses, or offering technical services. Fair enough, if it can be managed, but the clear risk is that the attention paid to necessary information will wane, and the quality of service to the stakeholder farmer will worsen. Income from users, as with any network at a given stage of its development, depends on their satisfaction and continued loyalty. In that sense, the idea of providing value-adding services to price information is a sensible way to build up user loyalty, and thus turnover. The problem arises when users are savvy enough to do their own deals directly, without any broker service. When the MIS has no more tricks or special information up its sleeve, it will wither and die. That was not the point of all the investment made in these services. The next step, then, is to help MIS operators to adapt themselves to the changing market place and to stay one step ahead of the competition. Which is where they came in.

40|$|Agriculture is {{climbing}} back {{on to the}} world s major agenda, after a sad, bad absence. Some even ask, did it fall, or was it pushed? This time, {{we are here to}} stay. In the endless bustle of the streets around the central post office in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the vendors will sell you anything, and everything even the latest copy of Spore. Walk around, and amidst the cacophony of colours and noise you will notice Spore s familiar cover, in the kiosks and on the arms of those high-pressure salesmen-cum-street-children. Our correspondent says the going price downtown is up to 2 dollars a copy but he has a tip: go to the student area, <b>you</b> <b>ll</b> pay no more than a dollar or its equivalent. Until he arranged a mail subscription early in 2002, he bought a copy for the NGO information centre he works with, where it is used by more than 200 readers (10 times more than the average copy with only an estimated 20 -odd readers). This tell-tale sign of market forces at work is a tiny reflection of the supply-and-demand economics of the media. Demand for Spore has built up steadily since it was launched 100 issues ago in 1985, or our Portuguese edition Esporo 50 issues ago. Officially, the magazine is sent only to registered or paying subscribers, and is not available for sale in kiosks and shops. But these are merely the rules of the publisher and its funders; in reality, the market place has discovered that other people will pay for Spore. Whether that is right, we shall leave to others to debate and decide. If Spore s amazing readership of one million is typical of the demand for agricultural information in popular scientific language, why is it, some may ask, that agriculture is not daily headline news in local, national and international media? The simple answer is that we are dealing with two worlds. One is the local, rural world, with its own pace and priorities, in which there are many undervalued initiatives in communication as recorded in the book Information Revolutions (see end of article). The other is a world where tastes are dictated by urban preferences, where the thoughts of policy makers and media operators are strongly defined by the horizons of the city. In the words of the song, we all belong to one world, but live in different ones. The strength and quality of the link between these two worlds depends on their mutual awareness and understanding. This in turn requires well-managed and, especially, well-communicated information. In short, the media have a crucial role to play. Back to the limelight As the world becomes more urban, every rural person becomes more important. The Gibson Institute for Land, Food and Environment, an international think-tank based in Northern Ireland, explains this paradox thus: 'By the year 2005, {{for the first time in}} global history, the majority of the world s population will be classified as urban. (Already, an average of 40 % of an ACP country s people live in urban areas.) Rural issues will become ever more important. That moment will mark a historic watershed in the complex relationship between rural and urban. It will also call for renewed and radical attention on how these two sectors separate and interact. ' The agricultural sector in any economy, and especially ACP agriculture, in all its complex entirety, has to fight its corner with many competitors. And in a corner it seems to be. In the past few years, few meetings of agricultural practitioners or policy makers have gone by without the remark 'we need to get agriculture back on to the agenda'. It does not matter who you are. Take your pick: you are the leader of a farmer s organisation struggling to get attention for the pain of fatally low commodity prices. Or a trader whose market has been washed away by the effect of Europe s and America s moronic subsidies on agricultural exports. Or a research director fuming at the priorities given by donors to non-agricultural issues. Or a farmer with a sack full of perishable produce who has missed the bus to market because it was commandeered for the funeral of some AIDS victims. Or a Minister for Agriculture emerging bruised, almost literally, from a Cabinet meeting where health, education and defence budgets were hiked at the expense of your own. Whoever you are, and whomever you know who has been there, we have all been scrambling for ways to get our sector back on to the agenda and into the headlines. This has been driven by our belief that there is something fundamental about agriculture. How can a person, a culture, a civilisation grow and feed its mind and its body without food? How can agriculture win attention, and keep it? The signs are that the return to the top agenda is happening. In May 2002, Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, heaved agriculture fairly and squarely back up on to the top agenda of the UN s World Summit on Sustainable Development, alongside health, water and environment. At the Summit, being held in August in South Africa, there will be sessions on Agriculture and the Media. There, practitioners will develop action plans to ensure that agricultural and rural issues are properly covered in the media, and thus command the respect of policy makers, stakeholders and external partners. A for Agriculture For the media ranging from daily newspapers, through national and international television, to Internet magazines to cover agriculture, we have to make sure that the sector is visible, understood, credible and capable of feeding them. For starters, as long as news agencies, Internet sites and other media suppliers classify the sector as some sort of subset of environmental affairs, or science and technology, or economics, we shall never get noticed. Editors please note: just use the A-word. Second, media professionals need to explain why the sector is crucial to food security, environmental management, employment and income generation. Third, they must follow the highest possible journalistic standards: seeking out stories rather than copying press releases; checking stories and then double-checking them; and, even though this is sacrilegious to some in the profession, refusing payment for articles and not demanding incentives such as petrol money and per diems before even talking about covering a story. The crucial point is to ensure high quality of the message. In recent years, much has been invested in helping stakeholders in the agricultural sector to enhance the form of their message. This has ranged from improving skills in public speaking, through design of Web pages, to preparing press releases for journalists. The schools of journalism which have now taken root in Kingston, Suva, Dakar, Nairobi, Maputo, Johannesburg and many more cities have played their role too, even though not always with an adequate eye on agriculture. All well and good. The long haul to successful information impact does not lie, though, in prettying up flimsy messages, however true it may be that a fine orator (which few of us are) can convey a bad message better than a bad orator a good one. It lies in painstaking effort to achieve the optimal quality of the story, for a fine media person will always pick out the fakes and the institutional drone, and choose for the most reliable and newsworthy one. One convincing way to convey the importance of the agricultural sector is to demonstrate its liveliness as well as its livelihoods. The new Spore poster, celebrating 100 issues of the magazine, carries 100 mentions of readers lives and Spore s place therein. We hope that in celebrating the rich diversity and buzz of our readership we have helped to highlight the confidence of the sector, and encouraged our colleagues in the media beyond agriculture to do the same.
