5|$|Although several {{survivors}} {{claimed to}} have seen a submarine sail with <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> insignia, a Navy inquiry attributed the sinking to a boiler explosion. The Navy reversed its findings in 2001 {{to acknowledge that the}} sinking was due to hostile fire and awarded Purple Hearts to the survivors and next-of-kin of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 {{the route}} was {{converted}} to double-deck operation using new Leyland Olympians painted {{in a unique}} white and blue livery with Timesaver branding. Four Leyland Tiger coaches in a <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> livery also using the Timesaver name, arrived a year later. The route branding was replaced by Stagecoach's corporate image of white with red, orange and blue stripes following their takeover of Ribble Motor Services in 1989.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated that to be the case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E
5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a bicolour square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly.|$|E
5|$|In home matches, the team's outfield players {{traditionally}} {{wear the}} colours of the Belgian flag: black, <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> Red dominates the strip {{and is often}} the sole jersey colour. The away colours are usually white, black or both; in 2014, the squad introduced a third, yellow kit. Their shirts are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins. Since 1981, the RBFA emblem has been the national team's badge; the previous badge was a yellow lion on a black shield, similar to the escutcheon of the national coat of arms.|$|E

5|$|Firehawk {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains. There are six cars with four seats in each row {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. There were three trains during the ride's first year at Geauga Lake, however only two have been used since. The third train became a parts donor for the first two. Originally, riders reclined on the lift hill – rather than in the station – and returned to an upright position prior to re-entering the station. However, this was changed to occur in the station due to problems that arose during the ride's first season. The trains feature the Firehawk logo on the front colored <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> Previously at Geauga Lake, the X-Flight logo was colored lime green and dark blue.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes to bathe in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} that the Rockets would unveil their classic <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> logo and {{accompanying}} uniforms used {{until the end of}} the 1994–95 season. Winter left soon after, being fired in January 1973 following a ten-game losing streak, and was replaced by Johnny Egan. Egan led the Rockets back to the playoffs in 1975, where the franchise also managed to win their first round against the New York Knicks, subsequently losing to the veteran Boston Celtics in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, selling out several home games during the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then selling out all of their home playoff games.|$|E

5|$|Since the 2013–14 season, Partick Thistle's kits {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by Joma Sports. During the 2014–15 season, Partick Thistle supported the Breast Cancer Care Charity by {{wearing a black}} and pink away shirt, with the charity ribbon on the shirt. The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care. Partick Thistle's current home kit features a <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> shirt, the sleeves are yellow with a predominanty red foreground. The kit features black shorts, red socks, with a yellow trim. The away kit is white, with a yellow collar and sleeve trim on the jersey. Goalkeepers wear a generic kit design from Joma, and are either pink or grey.|$|E
5|$|Today, many flags used in Poland {{are based}} on the design of the {{national}} flag. This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other uniformed services, such as the naval ensign – a swallow-tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe. Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag. Examples include the former flag of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the voivodeship – or the flag of the Lesser Poland Voivodeship – a horizontal tricolor of white, <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red</b> with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two.|$|E
5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between <b>yellow</b> <b>and</b> <b>red.</b> Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E
