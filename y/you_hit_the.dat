500|$|King told D. X. Ferris that [...] "whenever 'Raining Blood' {{comes in}} the set, it just electrifies the whole crowd. People just shit when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> first few notes. Like 'Jesus Christ it's a guitar, settle down.'" [...] In the past, Slayer used fake blood to cover their bodies when {{performing}} the song live. However, when asked about using fake blood in future performances, King remarked [...] "It's time to move on, but never say never. I know Japan never saw it, South America and Australia never saw it. So you never know." ...|$|E
500|$|Hanneman and King's dual guitar solos {{have been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "wildly chaotic," [...] and [...] "twisted genius." [...] Original drummer Lombardo would use two bass drums (instead of a double pedal, which is used on a single bass drum). Lombardo's speed and aggression earned him the title of the [...] "godfather of double bass" [...] by Drummerworld. Lombardo stated his reasons for using two bass drums: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> bass drum, the head is still resonating. When you hit it in the same place right after that, you kinda get a 'slapback' from the bass drum head hitting the other pedal. You're not letting them breathe." [...] When playing the two bass drums, Lombardo would use the [...] "heel-up" [...] technique.|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. <b>You</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> wrong part of him, my friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was not a small thing." [...] He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him.|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. It received {{a score of}} 91.96% on GameRankings and 91/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the [...] "fantastic soundtrack" [...] and [...] "great peripheral", further commenting that mini-Gibson SG controller [...] "is what makes Guitar Hero, rather than what breaks it". GameSpot echoed these sentiments, stating Guitar Hero had a [...] "great guitar controller" [...] and [...] "killer soundtrack" [...] and was possibly the [...] "best rhythm game ever made". Many reviews praised the game's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song. Play said the game [...] "gives bedroom air guitarists {{a chance to live}} out their rock 'n' roll fantasies". GameSpys review commented on the length of the songs, in that [...] "once <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> three minute mark or so, things start to feel 'too long'". Eurogamer said, [...] "the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may detract from the package from an importer's perspective" [...] and [...] "it would have been truly amazing with a better track list".|$|E
500|$|As {{stated by}} Scott Shetler of AOL Radio and Matthew Horton of BBC, the song {{features}} an aggressive tone, and dizzying percussion and electro elements create a [...] "frenzied pace that Hilson matches with an intense vocal delivery." [...] During {{the bridge and}} the chorus, she utters gasps and groans, like 'oohs and aahs' while singing the lyrics. As the first verse begins, Hilson sings: [...] "Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / You know how I like it Daddy when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> spot / Ooh ahh, baby don't stop / Imma take control when I climb up on top". As the song progresses, Hilson sings that she is [...] "so good, I'll make you think the bed is my workplace [...] Yeah, it's me, that's where you wanna be / I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] just before Ross's verse begins, seemingly summing up the image Hilson is going for: [...] "She looks like an angel, but she's sexy as hell." [...] As a whole, the lyrical arrangements are about sexual desire and not holding back.|$|E
2500|$|Motion capture {{was used}} to capture the {{character}} animations in the game. LucasFilm partner Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) generated the animation. The size of each character presented issues during development and developers had {{to find ways to}} adjust the moves, based on the opponent. For example: Chewbacca will throw lower punches when fighting Princess Leia. Each character averaged around 1,200 polygons, roughly twice the count of similar fighting games. In developing the button combo system the staff wanted buttons to have context with the character's movements. [...] "We want to make it so that when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> left button, you really hit with your left arm combo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Theodore Modis says [...] "nothing {{in nature}} follows a pure exponential" [...] and {{suggests}} the logistic function {{is a better}} fit for [...] "a real growth process". The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] {{is the time when}} the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when <b>you</b> <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring is only going to increase by a factor of 100 more.|$|E
2500|$|Without the {{guidance}} and songwriting that Bacharach/David had provided, Warwick's career stalled in the 1970s. There were no big hits during the decade, aside from 1974's [...] "Then Came You", recorded as {{a duet with}} the Spinners and produced by Thom Bell. Bell later noted, [...] "Dionne made a (strange) face when we finished [...] She didn't like it much, but I knew we had something. [...] So we ripped a dollar in two, signed each half and exchanged them. I told her, 'If it doesn't go number one, I'll send you my half.' [...] When it took off, Dionne sent hers back. There was an apology on it." [...] It was her first U.S. #1 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Other than this success, Warwick's five years on Warner Bros. Records produced no other major hits. Two notable songs recorded during this period were [...] "His House and Me" [...] and [...] "Once <b>You</b> <b>Hit</b> <b>The</b> Road" [...] (#79 pop, #5 R, #22 Adult Contemporary), {{both of which were}} produced in 1975 by Thom Bell.|$|E
