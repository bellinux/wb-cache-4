6000|$|... "It does {{very well}} on a diagram," [...] said the Other Professor. [...] "I could show it <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> only the chalk's a little blunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will show}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Mr. Cashaw, I'll trouble you to {{exchange}} hats, coats and collars with me," [...] the detective continued, {{turning to the}} old man.|$|E
30|$|T: Open {{the links}} {{one by one}} and see the examples. Take your time. I’ll get to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|MARTHA--[Going {{toward the}} study.] I'll be with <b>you</b> again <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> I hope. [She {{goes in and}} shuts the door behind her.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "His Majesty {{will see}} <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> Baron," [...] he said, {{when he came}} out. [...] "The Duc d'Orleans is with him, but, hearing your name {{announced}} for a private audience, he is taking his leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Tom," [...] was {{the younger}} brother's reply. [...] "You go on ahead, I {{want to say}} just a few words more to Waltham." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] {{interposed}} Boxer. [...] "Those {{guards are}} wide awake and will shoot <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Wait till it gets darker--we {{may get a}} chance to do something then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll tell <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Mine {{came on the}} day of the Guthries' hop. I {{was down}} at Brighton that morning. What date? Let me think; why, the 9th, I'm certain. To-day's what, mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here am I, Mister,' said a {{voice from}} one of the ladders, which a pair of clumsy feet descended briskly. 'It's all done now. Clear away, gals. Everything shall be ready for <b>you</b> <b>in</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Mister.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing," [...] she said, {{making a}} {{flip-flop}} into the thistles and dancing among them without feeling their sharp points. [...] "I could tell <b>you</b> <b>in</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{how to get}} over the thistles if I wanted to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The last word, as usual," [...] she sighed. [...] "Now, if {{you good}} people will kindly go on downstairs, I will join <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> Mr. Tavernake is my man of {{business}} and I am sure he {{has something to say}} to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Shandon {{looked up}} from his work. [...] "How do you do, Mr. Warrington," [...] he said. [...] "I'll speak to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Please sit down, gentlemen, if you can find places," [...] and away went the pen again.|$|E
6000|$|Pan said: [...] "Blink, I'll fool <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute...</b> Hold {{him down}} now. Step on his nose." [...] Pulling the right stirrup {{out from under}} the horse Pan drew the cinch a couple of holes tighter, and then straddled him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be with <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Massan.--Then, Frank, we'll {{expect an}} account of your journey to-night. Eda is very anxious {{that we should be}} told all about your {{wonderful}} adventures in the mountains. Meanwhile I shall be off to look after the men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No apology is necessary, my dear," [...] he said. [...] "This lady {{is with me}} on {{a matter}} of business. You will find your singing-master waiting for you upstairs. Begin your lesson; and I will join <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> Au revoir, my charming pupil--au revoir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Steady!" [...] he said, {{slipping}} his {{arm through}} Brooke's. [...] "Come in here. Now, keep {{back from the}} stove. I'll get you something that will fix <b>you</b> up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> <b>You</b> came <b>in</b> from the Dayspring--over the divide? I heard the freighter telling the boys it couldn't be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Breakfast," [...] said Rupert, firmly. [...] "If {{you don't}} {{know what it}} is, I can teach <b>you</b> <b>in</b> half <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> <b>You</b> play it with a pot of coffee, a knife and fork, and about a hundred-weight of {{scrambled}} eggs. Try it. It's a pastime that grows on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} known <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> if I hadn't been asleep when the girls squalled. You did it well, though, and I advise you not to try it again in a hurry, or you'll get shot," [...] said Eph, as they parted, he rather crestfallen and Gad in high glee.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It HAS been a {{depressing}} day,' said Mrs Brangwen sympathetically. At {{that moment the}} voices of the children were heard calling from upstairs: 'Mother! Mother!' She lifted her face and answered mildly into the distance: 'I shall come up to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Doysie.' Then to Birkin: 'There is nothing fresh at Shortlands, I suppose? Ah,' she sighed, 'no, poor things, I should think not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{lost the}} fight a-purpose," [...] ses the landlord, whispering. [...] "Miss Tucker {{found out that}} you wasn’t a prize-fighter—leastways, I did for ’er—and she told Bill that, if ’e loved ’er so much that he’d ’ave ’is sinful pride took down by letting you beat ’im, she’d think diff’rent of ’im. Why, ’e could ’ave settled <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> if he’d liked. He was on’y playing with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] James said, as, {{descending}} to the kitchen, he beckoned Mrs. Holl {{to follow}} him; [...] "but the Captain says {{you are to}} cut it short; so if you wants an answer you had best put your question, whatever it is, short and to the point, or he will snap <b>you</b> up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> I can tell you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Situation:"Mary, I'm {{going to}} be sending Mrs. Porter over to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> for repair of her {{fractured}} ankle. I {{want you to know}} what's going on with her. I'm concerned about her emotional status. I've also alerted Dr Anesthesiologist and Dr Surgeon about my concern, but they have agreed {{to go ahead with the}} surgery because she needs this procedure to salvage her foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|She turned quickly, {{and with}} a shy, teary smile thrust her hand toward him. [...] "All right. Let's forget it." [...] Then as he hungrily, impulsively sought to draw her nearer, she laughingly pushed him away. [...] "I don't mean--so much as you think." [...] But the light of {{forgiveness}} and something sweeter was in {{her face as she}} added: [...] "Won't <b>you</b> come <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and see mother and father--and Uncle Dan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{lost the}} fight a-purpose," [...] ses the landlord, whispering. [...] "Miss Tucker {{found out that}} you wasn't a prize-fighter--leastways, I did for 'er--and she told Bill that, if 'e loved 'er so much that he'd 'ave 'is sinful pride took down by letting you beat 'im, she'd think diff'rent of 'im. Why, 'e could 'ave settled <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> if he'd liked. He was on'y playing with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Can I prove it? Can any {{one else}} prove it?" [...] he said jovially. [...] "Prove with what? What do I want to prove? There isn't a single {{corner in the}} world, barring England, perhaps, where you could not find some man, or more likely woman, that would {{remember}} me for Harry Hagberd. I am more like Harry Hagberd than any man alive; and I can prove it to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> if you will let me step inside your gate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a rotten}} place," [...] said {{the young woman}} without hesitation. [...] "Regular old cat--always interfering. Accused me of {{tampering}} with her letters. Me! The flap was half undone anyway. There's never anything in the waste-paper basket--she burns everything. She's a wrong 'un, that's what she is. Swell clothes, but no class. Cook knows something about her--but she won't tell--scared to death of her. And suspicious! She's on to <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> if {{you as much as}} speak to a fellow. I can tell you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, thank heaven!" [...] His face became radiant. [...] "The Prime Minister is lunching with me. May he {{share your}} hopes? He has nerves of steel, and yet I {{know that he}} has hardly slept since this terrible event. Jacobs, will you ask the Prime Minister to come up? As to you, dear, I fear that {{this is a matter of}} politics. We will join <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> <b>in</b> the dining-room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind your}} hunger," [...] {{interrupted}} the Prince. [...] "I shall order <b>you</b> destroyed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> so <b>you</b> {{will have no}} need to ruin our pretty melon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you help}} me to wait," [...] she said. [...] "However," [...] she went on, [...] "I've really {{something}} for you {{that will help you}} to wait and which <b>you</b> shall have <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Only there's something more I want from you first. I revel in Sarah." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Name doesn't matter," [...] said Keogh, largely; [...] "it's {{the frame}} and the {{varieties}} of paint that does the trick. Now, I can tell <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> what I want. I've come on a little voyage of two thousand miles to take you in with me on a scheme. I thought of {{you as soon as}} the scheme showed itself to me. How {{would you like to go}} back with me and paint a picture? Ninety days for the trip, and five thousand dollars for the job." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stuff and nonsense!" [...] Captain Bayley said. [...] "You had a wash-up when we breakfasted, {{and what}} do you want more? There, go up and see the girl at once, Harry and I will join <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two; {{according}} to my experience, these sort of meetings are always better without the presence of a third party," [...] and the old officer winked at his grandson as Frank sprang up the stairs after the waiter whom Captain Bayley directed to show him to Miss Hardy's sitting-room.|$|E
60|$|If she {{perceived}} you at last, and {{you were}} at a distance, it is very probable {{that she and her}} young ones, if they were big enough, would all scramble out of sight in a very short time, for the black bears are very shy of man if circumstances will permit them to get away before he approaches too near to them. But if you are so near as to make the old bear-mother fearful for the safety of her children, you will find that she will face <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and if you are not well {{able to take care of}} yourself, you will wish you had never seen a bear.|$|E
60|$|BENNET [he is {{piling up}} the breakfast things]. Keziah {{requested}} me to apologise {{to you for}} not having heard your bell this morning. She {{will be ready to}} wait upon <b>you</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very few <b>minutes.</b> [To the Doctor] You will find shaving materials, doctor, on your dressing- table.|$|R
60|$|What their effectual {{means of}} {{enforcing}} demands on women of high rank and condition are I shall show <b>you,</b> Sir, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes,</b> when I represent to you another of these plots and rebellions, which always in India, though so rarely anywhere else, are {{the offspring of}} an easy condition and hoarded riches.|$|R
6000|$|... "'This {{is a very}} unassuming lunch,' she said, when we were at last {{seated at}} the table, 'but I am {{going to give you}} a nice dinner. If you want more than three eggs I will cook <b>you</b> some <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> I put another stick of wood in the fire so as to keep the water hot.' ...|$|R
