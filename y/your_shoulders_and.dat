25|$|The Bigfoot {{researchers}} {{say that no}} human can walk that way in the film. Oh, yes they can! When you're wearing long clown's feet, you can't place the ball of your foot down first. You have to put your foot down flat. Otherwise, you'll stumble. Another thing, when {{you put on the}} gorilla head, you can only turn your head maybe a quarter of the way. And to look behind you, you've got to turn your head and <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> your hips. Plus, the shoulder pads in the suit are {{in the way of the}} jaw. That's why the Bigfoot turns and looks the way he does in the film. He has to twist his entire upper body.|$|E
500|$|Doby {{was elected}} into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3, 1998, by the Veterans Committee {{at the age}} of 74. [...] "This is just a {{tremendous}} feeling. It's kind of like a bale of cotton has been on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> now it's off", said Doby. When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, [...] "You have {{to be some kind of}} special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not too sure there's a player in the game today who could handle it." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he has always washed his own clothes, calling it [...] "the best {{exercise}} for <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> fingers", when pointing out that spin bowling requires suppleness of limbs.|$|E
50|$|Move <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> up <b>and</b> down...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{the only}} man in Sunwich who wishes that," [...] said Miss Nugent, complacently, [...] "and I don't believe you mean it. If you'll come a little closer I'll put my head on <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> convert you." ...|$|R
50|$|Single Knee to chest. Lie on {{your back}} with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Slowly pull your right knee toward <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> hold 5 to 10 seconds. Lower the knee and repeat with the other knee.|$|R
2500|$|However, as Freud {{put it to}} the {{imagined}} auditors of his New Introductory Lectures (1932), [...] "You may perhaps shrug <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> say: [...] "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" [...] But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?" [...] He then went on to add that [...] "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking {{the fact that there is}} life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Hogan advocates {{the use of}} a waggle {{not only}} because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to {{remember}} where to go for the first part of your backswing. The angle of the swing should feel like you are swinging under a slanting plane of glass. [...] The [...] "glass" [...] has a hole for your head while it rests on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> touches the ground on top of your ball. Also, the backswing should be slightly steeper than the downswing. [...] At the top of your backswing, your back should be facing the target.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will get}} some grease, se√±or, from Maria, and then I will rub <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> arms; that will do you {{a great deal of}} good." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke laughed curiously. [...] "You {{would still}} have ridden beside me through many a long night march, with the moon shining round <b>and</b> full behind <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> I should have felt the white dress brush me softly where the trail was dark." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ah, it's a great responsibility--particularly {{with that}} old cat Amoore {{looking at the}} lists over <b>your</b> <b>shoulder.</b> <b>And</b> such a {{shocking}} thing happened last summer! Poor crazy Cissie, my Nurse that I was telling you of, she took three solid silver tablespoons.' ...|$|R
50|$|Billy Bishop, the top Canadian ace of World War I, {{described}} a break:Watching carefully over <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> judging {{the moment he}} will open fire, you turn your machine quickly so as to fly {{at right angles to}} him. His bullets will generally pass behind you during the maneuver.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's an idea. Roger, you've got a level head on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> we can't do {{any better}} than follow your advice," [...] {{returned}} my uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Whitewing, since ye ask, I {{would advise}} you to follow yer own devices. You've got a good head on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> know what's best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good for you, dad! You've {{got a long}} head on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>And</b> {{when are}} you going to let Dick Rover know he is in our power?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are not in}} your hammock, Dick; {{you have}} been wounded, and we are both prisoners {{in the hands of}} these Malays. Try and pull {{yourself}} together, but don't move; they have put a sort of bandage round <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> I am going to try and improve it." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{aspect of the}} temple is the two spherical rocks about one foot in diameter. The fun part is to lift these rocks on <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> head and then throw them to the ground. It is {{believed}} that only a pious-hearted person can only lift up these rocks.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's only a recollection. My {{father was}} alive then. I {{was at first}} home-sick and frightened in the strange place, among the big girls. You used to let me hide my face on <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> tell me stories. May I hide in the old way and tell my story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said; [...] "that {{will prevent}} any {{possibility}} of the thing slipping up over <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> will {{take a lot of}} the strain off your chest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "McChesney," [...] said he, [...] "when I {{give the}} word, take Davy and his drum on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> follow me. And Davy, {{do you think}} you can sing that song you gave us the other night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{spoke as}} broadly," [...] complained the minister, {{somewhat}} {{taken aback by}} this apparition, [...] "as any woman in Thrums, and now you fling a cloak over <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> immediately become a fine lady. Who are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|COSMO. 'If {{you like}} I'll show {{you with a}} cushion. You see this'--scoops it up--'is wrong; but this'--he does a little sleight of hand--'is right. Another way is this, with their head hanging over <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> you holding on firmly to their legs. You wouldn't think it was comfortable, but they like it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When {{we let you}} out you'll have a clear path. Run, but {{not very}} fast. Save your speed. Tell the Colonel to empty a keg of powder in a table cloth. Throw it over <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> start back. Run like you was racin' with me, and keep on comin' {{if you do get}} hit. Now go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas, no," [...] {{agreed the}} maid. [...] "But you've got a lovely fox head on <b>your</b> skinny <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> that's {{almost as good}} as being a fox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you call}} that {{practically}} the same! No, I am the one {{that will have to}} do the refusing now, and it is all off <b>your</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>And</b> you knew I was not feeling very well, either! Basil, how could you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Give me leave, sir," [...] said Riach; [...] "you've a good head upon <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> a good Scotch {{tongue to}} ask with; but I {{will leave you}} no manner of excuse; I want that boy taken out of this hole {{and put in the}} forecastle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Corrie, if {{you were}} a giant it would be much easier to go {{to the other side of}} the island, wring off the heads of all the pirates, and, {{carrying}} me on <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> Alice and Poopy in your coat-pockets, get safely aboard of the Foam, and ho! for Sandy Cove." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{yourself}} off, sir," [...] Cyril said. [...] "One of your brave companions {{has long}} ago bolted; {{the other is}} disarmed, and has his head broken. You may thank your stars that you have escaped with nothing worse than a sword-thrust through <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> a sound drubbing. Hanging would be a fit punishment for knaves like you. I warn you, if you ever address or in any way molest this lady again, you won't get off so easily." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Bend {{your left}} ear down towards <b>your</b> left <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> then <b>your</b> right ear down towards your right shoulder" [...] {{to test for}} pain free {{cervical}} spine lateral flexion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, buy {{the cooking}} pan first and sling it across <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> then as we wander about {{we can look}} in the shops and it will seem {{as if we were}} on the search for {{articles}} that we had been told to purchase; it would be better than sauntering about without any apparent object. But first let us walk briskly towards the side of the town facing the citadel. The Strada Vecchia is the one that I want to examine first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, with <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> long {{reach and}} activity, {{you ought to}} be {{something}} out of the way if you take pains, Mark. You see, I am barely five feet ten, and am something like two stone lighter than you are. I suppose you are not much under twelve stone and a half." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, Marie," [...] said St. Clare, [...] "your golden {{days are}} dawning. Here is our practical, business-like New England cousin, {{who will take}} the whole budget of cares off <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> give you time to refresh yourself, and grow young and handsome. The {{ceremony}} of delivering the keys had better come off forthwith." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now, Jones,' Mr. Earnshaw said, 'it's your turn. Put {{that light}} line over <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> {{when you get}} to the top haul on it till you get up the rope ladder, and fasten that to a stout trunk and give a low hail. We will hold the rope as steady as we can below while you mount.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, {{with your}} {{tramping}} sinewy legs, [...] With <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> young <b>and</b> strong, with your knapsacks and your muskets; [...] How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{his wife}} a black-haired woman, with a pretty foot and ankle; calls herself Athenais; and is always talking about her trente-deux ans? Why, sir, that woman was an actress on the Boulevard, when we were here in '15. She's no more his wife than I am. Delval's name is Chicot. The woman is always {{travelling}} between London and Paris: I saw she was hooking you at Calais; she has hooked ten men, {{in the course of}} the last two years, in this very way. She lent you money, didn't she?" [...] "Yes." [...] "And she leans on <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> whispers, 'Play half for me,' and somebody wins it, and the poor thing is as sorry as you are, and her husband storms and rages, and insists on double stakes; and she leans over <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> again, <b>and</b> tells every card in your hand to your adversary, and that's the way it's done, Mr. Pogson." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Pass, pass, ye proud brigades, {{with your}} {{tramping}} sinewy legs, [...] With <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> young <b>and</b> strong, with your knapsacks and your [...] muskets; [...] How elate I stood and watch'd you, where starting off you march'd.|$|R
