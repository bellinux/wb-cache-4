5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

500|$|By 1978, Genesis were {{a trio of}} {{lead singer}} and drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks and guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford. They had survived the {{departure}} of original frontman Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett and released the album ...And Then There Were Three..., which included the top ten single [...] "Follow <b>You</b> <b>Follow</b> Me". The group were still touring successfully, and enjoyed the songwriting collaborations between the three of them. They {{decided to take a}} break before writing and recording a new album, which would be largely group-written in a rehearsal room, without many pre-conceived ideas.|$|E
500|$|His {{previous}} Cornell team once faced Carlisle, and he {{was impressed}} by his opponent's approach to the game. Since the players were outweighed by every other team in the nation, they relied on speed and agility instead of size and physical force. Despite those strengths, Cornell won the game 23 to 6. The referee was a former Cornell graduate and was accused of helping out Cornell during the game. After the match, and in addressing the journalists, Warner acknowledged that there was assistance from the referee. He stated [...] that [...] "We outscored 'em but we didn't defeat 'em, if <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> me." [...] It {{has been said that}} after that game he considered Carlisle to be the future of college football.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Aerosmith brought [...] "Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{into the}} hard-rock mainstream. [...] Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Tom Hamilton had {{performed}} the song prior to joining Aerosmith. [...] Perry recalled, [...] "'Train Kept A-Rollin {{was the only}} song we had in common {{when we first got}} together. [...] Steven's band had played 'Train' and Tom and I played it in our band... It's a blues song, if <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> its roots all the way back... I always thought if I could just play one song, it would be that one because of what it does to me". [...] Perry's band began performing the song regularly after he had been moved by the performance of [...] "Stroll On" [...] in Blowup; Tyler recalled his band opened for the Yardbirds in 1966: ...|$|E
500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob or whatever it was. They were my team, I went to support them as a boy and being a Geordie it's in-bred, <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> the club still the same today." [...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club. He was also selected for the Newcastle Schools representative team, and at the age of 13 was among a group of players from the team selected to serve as ball boys at the 1974 Football League Cup Final at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I believed I was upside down {{and the sky was}} the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", have been described as [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E

500|$|Graphs {{in which}} {{vertices}} represent events occurring at a definite time, {{and where the}} edges are always point from the early time vertex to a late time vertex of the edge, are necessarily directed and acyclic. The lack of a cycle follows because the time associated with a vertex always increases as <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> any path in the graph so you can never return to a vertex on a path. [...] This reflects our natural intuition that causality means events can only affect the future, they never affect the past, and thus we have no causal loops. An example {{of this type of}} directed acyclic graph are those encountered in the causal set approach to quantum gravity though in this case the graphs considered are transitively complete. The version history example, each version of the software is associated with a unique time, typically the time the version was saved, committed or released. For citation graphs, the documents are published at one time and can only refer to older documents.|$|E
500|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} {{search for a}} replacement, Collins took over as lead singer, while the group gained popularity in the UK and the US. Following A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering (both 1976), Hackett left the band, reducing it to a core of Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Genesis had their first UK top ten and US top 30 single in 1978 with [...] "Follow <b>You</b> <b>Follow</b> Me" [...] and the group continued to gain commercial success with Duke (1980), Abacab (1981), and Genesis (1983), reaching a peak with Invisible Touch (1986), which featured five US top five singles. Its title track reached No. 1 in the US. After the follow up, We Can't Dance (1991) and related tour, Collins left Genesis in 1996 to focus on his solo career. Banks and Rutherford recruited Ray Wilson for Calling All Stations (1997), but a lack of success in the US led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the [...] in 2007, and together with Gabriel and Hackett were interviewed for the BBC documentary [...] in 2014.|$|E

Calafia and Amadis trade blows until he disarms her and knocks her helmet off. Both Calafia and Radario {{surrender}} to the Christians. While being held prisoner, Calafia acknowledges the astonishing beauty of Leonorina, daughter of the Constantinople emperor and the intended bride of Esplandián, and resolves not to interfere with their union. She accepts Christianity as the one true faith, saying, [...] "I have seen the ordered order of your religion, and the great disorder of all others, I have seen that {{it is clear that}} the law which <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> must be the truth, while that which we follow is lying and falsehood." [...] She marries Talanque, a large and handsome knight who fought with her outside the city gate; similarly, her sister Liota marries Maneli, Talanque's companion in arms. The women return to California with their husbands to establish a new dynasty complete with both sexes, as a Christian nation.|$|E

500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened {{and you can see that}} at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E
500|$|.....And Then There Were Three... was {{released}} in March 1978. It received some mixed reviews from critics at the time owing to the album only containing short songs, which excited new fans but disillusioned {{those who had been}} used to the band's previous work. [...] Chris Welch wrote a positive review in Melody Maker, citing a [...] "remarkably powerful" [...] album. It was a commercial success and peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 14 in the US. [...] "Follow <b>You</b> <b>Follow</b> Me" [...] {{was released}} as its lead single and reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 23 in the US, their highest charting single in both countries since their formation. Its success introduced the band to a new audience, including a larger female interest, helped by its music video airing on Top of the Pops. Its success caused some fans to accuse the group of selling out to more commercial music. A follow up single, [...] "Many Too Many", was less successful as it had already appeared on the album.|$|E
500|$|You {{know how}} many verses I did for that song. I did a version of that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E

500|$|The Prince-inspired [...] "Cross Dresser" [...] has a {{new wave}} style and {{whimsical}} lyrics in which the narrator holds on {{to the memory of}} his lost love by wearing her clothes. Hunt said that he did not intend for the song to have a meaning other than the explicit: [...] "I just thought it was funny. It's {{one of those things that}} people talk about, but that's never really happened to me. But I literally wrote it in 20 minutes. It felt good ... It was really quick and I just thought it was something silly and funny." [...] "It's a Mysterious Hustle" [...] features somber strings, a languid rhythm, an eerie piano vamp, and bitter singing by Hunt. It was recorded solely by Hunt, who played guitar, keyboards, and electronic drums. Its lyrics are about having to [...] "work your way through the crowd" [...] and [...] "overcome the place you come from", and view the world as [...] "no place to raise a child". Its spoken word conclusion preaches, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> the beaten path, it will keep you tied to the past." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her announcement, Rice's {{critique}} of Christianity was commented upon by numerous journalists and pundits. In {{an interview with}} the Los Angeles Times, Rice elaborated on her view regarding being a member of a Christian church: [...] "I feel much more morally comfortable walking away from organized religion. I respect that {{there are all kinds of}} denominations and all kinds of churches, but it's the entire controversy, the entire conversation that I need to walk away from right now." [...] In response to the question, [...] "how do <b>you</b> <b>follow</b> Christ without a church?" [...] Rice replied: [...] "I think the basic ritual is simply prayer. It's talking to God, putting things in the hands of God, trusting that you're living in God's world and praying for God's guidance. And being absolutely faithful to the core principles of Jesus' teachings." [...] In 2011, Rice participated in the [...] "I Am Second" [...] project, with a short documentary about her spiritual journey. On April 14, 2013, Rice stated in a Facebook post that she was a secular humanist. [...] On July 28, 2014, Rice stated in a Facebook post that Christ is still central to her life, but not in the way he is presented by organized religion.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Seconds Out was released, Banks, Rutherford, and Collins had already {{recorded}} ...And Then There Were Three..., the first Genesis album recorded as a trio, in September 1977 at Relight Studios with Hentschel as producer. It was then mixed at Trident Studios in London. The album {{is a collection}} of shorter songs in order to put across more musical ideas. Most of its eleven songs were written individually with Banks contributing four, Rutherford three, Collins and Banks one, and the remaining three written collectively. Their new material signalled a change in the band's sound with songs becoming more pop-oriented and commercially accessible, including the group-written track [...] "Follow <b>You</b> <b>Follow</b> Me". Collins recalled it was the only song on the album written from scratch during rehearsals. Rutherford felt comfortable taking on lead guitar duties in addition to his usual rhythm and bass roles, although the band had considered auditioning replacement guitarists or using a session guitarist on the album. Collins later saw the album as [...] "a very vocal, solid album" [...] that lacked more rhythmic tracks like [...] "Los Endos" [...] or songs from Wind & Wuthering, as coming up with ideas on the drums while living in his flat in Ealing with his family was difficult.|$|E
