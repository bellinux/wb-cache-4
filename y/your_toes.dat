25|$|As the Great Depression set {{in during}} the post-Broadway {{national}} tour of Show Boat, the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment. Audiences {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic had little money to spend on entertainment, and only a few stage shows anywhere exceeded a run of 500 performances during the decade. The revue The Band Wagon (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's Anything Goes (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as The Dancing Years, while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including On <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), Babes In Arms (1937) and The Boys From Syracuse (1938). Porter added DuBarry Was a Lady (1939). The longest-running piece of musical theatre of the 1930s was Hellzapoppin (1938), a revue with audience participation, which played for 1,404 performances, setting a new Broadway record.|$|E

He {{appeared}} in All's Well That Ends Well and As You Like It (1999–2000), and played Mercutio in a 1994 TV adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Other theatre credits include Waiting for Godot (1994) and 900 Oneonta (1994), which earned him a nomination for Best Actor at the Evening Standard Awards. He also acted in Martin Yesterday (1998), for which he was nominated as Best Actor in the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards, Naked (1998), Tales From Hollywood (2001), Three Sisters (2003), Iphigenia at Aulis (2004), The God of Hell (2005), and The Wild Duck (2005–2006).

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became {{well known}} for {{creating}} Broadway hits with other partners. [...] Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms (1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940). [...] Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: [...] On <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the [...] "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" [...] scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. [...] Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie (1924), The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat (1927). [...] Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, [...] "The Last Time I Saw Paris", which {{was included in the}} 1941 film Lady Be Good.|$|E

Luke Gibson from HipHopDX and Entertainment Weekly Leah Greenblatt considered [...] "Runaway Baby" [...] {{one of the}} standouts in the album. The former added that Mars shows his writing skills, despite being {{so different from the}} other recordings. While reviewing the album, Harris Decker of the website The Truth About Music praised the song. He found it to be a [...] "rocking, beat driven" [...] that allowed the album to have [...] "a life of its own". Yahoo!'s music critic, Sherri Thornhill, had a mixed opinion towards the track, calling it a [...] "catchy" [...] and [...] "gets <b>your</b> <b>toes</b> tapping", despite not being on of her favorites.

500|$|Krasinski {{received}} a haircut due to production on another film, Leatherheads (2008), which he thought [...] "ended up working perfectly" [...] {{for the season}} finale. Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as {{he thought it would}} [...] "change [...] up a little bit." [...] Krasinski thought it was [...] "really smart" [...] to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as {{he did not want to}} [...] "tip anything" [...] to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, [...] "That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep you on <b>your</b> <b>toes</b> in terms of not knowing where the story was going." [...] Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking". Herc has noted that [...] "breaking" [...] was also street slang of the time meaning [...] "getting excited", [...] "acting energetically," [...] or [...] "causing a disturbance". Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch <b>your</b> <b>toes,</b> hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to {{try to come up with}} something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked why}} The Run is from San Fran – New York rather than LA – New York, game’s {{producer}} Brian Lindley replied: [...] "That’s a good question. I {{think we were}} maybe looking for more of a direct route. It’s more of a straight line route rather than being sort of corner to corner. But also, San Fran has some iconic landmarks and things like the bridge and the downtown. Also, {{what we can do}} with the environment with things like fog, it makes it of a bit cooler place to drive than LA. And my experiences driving in LA are largely being stuck in traffic! So that’s the primary reason, it’s just a cooler looking start for the game." [...] Black Box PR Manager Dana Sissons stated that The Run was going to be more exciting, more varied, and bigger than ever. The race from San Francisco to New York was full of new race modes, tons of different terrain, and a few [...] "Michael Bay movie moment" [...] avalanches to keep you on <b>your</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|E
60|$|About {{the only}} {{drawback}} to going barefoot was stumping <b>your</b> <b>toe,</b> {{which you were}} pretty sure {{to do when you}} first took off your shoes and before you had got used to your new running weight. When you struck <b>your</b> <b>toe</b> against a rock, or anything, you caught it up in your hand, and hopped about a hundred yards before you could bear to put it to the ground. Then you sat down, and held it as tight as you could, and cried over it, till the fellows helped you to the pump to wash the blood off. Then, as soon as you could, you limped home for a rag, and kept pretty quiet about it so as to get out again without letting on to your mother.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{directors}} and choreographers {{have had a}} major influence on musical theatre style since at least the 19th century, [...] George Abbott and his collaborators and successors took a central role in integrating movement and dance fully into musical theatre productions in the Golden Age. [...] Abbott introduced ballet as a story-telling device in On <b>Your</b> <b>Toes</b> in 1936, which was followed by Agnes DeMille's ballet and choreography in Oklahoma!. [...] After Abbott collaborated with Jerome Robbins in On the Town and other shows, Robbins combined the roles of director and choreographer, emphasizing the story-telling power of dance in West Side Story, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1962) and Fiddler on the Roof (1964). Bob Fosse choreographed for Abbott in The Pajama Game (1956) and Damn Yankees (1957), injecting playful sexuality into those hits. [...] He was later the director-choreographer for Sweet Charity (1968), Pippin (1972) and Chicago (1975). [...] Other notable director-choreographers have included Gower Champion, Tommy Tune, Michael Bennett, Gillian Lynne and Susan Stroman. [...] Prominent directors have included Hal Prince, who also got his start with Abbott, and Trevor Nunn.|$|E
2500|$|Theater {{historian}} Ethan Mordden {{points out}} that, although Oklahoma! {{has been called}} [...] "the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical", Show Boat [...] "got there first on both counts." [...] Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French opéra bouffe, began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, {{paving the way for}} Show Boat and Oklahoma! by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. [...] These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, [...] "built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern's exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization." [...] Mordden also notes that Oklahoma! was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them Gay Divorce and On <b>Your</b> <b>Toes.</b> [...] He concludes: [...] "But Oklahoma! was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom." ...|$|E
