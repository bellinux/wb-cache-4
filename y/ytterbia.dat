In all the cases it is shown that with increase in thickness the extinction coefficient and the absorption edge decreased, while the refractive index increased. Typically, for the MS <b>ytterbia</b> films the variation was between 1. 6 and 1. 75 whereas it was between 1. 7 and 1. 8 for the IBS films.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper, we {{reported}} on a small grid-connected thermophotovoltaic (TPV) system consisting of an <b>ytterbia</b> mantle emitter and silicon solar cells with a 16 % efficiency (under solar irradiance at standard test conditions, STC). The emitter was heated using a butane burner with a rated thermal power of 1. 35 kW (referring to the lower heating value). This system produced an electrical output of 15 W, which corresponds to a thermal to electric (direct current) conversion efficiency of 1. 1 %. In the interim, further progress has been made, and significantly higher efficiencies have been achieved. The most important developments are:- (1) The infrared radiation-absorbing water filter between the emitter and silicon cells (to protect the cells against overheating) {{has been replaced by}} a suitable glass tube. By doing this, it has been possible to prevent losses of convertible radiation in the water, and to protect the cells against the flue gasses. (2) Cell cooling has been significantly improved, in order to reduce the cell temperature, and therefore increase the conversion efficiency. (3) The shape of the emitter has been changed from spherical to a quasi-cylindrical geometry, in order to obtain a more homogeneous irradiation of the cells. (4) The metallic burner-tube, on which the <b>ytterbia</b> emitter was fixed in the initial prototypes, {{has been replaced by a}} heat-resistant metallic rod, carrying ceramic discs as emitter holders. This has prevented the oxidation and clogging of the perforated burner tube. (5) Larger reflectors have been used to reduce losses of useful infrared radiation. (6) Smaller cells have been used, to reduce the electrical series-resistance losses. A system efficiency of 1. 5 % was attained by applying all these improvements to the basic 1. 35 kW prototype. By using preheated air for combustion (at approximately 370 Â Â°C), 1. 8 % was achieved. In a subsequent step, a photocell generator was constructed, consisting of high-efficiency silicon cells (21 % STC efficiency). In this generator, the spaces between the cells were minimized, in order to achieve as high an active cell area as possible, while simultaneously reducing radiation losses. This new system has produced an electrical output of 48 W, corresponding to a system efficiency of 2. 4 %. This is the highest-ever-reported value in a silicon-cell-based TPV system using <b>ytterbia</b> mantle emitters. An efficiency of 2. 8 % was achieved by using preheated air (at approximately 350 Â Â°C). An electronic control unit (fabricated of components with low power consumptions, and including a battery store) was developed, in order to make the TPV system self-powered. This unit controls the magnetic gas-supply valve between the gas-supply cylinder and burner as well as the high-voltage ignition electrodes. Both the control unit's own power consumption and the battery-charging power are supplied directly by the TPV generator. A small commercial inverter is used to transfer excess power to the 230 V grid. In future systems, the effect of preheating the combustion air will be studied in more detail. Finally, this system will be scaled up to provide self-powered domestic boilers.

Although Yb 3 + and Lu 3 + possess the similar small ion size (0. 86 Å and 0. 85 Å) as two adjacent rare-earth elements, Yb- and Lu-α-sialon ceramics present very different microstructure and properties. Yb-α-sialon ceramic is fully composed of α-sialon phase without any secondary phase.

40|$|Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy {{conversion}} enables millimeter scale power generation required for portable microelectronics, robotics, etc. In a TPV system, a heat source heats a selective emitter to incandescence, the radiation from which is incident {{on a low}} bandgap TPV cell. The selective emitter tailors the photonic density of states to produce spectrally confined selective emission of light matching the bandgap of the photovoltaic cell, enabling high heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency.

40|$|We discuss {{quantum well}} cells (QWCs) in the {{quaternary}} system In 1 -xGaxAsyP 1 -y lattice-matched to the InP substrate (x approximate to 0. 47 y) {{for the use}} in solar and thermophotovoltaic (TPV) applications. The deep lattice-matched wells of up to y = 1 (In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As) can be incorporated without any strain. The effective band-gap for absorption in these quaternary QWCs can be tailored (up to similar to 1. 7 mu m) to produce the ideal band-gap for a given blackbody or selective-emitter spectrum while retaining a comparatively high efficiency for the solar spectrum. This has a great potential for higher-efficiency cells, especially for hybrid solar-TPV applications. We present {{the results of a}} new model for the external quantum efficiency of InGaAsP QWCs. The model calculates the spectral response of multi-layer InGaAsP photovoltaic cells with and without quantum wells. It is in very good agreement with the experimental spectral response of InGaAsP QWCs with a variety of designs and therefore is an important tool for the optimisation of these cells. Besides improvements in quantum well geometry, processing and material quality the high efficiencies we obtain can be even further increased by additional features {{such as the use of}} back surface reflectors. We also investigate how these cells perform under several different illuminations such as solar and blackbody spectra as well as narrow-band selective-emitter spectra from erbia and <b>ytterbia</b> comparing them to lattice-matched InGaAs monolithic interconnected modules. We conclude that the InGaAsP QWC system is a very promising candidate for high-efficiency photovoltaic cells for hybrid solar-TPV applications...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{photovoltaic}} cell efficiencies {{can be achieved}} by introducing quantum wells into the intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode, if the gain in short-circuit current exceeds the loss in open-circuit voltage. In such a Quantum Well Cell (QWC), in the quaternary system InGaAsP lattice-matched to InP substrates, the effective band-gap can be tuned, out to #approx# 1. 65 #mu#m (In_ 0 _. _ 5 _ 3 Ga_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 7 As), without introducing strain, by varying the well depth and width to match a given spectrum. This is particularly important for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) applications, where heat radiation is converted into electricity, often using narrow-band selective emitters such as erbia and <b>ytterbia</b> to reshape the spectrum. The enhancement in output voltage of a QWC is also a major advantage. This thesis describes a systematic experimental and theoretical study of InGaAsP quantum well cells for TPV applications. A range of samples have been studied and characterised by I-V measurements in the dark and under illumination, and their spectral response measurements have been fitted with a model specifically modified for this material system. Very good agreement for a variety of designs makes this model an important tool for optimisation. Efficiencies for solar (AM 1. 5), black-body spectra of 1500 - 3200 K and selective emitters are predicted and compared with state-of-the-art bulk InGaAs on InP monolithic interconnected modules (MIM) and the current industrial frontrunner GaSb TPV cells. The study of the temperature dependence under 3000 K black-body and Erbia-like illumination shows better performance of QWCs compared to their well control. In a new approach a strain-balance technique has been investigated where the absorption is extended beyond #approx# 1. 7 #mu#m, important for applications with Holmia emitter for example. InGaAsP or strain-balanced InGaAs QWCs show superior performance when compared with bulk GaSb and InGaAs MIM cells. The conclusions summarise the advantages of the InGaAsP QWC system for high-efficiency {{photovoltaic cell}}s for TPV applications.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties and microstructure formation processes in Si 3 N 4 + 3 % AI 2 O 3 + 5 % Y 2 O 3 (Yb 2 O 3) ceramic compacts sintered under microwave heating (MWH) and under traditional heating (TH) were investigated. The initial ceramic materials were powder blends of silicon nitride with oxides. The mean powder particle sizes were 0. 5 - 1. 0 mim. The content of alfa-phase in the Si 3 N 4 powder {{was more than}} 95 %. The samples were sintered at 1800 BC in nitrogen at normal pressure, the heating rate in all experiments was 60 BC/min. The Vickers hardness (HV), fracture toughness (K 1 C) and bending strength (on) were determined. The microstructures of fracture surfaces of samples were studied by SEM. Quantitative microstructure analysis was carried out. It was shown that the values of HV and Kic of ceramic samples sintered under MWH at 1800 BC rose steadily with the sintering time. This caused an increase in density, which reached maximum as fast as after 30 min of the MWH sintering; the mass loss at that time amounted to 3 - 4 %. The porosity of sintered samples with an addition of yttria was less than 1 %, that of <b>ytterbia</b> was greater, 2. 4 %. For similar values of relative density, the hardness and fracture toughness of ceramic samples produced under MWH were higher as {{compared with those of}} samples sintered under TH. The microstructure of samples had the form of elongated grains in a matrix of polyhedral grains of the beta-Si 3 N 4 phase. Measurements showed the mean size of grains in samples produced by MWH to be greater that in samples produced by TH. A larger number of elongated grains were formed. It was concluded that for sintering under MWH of Si 3 N 4 -based ceramics the growth of elongated beta-Si 3 N 4 grains and formation of a "reinforced" microstructure were promoted and thereby improved the {{mechanical properties}} of such ceramics...|$|E
