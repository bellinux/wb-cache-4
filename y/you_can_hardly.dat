[...] By 1855, North Conway had become [...] " [...] … the pet valley of our landscape painters. [...] There are always {{a dozen or more}} here during the sketching season, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> glance over the meadows, in any direction, without seeing one of their white umbrellas shining in the sun," [...] thus echoing Champney's own words. [...] By the 1850s, North Conway had arguably become the first artist colony in the United States. [...] Winslow Homer (18361910) depicted these artists in his 1868 painting titled [...]|$|E
500|$|The album's muddy, gritty {{sound was}} {{due in part to}} this overdubbing and erasing and mixing {{techniques}} nearly drowned out undubbed sounds. Miles Marshall Lewis stated [...] "Never before on a Sly and the Family Stone album were songs open to so much interpretation, and even more so, dripping with cynicism. On the other hand <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> hear what he's saying for most of the album. Like Radiohead's Kid A or even the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. more recent to the time, a murkiness in the mix of the record inhibits complete comprehension of the words." [...] Stone felt that the rhythm box made unrealistic sounds if used as designed, so he resorted to overdubbing the drum sounds manually, again contributing to the difficult mix.|$|E
500|$|In 1545, Charles Estienne was {{the first}} writer to {{identify}} the clitoris in a work based on dissection, but he concluded {{that it had a}} urinary function. Following this study, Realdo Colombo (also known as Matteo Renaldo Colombo), a lecturer in surgery at the University of Padua, Italy, published a book called De re anatomica in 1559, in which he describes the [...] "seat of woman's delight". In his role as researcher, Colombo concluded, [...] "Since no one has discerned these projections and their workings, if it is permissible to give names to things discovered by me, it should be called the love or sweetness of Venus.", in reference to the mythological Venus, goddess of erotic love. Colombo's claim was disputed by his successor at Padua, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tube), who claimed that he {{was the first}} to discover the clitoris. In 1561, Falloppio stated, [...] "Modern anatomists have entirely neglected it... and do not say a word about it... and if others have spoken of it, know that they have taken it from me or my students." [...] This caused an upset in the European medical community, and, having read Colombo's and Falloppio's detailed descriptions of the clitoris, Vesalius stated, [...] "It is unreasonable to blame others for incompetence on the basis of some sport of nature you have observed in some women and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> ascribe this new and useless part, as if it were an organ, to healthy women." [...] He concluded, [...] "I think that such a structure appears in hermaphrodites who otherwise have well formed genitals, as Paul of Aegina describes, but I have never once seen in any woman a penis (which Avicenna called albaratha and the Greeks called an enlarged nympha and classed as an illness) or even the rudiments of a tiny phallus." ...|$|E

She grew up in [...] (renamed Kaliningrad when it was annexed to the Soviet Union in 1946) and Berlin. Arendt's family was thoroughly assimilated and she later remembered: [...] "With us from Germany, the word 'assimilation' received a 'deep' philosophical meaning. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> realize how serious we were about it." ...|$|E

Before shipping to Kentucky he reported worked well in an exercise on the long gallop at Newmarket. In the build-up to the race, there was some concern about the state of the turf course which had been softened by heavy rain, with the track supervisor saying that the ground was likely to be [...] "good to soft" [...] by British standards. Golden Horn was attempting to become the first Arc winner to win the race, following the failures of Dancing Brave (fourth in 1986), Trempolino (second in 1987), Saumarez, (fifth in 1990), Subotica (fifth in 1992) and Dylan Thomas (fifth in 2007).|$|E

2500|$|Otis Redding {{recorded}} a rendition of [...] "Satisfaction" [...] for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding {{claimed that he}} did not know the lyrics of the song. [...] "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," [...] he noted. [...] "That's because I made them up." [...] Of that session, Steve Cropper said, [...] "...if you ever listened to the record <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>hardly</b> understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper and before we got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." [...] Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an [...] "anarchic reading" [...] of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.|$|E
