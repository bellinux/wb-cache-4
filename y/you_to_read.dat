500|$|The Saturn {{version was}} noted as being mostly {{faithful}} to the PC original. Sam Hickman of Sega Saturn Magazine praised it for retaining the original intro, music, speech samples, and features of the PC version (all {{of which had been}} left out of most previous console versions), although a reviewer from the Japanese magazine of the same name criticised the lack of mouse support. Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer held a similar opinion to that of Hickman by commending the Saturn version for being a comprehensive port of the PC original, and also applauded the addictive simulation gaming of Theme Park, calling it [...] "SimCity with a playful spirit". Mean Machines Sega reviewer compared it to the Mega Drive version, citing the save function and variety of entertainers as major improvements over that version. A Next Generation critic lauded the game's [...] "simple interface", [...] "infectious gameplay", and [...] "realistic business fundamentals", but felt the Saturn's [...] "near-perfect" [...] conversion of the PC original was commendable but unexciting, and expressed regret that there were no upgrades or additions. GamePro gave a terse joint review of the Saturn and PlayStation versions, commenting, [...] "you decide every detail, right down to the roller coaster's speed. Simple graphics and sounds offer up little treats to keep the game interesting. Overlapping menu systems force <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the manual".|$|E
