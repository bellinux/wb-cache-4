5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, {{you can see that}} it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That was a very different depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E
5|$|When Dante next meets Trish, she betrays him {{and reveals}} that she too {{is working for}} Mundus, but when her life is endangered, Dante chooses to save her. Claiming he did so only because of her {{resemblance}} to his mother, he warns her to stay away. <b>Yet</b> <b>when</b> he finally confronts Mundus, {{who is about to}} kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.|$|E

5|$|With {{the vocal}} tracks completed, a final {{mix of the}} album was {{undertaken}} with engineer Dick Meaney at the Church in Crouch End during the autumn of 1991; it was the nineteenth studio in which Loveless had been worked on. The album was edited on an aged machine {{that had previously been}} used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s. Its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to put it back together from memory, <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} term as {{representative}} from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. <b>Yet,</b> <b>when</b> she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in Washington County and Houston City, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in Austin. When the couple appeared at several events in Nacogdoches, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure {{her that he was}} giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.|$|E
5|$|On Bennett's third trip, from January to March 1842, {{in which}} he also visited Kassel, Dresden and Berlin, he played his Caprice for piano and orchestra, Op. 22, in Leipzig. Despite his then-pessimistic view of music in England, Bennett missed his chance to {{establish}} himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for reassurance and encouragement. England could not provide this for a native composer in his time. He found it temporarily in German musical circles; <b>yet,</b> <b>when</b> the opportunity came to claim his earned place {{as a leader in}} German music, he was not quite bold enough to grasp it.|$|E

5|$|Before the battle, {{a section}} from the 2 RAR Medium Machine Gun Platoon had been {{stationed}} within the American perimeter near Hill 111 to provide covering fire across {{the area between}} the positions occupied by the US Marines and the Australians. Commanded by Sergeant Brian Cooper they soon found themselves {{in the thick of}} the fighting, firing their Vickers machine-guns in support of the Australian positions and to defend themselves from the weight of the Chinese main attack which fell on the Marines. Three men were wounded during the night but the machine-gunners continued to fire in support, while the remainder of the section repelled Chinese assaults from the left. Ultimately the Chinese were unable to dislodge them, with the Australians calling-in artillery on to their own positions during repeated Chinese attempts to overrun them as the US Marines withdrew past their position, leaving them isolated. When dawn came dozens of Chinese bodies were found strewn in front of the Australian machine-gunners. As the US Marines worked to clear the Chinese stragglers from their position the Australians had endeavoured to coax a Chinese soldier from a bunker, <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> he resisted they were forced to kill him with a grenade. Cooper was later awarded the Military Medal for his leadership, with the stubborn defence of the Australians contributing to the break-up of the Chinese attack which at one stage had threatened to overrun the Marine position. Large groups of Chinese remained though, occupying a number bunkers and trenches, and they were not finally dislodged by the Marines until the following afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most {{human and animal}} herpesviruses, the trunk secretions may {{be a source of}} transmission for EEHVs. Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the direct transmission of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E
5|$|War {{broke out}} in 433 BC when Athens, perhaps seeking {{additional}} cavalry and resources {{in anticipation of the}} Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), allied with a brother and cousin of Perdiccas II who were in open rebellion against him. This led Perdiccas to seek alliances with Athens' rivals Sparta and Corinth, <b>yet</b> <b>when</b> his efforts were rejected he instead promoted the rebellion of nearby nominal Athenian allies in Chalcidice, winning over the important city of Potidaea. Athens responded by sending a naval invasion force that captured Therma and laid siege to Pydna. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking Chalcidice and Potidaea due to stretching their forces thin by fighting the Macedonians and their allies on multiple fronts, and therefore sued for peace with Macedonia. War resumed shortly after with the Athenian capture of Beroea and Macedonian aid given to the Potidaeans during an Athenian siege, yet by 431 BC, the Athenians and Macedonians concluded a peace treaty and alliance orchestrated by the Thracian ruler Sitalces of the Odrysian kingdom. The Athenians had hoped to use Sitalces against the Macedonians, but due to Sitalces' desire to focus on acquiring more Thracian allies, he convinced Athens to make peace with Macedonia on the condition that he provide cavalry and peltasts for the Athenian army in Chalcidice. Under this arrangement, Perdiccas II was given back Therma and no longer had to contend with his rebellious brother, Athens, and Sitacles all at once; in exchange he aided the Athenians in their subjugation of settlements in Chalcidice.|$|E
