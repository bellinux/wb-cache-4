The undead skeletons that attack Finn and Jake were originally supposed to be [...] "specific undead from [...] ". However, Ward changed his mind and tasked Andy Ristaino, a character designer for the series, with stylizing the corpses. Ristaino designed them to resemble [...] "east coast commuters [...] bundled up for winter." [...] He strove to make them look like people <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> on a subway, such as a bike messenger, a couple, man in a [...] "goofy hat", and a man wearing a suit. Originally, when the Lich set off his bomb, the storyboard featured a simple mushroom cloud. Ian Jones-Quartey, one of the series' storyboard revisionists, however, added a face to the blast. Ristaino then added skulls to the smoke. The series' staff liked this version so much that they later included it on the title card.|$|E

500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the same time that it had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with the remainder of his cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when we saw them. [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E

Tony and Matt are great actors, and the fact that they're easy on the eye is a great advantage". [...] "What the brothers bring is romance and fun, because that's something we've been a little short-changed on in EastEnders recently. The Moons are a very interesting family to work with– they're all big characters. It's a great new era for that clan". Kirkwood added that [...] "there is more to the pair than meets the eye" [...] saying that there [...] "are a couple of buried secrets between Eddie and his sons" [...] confirming it will be [...] "a big story for the summer". He finished, [...] "there'll be consequences for all concerned". Kirkwood later added, [...] "What I hope we've created in Tyler and Anthony are blokes <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> in the pub on a Friday night with an appetite for life– and for women." [...] When Anthony was introduced, it was revealed that he was a gambling addict. Of this, Lapinskas said, [...] "it's a great thing that our executive producer Bryan Kirkwood and the EastEnders team came up with for Anthony– that he does have this gambling problem and various insecurities connected with it. It adds some more depth to the character and it's brilliant when we can explore that. With every topic and every storyline that crops up, I think Anthony's background will always have an effect and impact on it. That's really nice to play." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{developers}} {{stated that}} they wanted to keep a certain amount of realism to the setting of their game. [...] "It's not science fiction, it's like racing on the most beautiful places on earth" [...] stated Senior Game Designer Peter Petrekovits. Development began with low polygon versions of the game's three settings to hone gameplay, which were later upgraded with details created from primitive shapes. Artists then took these settings and provided finalized environments while course designers laid out the specific elements to each race. Multiple routes were created in each setting allowing for several course configurations. Some of the plane designs were inspired from real-world fighter planes, but each were evolved from initial concept art into their current designs. Petrekovits elaborated on their design. [...] "These planes are not real life models. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> some part of them [...] familiar, but these are whole new concepts". Petrekovits further clarified that though the planes can be equipped with weaponry via powerups, they [...] "are not military planes whatsoever, [...] are racing planes." [...] Two members of the game's development team were graduate airplane technicians.|$|E
2500|$|The Hotel Oloffson {{was one of}} {{the early}} concert venues for rasin bands and {{performers}} beginning in 1987. [...] Rasin bands incorporated not only traditional Vodou folk music lyrics and rhythms into modern musical style, but included petwo drums and rara horns, instruments used in Vodou religious ceremonies. [...] When Morse gathered together dancers and musicians to create RAM in 1990, the rasin style was popular in Port-au-Prince and gaining popularity {{in the rest of the}} country. [...] "Ke'm Pa Sote" [...] by Boukman Eksperyans, whose song title translates to [...] "I Am Not Afraid" [...] in English, was the most popular song at the 1990 Carnival in Port-au-Prince. [...] It was widely understood to be a criticism of the corrupt military government of General Prosper Avril. [...] RAM adopted a similar format and together with Boukman Eksperyans and other rasin bands developed the style and genre of protest music grounded in Vodou musical tradition. [...] Eventually, Richard Morse became so involved in the Vodou religion through his music that he was initiated as a houngan, or Vodou priest, in 2002. [...] Describing a RAM concert, Morse explains, [...] "Yes, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> our dancers go into a trance. [...] Some get possessed by the loas, to the rhythm of the drums, but it's a natural state when it happens. You can't fake it." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Billy Pilgrim becomes [...] "unstuck in time," [...] he {{is faced}} with {{a new type of}} philosophy. When Pilgrim becomes acquainted with the Tralfamadorians, he learns a {{different}} viewpoint concerning fate and free will. While Christianity may state that fate and free will are matters of God’s divine choice and human interaction, Tralfamadorianism would disagree. According to Tralfamadorian philosophy, things are and always will be, and there is nothing that can change them. When Billy asks why they had chosen him, the Tralfamadorians reply, [...] "Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything? Because this moment simply is." [...] The mindset of the Tralfamadorian is not one in which fate and free will exist. Things happen because they were always destined to be happening. The narrator of the story explains that the Tralfamadorians see time all at once. This concept of time is best explained by the Tralfamadorians themselves, as they speak to Billy Pilgrim on the matter stating, [...] "I am a Tralfamadorian, seeing all time as <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> a stretch of the Rocky Mountains. All time is all time. It does not change. It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is." [...] After this particular conversation on seeing time, Billy makes the statement that this philosophy does not seem to evoke any sense of free will. To this, the Tralfamadorian reply that free will is a concept that, out of the [...] "visited thirty-one inhabited planets in the universe" [...] and [...] "studied reports on one hundred more," [...] exists solely on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|When Entity FX {{took over}} the duties of {{creating}} the digital effects for the series, they also {{took over the}} challenge of crafting effects that would illustrate Clark’s super-powered abilities, including the new [...] "heat vision" [...] that was introduced this season. The visual effects for heat vision evolved {{over the course of}} the first season, until Gough and Millar agreed on one that reflected their image of what heat vision should look like; they did not want the usual [...] "red beams" [...] or [...] "laser vision". The visuals developed from the idea that they wanted Clark to be able to use it in front of people without them being able to see it. What emerged was a [...] "heat ripple" [...] from [...] "distorting the frame". John Wash explains what the creators were looking for:" [...] wanted to be fairly accurate in terms of what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>see</b> from something that was searingly hot traveling through the air, like a disturbance of the atmosphere. We keyed our research off the little ripples that you see if a light goes past a hotplate and reflects on a wall. We used a computer to create a conical version of that effect that could emanate from Clark's eyes, in combination with a little effect." [...] They used [...] "blobs of heat vision" [...] instead of [...] "constant rays" [...] for the first instances of Clark using his ability, in an effort to simulate Clark's attempts to control it. A couple of episodes later in [...] "Red", the special effects team would use similar techniques for red kryptonite. To illustrate red kryptonite’s effect on Clark, and it releasing his inhibitions, the special effects team crafted digital effects in his eyes. Brian Harding tweaked the effects they were already using for Clark’s heat vision, giving them a [...] "little devilish, hellish red flicker" [...] in Clark’s iris. To help illustrate Clark’s super speed, Mat Beck and his team would slow down and speed up background settings in a single shot. For example, in [...] "Ryan", when Clark speeds up to the camera everything else slows to a stop—leaves stop blowing and birds are frozen in mid-flight—then everything begins moving normally as Clark races away from the camera. Entity FX also adds a blurring effect to Clark's body, as well as a distortion to the background to help further illustrate the speed at which Clark travels.|$|E
