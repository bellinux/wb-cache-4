Then <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> yourself: 'What is a global outbreak'? Global outbreak means that we see both spread of the agent … and then we see disease activities in addition to the spread of the virus." ...|$|E

I would sink them all. I am not proud of the part I played in it. I did it because it was necessary for the safety of this country. That's why I am such a great exponent of stopping this whole nonsense of war. Unfortunately limits— attempts to limit war have always failed. The lesson of history is when a war starts every nation will ultimately use whatever weapon it has available. ... Every time you produce radiation, you produce something that has a certain half-life, in some cases for billions of years. ... It is important that we control these forces and try to eliminate them."

6000|$|TOMO A {{question}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> well <b>ask.</b> She is the exile's daughter. She {{wanted to}} see her father once more, and so came hither to seek him. Will you take us to Kagekiyo? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, there ain't no Bowlong," [...] {{said the}} barmaid, taking up a glasscloth and a drying tumbler and {{beginning}} to polish the latter. [...] "First off, I thought <b>you</b> <b>might</b> be <b>asking</b> for Beaumont--the names being similar. Were you expecting them on bicycles?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been better for him had one of his own degree been there: not that I doubt you did the duty of a good neighbour, as well as it might be done by one like <b>you.</b> <b>Might</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> your name, lady?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} would stay, {{if it were}} for her good. I was thinking, Duke, that perhaps <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> the Greys to come to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL. Well, if you was a gentleman, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> {{me to sit}} down, I think. Don't I {{tell you}} I'm {{bringing}} you business? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> {{her to come}} down, {{tomorrow}} morning, to see me. Of course, she {{shall not}} be a loser by giving up her morning's work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have come sooner," [...] she said gaily. [...] "That red mask has been here again. He {{looked as if he}} wanted to make love to me this time. But he didn't. If you'd been here <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>asked</b> him where Mrs. Bowen was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear friends," [...] he said, impressively, [...] "if {{you could}} have built a model, or {{conducted}} these negotiations in the usual way, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> have <b>asked</b> a million. As it is, I think I am {{the only man in}} England who could have dealt with this matter--so satisfactorily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> {{think we}} <b>might</b> <b>ASK</b> him?" [...] said Francis, in a vehement whisper. [...] "After all, {{we are the}} only three English people in the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You go if {{you want}} to," [...] said Meagle, [...] "and we will play dummy. Or <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> the tramp to take your hand for you, as you go downstairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> me in." [...] There was {{a hint of}} reproach in Frona's voice, and of haste. [...] "I blundered {{through the}} ice, and my feet are freezing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think I {{left it in}} {{the office}} somewhere. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> at the desk; or perhaps it's in the rack by the dining-room door--or maybe up in our room." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I was thinking,' said Mrs. Ashford, 'how forlorn {{it will be}} {{for that}} poor youth to spend his Christmas-day alone in that great house. Don't <b>you</b> think we <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> him to dinner?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{promised you}} {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask.</b> All {{my share of}} his ransom, or his person, bond or free, is yours. You have only to prevail with your own Jarls and Bonders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} Edward is," [...] she laughed in reply, [...] "he has {{no sense of}} time. If it occurs to you next time you write <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> him when he's {{thinking}} of coming." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, {{and while}} you are waiting," [...] I continued, [...] "you must try to find out, in the first place, if there are, or have been, any signs of delirium. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> the old lady, and besides, {{you may be able}} to judge for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You are an excitable youth, Gay,' he said; 'and should {{endeavour}} to {{cool down}} a little now, for it would be unwise to encourage feverish predispositions. Be as cool as you can, Gay.

6000|$|... "Then {{we shall}} test <b>you</b> tonight. <b>Might</b> I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{as a very}} great favour, when you occupy that couch tonight, to sleep with this old funnel placed {{by the side of}} your pillow?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Seems to me I've {{heard the}} name," [...] replied the clerk. [...] "But I can't just place it. <b>You</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> Tom Dillon, over yonder.

6000|$|... "Nay, that I do not mind!--But <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>ask</b> our surly host if {{he could}} let me wait in another room, where I could be safer from the prying eyes of any chance traveller.

60|$|ZOO. The same reply, {{word for}} word, that your illustrious predecessor, {{as you call}} him, got fifteen years ago. You asked for it; and you got it.
