The analysis uses a census of French exports by firm-destination-product over the period 1994 - 2008 with a monthly frequency. We first uncover a large calendar year bias: the growth of exporters {{between the first and}} the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>export</b> is biased upwards because new exporters may start exporting late during the year. This incomplete calendar year reduces export revenue by 32 % on average for the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>export.</b> We then show that, controlling for size, export experience is negatively related to net growth of exports for surviving exporters. Controlling for export experience, the relationship between average size and net growth of exports shows no systematic pattern. Finally, churning in foreign markets is decreasing with export experience and (sharply) with size...|$|E

It further seeks to outline the conditions allowing firms to benefit from these spillover effects. Using a propensity score matching method, a group of firms having entered the export market (treatment group) is compared with a similar group of non-exporting firms (control group), and difference-in-differences regressions are carried out. The results show a cumulative productivity differential of 32 % {{for the first four}} <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>exporting,</b> with continuous improvement in productivity. After three <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>exporting,</b> productivity gain is still approximately 10 %. This study shows that increases in capacity utilisation and competitive pressure from foreign markets are insufficient to explain this causal link between exporting and total factor productivity (TFP). It is thus possible to deduce the presence of a learning-by-exporting effect, benefiting firms with sufficiently qualified employees and which are already engaged in international relations (due to foreign suppliers and/or foreign equity participation) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the top 1 percent of {{exporters}} critically shape trade patterns, using firm-level data from 32 countries. In particular, variation in average firm size (the intensive margin) explains over {{two thirds of the}} variation in the sector distribution <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> across countries, the remaining share is explained by variation in the number of firms (the extensive margin). Variation in average firm size across sectors is largely driven by variation in the sectoral distribution <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> from the top 1 percent of firms in a country—export superstars. In contrast, the sectoral distribution <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> from the remaining 99 percent of firms is more similar across countries, and the distribution {{of the total number of}} firms across sectors is very similar across countries.

40|$|Following {{along the}} lines of a growing {{literature}} on the causal link between export- ing and productivity this paper analyzes the existence of flearning-by-exporting using firm-level data. The paper asks whether, in addition to better perfirming firms self-selecting into exports and multinational production, exporting (multina- tional production) further improves their perfirmance compared with non-exporters. We develop and test a simple model of trade and international production with het- erogeneous firms that generates learning effects through competition in the export markets. The estimations perfirmed on the sample of Slovenian manufacturing enter- prises between 1994 and 2002 indicate that more productive firms tend to self-select into more competitive markets, while there is no conclusive evidence <b>of</b> learning-by- <b>exporting.</b> Although new exporters experienced a surge in productivity in the initial <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> the effect dissipates as soon as the following year.

This study uses an unique dataset <b>of</b> Austrian service <b>exporting</b> firms over a four-year period to add to this literature. We show that service export participation is very low and highly concentrated among a few firms and that service exporters are on average larger and more productive than non-exporters. We also find that firm productivity increases with the number <b>of</b> <b>export</b> markets served. The detailed analysis on the export premium suggests the self-selection of firms as well as learning effects from exporting for export starters. The dynamic analysis reveals that the rate <b>of</b> <b>export</b> exits is high for export starters in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>exporting,</b> especially for firms of small size.
