500|$|You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing,</b> {{their fourth}} album, was issued in mid-2004. It was led off by [...] "If You Ever Stop Loving Me", which in mid-2004 became Montgomery Gentry's first number 1 single {{on the country}} charts. It was also their biggest hit on the Hot 100, {{reaching}} number 30 there. Following it, the album's title track went to number 22 on the country charts, while [...] "Gone" [...] peaked at number 3 and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] became their second number 1 single. The song spent two weeks at number 1, thus making it the first single for Columbia Records' Nashville division {{to spend more than}} one week at number 1 since [...] "Daddy's Money" [...] by Ricochet in 1996. [...] "Gone" [...] was also the most-played single by a country music duo in 2005, and it received a digital gold certification for 500,000 certified music downloads. You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing</b> became their third platinum-selling album. Scaife, Chancey, Rutherford, Steele, and Mark Wright split production duties on the album. Steele also co-wrote [...] "Gone" [...] and [...] "Something to Be Proud Of" [...] with Bob DiPiero and Chris Wallin, respectively, while Rutherford and DiPiero co-wrote [...] "If You Ever Stop Loving Me" [...] with Tom Shapiro. In October 2005, You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing</b> became the duo's third platinum album. Rick Bell gave the album a favorable review on Country Standard Time, saying that the duo [...] "unleash [...] in a torrent of brash lyrics, wailing guitars, and pounding percussion." [...] Jurek wrote that it [...] "is easily the finest outing by modern country's most relevant duo; it rocks, it's soulful, and it's memorable." [...] Montgomery Gentry toured in late 2004 – early 2005 with Trace Adkins in support of the album.|$|E
500|$|Montgomery Gentry {{released}} six studio albums for Columbia Records' Nashville division: Tattoos & Scars (1999), Carrying On (2001), My Town (2002), You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing</b> (2004), Some People Change (2006), and Back When I Knew It All (2008), and a Greatest Hits package.

Ten more of their songs reached the top 10 on the country charts, including the number 3 hit [...] "Gone", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. Tattoos & Scars, My Town, and You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing</b> are all certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist—Country at the American Music Awards. Both the Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association named them Duo of the Year in 2000, an award for {{which they have been}} nominated by both associations in every year since. In 2009, they were inducted into the Grand Ole Opry.|$|E

[...] Staunton described Collaborations as an [...] "intriguing series of East–West summits" [...] and concluded: [...] "It may have limited appeal … but this box set is a strong testament to two friends' mutual respect and their desire to push musical boundaries." [...] In an article for Time Out New York on the various Beatles-related reissues of late 2010, Sophie Harris wrote: [...] "You might not think that Vedic chanting is <b>your</b> <b>thing,</b> but as Philip Glass notes {{in the introduction to}} this gorgeous set, there's scarcely a musician in the world who hasn't been touched by the musical partnership [...] … Contained herein: awesome, spooky-sounding chanting, a live DVD, a glossy book and much more to rejoice about." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 13, 2006, Hayes {{announced}} that he was quitting the show because of the series' treatment of religion, saying, [...] "There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins. Religious beliefs are sacred to people, and at all times should be respected and honored. As a civil rights activist of the past 40 years, I cannot support a show that disrespects those beliefs and practices." [...] The Guardian observed that Hayes did not specifically mention Scientology in his statement. Later in an interview on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, Hayes added he did not see the episode itself, but was told about it. In a separate interview, he reportedly said regarding Parker and Stone, [...] "Guys, you have it all wrong. We're not like that. I know that's <b>your</b> <b>thing,</b> but get your information correct, because somebody might believe that shit, you know? But I understand what they're doing. I told them to take a couple of Scientology courses, and understand what we do." ...|$|E
500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think {{we got a little}} too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, saying that it was more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do <b>Your</b> <b>Thing,</b> and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD (now part of Mania.com) gave {{positive}} reviews {{to the two}} New Cutey Honey Collections {{released in}} 2000 by ADV; he [...] "was really impressed with the production values of this show" [...] and called it [...] "quite a bit of fun, especially for those looking for fan-service with a bit more intelligence and style {{than some of the}} other offerings out there". [...] Two reviews of Honey on the website Anime Jump greatly diverged: site maintainer Mike Toole rated the series 3.5 out of 5 stars and called it [...] "tons of fun, a light, tasty action-comedy that's... spirited and silly and tongue-in-cheek", and praised its character designs as [...] "letter-perfect to Go Nagai's original (quite appealing!) character designs"; Jason Carter praised Calvello's voice work in his review of the 2004 ADV release, but rated it 1.5 out of 5 stars, said that much of Cosplay City [...] "goes back and forth between looking like an ordinary modern metropolis and resembling some sort of Smurf town built of polluted marshmallows", and concluded [...] "The characters are largely annoying, the plot is , the nudity is absurd, the fighting is rarely more than average, and the whole thing is ultimately pointless - as the series' later attempts at developing Honey as a person make all too clear." [...] Sandra Dozier of DVD Verdict was also unimpressed with Honey: [...] "I can see why it is popular—the glossy animation, the well-endowed chicks, the scant clothing. If that isn't <b>your</b> <b>thing,</b> however, there is very little to draw you to this series." ...|$|E

Similarly, Claire Suddath of Time {{magazine}} commented that [...] "1+1" [...] is probably the finest ballad Beyoncé has delivered in years. Amos Barshad of New York magazine described [...] "1+1" [...] as [...] "a big grand love ballad". Andy Kellman of Allmusic picked [...] "1+1" [...] {{as one of the}} album's top songs, describing it as [...] "a sparse and placid vocal showcase, [...] fades in with a somber guitar line, throws up occasional and brief spikes in energy, and slowly recedes." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound commented that in contrast to the geometry taught at school, there is something interesting in [...] "1+1"; he further wrote that ballad focuses on Beyoncé's [...] "amazing vocal range" [...] as it is not upbeat like most of her previous offerings. Leah Collins of Canada's Dose described the song as a [...] "melodramatic soul ballad". A reporter from The Huffington Post stated that [...] "1+1" [...] is a departure from [...] "Run the World (Girls)", noting that Beyoncé [...] "replac the defiance of [...] with devotion" [...] ". He added that {{it is one of the}} first representations that [...] "Beyoncé is keeping her promise that a whole new array of sounds will make their way into 4."

[...] The song was a Number One single {{on both the}} Hot Country Songs and Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts for Rascal Flatts in 2006, and was also a chart single for Cascada in 2007. Another one of Steele's compositions, Steve Holy's Number One single [...] "Brand New Girlfriend", earned him yet another BMI award in 2006, {{as well as the}} Rascal Flatts hit [...] "My Wish" [...] just as Steele released his album, Hell on Wheels.
