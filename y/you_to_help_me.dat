He said, 'Yes, I know, {{but no one else}} but you could help me.' He said, 'Two sticks, a dash and cake with a stick down. What is it?' I said, 'Did you wake me up just to tell me this?' As it turns out, two sticks is the number 11. A dash is a dash. And cake with a stick down is the number nine. And that was September 11." ...|$|E
2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war. To try and avoid such as a calamity as a European war, I beg you {{in the name of}} our old friendship to do what you can to stop your allies from going too far." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 258, Sun Chen deposed {{the second}} Wu emperor Sun Liang and {{replaced}} the latter with Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu was unhappy that Sun Chen monopolised state power so he plotted with the minister Zhang Bu to eliminate Sun Chen. Zhang Bu told the emperor, [...] "Ding Feng {{may not be}} proficient in administrating civil affairs, but he is an outstanding strategist and is capable of making important decisions." [...] Sun Xiu then summoned Ding Feng for a meeting and said to the latter, [...] "Sun Chen usurps state power and is plotting treason. I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> eliminate him." [...] Ding Feng replied, [...] "The Chancellor (Sun Chen) and his brothers have many supporters. Not everyone in the imperial court is on our side. We cannot confront them directly. I suggest that Your Majesty order your soldiers to kill him during the Laba Festival." [...] Sun Xiu followed Ding Feng's plan and pretended to invite Sun Chen to the palace to celebrate the Laba Festival. When Sun Chen stepped inside, Ding Feng and Zhang Bu signalled to the imperial guards to kill him. For his contributions, Ding Feng was promoted {{to the position of}} General-in-Chief (大將軍) and received the additional appointments of Left and Right Protectors of the Capital (左右都護).|$|E

6000|$|... "You're very wonderful," [...] Mr. Longdon {{presently}} returned. [...] "A {{year and}} a half ago <b>you</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Mr. Vanderbank." ...|$|R
6000|$|ASHER. <b>You</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> when I'm {{starting}} {{out on a}} liberal scheme which I thought you {{would be the first}} to endorse? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly! How can I expect <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{unless you}} know what a serious reason there is for keeping Lucilla in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get clothes--and shelter--and then, {{with other}} things. I've left them long enough. If you won't--well! But you will--must." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've got it, Jessie; and, with <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> I hope to {{make the}} child feel {{that she is not}} quite fatherless and motherless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a lovely}} house! You know, I think <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> Guardy. Just imagine if your grandchildren {{were thrown out}} into the street!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said I, [...] "enough said. If <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> there's {{no doubt}} but I'll be glad of it, and none but I'll be grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind, do as I tell <b>you.</b> Go <b>to</b> {{your room}} and finish {{learning}} it well, {{and stay there}} until I call <b>you</b> down <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> get tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, him!' she answered. 'But make no mistake, my revenge is my own; and I merely use <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to it.' Wykham asked suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be unfortunate for everybody. I advised {{your father}} {{to say a}} prayer for our success. I depend upon <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> more materially." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> here, Mr Chalmers. You have {{stronger}} wrists than I have. I {{will tell}} you what to do. Hold the frame tightly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An American and his daughter, Mr. and Miss Van Decht. If {{they come}} I hope that I may count upon <b>you,</b> Countess, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> make their visit an enjoyable one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Both, lad, both--some of everything. Well, as I was saying--and you've a {{right to}} know what's running in my head, seeing that <b>you</b> have <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> carry out the plans--I'll give you a rough notion of 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You fraud! You humbug! And <b>you</b> pretended <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> {{look for}} it." [...] She {{gazed at him}} almost with respect. [...] "I never knew you were so deep and snaky. I'm {{discovering}} all sorts of new things about you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no we weren't! Don't {{say such}} things, dearest! I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> sum it all, up. You think it's been a success, don't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm afraid I {{must ask}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> home, then. I'll make it worth your while. You see.' The sightless eyes turned towards her and Bessie saw.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear aunt, I am {{very unhappy}} about something, and I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> I'm afraid, though, {{it will give}} you a great deal of trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And let’s ’ope {{you go on}} as you’ve begun," [...] {{said that}} gratified lady. [...] "There’s {{something}} in old Purnip after all. I’ve been worrying you for months for that oilcloth. Are <b>you</b> going <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> wash up? Mr. Purnip would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} turtle, [...] "these {{things have been}} {{happening}} ever since there were fairies, and you might expect some of our adventures would get into books. But are <b>you</b> willing <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me?</b> That is the important thing just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good," [...] said Lawrence. [...] "I {{tried to}} go <b>to</b> her, as <b>you</b> know, and was prevented. Now all I ask of <b>you</b> is <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do what <b>you</b> so {{strongly}} urged me to do. There is nothing particularly cool in that, I think." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Should I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> if I did?" [...] Mrs. Sowler asked contemptuously. [...] "They may be both {{dead and}} buried, for all I know to the contrary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Still, deserters do get out, you know, doctor. There is {{scarcely}} {{a week that}} two or three don't manage to get away. I mean to try, anyhow. If <b>you</b> like <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> of course it will make it easier; if not, I shall try by myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Girl, if <b>YOU</b> want <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> more--bring me some bread an' meat. Don't tell any one. Look what a ragamuffin I am.... An' there's Wildfire.

6000|$|... "I was mad all right," [...] Bob agreed. [...] "My {{flour and}} tea's gone, and I can't hire {{up about the}} settlements, but if I'd a hundred dollars, I'd {{try to make the}} coast."

6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "This {{affair of}} Duson's remains a {{complete}} mystery to me. I am looking to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> solve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> Maggie--help {{me to be}} brave. I {{have only}} {{a year or two}} longer to live, and there's a lot to be done in that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid, dear, that I {{shall have}} to ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> to do some shopping. I {{think there are some}} stores near here. We had better drive to them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{see it all}} now." [...] A {{brilliant}} inspiration {{had suddenly}} obscured her humour. She sat down suddenly, and he sat down too. [...] "You did it," [...] she said, [...] "because <b>you</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me.</b> And <b>you</b> thought I was too Conventional <b>to</b> take <b>help</b> from one I might think my social inferior." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she cried. [...] "Please don't think so. It {{has given}} me a sense of--of security. That <b>you</b> were ready <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> if--if I needed you." ...|$|R
