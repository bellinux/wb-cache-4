25|$|In {{response}} to the white influx, some blacks operated alternative venues in their homes. Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: you could only find a buffet flat if <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> address and apartment number, which hosts did not advertise.|$|E
500|$|After Harrison {{has named}} Rolling Stone {{as the main}} {{perpetrator}} of his anguish, Leng suggests that {{he is unable to}} sustain the previous [...] "artifice", whereby the lyrics' shift in perspective from first-person to third-person represented the apparently [...] "happy" [...] private man versus the [...] "wounded" [...] musician, as [...] "personified by his guitar". Instead, Harrison [...] "flays his detractors" [...] in the song's subsequent verses. These final verses contain the rhyming couplets [...] "Thought by now <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> score / You missed the point just like before" [...] and [...] "While you attack, create offence / I'll put it down to your ignorance". Music critic Lindsay Planer describes the lines as [...] "suggesting that there is more to Harrison's music than is being taken into consideration by narrow-minded journalists".|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} between his junior and senior years, {{he played in the}} Cape Cod League, {{finishing}} sixth in the league in batting average. In his senior year in 2001 he repeated as second-team All-American. He set UC career records for home runs (56), walks (206), slugging percentage (.627), and on-base percentage (.499) with a batting average of [...]366. [...] "He had a great eye ... he hardly ever struck out looking", said Brad Meador, UC's associate head coach. [...] "When he did, <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> ump missed the call." [...] Cleary, noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed, told his father: [...] "Your son's going to be a millionaire some day. I don't know if it's in baseball, but he's going to make some money one of these days." [...] Youkilis was later inducted into UC's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|Presiding {{over the}} trial was Sir William Chapple, a senior and {{respected}} judge in his early sixties. [...] The prosecution was directed by King's Counsel Thomas Place and Richard Crowle (brother of George), and proceedings were recorded by a York resident, Thomas Kyll. [...] Turpin had no defence barrister; {{during this period of}} English history, those accused had no right to legal representation, and their interests were cared for by the presiding judge. [...] Among the seven witnesses called to testify were Thomas Creasy, and James Smith, the man who had recognised Turpin's handwriting. [...] Turpin offered {{little in the way of}} questioning his accusers; when asked if he had anything to ask of Creasy, he replied [...] "I cannot say anything, for I have not any witnesses come this day, as I have expected, and therefore beg of your Lordship to put off my trial 'till another day", and when asked about Smith, he claimed not to know him. [...] When questioned himself, Turpin told the court that he had bought the mare and foal from an inn-keeper near Heckington. [...] He repeated his original story of how he had come to use the pseudonym Palmer, claiming that it was his mother's maiden name. [...] When asked by the judge for his name before he came to Lincolnshire, he said [...] "Turpin". [...] Without leaving the courtroom the jury found Turpin guilty of the first charge of stealing the mare and foal, and following further proceedings, guilty of stealing the gelding. [...] Throughout the trial Turpin had repeatedly claimed that he had not been allowed enough time to form his defence, that proceedings should be delayed until he could call his witnesses, and that the trial should be held at Essex. [...] Before sentencing him, the judge asked Turpin if he could offer any reason why he should not be sentenced to death; Turpin said: [...] "It is very hard upon me, my Lord, because I was not prepar'd for my Defence." [...] The judge replied: [...] "Why was you not? [...] <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> Time of the Assizes as well as any Person here." [...] Despite Turpin's pleas that he had been told the trial would be held in Essex, the judge replied: [...] "Whoever told you so were highly to blame; and as your country have found you guilty of a crime worthy of death, it is my office to pronounce sentence against you", sentencing him to death.|$|E
