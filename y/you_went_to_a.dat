2500|$|In 1976, Interview {{with the}} Vampire by Anne Rice was published. The main character, {{although}} dark, wanted companionship and love. The book, according to music journalist Dave Thompson, slowly created {{an audience for}} gothic rock by word of mouth. The same year saw the punk rock band the Damned debut. The group's vocalist, Dave Vanian, was a former gravedigger who dressed like a vampire. Brian James, a guitarist for the group, noted, [...] "Other groups had safety pins and the spitting and bondage trousers, but <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Damned show, and half the local cemetery would be propped up against the stage".|$|E

I don't think much of it all, Mr Brodrick; but when the stake is so high, it is worth playing for.

5000|$|The {{promotion}} manual {{also had}} lots of ideas for radio disc jockeys to promote the film, including a special scream in.

[...] Those with the best set of lungs would win free passes to the film. The manual also encouraged the DJs to attend dressed as funeral attendants and give each girl a white lily and each boy a blood-red carnation.|$|E

50|$|For {{instance}} Black Scholes theory claims {{vanilla option}} pricing {{can be achieved}} {{through the use of}} stock and zero-coupon bond. A simple example would be if <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bank and purchased a synthetic ETF for the purpose of replication. That fund may represent a certain group of stocks in Apple. However, the synthetic ETF is in no way physically attached to Apples stock. The bank you purchased the fund from would largely mirror Apples stock performance 100% through the use of derivatives and swaps in the process of replication and would charge you a fee for it. This is an extremely simple example but does describe the base process of synthetic replication.|$|E

40|$|I {{was talking}} with some friends recently, friends who don't own a computer. They were {{thinking}} of getting one so they could use Amazon. com to buy books and CDs. Not to use “the Internet,''not to use “the Web,''but to use Amazon. com. Now, that's the classic definition of a “killer application'': one that makes someone {{go out and buy}} a computer. What's interesting is that the killer application is no longer a desktop productivity application or even a back-office enterprise software system, but an individual web site. And once you start thinking of web sites as applications, you soon come to realize that they represent an entirely new breed, something you might call an “information application,''or perhaps even “infoware. ''Information applications are used to computerize tasks that just couldn't be handled in the old computing model. A few years ago, if you wanted to search a database of a million books, you talked to a librarian, who knew the arcane search syntax of the available computerized search tools and might be able to find what you wanted. If you wanted to buy a book, <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bookstore, and looked through its relatively small selection. Now, tens of thousands of people with no specialized training find and buy books online from that million-record database every day. The secret is that computers have come one step closer to the way that people communicate with each other. Web-based applications use plain English to build their interface [...] words and pictures, not specialized little controls that acquire meaning only as you learn the software. Traditional software embeds small amounts of information in a lot of software, infoware embeds small amounts of software in a lot of information. The “actions''in an infoware product are generally fairly simple: make a choice, buy or sell, enter a small amount of data, and get back a customized result...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays in the {{developed}} world, almost everyone has a smartphone with which people stay connected: we communicate between themselves, we control work e-mail, personal e-mail, and we have multiple calendars and reminders of birthdays, work meetings, doctor appointments and stuff. We are online 24 h of our time, we share our thoughts, pictures or videos on Facebook, twitter, or other social networks. We look for jobs through LinkedIn through the screen of our smartphone. We can watch TV-series’ episodes on our smartphones without downloading the file, just by streaming {{the data from the}} cloud. We can book flights, restaurants, hotels, everything through the Internet on our smartphone. If we get lost on the road, we can use our smartphone to guide us back home or to take us to our destination. Few years ago, in the 1980 s, this was not like this. Few years ago, you could not read the news anywhere other than in a newspaper, you could not book flights or hotels unless <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> travel agency and if you wanted to keep track and not miss any meetings or birthdays, you had to write everything on an agenda (and check it every day to know what you had to do). Even when the Internet became mainstream and available to the majority of society, you had to be {{in front of a computer}} to do some of this things. So, what happened in order for us to be able to do all this things mentioned before, on the go, virtually anywhere? The smartphone boom explains this as it has given society, and more specifically, smartphone owners, lots of capabilities at the reach of the hand no matter where you physically are. But, what is a smartphone? How has it evolved in the years that the concept has existed? Even though there had been research for a while and some concepts appeared before Apple’s smartphone, the company from Cupertino changed the rules of the game. When Steve Jobs announced the iPhone in June 2007, people divided into the ones seeing the potential and great achievements by the people from Apple and the ones that believed it was going to be a failure in the market. Actually, none of the concepts unveiled by Jobs when announcing the iPhone were completely new: touchscreens had been known for some time and other manufacturers were using it in their products (or not used because it was believed not to be a success as Nokia seemed to think) ...|$|E

30|$|Another {{important}} {{benefit of}} walking around {{is that it}} helped keep students on task, reducing {{the need for more}} direct confrontation.
