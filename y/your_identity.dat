As the show begins, aspiring journalist Zoe Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the [...] "Fairfax County Council" [...] beat to covering [...] "'what's behind the veil' of power in the Capitol hallways." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times notes {{that by the end of}} the first episode, Mara's Barnes is among the cadre of Frank's accomplices. After she pleads for a relationship with him by promising to earn his trust and not [...] "ask any questions", Frank uses her fiendishly. However, Ashley Parker of The New York Times considers her unfathomably aggressive and too overt, transactional and sexual. Parker points out that Barnes' statement [...] "I protect <b>your</b> <b>identity,</b> I print what you tell me, and I'll never ask any questions" [...] almost discredits itself.|$|E

The image supposedly reflects a national character— that is, if you are Australian, some of these characteristics make up <b>your</b> <b>identity.</b> Many people argue that this image is outdated and inaccurate. In fact, Russel Ward (1958) argues that the image should be understood as typical, not common.|$|E
2500|$|Use of {{the term}} [...] "spyware" [...] has {{eventually}} declined as the practice of tracking users has been pushed ever further into the mainstream by major websites and data mining companies; these generally break no known laws and compel users to be tracked, not by fraudulent practices per se, but by the default settings created for users and the language of terms-of-service agreements. In one documented example, on CBS/CNet News reported, on March 7, 2011, [...] on a Wall Street Journal analysis revealing the practice of Facebook and other websites of tracking users' browsing activity, linked to their identity, far beyond users' visits and activity within the Facebook site itself. The report stated: [...] "Here's how it works. You go to Facebook, you log in, you spend some time there, and then ... you move on without logging out. Let's say the next site you go to is New York Times. Those buttons, without you clicking on them, have just reported back to Facebook and Twitter that you went there and also <b>your</b> <b>identity</b> within those accounts. Let's say you moved on to something like a site about depression. This one also has a tweet button, a Google widget, and those, too, can report back {{who you are and}} that you went there."

2500|$|Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun named The Veronicas [...] "album of the week" [...] on 20 November 2014. Most of {{the tracks}} were deemed [...] "effortless" [...] and he welcomed their return to music saying, [...] "The world of pop is a more {{exciting}} and interesting place with The Veronicas out of traction and back in action." [...] Tim Byron of The Guardian welcomed the experimental sounds of [...] "Sanctified", [...] "Teenage Millionaire" [...] and [...] "You Ruin Me". However, he opined {{that some of the}} songs were [...] "outdated" [...] saying, [...] "outside of these often interesting experiments, {{about a third of the}} album – such as [...] "If You Love Someone" [...] or [...] "Mad Love" [...] – reeks of a tired formula that the Origliasso sisters have clearly outgrown." [...] Similarly, a writer for mX suggested that songs such as [...] "Mad Love" [...] and [...] "Teenage Millionaire" [...] were out-dated and would have been better additions to their previous album Hook Me Up (2007). However, compliments were given for the tracks [...] "Line Of Fire," [...] "Let Me Out" [...] and [...] "You Ruin Me" [...] which the reviewer felt [...] "hint at what might have been, but all too often this album gives doughnuts." [...] Jenny Valentish of Rolling Stone Australia described The Veronicas as being [...] "rife with trend-hopping chart-stormers" [...] and awarded the album four stars. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Craig Mathieson gave the album four stars and praised the lyrics saying that several songs [...] "marks their lyrical shift from the uneasy negotiations of adolescence to forging <b>your</b> <b>identity</b> as an adult." [...] He felt that there could have been clearer editing, however he said that [...] "nonetheless The Veronicas remain committed and creative." [...] The Veronicas was well received by The Courier-Mail's Noel Mengel who praised tracks such as [...] "Cold", [...] "Cruel", [...] "Sanctified", [...] "Always", [...] "Line of Fire" [...] and [...] "You and Me". However, he considered the 14 track album to be [...] "too long." [...] James d'Apice criticised the overly [...] "derivative" [...] album stating that [...] "originality is not their strong suit", but admitted that it [...] "doesn’t prevent them from being fun!" ...|$|E
