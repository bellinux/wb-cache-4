There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E

25|$|The Te Deum, Op. 103, is a cantata for soprano and {{baritone}} solo, {{choir and}} orchestra to the Latin {{text of the}} famous hymn Te Deum (God, we laud <b>You).</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> composed in 1892 and dedicated to the 400th anniversary {{of the discovery of}} America. The composition had been completed before Dvořák moved to America and was commissioned by Jeanette Thurber in 1891, when the composer accepted a position as director of her school.

The child abuse allegations polarized some of the siblings, with some of them rejecting the claims.|$|E

500|$|The cast of Twin Peaks did {{not know}} who would be {{revealed}} as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland {{would not be the}} eventual murderer; as the parent of a young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said [...] "Ray, it was <b>you,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was [...] "beautiful", and that it left him and his character [...] "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.|$|E

500|$|Nilsen {{performed}} at the annual Øyafestivalen (Island festival) on 10 August 2012. The music festival is held at Middelalderparken (Medieval park) in Nilsen's hometown of Oslo, Norway. [...] Nilsen had previously performed there as a backing singer for Jens Carelius. [...] The festival features four stages, and during Nilsen's opening song, [...] "Ta meg med" [...] (Take me with <b>you),</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to hear the soundcheck of the black metal band, Nekromantheon, but Nilsen seemed unaffected. [...] Among concert reviews, Nilsen was described by one writer as [...] "a fascinating hybrid of melancholy, vulnerable sweetness and inner strength..." [...] This was Nilsen's first concert since the Rockefeller in March 2012, and since giving birth to a daughter two months previous. [...] Commenting on the most recent phase of her life, Nilsen said, [...] "Now I've also got a million new things to write about, there's so much I want to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{time-frame}} of {{the original}} band's career, Van der Graaf Generator have been frequently {{referred to as a}} progressive rock band. Writing in Record Collector, Toby Manning said the music was [...] "philosophical, even intellectual, complex [...]. at times, terrifying". While the music on The Aerosol Grey Machine (September 1969) has a more pastoral, hippie feel, with prominent use of Hammill's acoustic guitar, later work featured more complex instrumentation and arrangements. Hammill thinks the style of the band evolved due to the culture of music in the late 1960s, stating [...] "the whole of music was laid out in front of <b>you...</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the blues in wonky time signatures." [...] Both Hammill and Banton have stated that Jimi Hendrix was an influence on the band's sound, with Hammill remarking that [...] "there'd been distortion before, but there hadn't been that real out-there attitude to sound in itself". The group's experimental style has also been compared to Krautrock bands such as Can. Because of their musical influences and line-up, the band tended to play darker musical themes than other progressive bands, {{with the possible exception of}} King Crimson. However, Hammill has stated that the group is still fun to work with, stating [...] "as far as we're concerned, it's serious fun, but fun nonetheless." ...|$|E
500|$|On its review, Monthly Film Bulletin {{qualified}} Presley's {{career as}} [...] "one {{of the most}} puzzling and less agreeable aspects of modern popular music". the review declared: [...] "Presley adopts a slurred and husky style of delivery {{and a series of}} grotesque body gestures to impose on his otherwise innocuous material a suggestive meaning.... in 'Loving You' he is allowed more scope and is at times both the cause and sum total of the film's somewhat doubtful entertainment value." [...] Down Beat opened its review mentioning the negative reception of Presley by the press, indicating that while other publications [...] "hotly despised" [...] him, Down Beat was [...] "prepared to dismiss him with a decimating round of punfire". [...] The reviewer, however noted that after watching Loving <b>You,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "amiss to speak unkindly of [...] ", and that the film was [...] "a rather entertaining pic". It remarked the [...] "resourcefulness" [...] of Lizabeth Scott, the [...] "positive acting ability augmented by a fresh prettiness" [...] of Dolores Hart, and the [...] "witty lines and range of expressions" [...] delivered by Wendell Corey. The review favored Presley, describing his performance as [...] "an overpowering, if touchingly naive, celluloid sexuality." [...] It concluded: [...] "For all his high-voltage on-stage erotica... he plays the sullen country boy convincingly... evincing all the emotion of a well bred head of livestock." ...|$|E

500|$|The Guitar Trio {{continued}} touring in 1980. De Lucía reportedly {{suffered from}} headaches and backaches while performing because {{he found it}} difficult to improvise and follow McLaughlin and Coryell's advanced knowledge of jazz improvisation. Paco professed, [...] "Some people assume that they were learning from me, but I can tell <b>you</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me learning from them. I have never studied music, I am incapable of studying harmony—I don't have the discipline, playing with McLaughlin and Di Meola was about learning these things." [...] In 1981, Coryell was replaced with Di Meola, and The Guitar Trio released one of their most successful records, Friday Night in San Francisco, which sold over 1 million copies and generated a significant interest in flamenco music in America and Europe. It featured an extended combination of Mediterranean Sundance and Río Ancho; this became arguably the piece most associated with the musicians. De Lucía also formed the Paco de Lucía Sextet in 1981 (which included his brothers Ramón and Pepe), and released the first of its three albums that same year. On 30 August 1981, de Lucía performed a solo set at St. Goarshausen in Germany, where he performed Monasterio de Sal and Montino among others and later performed with The Guitar Trio. The event was broadcast on national WDR television.|$|E
500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get <b>you.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when you grow up like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood. Those were exchanged for hard work, struggle and pain, and eventual material and professional success".|$|E
