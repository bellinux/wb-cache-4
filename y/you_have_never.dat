Grant {{said that he was}} attending the Conservative and Labour conferences as well, but told Lib Dem activists that [...] "You, more {{than any of the other}} parties, have a good bill of health. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been in bed with these scumbags." ...|$|E
500|$|K. M. Munshi had {{a totally}} {{different}} take on the myth in his Krishnavatara series. Though Putana came with evil intentions, she is portrayed as being happy to see Krishna and her maternal instinct rises, telling her [...] "Take this lovely boy to your breast. You are a wicked and miserable woman. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen joy before, joy which thrills your whole body and mind with mad delight." [...] Overjoyed and forgetful of her poisoned breasts, she took Krishna {{in her lap and}} suckled him. In the process, she surrenders to Krishna saying [...] "I give you all, my beloved child... I am yours." [...] Further, Putana is purified and liberated from her mortal body by Krishna.|$|E

Several other {{memorials}} were built in Arnhem and Oosterbeek, and an annual parade is held in the area. A memorial near the museum reads: [...] "To the People of Gelderland; 50 years ago British and Polish Airborne soldiers fought here against overwhelming odds to open the way into Germany and bring the war to an early end. Instead we brought death and destruction for which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> blamed us. This stone marks our admiration for your great courage remembering especially the women who tended our wounded. In the long winter that followed your families risked death by hiding Allied soldiers and Airmen while members of the resistance led many to safety." ...|$|E

I think it probable, however, that your own {{experience}} may help you. Didn't you once see a young girl whom <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> seen before, whom you didn't know, whom <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> even heard of, yet you became desperately anxious to win her?" ...|$|R

500|$|The Pro Wrestling Torch {{review of}} the main event steel cage match stated that [...] "Tons of {{activity}} outside the cage, in–ring psychology, and intense fan heat made up for a largely mediocre athletic performance by the two men", referring to Konnan and Perro Aguayo. It added that [...] "the wrestling contained on this card impressed those responding to the Torch poll". The Torch rated the opening match at three-and-a-half stars, the second match at four stars, the third match at two and three-quarter stars, the tag match at four and a quarter stars, and the main event at three stars. The tag team match was rated at [...] "9.1" [...] {{out of a possible}} 10 by the registered users of cagematch.net. When the WWE posted clips from the show on their website, they described the show as [...] "the Best PPV <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen".|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{said she}} studied method acting {{to make her}} {{character}} seem real. The actress said that her character is determined and added, [...] "While her father wants her to become an accountant she aspires to become the leading model in fashion industry". [...] Addressing rumours that the film was an exposé of the fashion industry, she said, [...] "It is nothing like that. Whatever problems that come up to my character in the film are {{not because of the}} profession but because of the choices that my character makes in her life". Ranaut said, [...] "In this script my character is such that you get to express you emotions, emotions that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> delivered before in front of the camera. So when I heard the script, it was something new and much more challenging, more interesting and exciting." [...] Godse said that she accepted her role in the film because she identified with her character, Janet Sequira, whom she described [...] as [...] "outgoing, vibrant, bold and outspoken". Arjan Bajwa described his character, an aspiring fashion model, as uncompromising, achieving success in his own way. Samir Soni found his role as a closeted fashion designer very challenging, requiring research to flesh out the character and his personality. Soni's greatest challenge was to avoid a stereotypical homosexual character, instead subtly expressing his sexuality in his personality and relationships with the film's other characters.|$|E
500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "The film may be animated, and largely taken up with rats, but its pulse is gratifyingly human. And <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen a computer-animated feature {{with this sort of}} visual panache and detail." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "So many computer-animated movies are brash, loud and popping with pop-culture comedy, but Ratatouille has the warm glow of a {{favorite}} book. The characters are {{more than the sum of}} their gigabyte-consuming parts – they feel handcrafted." [...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "Has Pixar lost its magic recipe? Ratatouille is filled with fairly generic animated imagery, a few modest chases, a couple of good gags, not a lot of laughs." [...] Scott Foundas of LA Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Bird has taken the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whipped them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "It's not just the computer animation that is vibrantly three-dimensional. It's also the well-rounded characters... I defy you to name another animated film so overflowing with superfluous beauty." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "With Ratatouille, Bird once again delivers not just a great, witty story, but dazzling visuals as well." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four and a half stars out of five, saying [...] "Like the burbling soup that plays a key part in Ratatouille, the movie is a delectable blend of ingredients that tickles the palette and leaves you hungry for more." ...|$|E

500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but you must have the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E

2500|$|President Erdoğan {{has said}} that the marchers are {{supporting}} terrorism: [...] "If you are launching a march for terrorists and for their supporters, something which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> thought about doing against terrorist groups, you can convince no one that your aim is justice." [...] He said that the opposition party's actions exceeded the scope of political opposition and said that they were [...] "acting with terrorist organisations and the forces inciting them against our country". Erdoğan likened the march to the coup attempt: [...] "The coup soldiers had their F-16s and tanks; Kılıçdaroğlu has his march." ...|$|E

After all, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> seen or examined me before," [...] only to be told that [...] "it was unnecessary; the documentary evidence [...] is very copious and completely substantiated. It is overwhelming." [...] Ludwig was transported to Berg Castle on the shores of Lake Starnberg, south of Munich.|$|E
2500|$|The working {{title for}} the first track [...] "Intro" [...] is [...] "Attempted Assassination". Papoose said he was using the song [...] "more as a {{preparing}} the listener for what type of album, what type of experience they [...] about to have. I’m just basically setting the stage then an interlude." [...] The intro features samples from Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr. speeches. The third track [...] "Mother Ghetto" [...] is about loving and representing where you are from. Papoose being from Brooklyn, New York he said the song will give you and inside look to the city even if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been there. Papoose would say his Mobb Deep collaboration [...] "Aim, Shoot" [...] was recorded in 2012 even through the feud that went on between members Havoc and Prodigy.

2500|$|... "Mabel," [...] Lunn wrote, [...] "was invincibly English and I {{was much}} consoled during the dark days of 1940 {{by the fact}} that her {{confidence}} in final victory was never shaken." [...] Lunn once said something nice to their daughter Jaqueta about the latter's courage during an air raid. For this he was later reproved by Mabel. [...] "I want Jaqueta to feel," [...] she said, [...] "that the only thing which calls for comment in war time is cowardice." [...] Lunn was an agnostic when they married, and Mabel a devout Anglican, which she remained all her life. Lunn wrote: [...] "Mabel's husband, brother and three children became Catholics, but I never expected her to follow our example. Humanly speaking, she was bound to remain a member of the Church of England." [...] An Anglican vicar once asked Lunn to preach in his church. [...] "I asked you," [...] he said, [...] "because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> written anything unpleasant about Anglicanism since you became a Roman Catholic." [...] But Lunn could never have written [...] "anything unpleasant" [...] about Mabel's Church, and when the first shock of his conversion was over, [...] "Mabel soon yielded not merely notional but real assent to the belief that the doctrinal differences which separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the Catholic were infinitely, yes infinitely, less than those which had separated Mabel the Anglican from Arnold the agnostic." ...|$|E
