He says {{the advantage of}} working with clay {{is that you can}} feel the transitions and feel where there is too much surface or more surface needed. He suggests that you could almost design a car blind, because [...] "you don't have to see it, you have to feel it, and by feeling it <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> it's right or it's not right".|$|E
2500|$|Gil Scott-Heron {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, was an opera singer who {{performed}} with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed [...] "The Black Arrow", was a Jamaican football player in the 1950s who {{became the first black}} man to play for Celtic Football Club in Glasgow. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in The Bronx in New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, [...] "'How would <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And [...] said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'" [...] This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron's later recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How would <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>if</b> you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E

They believe it is the money he wants, and when they call him a tailor, they think that he must be mean. He is not mean. He is clever, and can talk about things better than my cousin. He can work hard and give away all that he earns. And so could his father. They gave all they had to us, and have never asked it again. I kissed him once,--and then he said I had paid all my mother's debt." [...] Alice Bluestone shrank within herself when she was told by this {{daughter}} of a countess of such a deed. It was horrid to her mind that a tailor should be kissed by a Lady Anna Lovel. But she herself had perhaps been as generous to the black-browed young barrister, and had thought no harm. [...] "They think I do not understand,--but I do. They all want this money, and then they accuse him, and say he does it that he may become rich. He would give up all the money,--just for me.

'No,' said Nicholas, 'and {{for that}} reason poverty should engender an honest pride, {{that it may not}} lead and tempt us to unworthy actions, and that we may {{preserve}} the self-respect which a hewer of wood and drawer of water may maintain, and does better in maintaining than a monarch in preserving his. Think what we owe to these two brothers: remember what they have done, and what they do every day for us with a generosity and delicacy for which the devotion of our whole lives would be a most imperfect and inadequate return. What kind of return would that be which would be comprised in our permitting their nephew, their only relative, whom they regard as a son, and for whom it would be mere childishness to suppose they have not formed plans suitably adapted to the education he has had, and the fortune he will inherit--in our permitting him to marry a portionless girl: so closely connected with us, that the irresistible inference must be, that he was entrapped by a plot; that it was a deliberate scheme, and a speculation amongst us three? Bring the matter clearly before yourself, mother. Now, how would <b>you</b> <b>feel,</b> <b>if</b> they were married, and the brothers, coming here on one of those kind errands which bring them here so often, you had to break out to them the truth?
