500|$|Like the Harrison–Shankar North American tour, Dark Horse {{received}} mainly unfavourable {{reviews from}} music critics, {{many of whom}} condemned Harrison for his hoarse singing and for having rushed the recording to capitalise on the tour. In his highly unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller considered [...] "So Sad" [...] to be [...] "one of the album's few resonant moments" [...] and a song that [...] "probably tells the truth" [...] regarding Harrison's state of mind, unlike [...] "Bye, Bye Love", which he found [...] "a sick man's idea of a joke". Bob Woffinden of the NME labelled [...] "So Sad" [...] "a trite, self-pitying number, both unoriginal and lifeless, with the vocals again sounding portentous and unnatural". Woffinden added: [...] "When somebody sings 'While his memory raced/with much speed and great haste', <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> the lyricist is floundering and filling in lines." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s nothing worse than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E
500|$|Jason Fox for NME {{felt that}} [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] was Oasis's {{return to the}} [...] "long lost humanism" [...] of their 1996 single [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", because of Noel Gallagher's ability to lighten the mood of his {{audience}} {{when they are in}} need. He further wrote that the listener is transported back when [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] was released. Simon Evans for musicOMH also compared the song to [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger", writing that they have the same [...] "defiance". Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic was brief in his review of the song, simply writing that it is a [...] "pretty good power ballad". Evan Chakroff for Stylus Magazine wrote that the song was forgettable, adding that while writing his review of the album, he could not remember the melody of [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out". Victoria Segal for NME wrote a single review when it was released, and believed that it was difficult to take the song seriously. Segal wrote that it is a [...] "disappointing" [...] song that when [...] "looked at in the sober light of day, it's nothing but a lachrymose slur through the Big Noel Book Of Emotional Cliches and some truly shameless piano, but <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> that come closing time, it could make a breeze block cry". BBC reviewer Chris Long stated he preferred previous single [...] "The Hindu Times" [...] but [...] "Stop Crying Your Heart Out" [...] delivered on the [...] "simple tunes, good strong riffs and textbook lyrics" [...] in which Gallagher specialized.|$|E

500|$|On the film's Rotten Tomatoes listing, 57% {{of critics}} gave the film {{positive}} reviews from {{a total of}} 23 reviews. DVD Authority says [...] "After this one, the other Jaws movies seemed to just not be as good." [...] One review says: [...] "it's obviously not a patch on Spielberg's classic, but it's {{about as good as}} could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters." [...] The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton are particularly praised. George Morris for the Texas Monthly preferred Jaws 2 over the original because it is [...] "less insidious in its methods of manipulation" [...] and [...] "because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials' efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going." [...] However, Morris' review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing [...] "producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster." [...] Similarly, John Simon felt that the [...] "shark's waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg's manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately..."Simon praises Scheider and Hamilton, but is less complimentary about Gary. A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it [...] "seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary". [...] The Radio Times was not pleased with Jaws 2, calling it a [...] "pale imitation of the classic original" [...] and stating that [...] "the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> how everyone is going to react — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark." ...|$|E

2500|$|The character, Frasier Crane, {{was created}} in the third season of Cheers (19841985) by series creators Glen and Les Charles as Diane Chambers's (Shelley Long) [...] "romantic and {{intellectual}} ideal" [...] following her breakup with Sam Malone (Ted Danson). Not only Sam Malone's rival and opposite, Frasier Crane was also part of the love triangle, [...] "a different form to the Sam-Diane relationship," [...] said Glen Charles. The show's writers initially conceived the character as [...] "the role Ralph Bellamy used to play in Cary Grant movies — the guy the lady falls in love with, but is not real. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>know</b> he doesn't have the sexual dynamism Grant does." [...] John Lithgow was originally chosen by Cheers producers for the role, but turned it down. Grammer believed that he had failed the audition because no one laughed, but was chosen because of the quality of his performance with Danson. Frasier was supposed to only appear on a few episodes before Diane left him, but Grammer's performance was praised by series executives, leading to an extended role in the series.
