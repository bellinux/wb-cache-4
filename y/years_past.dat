5|$|On June 24, WWE {{announced}} {{on its website}} that a supplemental draft would take place on June 25 at noon ET. The supplemental draft, like the previous year, was conducted randomly, with each brand receiving random draft selections. Wrestlers affected by the televised draft were exempt from the supplemental draft. Because professional wrestling is scripted, outcomes are usually predetermined. Unlike <b>years</b> <b>past,</b> during this draft, many employees in WWE were not told whether they were scripted to change brands.|$|E
5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>past</b> and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been generated on the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Chiappucci {{believed}} that the descents of the mountains included in the race were very difficult. An El País writer found the route to be more mountainous than in <b>years</b> <b>past.</b> In addition, the writer mentioned {{that the increase in}} mountains within the route coupled with the reduced amount of time trial kilometers, including the lack of a prologue, favored Marco Pantani. Three-time winner Gino Bartali {{believed that}} the route for the Giro was harder than the same year's Tour de France course.|$|E

5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne. Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski {{on one side and the}} pro-Maximilain Zborowski family on the other. The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated <b>years</b> <b>past</b> and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} long-lived, which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of <b>years</b> <b>past</b> leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 years or more.|$|E
5|$|The date of {{the draft}} was set for June 2–4, and would occur as a conference call to the Commissioner of Baseball's office in New York. Unlike the 1987 NFL Draft, which aired on ESPN, no network {{televised}} the MLB draft. High school seniors, college juniors and seniors, and anyone who had never played under a professional contract were considered eligible to be drafted. For the first time, junior college players would also {{be included in the}} June draft; in <b>years</b> <b>past,</b> teams would select junior college players in a separate draft.|$|E

5|$|The {{new point}} {{system for the}} general {{classification}} was met with some resistance as many people were very confused by how the new system operated or simply preferred the original system the organizers had used in <b>years</b> <b>past.</b> In response to the confusion surrounding the general classification format, the race organizers released a supplement to help better explain how the new points system operated. A La Stampa writer claimed that the supplement provided several lengthy example calculations and stated that they would know after the first stage how successful this new system will be.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the party, {{the reunification}} of worlds has opened the {{pathways}} to ancient sites where weapons and powers used to quell Enuo's rise a thousand <b>years</b> <b>past</b> lay in wait. So armed, the party enters the Rift, seeking out Exdeath {{at the center of}} the inter-dimensional nexus where they, too, fall prey to the Void. With help from their fallen allies, the party survives and is returned before Exdeath, now manifested as a demonic sylvan, battling him until he weakens and is swallowed by his own power. He then transforms into Neo Exdeath, intent on destroying the very essence of reality, himself with it. Exdeath is ultimately defeated, and, using the power of the Crystal shards, the heroes seal the Void once more and restore the reunified world and its Crystals. The game's ending varies based on how many party members are still alive at Neo Exdeath's defeat, detailing the events after the world's resurrection. At the end, the remaining group visits the Guardian Tree, and find that the fallen party members have returned to life.|$|E
5|$|Of the 56 riders that {{signed up}} to {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in <b>years</b> <b>past.</b> The organizers allowed the participating teams to have up to four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and so all the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Gianni Bugno. He {{also stated that}} Claudio Chiappucci would likely contend for the overall crown due to his good form coming into the race. According to Paolo Viberti of El País, Bugno came in as the odds on favorite to win the race. Eugenio Capodacqua of La Repubblica and La Stampas Gianni Ranieri believed that the race was going be won by either Chiappucci or Bugno. Despite being favored to win the race, Bugno entered the race with no victories to his name that season. American Greg LeMond told the press he planned to be more competitive at this Giro than he had in <b>years</b> <b>past.</b> Other favorites to win the race were Laurent Fignon, Pedro Delgado, and Marino Lejarreta.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. Points were {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. In the 2010 Tour, any hors catégorie, first-, or second-category climb awarded double points if it was the last of the stage. In 2011, only the summit stage finishes awarded double points, specifically stages 12, 14, 18 and 19. Pre-race analysis speculated that the winner would be more likely, under this system, to be a general classification contender than in <b>years</b> <b>past.</b> This speculation proved accurate, as Samuel Sánchez, who finished sixth in the general classification, won the mountains classification, and the top three finishers in the general classification were in the top five of the mountains classification. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 2010–11 season, James {{embraced the}} villain role that was {{bestowed}} upon {{him by the}} media. He played for the Heat with an angry demeanor and less joy than in <b>years</b> <b>past,</b> and later admitted that he regretted this approach. On December 2, he faced the Cavaliers in Cleveland {{for the first time}} since departing as a free agent. He scored 38 points and led Miami to a win while being booed every time he touched the ball. He finished the season with averages of 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7 assists per game on 51 percent shooting. Miami entered the playoffs as the East's second seed and advanced to the Finals before stumbling against the Dallas Mavericks, losing in six games despite holding a 2–1 series lead going into Game 4. James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series. His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.|$|E

5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two <b>years</b> <b>past</b> the age of puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, {{it appears that the}} eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E
5|$|While the {{scientists}} argued over classifications and nomenclature, they also returned west for more fossils. Marsh made his last trip backed by Yale in 1873, {{with a large}} group of thirteen students accompanying him, protected by a group of soldiers who wanted to make a show of force to the Sioux tribe. Due to concerns over his more lavish and expensive expeditions in <b>years</b> <b>past,</b> Marsh had the students pay their own way, and the trip cost Yale only $1857.50, far less than the $15,000 (over $200,000 in modern currency) that Marsh had claimed for the previous expedition. This excursion would prove to be Marsh's last: {{for the rest of the}} Bone Wars, Marsh preferred to enlist the services of local collectors. Though he had enough bones to study for years, the scientist's appetite for more would grow. Cope was even more prolific in his collecting that season than he was in 1872, although Marsh's penchant for cultivating collectors of his own meant that at Bridger his rival was persona non grata. Tired of working under Hayden, Cope found a paying job with the Army Corps of Engineers, but was limited by this federal association; while Cope had to tag along on surveys, Marsh could collect wherever he pleased.|$|E
5|$|Other {{ichthyosaur}} remains {{had been}} discovered in <b>years</b> <b>past</b> at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings {{was the first to}} come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking {{it was a kind of}} fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name Ichthyosaurus (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.|$|E
