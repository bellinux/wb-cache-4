Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain Beach demonstrated {{the lifting of the}} ban by walking though the ship smoking a cigar, blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> do this?" [...] He recorded in his log that [...] "it took some 37seconds for the word to get around." [...] On 20 April 1960, the Triton crossed the Prime Meridian, and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.|$|E
500|$|Deja Entendus first single, [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows", {{impacted}} radio airplay in July 2003, a {{month after}} the album's release. The song was said to be about regret, or, as Lacey stated, [...] "how there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It's kind of something that if it wasn't overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it." [...] The song's music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it [...] "is about death or losing someone and it's those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> change". They also made a music video for the second single, [...] "Sic Transit Gloria... Glory Fades," [...] where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. [...] "Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else," [...] he said, [...] "there's a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song." [...] Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went [...] "virtually unnoticed", with the videos finding [...] "constant" [...] airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst [...] "The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows" [...] peaked at number 37 on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day?

She also made a list of their [...] "14 Anime Marksmen That You Can't Hide From", where she ranked 14th, as well as the [...] "15 Anime Characters <b>You</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>You</b> <b>Could</b> Waifu", with author Aaron Magulick adding [...] "Sinon is calm and cool, but she'll snipe you right in the heart. Once you get past her cold exterior, you'll find a loving person that'll protect you from afar. Which works when you're stuck in a gun-based mmo." [...] A Newtype character poll had Sinon placed first in female characters, notably edging out fellow Sword Art Online character Asuna. In a fan contest where respondents chose between 41 options for the next Sword Art Online figurine, Sinon placed fourth (Gun Gale Online version) and ninth (ALfheim Online version).|$|E

Think how this must appear among the powdered heads of Paris! I wish every lady and gentleman in France would only be so obliging as to follow my fashion, comb their own heads as I do mine, dismiss their friseurs, and pay me half the money they pay to them." ...|$|E

[...] If {{you are going to be}} engaged, and so can not attend to him, say to him that <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> talk with him, and answer the questions, but that you are going to be busy and can not do it; and then, after providing him with some other means of occupation, require him to be silent: though even then you ought to relieve the tedium of silence for him by stopping every ten or fifteen minutes from your reading, or your letter-writing, or the planning of your work, or whatever your employment may be, and giving your attention to him for a minute or two, and affording him an opportunity to relieve the pressure on his mind by a little conversation.|$|E

Description of Task The task of this project is to enable the creation of on-the-fly visualizations for interfaces geared toward natural sketch-like input such as touch and pen interfaces. The hope is that this will become useful as interfaces shift from traditional keyboard+mouse interactions, to more free-form, widely applicable touch, gesture, and drawing kinds of interactions.
