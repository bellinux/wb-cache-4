2500|$|In {{the same}} Entertainment Weekly article, Corgan {{disclosed}} that {{things went wrong}} {{at some of the}} very first recording sessions. [...] "...it was like, 'What do you mean the guitar's out of tune? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> have to be there at 11? What do <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> <b>I</b> can't order $100 of lobster every day?' I mean, like, bad. But it was too late. It was already public. The album was going out. So I did what I always did: try {{to make the best of}} a situation and start covering up. Put on a good face. And honestly, I'm glad the thing didn't sell, because if it had sold well it would have been really tough. I would look like I was going to walk away from something that I'd just built." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November, Hannam, Hewett and {{the head}} of Eastbourne CID, Detective Inspector Pugh, searched Adams' house with a warrant issued (in Pugh's name) under the Dangerous Drugs Act 1951. When told they were looking for, [...] "Morphine, Heroin, Pethidine and the like", Adams was surprised: [...] "Oh, that group. You will find none here. I haven't any. I very seldom ever use them", he said. When Hannam asked for Adams' Dangerous Drugs Register – the record of those ordered and used – Adams responded: [...] "I don't know what <b>you</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> keep no register." [...] He had not kept one since 1949. When shown a list of {{dangerous}} drugs he had prescribed Morrell, and asked who administered them, Adams said, [...] "I did nearly all. Perhaps the nurses gave some but mostly me" [...] – contradicting what the nurses' notebooks would show during his trial. Hannam then observed, [...] "Doctor, you prescribed for her 75 – 1/6 grains heroin tablets the day before she died." [...] Adams replied, [...] "Poor soul, she was in terrible agony. It was all used. I used them myself [...] Do you think it is too much?" ...|$|E
