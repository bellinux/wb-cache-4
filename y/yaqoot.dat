50|$|Atranji Khera, {{a village}} near Kasganj, {{is a major}} Archaeological {{excavation}} site. This site was first identified by Sir Alexander Cunningham in 1862. Excavation here began in 1962, which revealed that site was occupied from 1200 B.C to 300 B.C. Various artefacts and ruined structures from ancient town {{have been found in}} Atranji Khera. Another village near Kasganj, Jakhera is also a major archaeological excavation site. Iron tools like sickles, hoes, ploughshare and terracotta figurines have been found from Jakhera which dates back to 1000B.C. to 600B.C. giving evidence that Jakhera was a part of Painted Grey Ware culture and Northern Black Polished Ware culture of ancient India. Currently research is going on the collected artefacts. These evidences show that Kasganj has a rich history since ancient and medieval times.Kasganj was founded by Nawab <b>Yaqoot</b> Ali Khan, a descendent of the Nawabs of Farrukhabad.needed The city was known as <b>Yaqoot</b> Ganj in the early sixteenth century,needed but it later became popularly known as Kasganj because it was established in a thick forest of kans, a vegetation grown abundantly here. The inscription regarding its establishment is still visible in the city's Jama Masjid (big mosque). It is said that the well-protected building at Tehsil Road which houses the tehsil was the residence of Nawab <b>Yaqoot</b> Ali Khan until it was acquired by the British after fall of Awadh.The city was established here because it represented a centre point in the road connections between various small, ancient cities of District Etah, such as Bilram, Marehra, Etah, Sakeet, Atranji Khera and Aligarh. Kasganj is a city of rich cultural heritage. It is the junction of east, west and south UP, that very much reflects through peoples language,dresses and dishes. Direct impact of Brij Pradesh is very much evident. Hindu-Muslim culture is woven fine here. There is a long history of togetherness of both communities with love and respect to each other. Christians and Sikhs are also indispensable part of the society. Some important families of all the communities are the legend of a rich past. The articles,manuscripts of historical importance are available with some families of the city caring for heritage like Rao Mahinder Man Singh, family of Late Kunwar Maharaj Singh Jain, Seth Uttam Chand Chandak, Nawabzada Haji Abdul Sattar Ali Khan(Mukhiya Family), Seth Janki Prashad and some other families from Vaishyas, Brahmins, Thakurs of Piwari, Mehmoodpur, Kendi, Gorha & Kayasths as well.|$|E

This study aims to explore health care students’ perception of the relevance of simulated IPL for rural health care services. Methods: Three focus group interviews were held with pre-registration medical, pharmacy, and allied health students (n= 22). Students worked together to manage complex simulation scenarios in small interprofessional teams. Focus group sessions were held at the end of simulation activities to explore students’ views on the relevance of simulated IPL activities. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the qualitative data obtained from the focus groups. Results: Participants embraced both the interprofessional and the simulation components enthusiastically and perceived these to be useful for their future as rural health care practitioners. Four major themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: appreciation of the role of other health disciplines, collaborative approach to patient care, competency and skills for future health care practice, and relevance for future rural and remote health care practice. Students acknowledged the simulated IPL sessions for improving their understanding of multidisciplinary practice in rural practice and facilitating the appreciation for collaborative practice and expertise. Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, simulated IPL activities seem to be a potential intervention for developing collaborative practice among pre-registration health profession students. However, further evidence is required to assess if positive responses to simulated IPL activities are sustained in practice and translate into improving patient outcome.
