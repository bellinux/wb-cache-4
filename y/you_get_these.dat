500|$|Cole Waterman of PopMatters {{awarded the}} album {{a score of}} eight out of ten, finding the record to be the group's [...] "most {{accessible}} by far". Waterman described the album's composition as [...] "catchy", finding {{it to be an}} appropriate response to the band's previous album Anonymous; he also highlighted the [...] "absurdist" [...] tone of the record's lyrics—pointing out [...] "South Paw" [...] and [...] "Waratorium" [...] as particular examples of this. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson scored Oddfellows 6.8 out of ten, considering it [...] "Tomahawk's most straightforward, stripped-down release to date". Thompson considered the group's main dynamic to consist of Denison's compositions and Patton's vocals, finding that bass player Dunn [...] "hangs back here, ably holding down the low end without overasserting himself". Thompson also debated the effect that the album's short germination period had on its overall composition, believing that the brief recording time lent the record [...] "a feeling that, whenever <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> guys in the same room, this music [...] just comes tearing out".|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the very thing we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then how in {{the name}} of all that is {{wonderful}} did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> facts? They are absolutely correct in every particular." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Where did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all <b>these</b> votes?” Amang Rodriguez, {{the party}} {{president}} would ask.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{see what}} <b>you</b> <b>get</b> of <b>these</b> fellows, besides,' said Pancks' 'See what more <b>you</b> <b>get</b> of <b>these</b> {{precious}} Humming-Tops, revolving among you with such smoothness that you've {{no idea of}} the pattern painted on 'em, or the little window in 'em. I wish to call your attention to myself for a moment. I an't an agreeable style of chap, I know that very well.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The servant {{stood and}} stared like one bereft of wits. [...] "How comes all this change?" [...] said he, [...] "and how did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all <b>these</b> grand things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless you are {{meanwhile}} burned as fuel on the Cairo Railway," [...] I added mentally. [...] "But how," [...] I continued aloud, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> lights?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Philip's papa {{is a rich}} man," [...] says Mrs. Staveley, {{putting my}} own thought into words for me. [...] "Where do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> ideas, Eunice? Surely, you {{are not allowed to}} read novels?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did you do this, M. Paul? Is {{this your}} house? Did you furnish it? Did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> papers printed? Do you mean me? Am I the directress? Is there another Lucy Snowe? Tell me: say something." ...|$|E
6000|$|He whispered and whispered, {{until at}} last the king up and spoke. [...] "Tell me, Jacob Stuck," [...] he said, [...] "where do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all <b>these</b> fine things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said, [...] "but how do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> all <b>these</b> luxuries of civilization?" [...] and I {{pointed to}} the books, the crockery, and the knives and forks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} have had a nice day," [...] he said, [...] "and won't be too tired when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> home. <b>These</b> {{excursions}} are rather hard work. Remember me to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear young man," [...] he exclaimed, [...] "my dear Mr.--Mr. Burton--why, this is wonderful! Where did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> sheets, do you say? Are you {{honestly}} {{telling me that}} they were written within the last thousand years?" ...|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. [extricating {{his hands}} and sitting down] Where on earth did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> morbid tastes? You {{seem to have been}} well brought up in a normal, healthy, respectable, middle-class family. Yet you go on like the most unwholesome product of the rankest Bohemianism.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, haven't you?' {{and he put}} {{his hand}} in my pocket, and brought out ten guineas. 'Hullo!' he said; 'where did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these?</b> You told me {{yesterday}} you had not got a groat. Why, you young villain, you must have been robbing the till!' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>You</b> can <b>get</b> into <b>these</b> two shoes {{only if you}} don’t go anywhere.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Capital, capital,' {{the editor}} said, fondling his big hands softly; 'that'll exactly suit us. And could <b>you</b> <b>get</b> at <b>these</b> plans and papers now, this very evening, just to refresh {{the gaps in}} your memory?' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Passive {{supporters}} often don't know they're supporting terrorism. So when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into <b>these</b> gray areas {{about what}} people know and what they don't know, I think the law {{is going to have}} a difficult time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> facts from Stephen Layard and Miss Layard? Ah! I guessed as much. Well, {{the story}} is a lie; I was merely {{arranging}} her hood which she could not do herself, as the wind forced her to use her hand to hold her dress down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Odd's fish! I'll bear it," [...] said Sir Andrew with a merry laugh, [...] "seeing {{that you}} are alive to give it. [...] . Would you have had me allow Lady Blakeney to do the journey alone? But, {{in the name of}} heaven, man, where did <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> {{extraordinary}} clothes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody has got {{something}} but me. I wish I had a dove, or a hen, {{or even a}} turtle, all my own," [...] thought Nat, feeling very poor as he saw the interesting treasures of the other boys. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> things?" [...] he asked, when he joined Tommy in the barn.|$|E
6000|$|... "More, perhaps, {{than you}} would think, madam," [...] he declared. [...] "He {{knows how to make}} a bargain, believe me. It cost us more than I would like to tell <b>you</b> to <b>get</b> <b>these</b> fellows here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, look here, Marty," [...] {{said the}} barber, sitting {{down on the}} coffin-stool table. [...] "How much do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> for making <b>these</b> spars?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For God's sake! clap on all {{the sail}} <b>you</b> can! <b>Get</b> <b>these</b> reefs out!" [...] With {{trembling}} fingers Ezra let out the sail, and the boat lay over further under the increased pressure. [...] "Is there no other sail that we could put up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a {{suggestion}} to make," [...] said the doctor. [...] "While Mother puts up a lunch, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> youngsters {{so that they}} can keep right side up. Then we'll all take a short hike and show Muldoon how real woodmen can have a hot meal when there is three feet of snow in the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man's manner at once {{softened}} with Western courtesy. He {{swung his}} broad-brimmed hat from his head, and bent his {{body with the}} ceremoniousness of the country ball-room. [...] "I reckon the lady had better {{come up to the}} shanty out o' the dust and sun till we kin help <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> things fixed," [...] he said to the driver. [...] "I'll send round by the road for your hoss, and have one of mine fetch up your wagon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you keep}} yours," [...] he advised. [...] "You're my nearest of kin, Mary, though you're but my cousin's widdy. If {{you can learn}} to keep a still tongue in your head and do what's asked of you, there may be a trifle coming to you when my time comes. But if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> curious fits on you, and they're more than you can stand; if you're going bleating from house to house in the village, and {{spending}} your time in tittle-tattling, then we'll part. Them's plain words, anyhow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, girls," [...] Oswald {{said when}} they reached it, [...] "you must take off your cloaks, and all upper garments. Were <b>you</b> to <b>get</b> <b>these</b> wet <b>you</b> would, before morning, die of cold. Don't lose a moment. Undress under the shelter of these bushes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Ann Veronica Smith," [...] the {{magistrate}} remarked {{when the case}} was all before him, [...] "you're a good-looking, strong, respectable gell, and it's a pity you silly young wimmin can't find something better {{to do with your}} exuberance. Two-and-twenty! I can't imagine what your parents can be thinking about to let <b>you</b> <b>get</b> into <b>these</b> scrapes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Other folks seem {{to share}} it in Winnipeg, Chicago, New York, and Liverpool. <b>You</b> can't <b>get</b> behind <b>these</b> stock statistics, though, of course, dead low prices are apt to cut the output." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, gentlemen," [...] Colonel Inglis said, [...] "our {{thoughts}} {{are all the}} same. We are ready to fight another month, but we dread the delay {{for the sake of}} the women and children. However, God's will be done. All that men can do, this garrison will, I know, do; and with God's help, I believe that whether aid comes a little sooner or later, we shall hold these battered ruins till it arrives. Captain Fellows, will <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> officers something to eat, and some clothes? Then, if they are not too tired, they will perhaps not mind sitting up an hour or two and giving us the news from the outside world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Next term!" [...] he said. [...] "Well, you see, miss, it's this way. It's all there, in {{a manner}} of speaking, with Master Mike. He's got as much style as Mr. Joe's got, every bit. The whole thing is, you see, miss, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> young gentlemen of eighteen, and {{nineteen}} perhaps, and it stands to reason they're stronger. There's a young gentleman, perhaps, doesn't know as much about what I call real playing as Master Mike's forgotten; but then he can hit 'em harder when he does hit 'em, and that's where the runs come in. They aren't going to play Master Mike because he'll be in the England team when he leaves school. They'll give the cap to somebody that can make a few then and there." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{night they}} had a big supper, and all them men and women was there, and I stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them, and the niggers waited on the rest. Mary Jane she set {{at the head of}} the table, with Susan {{alongside}} of her, and said how bad the biscuits was, and how mean the preserves was, and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was--and all that kind of rot, the way women always do for to force out compliments; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop, and said so--said [...] "How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice?" [...] and [...] "Where, for the land's sake, DID <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>these</b> amaz'n pickles?" [...] and all that kind of humbug talky-talk, just the way people always does at a supper, you know.|$|E
5000|$|... "We have a {{law that}} is shaky at best. My feeling is that Sami U.S. v.

6000|$|... "George, do <b>you</b> see to <b>getting</b> <b>these</b> traps {{down to the}} boat. I {{shall be}} there in a quarter of an hour. Is there {{anything}} else that you can think of, or that you want yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said the}} countess, piteously, [...] "you {{can have no}} idea of what I shall have to go through with your father. And, of course, <b>you</b> could <b>get</b> all <b>these</b> things afterwards." ...|$|R
