40|$|Caraway {{has very}} low {{competitive}} ability against most of weed species. Therefore, {{it is important}} to choose a suitable herbicide control, especially at biennial caraway. The experiments with the herbicides applied in caraway were found in pure growth, with variety Kepron (with standard length of ve­ge­ta­ti­ve period). The aim of the trials was to find out the differences at achenes <b>yiled</b> and essential oil content after the treatment by the various herbicides, applied preemergently. Also, the selective ac­ti­vi­ty of individual herbicides was tested, including the different doses. The herbicides used in the ex­pe­ri­ments had enough level of selektivity on the plants of caraway. They had a positive effect on the <b>yiled</b> comparing to non-treated control variant in all observed years. There was no statistically significant difference in essential oil kontent between the treated variants and non-treated control. On the basis of these results, the most suitable herbicide was chosen for the „minor“ registration for caraway...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{show here}} that the <b>YIL</b> 113 w gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a {{functional}} protein phosphatase. <b>Yil</b> 113 p shows no activity in vitro towards either phosphorylated casein or myelin basic protein. However, <b>Yil</b> 113 p dephosphorylates activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 MAP kinase indicating {{that it is a}} dual-specificity MAP kinase phosphatase. In support of this we find that <b>Yil</b> 113 p specifically interacts with the stress-activated Slt 2 /Mpk 1 p MAP kinase of S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, expression of <b>Yil</b> 113 p causes the dephosphorylation of Slt 2 /Mpk 1 p in vivo, while expression of an inactive mutant of <b>Yil</b> 113 p causes the accumulation of phosphorylated Slt 2 /Mpk 1 p.

40|$|Important {{linkages}} between farm management variables, soil loss, crop yields, and incentives to practice soil conservation {{have often been}} omitted from previous empirical studies, due to regional data limitations and incomplete knowledge of soil loss/crop <b>yiled</b> relationships. An optimal control model is developed with explicit attention to interactions between management choices, soil loss, and long-term farmland productivity. Analysis of the optimality conditions generates a number of hypotheses related to farmers' productivity-linked conservation incentives, which can be tested empirically without precise knowledge of specific erosion-productivity relationships.

The problems to cultivate {{the plant in}} this area are shading and water availability. The objective of the research is to describe and evaluate the cultivation of creat between annual tree crops in the estate area. Lands were cleared and plowed to form plots with 20 m x 1. 5 m ridge.

40|$|According to {{vibration}} observation {{from real}} building structures and modal test results in earthquake simulation tests, this paper {{indicates that the}} traditional elastic analysis based on the stiffness determination directly from the geometric dimensions of structural members can only provide a kind of idealized theoretical estimation for the elastic response of structures.

As a result, {{it was found that the}} stiffness eccentricity can not be selected randomly by researchers because it is strongly dependent on the strength eccentricity in most study cases for torsional effects of asymmetric building structures.

The agar yield of the materials kept in the dark condition was the maximum values of 29 %, while the lowest agar yield of 17 % was obtained from sterile plants. The highest gel strength of 919 ± 37. 5 g cm^ was obtained from the cystcarpic plants, while the lowest gel strength of 444 ± 103 g cm^ was obtained from sterile plants.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to evaluate the phenotypic parameters (milk, fat, protein) in a herd of 120 Romanian black spotted dairy cows, in the third lactation, from Dambovita farm, Timis County. Milk samples were collected each day for 305 -day lactation. Lactation records for milk, fat, and protein production of dairy cows were analyzed by fitting a multiple trait animal model using restricted maximum likelihood. Results indicated that average milk yield in the studied herd was 5493. 78 ± 991. 11 kg; fat yield 212. 53 ± 37. 85 kg and protein yield 173. 26 ± 31. 13 kg. The mean percentage of fat in the milk was 3. 9 while that of protein was 3. 2. Values of phenotypic correlation estimated between total 305 -day milk, fat, and protein yields ranged from 0. 88 to 0. 92. Between milk production, milk fat percentage and protein percentage, it was a negative correlation of – 0. 26 and – 0. 24 respectively. For all parameters examined, phenotypic variability was moderate (less than 20 %) which indicates a relatively homogeneous nucleus. The existence of strong positive correlation between milk production and fat yield, but especially between milk production and protein <b>yiled,</b> help the farmers to make the selection of plus variations and to increase the production...|$|E

40|$|Risks {{and returns}} are {{important}} for investors, as they expect high returns with low risk. However, in practice the financial instruments take the high risk high return method, which means the higher the risk of higher returns, the less risk it becomes, the smaller the returns the investor receives. In jurisprudence is known as al ghurm bi al ghunm. Investors who purchase financial instruments can choose financial instruments that generate high returns but the risks are high or choose a monetary policy that lowers risk but low returns are also low. The {{purpose of this study}} is to prove whether Islamic securities have the same characteristics as conventional securities, following the high risk high return method or al ghurm bi al ghunm. That means, the higher the risk will be the higher returns that investors will receive. This study examined whether high risk sukuk will result in high returns and sukuk that have low risk and vice versa. This study was conducted in two stages of analysis, first, comparing the risks and returns between Ijārah sukuk and Muḍārabah sukuk. The second step, measured the impact of some sukuk and coupon risks on sukuk returns using <b>yiled</b> to maturity (YTM). The population of this study is the entire sukuk issued in the Capital Market of Indonesia, while the sample is the Sukuk Mudahrabah and Ijārah which is still circulating from 2010 to 2014. Data analysis used independent sample t test and multiple regression ratios. The findings show that the Muḍārabah sukuk risk and returns are greater than sukuk Ijārah. However, based on independentt test analysis, the returns and risks of both sukuk are not significantly different. Regression results are found that affecting sukuk returns are interest rate risk, maturity, coupon rate and rating. Concurrently, the effect of interest rate, maturity, coupon rate and rating risk on the rate of return of 44...|$|E
