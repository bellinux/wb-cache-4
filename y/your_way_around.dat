5000|$|Dollimore’s essay [...] "On Leaving" [...] (2011) is biographical, {{dealing with}} its author’s teenage years, his arrival at university, then his {{departure}} from that place {{later in his}} life, but it also includes a more abstract discussion of the modern university and its function in society. Dollimore discusses the modern professionalised academy, and argues that it promotes mediocrity: 'the professionally defended arts academic is only half alive'; 'professional success - the successful career - {{is one of the}} most compromised, complicit and corrupt kinds of success available today.' Dollimore claims that, even if it has always been true that 'you have to find <b>your</b> <b>way</b> through or <b>around</b> formal education in search for what really matters,' it is also true that 'never before… has the project of creating value inside of, and against, educational institutions been so necessary.' ...|$|R

50|$|This is a four-wheeled slide {{performed}} on inclines, banks, ditches, and transition. most common riding frontside or straight up the transition. At {{the peak of}} momentum, the rider unweights the board and slides the back wheels up to 'catch up' {{with the rest of}} the body at 90 degrees. Then as the body's momentum returns, the rider pivots the back truck while sliding the front wheels 90 degrees back toward the bottom of the incline. Simply put, backside shred up, pivot back down. A fun lazy way of riding transition backside. if you ride up frontside, you do this trick in a backside 'alley-oop' fashion.
