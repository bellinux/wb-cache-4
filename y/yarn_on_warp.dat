40|$|Yarns of warp beams to knit <b>on</b> <b>warp</b> {{knitting}} machines {{need to be}} wound at equal tensions. The tension variations lead to produce valleys and ridges of <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> <b>on</b> the beam and hence different lengths of individual warp yarns. These length variations lead to loop length variations in warp knitted fabrics and may cause defects along the wales. This research aimed at investigating the warp length variations caused by tension variations {{and its effect on}} the quality of the fabrics knitted. Tension variations of individual <b>warp</b> <b>yarns</b> <b>on</b> <b>warp</b> beams for warp knitting were examined. 16 % of warp yarns were outside the permissible tension range in practical environment. The length measurements of 1128 individual yarns of a warp beam show that 0 - 1. 7 % length variations exist among the yarns. The fabrics knitted at different tension values ranging from 4 cN to 20 cN show 6. 6 % increase in wale density. Although the fabric weight variation is below 5 %, the microscopic view of the fabrics shows significant change in the size of loops and rupture of filaments. This has caused visual colour difference in the fabric...|$|R
40|$|In {{the village}} of Vellanchery, Tamil Nadu state, India, {{the main source of}} income is through the weaving of {{traditional}} silk saris. This activity is completed by the males of the families. This is a domestic process carried out on handlooms using a warp of approximately twenty-one metres; from which, three six metre sari lengths are produced. This leaves close to three metres of remnant silk <b>yarns</b> <b>on</b> the <b>warp</b> beam. Past efforts to make use of these remnant yarns have been aimed at the production of fashion accessories, including items such as: bangles and necklaces, which crucially are of low value and only sold in the local market. As such, the production of these items from remnant yarns provide minimal economic empowerment {{of the women in the}} village, which is very much needed. The thesis investigates the development of a process of recycling hand spun knitting yarn using 30...|$|R
25|$|The weaving process uses a loom. The lengthway threads {{are known}} as the warp, and the cross way threads {{are known as}} the weft. The warp which must be strong needs to be {{presented}} to loom <b>on</b> a <b>warp</b> beam. The weft passes across the loom in a shuttle, that carries the <b>yarn</b> <b>on</b> a pirn. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.|$|R
