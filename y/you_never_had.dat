25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{also found}} the long-running {{football}} vs. glee storyline repetitive, but wrote that the football players joining glee club was [...] "a welcome twist", however convoluted and unrealistic. He rated the episode 8/10, finding it [...] "preposterously fun". Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker considered the episode [...] "at once in-your-face and under-handed, very clever about its very cynicism." [...] He noted that while he had become jaded with Glee, he enjoyed [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", summarizing that, [...] "Everything in this episode was chaotic and topsy-turvy, but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> the feeling the silliness was {{getting away from the}} producers. It all came together." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrea Magrath of Daily Mail {{compared}} Beyoncé with Maria von Trapp in the video. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine {{praised the}} video, [...] "What {{better way to}} show your ex they're the best thing <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> than with saying 'I Do' to someone bigger and better in a Baracci Beverly Hills wedding gown." [...] Jason Lipshutz of the same publication {{described it as a}} [...] "smile-inducing clip with a dream wedding". A writer of Rap-Up praised the video's [...] "fairytale" [...] ending. Gordon Smart of The Sun described the white corset that Beyoncé wore in the video as sexy and wrote that [...] "her ex will be feeling a bit of a mug watching it when he remembers what he's missing out on." [...] Ashleigh Rainbird of the Daily Mirror found Beyoncé, [...] "looking sexy in white lacy undies and garter – and later in a Big Fat Gypsy Wedding-style frock". Amos Barshad of New York magazine commented, [...] "To just full-on hammer down the whole 'mature and settled down and happy' thing, Mrs. Hova saunters around with the most irrepressible smile you've ever seen, shimmying amazingly (note the moves at 3:30) as home footage of that jerk she threw away like a parking ticket cuts in and out." [...] The music video peaked at number one on the UK TV Airplay Chart, logging 634 plays on July 24, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Emin has {{described}} Top Spot as being [...] "about the moment of... understanding {{that you are}} walking into an adult world which means sex, which means often violence, which means that you may suddenly have some perspective on your own life that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> before." [...] Top Spot was given an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification, much to Emin's dismay, as she intended the film for a teenage audience.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the release}} of the first game a former Rockstar {{employee}} admitted that the game almost caused a mutiny in the company, saying that [...] "It may sound surprising, but there was almost a mutiny at the company over that game. It was Rockstar North's pet project - most of us at Rockstar Games wanted no part of it. We'd already weathered plenty of controversy over GTA III and Vice City - we were no strangers to it - but Manhunt felt different. With GTA, we always had the excuse that the gameplay was untethered - <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> to hurt anybody that wasn't a [...] "bad guy" [...] in one of the missions. You could play completely ethically if you wanted, and the game was parody anyway, so lighten up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' she said, pondering. 'You {{are just}} egocentric. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> any enthusiasm, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> {{come out with}} any spark towards me. You want yourself, really, and your own affairs. And you want me just to be there, to serve you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>never</b> see Judith?" [...] {{demanded the}} girl, with quick earnestness; [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>have,</b> go {{at once and}} look at her. Even Hurry Harry isn't more {{pleasant}} to look at though she is a woman, {{and he is a}} man." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes; {{and if a}} jury {{should decide}} {{that there had been}} no Australian marriage,--which I fear we can hardly hope;--but if a jury were to decide that, then of course she could go back to him.
