6000|$|... "I've a great mind not to pass them," [...] said Jenny. [...] "Are you {{in earnest}} in what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> only <b>saying</b> it for sensation? How can people believe such things and be comfortable? I could not. If I {{believed}} all <b>you</b> have <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> I {{could not sleep}} nights,--I should be perfectly miserable; and you cannot really believe all this, or you would be." ...|$|R
6000|$|STRAMMFEST. You do {{not know}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying.</b> This <b>is</b> pure Bolshevism. Are you, the {{daughter}} of a Panjandrum, a Bolshevist? ...|$|R

6000|$|... --Here <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>says</b> Alf, {{chucking}} out the rhino. Talking about hanging, I'll {{show you}} something you never saw. Hangmen's letters. Look at here.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why do {{you look}} so terrified, my darling? What have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> to her, <b>you</b> old villain?' and the Amal raised his whip.|$|R
