25|$|The steel quick-action vise doesn't suffer so {{much from}} this problem. With one exception, it {{functions}} well {{on the end of}} the bench. Its main drawback as a tail vise is the distance of the dog from the edge of the vise. Ideally, the dog hole strip should be fairly close to the edge of the bench. This puts your weight more directly over the work and behind the plane, enabling <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> more power and control into the operation with less strain. It is also important to keep the dog holes near the edge so that fenced planes can easily be used. With even a small quick-action vise the dog hole strip is still pretty far from the edge. So if you decide to use a quick-action vise as a tail vise, get the smallest good one you can find.|$|E

500|$|He got {{his first}} job writing for {{television}} on the sitcom Three's Company in 1983. Through his cousin, Mirkin met writer George Tricker who became his mentor. Tricker wrote for the Three's Company spin-off The Ropers so Mirkin wrote a spec script for an episode of The Ropers. Although rejected by the producers of The Ropers, Three's Company creator Bernie West {{was impressed by the}} script and Mirkin began pitching ideas for that series instead. Mirkin pitched to the series' story editors for several years without success because they had very limited script buying power. He was eventually able to pitch to the show's producers, who bought a script from him, and then hired him as a staff writer. Mirkin was apprehensive about the job because he was aiming to work on Cheers, a show more focused on character-driven humor which Mirkin preferred writing, but felt he could not turn the opportunity down. Mirkin considered Three's Company to have [...] "a classic French farce structure", as [...] "the characters were so stupid they could never say anything clever." [...] This meant Mirkin had to adapt his preference for character-driven comedy to fit the show; it [...] "forced <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all the cleverness into the plot, a much more difficult thing to do. The plot had to get all the laughs". Mirkin felt the experience [...] "taught [...] a lot about structure" [...] which greatly aided his later work on character-focused shows.|$|E

And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. They [...] say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away?

2500|$|In 1801, David Hartley first {{postulated}} that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable {{by the end}} of the 19th century. In ‘Peter and Wendy’, J.M. Barrie wrote [...] ‘It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. …When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> on.’ The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of cognitive psychology, some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.|$|E

2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I know those sort of women.
