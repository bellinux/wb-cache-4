Annabeth Gish later revealed that her lines were difficult to remember. She explained, [...] "I remember learning my lines and thinking, 'Oh my God. I've got to memorize this. It's scary.

[...] Sf historian Mike Ashley suggested that Pines was right to launch Fantastic Story Quarterly as a pulp; in Ashley's words, [...] "Early pulp fiction somehow never reads right in book form. [...] <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> crumbling paper, the smell of woodpulp, and the mixture of advertisements, illustrations and old pulp-style text to create the right atmosphere". [...] Most of the contents were reprinted from Wonder Stories, but occasionally material from other publishers appeared, such as A.E. van Vogt's novel, Slan, which had originally appeared in Street and Smith's Astounding Science Fiction in 1940, and which was reprinted in Fantastic Story Summer 1952 issue. [...] New fiction included Richard Matheson's [...] "Lazarus II", and Walter M. Miller's [...] "A Family Matter". [...] Fantastic Story also printed Gordon R. Dickson's first sale, [...] "Trespass", a collaboration with Poul Anderson which appeared in the very first issue. [...] In addition to fiction, there was an editorial page and a letter column. [...] Illustrators whose work appeared in its pages included Virgil Finlay, Ed Emsh, and Earle Bergey.|$|E
