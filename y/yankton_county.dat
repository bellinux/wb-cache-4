40|$|The {{following}} {{document is}} a statistical compilation of estimated expenditure impacts that are traceable to the visitor industry in South Dakota. South Dakota Tourism first {{made a major}} commitment to monitor economic impacts generated by the industry in 1985 when the study Economic and Fiscal Impacts Associated with the Vacation Travel Industry in South Dakota was commissioned. A major update of this study, carrying the same name, was commissioned in 1988 and was completed in January of 1989. Since then, abbreviated statistical updates of travel related economic impacts have been produced each year. The South Dakota Department of Revenue began collecting taxable sales data in bimonthly intervals in July of 1983. Accordingly, {{it is now possible}} to analyze the changes in visitor spending impacts as they have occurred over the last 20 years. Moreover, these impacts can be studied at the county level because of the detail employed in the data collection process. The present document is an update that addresses visitor industry impacts that have occurred from November 1, 2002, to October 31, 2003. Thus, the 2003 travel year focused on in this document includes all of the months of 2003 except for the 2002 months of November and December. This time span provides for the inclusion of the immediate past hunting season, which is of considerable importance to several counties in South Dakota. This year, a slight modification was made to the regional definitions used in previous years. Douglas, Bon Homme and <b>Yankton</b> <b>Counties</b> have been moved from the Great Lakes region to the Southeast region. Also, Jerauld and Sanborn Counties have been moved from the Great Lakes region to the northeast region. These changes coincide with the regional boundaries followed by the four regional tourism associations in the state. See the map {{at the end of this}} document for regional boundaries...|$|R
