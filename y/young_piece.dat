As before, he {{made a name for}} himself as a resolute advocate for the Göppingen workforce, visiting plant after plant and rapidly familiarizing himself with the local situations and gaining the confidence and trust of the membership: at the same time his [...] "no nonsense" [...] approach won him the respect of employers. He was relatively unconcerned by custom and convention, however. At one business meeting he talent spotted the <b>young</b> <b>piece</b> worker, Hilde Kirsamer, whom he backed within the union and who in the end was appointed Work council president at the Märklin company. Within the IG Metall staff women were badly under-represented at the time. That an unskilled female factory worker should end up as a works council president in the early 1950s was little short of sensational. Bleicher was proud of Kirsamer's success, although the issue of gender equality was not then the hot political topic that it became a couple of decades later, and was not something that would have been to the fore in his own political thinking.|$|E

50|$|The Well-Tuned Piano, being improvisatory in nature, {{as well as}} ever-changing, has no {{specific}} form. The closest a listener can come to understanding the structure of <b>Young's</b> <b>piece</b> is by studying the liner notes from the 1981 Gramavision recording. Within the liner notes, Young breaks the performance into seven major sections and further deconstructs each of those sections into multiple subsections. The sections and subsections are not notated or described, but simply listed along with the duration of each section so a listener can easily follow along. The seven major sections are as follows.|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] age is defined herein as the difference between times of carbon fixation in a material and deposition of that material within sediments from which it is eventually sampled in order to estimate deposit age via radiocarbon dating. Inheritance generally leads to over-estimation of the age by an unknown amount and therefore represents unquantified bias and uncertainty that could potentially lead to erroneous inferences. Inherited ages in charcoal are likely to be larger, and therefore detectable relative to analytic error, where forests are dominated by longer-lived trees, material is stored for longer periods upslope, and downstream post-fire delivery of that material is dominated by mass movements, such as in the near-coastal mountains of northwestern North America. Inherited age distribution functions were estimated from radiocarbon dating of 126 charcoal pieces from 14 stream-bank exposures of debris-flow deposits, fluvial fines, and fluvial gravels along a headwater stream in the southern Oregon Coast Range, USA. In the region, these 3 facies are representative of the nearly continuous coalescing fan-fill complexes blanketing valley floors of headwater streams where the dominant transport mechanism shifts from debris-flow to fluvial. Within each depositional unit, and for each charcoal piece within that unit, convolution of the calibrated age distribution with that of the <b>youngest</b> <b>piece</b> yielded an inherited age distribution for the unit. Fits to the normalized sums of inherited age distributions for units of like facies provided estimates of facies-specific inherited age distribution functions. Finally, convolution of these distribution functions with calibrated deposit age distributions yielded corrections to published valley-floor deposit ages and residence time distributions from nearby similar sites. Residence time distributions were inferred from the normalized sums of distributions of 30 deposit ages at each of 4 sites: 2 adjacent valley reaches 10 ³ m long and within 10 ² m of 2 tributary confluences. Mean inherited ages from the observed distributions are 666, 688, and 1506 yr for debris-flow deposits, fluvial fines, and fluvial gravels, respectively. On average, correction reduced estimates of individual deposit age means by a factor of 0. 71 (0. 56 – 0. 94) and increased standard deviations by a factor of 6. 1 (0. 97 – 43). Across sites, mean residence times decreased by 24. 0...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the BAH (Biologische Anstalt Helgoland) was to gain control over the induction of sporogenesis in Laminaria digitata and to reduce {{the time it takes}} individual algae to start reproduction. Compared to the occurrence of double prime sorus double prime (sporogenous tissue) on L. digitata in the field, the experiments showed the acceleration of sporogenesis by 5 months under certain conditions in the laboratory. <b>Pieces</b> of <b>young</b> tissue developed sorus under various light regimes and a range of temperatures. In contrast to L. digitata, L. saccharina tissue required short-day conditions for sorus formation that was obtained at least two months ahead of natural occurrence. The minimum plant age of L. digitata facilitating sporogenesis was found to be 7. 5 months {{at the start of the}} experiment, with the first sorus showing after 5 weeks. This corresponds to our findings in mass cultures of local L. digitata which have been undertaken close to the island of Helgoland. They rendered early formation of sorus on 8. 6 months old sporophytes as calculated from the zoospore stage, contrasting to 18 months in natural populations and reconfirming findings in mass cultures at CEVA, Pleubian. The youngest tissue forming sorus in the experiment was collected from a second year plant and was only 14 to 28 days old. Older pieces of the thallus preceeded <b>younger</b> <b>pieces</b> in sorus formation. Nutrient enriched seawater accelerated sporogenesis compared to pure seawater, but had the disadvantage of facilitating luxuriant growth of epiphytes. The viability of the laboratory raised spores was tested and a completely normal developement of young sporophytes obtained. 340 m of culture string were densely seeded with L. digitata spores from 12 disks with an original diameter of 23 mm. double prime Phycotrons double prime, designed by IFREMER, Nantes, and employed at Helgoland showed that in parallel experiments isolated disks of thallus preceded whole algae in the formation of spores by far. The same was found in a different experimental setup. To investigate the reasons for the different behaviour of isolated pieces versus whole thallus in terms of sporogenesis, experiments were conducted at CNRS-CEOBM, Roscoff, and at the BAH on Helgoland. An oxidative stress following the punching out of thallus disks was tested, but could not be proven.
