5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. <b>You</b> <b>never</b> know where you are going to end.|$|E

Hayley tries to get the door shut But it's too strong to close off. Klaus now having the home being flooded Can go {{whenever}} he wants and says see <b>you</b> <b>never</b> with the F-word being bombed. He jumps out of the fishbowl into the water only to have his skin to burn due to salt water before hayley puts him back in the fishbowl. The other family makes an rope out of curtins {{to get them out of}} the attic after removing stuff out of the door. Roger (now missing his wigs until it's here) Picks up the wigs instead klaus that he still go to cowboy weddings, leaving him behind. Franice tell the family to take one at the time as the rope is too weak. Unfortunately, Jeff was too panicked to wait. He jumps on the rope witch ends up tearing it down, angering hayley.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But <b>you</b> <b>never</b> knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really. As musicians {{you try to}} find a name for your band that represents you and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really do, because, basically, names for bands lose their meaning after a while. They become a series of sounds that you associate with people in music. The most important thing for a name is that you can imagine forty-thousand people screaming it in unison.|$|E
25|$|Socrates warns the excitable Hippocrates that Sophists are dangerous.

With food and drink, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> know what you are getting, but you can consult experts for advice before consuming anything that might be dangerous (313a–314c).|$|E
25|$|Dharmakaya is like space. You cannot {{say there}} is any limit to space in any direction.

Dharmakaya is all-pervasive and totally infinite, beyond any confines or limitations. This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas. There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha, as there is no individual space for each country.|$|E

25|$|Vélez {{made her}} final {{appearance}} on Broadway in the 1938 musical <b>You</b> <b>Never</b> Know, by Cole Porter. The show received poor reviews from critics but received {{a large amount}} of publicity due to the feud between Vélez and fellow cast member Libby Holman. Holman was also irritated by the attention Vélez garnered from the show with her impersonations of several actresses including Gloria Swanson, Katharine Hepburn and Shirley Temple. The feud came to a head during a performance in New Haven, Connecticut after Vélez punched Holman in between curtain calls and gave her a black eye. The feud effectively ended the show.|$|E

A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and <b>you</b> <b>never</b> did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E
25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} great sense of duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, <b>you</b> <b>never</b> had the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E

According to lead vocalist Mark Hall: [...] "Nobody falls, it's just a slow fade.

He {{continued}} by saying that: [...] "As believers, as men, if we're not guarding our relationship with God, we're going down. There's too much going against us.
