5|$|In 2005, Lance Mackey {{became the}} first <b>Yukon</b> Quest rookie to win the race, a feat that was {{repeated}} by 2011's champion, Dallas Seavey. In 2007, Mackey {{became the first}} to win both the <b>Yukon</b> Quest and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20days, 8hours, and 29minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle {{became the first woman}} to win the race, in 10days, 22hours, and 57minutes. <b>Yukon</b> Quest International, which runs the <b>Yukon</b> Quest sled dog race, also runs two shorter races: the Junior Quest and the <b>Yukon</b> Quest 300 (previously the <b>Yukon</b> Quest 250).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main 1,000-mile sled dog race, the <b>Yukon</b> Quest organization operates two shorter races: the Junior <b>Yukon</b> Quest and the <b>Yukon</b> Quest 300. The two began in 2000, though in its first three years the Quest 300 was only 250miles and thus known as the Quest 250.|$|E
5|$|The Junior <b>Yukon</b> Quest, or Junior Quest, is a 135-mile (217km) {{race for}} mushers older than 14 but under 18. Unlike the <b>Yukon</b> Quest, the Junior Quest {{does not change}} {{locations}} and always starts and ends in Fairbanks. It is billed {{as an opportunity for}} young racers to experience a mid-distance sled dog race. They must plan a food drop, camp away from checkpoints, and carry much of the same equipment as mushers in the <b>Yukon</b> Quest and <b>Yukon</b> Quest 300.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Yukon</b> Quest 300 is a 300-mile (483km) race {{along the}} regular <b>Yukon</b> Quest trail. It {{alternates}} starting locations {{along with the}} main race and is intended for less-experienced mushers training for longer races. The race is also a qualifier for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race and the following year's <b>Yukon</b> Quest. Several mushers, including Fort <b>Yukon</b> Native Josh Cadzow, have used the race as a trial before entering the longer races.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1992 race, {{controversy}} erupted {{when the}} Alaska {{board of directors}} of <b>Yukon</b> Quest International informed the <b>Yukon</b> board that they were considering dropping the <b>Yukon</b> half of the Quest because <b>Yukon</b> officials did not meet fundraising goals. Alaska officials also believed {{it would be easier to}} manage an Alaska-only race. A crisis was averted when the <b>Yukon</b> board of directors agreed to raise more money and the two sides formed a joint board of directors. The 1993 race was run as usual, but Jeff Mann had a more eventful race than most. When a moose attacked his dog team, he was forced to kill it with an axe, then butcher it according to Quest rules. Later, he was penalized 90minutes for borrowing a reporter's head lantern. Finally, after the conclusion of the race, he was fined half his winnings when his dogs tested positive for ibuprofen.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the <b>Yukon</b> River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort <b>Yukon.</b> At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the <b>Yukon</b> Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the Bering Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the race}} was capped at 25 entries. When the Quest 300 starts in Whitehorse, its course follows the main <b>Yukon</b> Quest trail until the Stepping Stone {{hospitality}} stop. From there, it turns southwest, ending in Minto Landing, <b>Yukon.</b> The Fairbanks route follows the main trail to Circle, then reverses course, ending in Central.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 race, Alaskan Bruce Cosgrove {{was denied}} entry by Canadian customs {{officials}} in the pre-race verification process, the only time a musher has been denied entry into either Canada or Alaska. Cosgrove started the race, but quit before the border. Following the race, controversy again erupted when Alaska <b>Yukon</b> Quest officials announced they would unilaterally eliminate Whitehorse from the <b>Yukon</b> Quest and run a cheaper Fairbanks-to-Dawson City race. Members of the <b>Yukon</b> Quest organization revolted against this and voted to evict the board members who had proposed it.|$|E
5|$|The {{report was}} duly reconsidered, but in 1978, the Army Corps of Engineers {{confirmed}} the project {{no longer was}} justified. The audited report was accepted by the U.S. Senate, and no further funding was allocated to study the issue. The final nail in the coffin came on December 1, 1978, when President Jimmy Carter authorized {{the creation of the}} <b>Yukon</b> Flats National Wildlife Monument, which became the <b>Yukon</b> Flats National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. The refuge status eliminated any possibility of flooding the <b>Yukon</b> Flats, a process that would have been inevitable with the construction of the dam.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{starting line}} is in Whitehorse on First Avenue, near the former White Pass and <b>Yukon</b> Route train station, which today houses the Canadian offices of <b>Yukon</b> Quest International. Shortly {{after leaving the}} starting line, racers follow the frozen <b>Yukon</b> River north out of town. Crossing onto the Takhini River, mushers follow it north to the Klondike-era Overland Trail. Racers take the trail to Braeburn Lodge, the first checkpoint.|$|E

5|$|Dawson City {{was founded}} in 1896 {{in the early days}} of the Klondike Gold Rush, {{alongside}} the <b>Yukon</b> River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 at the height of the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again as many of the immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new <b>Yukon</b> Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of the Mounted and Challenge of the <b>Yukon</b> continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the <b>Yukon.</b> Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity of these films finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the <b>Yukon.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Beringian wolf, other Beringian carnivores include the Beringian cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea), scimitar-toothed cat (Homotherium serum), short-faced bear (Arctodus simus), and the omnivorous brown bear (Ursus arctos). Beringian wolves would have faced competition for the carcasses of large herbivores from the formidable short-faced bear, a scavenger. Additionally, humans had reached the Bluefish Caves in the <b>Yukon</b> Territory by 24,000YBP, with cutmarks being found there on specimens of <b>Yukon</b> horse, steppe bison, caribou, wapiti (Cervus elaphus), and Dall sheep (Ovis dalli).|$|E
5|$|In {{planning}} the dam project, engineers anticipated that building the dam would flood nine Alaska Native villages, forcing {{the relocation of}} an estimated 1,500 people. Although some of the affected villagers felt the increased job opportunities would outweigh the forced move, most objected to the potential loss of the region's history. Among the affected villages was Fort <b>Yukon,</b> which is the oldest English-speaking settlement in Alaska. In 1964, several groups of Native dam opponents in the <b>Yukon</b> Flats came together to form an organization called Gwitchya Gwitchin Ginkhye, which lobbied against the project. The Tundra Times, an Alaska newspaper devoted to Native issues, also came out strongly {{in opposition to the}} project, saying that all but one village from the head of the proposed reservoir to the mouth of the <b>Yukon</b> River were against the dam. Don Young, Alaska's representative to the U.S. House of Representatives, was elected to the Alaska Legislature in 1964 from Fort <b>Yukon</b> on a platform of opposition to Rampart Dam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to spread into the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the <b>Yukon</b> valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the <b>Yukon</b> and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 <b>Yukon</b> Quest {{champion}} is Alaskan Dallas Seavey, {{who finished}} {{the race in}} 10 days, 11 hours and 53 minutes. Seavey, who has run the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race several times, won the <b>Yukon</b> Quest in his rookie year and therefore also was named rookie of the year. Haliburton, Ontario musher Hank DeBruin won the 2011 Red Lantern Award by finishing the race in 13 days, 10 hours, and 54 minutes. For {{the first time in}} <b>Yukon</b> Quest history, more than one musher received the sportsmanship award. Following the 2011 race, Allen Moore, Brent Sass and Mike Ellis shared the honor. Ken Anderson, who reached Dawson City third, {{was the only one of}} the top three at that point to finish, and thus received the Dawson Award. Wasilla musher Kelley Griffin received the Spirit of the North award, and the Veterinarian's Choice award was given to Mike Ellis and his wife/handler Sue Ellis.|$|E
5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the <b>Yukon</b> River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, downstream from its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the <b>Yukon</b> in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
5|$|The North-West Mounted Police set up control posts at {{the borders}} of the <b>Yukon</b> Territory or, where that was disputed, at easily {{controlled}} points such as the Chilkoot and White Passes. These units were armed with Maxim guns. Their tasks included enforcing the rules requiring that travellers bring a year's supply of food with them to be allowed into the <b>Yukon</b> Territory, checking for illegal weapons, preventing the entry of criminals and enforcing customs duties.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in <b>Yukon</b> was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the <b>Yukon</b> Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E
5|$|The final trigger, however, was the {{discovery}} of gold elsewhere in Canada and Alaska, prompting a new stampede, this {{time away from the}} Klondike. In August 1898, gold had been found at Atlin Lake {{at the head of the}} <b>Yukon</b> River, generating a flurry of interest, but during the winter of 1898–99 much larger quantities were found at Nome at the mouth of the <b>Yukon.</b> In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August. The Klondike gold rush was over.|$|E
5|$|When the {{contracts}} were announced, Alyeska already had 12 pipeline construction camps either built or under construction. These camps were all {{north of the}} <b>Yukon,</b> however, and camps had to be built along {{the entire length of}} the project. Alyeska planned for 29 construction camps, but 31 were created. Seven were built along the pipeline south of the <b>Yukon,</b> and one was built at each of the 12 pump stations along the length of the route.|$|E
5|$|Competitors {{must meet}} {{a series of}} written and unwritten {{requirements}} before entering. The first is that each musher must have a team of dogs. The race does not furnish any dogs, but participants {{have been known to}} lease or borrow dog teams rather than raise their own. In the 2009 <b>Yukon</b> Quest, for example, Newton Marshall from the Jamaica Dogsled Team borrowed a dog team from Canadian Hans Gatt. Each competitor must have completed at least two sled dog races sanctioned by <b>Yukon</b> Quest International: one of 200miles (320km) and one of 300miles (480km). Sanctioned races include the Copper Basin 300 and the Tustumena 200, Alaska races held before the Quest.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 race, {{officials}} {{decided to}} advance the competition's start date by one week to better accommodate mushers also participating in the Iditarod. The 2010 race started in Fairbanks on February 6, 2010, and the early start date was kept for the 2011 competition. Hans Gatt won the 2010 race with the fastest finish in <b>Yukon</b> Quest history: 9days and 26minutes. That race was marked by good weather, and few mushers dropped out. In 2011, conditions returned to normal, as violent storms blasted the trail and mushers {{during the second half}} of the race. Only 13 of the 25 competitors completed the race, tying the record for fewest finishers. In 2013, poor trail conditions over American Summit forced the Dawson to Eagle section of the course to be rerouted over the <b>Yukon</b> River.|$|E
5|$|In February, as the ice {{bridge and}} snow road were {{carrying}} tracked vehicles north, Alyeska awarded {{a contract to}} design the construction and maintenance road. Michael Baker, Jr., Inc., a firm in Pennsylvania, was awarded the contract. To cross the <b>Yukon</b> River, the state of Alaska designed a bridge and paid two-thirds of its cost. The remaining third was paid by Alyeska, and the bridge was built by Manson-Osberg-Ghemm. On April 5, the contracts to build the road were picked. In total, the new Dalton Highway cost $185 million to build, and four companies shared that cost. Construction of the Dalton Highway started on April 29, and {{at the peak of}} the effort, Alyeska and the four subcontractors had more than 3,400 workers deployed from the <b>Yukon</b> River to Prudhoe Bay. A massive airlift was created to supply the road construction effort; more than 700 flights per day—170,000 in total—were required before the road was finished on September 29. In just 154 days, a 360-mile gravel road had been built. Final grading had to be done and more than 20 small permanent bridges had to be built, but by November, the road was open to traffic crossing the <b>Yukon</b> River on another ice bridge.|$|E
