500|$|Critical {{reception}} to the episode's subplot involving Kelly and Ryan {{was largely}} positive. McNutt called Novak's acting [...] "some of [...] best {{work in a}} long time". He called the plots conclusion [...] "the sort of screwed up situation that The Office does well". White wrote that [...] "If it weren't for [...] story ... I might have written this clumsy episode off entirely." [...] Forcella enjoyed the plot, praising the ending {{due to the fact}} that it concluded with [...] "boos and hisses". However, he was confused with the casting, noting that [...] "why bring Sendhil Ramamurthy in for one scene? ... He seems more like someone <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> for a multi-episode arc." [...] Hyatt lauded the scenes, and wrote [...] "the Ryan-Kelly stuff I give a 10/10." ...|$|E

6000|$|Ormsgill told him, and Gavin nodded, [...] "It is a {{reasonable}} offer," [...] he said. [...] "I will engage that our friend makes terms with <b>you.</b> <b>Bring</b> <b>in</b> the provisions, and you shall have the girl." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Is it {{necessary}} for me to remind you, I wonder," [...] she said, [...] "that it is usual to address a few remarks--quite {{as a matter of}} form, you know--to the woman whom <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> to dinner?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it delightful?" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Milly and I are so hungry, and we're {{dying to}} see the 'Milan.' Will <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> Milly <b>in</b> another hansom?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Nineteen hundred pounds, and a {{thousand}} pounds in shares. Bravo, Roundhand--bravo, gentlemen! Remember, every share <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> brings you five per cent. down on the nail! Look to your friends--stick to your desks--be regular--I hope none of you forget church. Who takes Mr. Swinney's place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> {{the names}} of these women?" [...] said he, {{after a moment of}} {{pregnant}} silence. [...] "What have they to do with the proposal which I make you? I must have your answer! Will you devote yourself, and sacrifice all to this great end, and be my friend of friends forever?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't scream," [...] said Mrs. Gibbs, [...] "not if I know it's {{flesh and}} blood. Oh, where is he? Why don't <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> 'im <b>in?</b> Let {{me go to}} 'im." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tonnerre! why do <b>you</b> always <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> that malheureux [...] Nile?--Is it {{not enough}} that we were beaten--disgraced--destroyed--that a friend must tell us of it so often?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It won't be difficult," [...] he went on; [...] "not near {{as tough}} as that case you won for me. <b>You</b> can <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> all the bosh about his {{claiming}} to be an author, you know. And I'll stand expenses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might have}} let <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the wood, if I'd thought; but I'm so {{accustomed}} to doing such things for myself that it never came into my mind. I {{wonder if you could}} split up a few kindlings? That is the most trying part of keeping house alone, for whenever I strike a piece of wood with an axe I never know whether it's going to break, or fly up and hit me in the face." ...|$|E
60|$|MEGAERA. You'd {{much better}} have {{remained}} a drunkard. I can forgive a man being addicted to drink: its only natural; and I don't deny I like a drop myself sometimes. What I can't stand is your being addicted to Christianity. And what's worse again, your being addicted to animals. How is any woman {{to keep her}} house clean when <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> every stray cat and lost cur and lame duck in the whole countryside? You took the bread {{out of my mouth}} to feed them: you know you did: don't attempt to deny it.|$|E

Very glad to see you back, Tregellis, but you must really be more careful what <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> upon your skirts. It was only yesterday that we had an infernal Dutchman here howling about some arrears of interest and the deuce knows what. 'My good fellow,' said I, 'as long as the Commons starve me, I have to starve you,' and so the matter ended." ...|$|E

Each has got what the other requires. I have come {{for the purpose of}} opening up trade with you. It is true that I myself will take my {{departure}} to-morrow, because I am in search of new lands; but some of my people will remain on the spot, and if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a sufficient quantity of furs to make it answer, my men will return to Fort Chipewyan for more goods, and will spend the winter here. They will build a fort and continue to dwell among you as long as you shall be found to deserve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. If {{the partner}} is a stirring, diligent, capable man, there is danger of his {{slipping}} into the whole trade, and, getting in between you and home, by his application, thrusting you at last quite out; so that <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> a snake into your chimney corner, which, when it is warmed and grown vigorous, turns about at you, and hisses {{you out of the}} house. It is with the tradesman, {{in the case of a}} diligent and active partner, as I have already observed it was in the case of a trusty and diligent apprentice, namely, that if the master does not appear constantly at the head of the business, and make himself be known by his own application and diligence to be what he is, he shall soon look to be what he is not, that is to say, one not concerned in the business.|$|E
60|$|There is no {{help for}} it, there it is! The Master suffers {{with the last}} and least of his successors. For all the {{humanity}} he wins to, through his dramatic device of dialogue, I doubt if anyone has ever been warmed to desire himself a citizen in the Republic of Plato; I doubt if anyone could stand a month of the relentless publicity of virtue planned by More.... No one wants to live in any community of intercourse really, save {{for the sake of}} the individualities he would meet there. The fertilising conflict of individualities is the ultimate meaning of the personal life, and all our Utopias no more than schemes for bettering that interplay. At least, that is how life shapes itself more and more to modern perceptions. Until <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> individualities, nothing comes into being, and a Universe ceases when you shiver the mirror of the least of individual minds.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> me for?" [...] {{broke from}} the captain. His voice was indeed scarce raised above a whisper, but emotion clanged in it. [...] "What {{do you know}} about me? If you had {{commanded}} the finest barque that ever sailed from Portland; if you had been drunk in your berth when she struck the breakers in Fourteen Island Group, and hadn't had the wit to stay there and drown, but came on deck, and given drunken orders, and lost six lives--I could understand your talking then! There," [...] he said more quietly, [...] "that's my yarn, and now you know it. It's a pretty one for the father of a family. Five men and a woman murdered. Yes, there was a woman on board, and hadn't no business to be either. Guess I sent her to Hell, {{if there is such a}} place. I never dared go home again; and the wife and the little ones went to England to her father's place. I don't know what's come to them," [...] he added, with a bitter shrug.|$|E
6000|$|... (3.) Be very {{cautious}} how <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>in</b> the awful sanctions of religion, to assist you directly, {{in the discipline}} of your school. You will derive a most powerful indirect assistance, from the influence {{of religion in the}} little community which you govern. But this will be, through the prevalence of its spirit in the hearts of your pupils, and not from any assistance which you can usually derive from it in managing particular cases of transgression. Many teachers make great mistakes in this respect. A bad boy, who has done something openly and directly subversive of the good order of the school, or the rights of his companions, is called before the master, who thinks that the most powerful weapon to wield against him is the Bible. So while the trembling culprit stands before him, he administers to him a reproof, which consists of an almost ludicrous mixture of scolding, entreaty, religious instruction, and threatening of punishment. But such an occasion as {{this is no time to}} touch a bad boy's heart. He is steeled, at such a moment, against any thing but mortification, and the desire to get out of the hands of the master; and he has an impression, that the teacher appeals to religious principles, only to assist him to sustain his own authority. Of course, religious truth, at such a time, can make no good impression. There may be exceptions to this rule. There doubtless are. I have found some; and every successful teacher who reads this, will probably call some to mind, some which have occurred in the course of his own experience. I am only speaking of what ought to be the general rule, which is, to reserve religious truths for moments of a different character altogether. Bring the principles of the Bible forward when the mind is calm, when the emotions are quieted, and all within is at rest; and in exhibiting them, be actuated not by a desire to make your duties of government easier, but to promote the real and permanent happiness of your charge.|$|E
