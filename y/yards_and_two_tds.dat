25|$|Harrell, {{who threw}} for 445 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> while also {{running for a}} TD, {{was chosen as the}} {{offensive}} MVP. Tech cornerback Antonio Huffman was defensive MVP. Other top performers for Tech included Woods (109 yards and three TDs rushing) and Filani (nine catches for 144 yards and a TD).|$|E
25|$|Lyle Leong snared three {{touchdown}} passes from Harrell, who was 38-for-51 for 454 yards. Texas Tech scored on seven straight possessions {{and did not}} attempt a punt until Taylor Potts replaced Harrell late in the fourth quarter. Heisman candidate Michael Crabtree had nine catches for 107 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b> With six, Harrell tied his career-best for {{touchdown passes}}, getting the ball to ten different receivers.|$|E
25|$|The fifth-largest {{crowd in}} Razorback Stadium history watched the Hogs and Dogs pile up over 1,000 yards of offense and {{numerous}} school records. Georgia QB Joe Cox threw for 375 yards and five scores. Bulldogs receiver A. J. Green had seven catches for 137 {{yards and two}} scores. Ryan Mallett of Arkansas completed 21 of 39 for 408 yards and five touchdowns. The yardage and touchdown totals both are school records. Razorback receiver Greg Childs caught five passes for 140 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup Rex Grossman {{to the starting}} position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28-14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins {{got off to a}} surprise 2-0 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18-16.|$|R
25|$|The Redskins traded {{all their}} high level draft picks to St. Louis for taking Baylor QB Robert Griffin III #2 in the 2012 draft. Although {{the need for}} a {{franchise}} QB was obvious, many football experts doubted the wisdom of such a trade for one player. Griffin silenced his critics in Week 1 as Washington won a surprise upset over the Saints in New Orleans. The rookie QB threw for 320 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes in a 40-32 victory for the Redskins' highest scoring game since 2005.|$|R
50|$|Steelman {{paced the}} Army offense with 128 <b>yards</b> passing <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes to Malcom Brown {{to go along}} with a team-high 74 yards rushing. Army would {{dominate}} the game from an offensive standpoint holding edges in, total <b>yards,</b> rushing <b>yards,</b> <b>and</b> time of possession. They would also hold a 4−2 edge on turnovers, but the fumble recovery <b>and</b> <b>two</b> big play <b>TD</b> passes by Dobbs would be too much to overcome.|$|R
25|$|UCLA led 7–0 after Hundley {{connected}} with Duarte for a score on their opening drive. However, Stanford's Kevin Hogan was 14 for 15 for 189 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> {{in the first}} half to lead the Cardinal to a 21–10 halftime lead. After Stanford scored on their first possession of the second half, they proceeded to control the clock. Stanford outgained UCLA in yardage 436–262 and had possession of the ball for almost 38 minutes. Backup Jerry Neuheisel finished the game after Hundley exited {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter with an injured throwing hand.|$|E
25|$|In Week 3 {{against the}} Kansas City Chiefs, he {{completed}} the then-longest touchdown pass {{in his career}} for 70 yards to Roddy White. The 70-yard touchdown pass to White was the longest pass completion for the Falcons since December 23, 2007, when Chris Redman threw a 74-yard touchdown pass. In the same game Ryan completed passes to 6 different players. The following week, he threw for 194 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> against the Green Bay Packers. His touchdown passes went to Roddy White and tight end Justin Peelle. The following week against the Chicago Bears Ryan led the Falcons to a comeback win. With 6 seconds left he completed a 26-yard strike to Michael Jenkins that set Jason Elam up for the game-winning field goal as time expired. Ryan finished the game 22-of-30 for a then career-high 301 passing yards. He also had a key fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Roddy White. On Atlanta's first offensive drive, Ryan completed all five of his pass attempts for 57 yards {{en route to a}} Falcons field goal and a 30 lead. Ryan was named Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance.|$|E
50|$|Heisman {{candidate}} Michael Crabtree {{had nine}} catches for 107 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Zach Mettenberger {{surveyed}} {{the field with}} {{plenty of time to}} throw and then delivered a perfect spiral to Odell Beckham Jr., who stopped short of the sideline, spun inside <b>and</b> galloped 33 <b>yards</b> untouched for the touchdown. It was the ninth and final time the two hooked up for a completion, and it proved to be the knockout blow. Mettenberger threw for 340 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns, Beckham had 179 <b>yards</b> receiving <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> <b>and</b> No. 10 LSU blew past Mississippi State for a 59-26 victory.|$|R
50|$|Freeman {{threw for}} 247 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> had <b>two</b> 1-yard <b>TD</b> carries for the Wildcats (5-3, 3-2 Big 12), who {{pulled away from}} a 10-point halftime lead to hand Baylor (3-6, 0-5) its eighth {{straight}} conference loss. Kansas State's Brooks Rossman kicked three field goals.|$|R
5000|$|Morton's career-best year at kick {{returner}} {{came with}} the 2002 New York Jets, as he earned [...]1,509 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns (both <b>TDs</b> in a single game) returning kickoffs for Herman Edwards' Jets squad, which won the AFC East title that year and ran away with a blowout win {{in the first round}} of the playoffs before falling in the divisional round to the ultimate AFC Championship winners, the Raiders.|$|R
50|$|On April 11, 2009, the Garnet squad {{defeated}} the Black squad, 30-14, {{in the annual}} Garnet & Black Spring Game, {{in front of a}} crowd of 25,157. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Stephen Garcia finished the game 13-20 with 144 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs,</b> while true freshman Jarvis Giles led the ground game with 114 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> on 12 carries.|$|E
50|$|On November 20, 2012, Shipley {{signed with}} the Jacksonville Jaguars. He played in six games, {{catching}} 23 passes for 244 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Brennan {{finished}} 37-of-50 for 401 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> but his pass {{attempt on}} fourth-and-14 from Oregon State's 26 fell short {{and so did}} Hawaii's comeback.|$|E
50|$|After {{nearly three}} weeks of rest, Golson {{returned}} to the lineup healthy on November 14 as Coach Fisher gave him the nod to start in Florida State's home matchup with North Carolina State. Things {{got off to a}} rocky start in Golson's final collegiate start as FSU fell behind 17-7 in the first quarter. Golson was only 5 of 9 passing for 52 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> had <b>two</b> uncharacteristic interceptions in his return. Maguire, who had the hot hand for Florida State (512 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> 3 TDs passing against Syracuse and Clemson the last two weeks), had to come off the bench and rescue the Seminoles as he did so by throwing for 231 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> for <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> in the comeback win. Golson's final start ended in a Florida State win, 34-17.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} season with Jim Harbaugh at the helm, San Francisco rolled ahead in {{impressive}} fashion, beating Green Bay on their home turf in Week 1. In Week 7 (the bye week), the 49ers stood 6-2. Afterwards, things started to take a strange turn as the team hosted division rival St. Louis at home. The match went into overtime and with neither veteran kicker David Akers or his opposite number Greg Zuerlein able to score, it ended 24-24 for the NFL's first tie game since 2008. In addition to the unusual ending, the game also saw Alex Smith concussed and his spot taken by backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had been drafted from Nevada in 2010 but had yet to see any regular season action. Kaepernick thus started the next week's game versus Chicago. The rookie starter stunned nearly everyone by throwing 243 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> passes in a 32-7 rout of the Bears. Although Alex Smith was subsequently cleared by team doctors to play, Kaepernick's performance caused Jim Harbaugh to name him starting quarterback until further notice. This move was not without some controversy since Smith had delivered a solid, if not outstanding performance {{over the last two}} seasons without any crippling mistakes. Kaepernick's stronger arm and scrambling ability proved a difficult temptation to resist with the added dimension of the [...] "Pistol Offense". Kaepernick's dynamic play added more to his cause by trouncing the Saints in New Orleans in Week 12. But the following week, a bad play {{at the end of the}} rematch with the Rams resulted in San Francisco's third loss of the season. Despite this, Harbaugh announced that he was going to continue starting Kaepernick as long as he [...] "has the hot hand".|$|R
50|$|Miami Quarterback Zac Dysert {{threw for}} 342 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> four touchdowns, while Nick Harwell caught ten {{of his passes}} for 186 yards {{including}} <b>two</b> of the <b>TD's</b> as Miami (Ohio) won their {{first game of the}} season 35-28 over Army. Harwell's 186 yards in a game was the third highest total in a single game in school history. Trailing 28-14 late in the third quarter, the RedHawks scored three straight touchdowns and then stopped Army in the red-zone with less than a minute left in the contest to preserve the victory. Army Quarterback Trent Steelman posted another solid game with 99 <b>yards</b> rushing <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TD</b> runs. He also was a perfect eight for eight passing for 124 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> a touchdown pass. Raymond Maples rushed for 111 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> a touchdown as well to pace the Black Knights potent rushing attack. The victory was the first head coaching win for Don Treadwell.|$|R
50|$|Looking to end {{a three-game}} losing skid, the Bulls {{recorded}} a lopsided victory over the Orange. Mike Ford rushed for 123 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs,</b> while the Bulls set a new school record for total offense with 536 yards.|$|E
50|$|McNeal {{returned}} to action in January 2006 for the postseason East-West Shrine Game in San Antonio, Texas, and led West team to 35-31 win with 9-of-11 passing for 211 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> (no INTs). He also rushed four times for 32 yards.|$|E
50|$|Tigers QB Jason Campbell was the game's MVP, {{completing}} 11 of his 16 pass attempts for 189 {{yards and}} a touchdown. However, he was intercepted once. For the Hokies, Randall went 21-for-38 passing for 299 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs,</b> but was intercepted twice.|$|E
50|$|Quarterback Tyler Murphy shined in his debut, {{throwing}} 173 {{yards for}} 1 TD <b>and</b> rushing 118 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> 1 TD. Sophomore running backs Tyler Rouse and Myles Willis {{contributed to an}} overall-team 338 yard rushing attack with 87 <b>and</b> 57 <b>yard</b> efforts, respectively. Senior wide receiver Josh Bordner caught 81 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> 1 <b>TD.</b> <b>Two</b> freshman kickers, Alex Howell and Joey Launceford made their debuts as well, both attempting two field goals (Howell 1/2, both on 44 yard attempts, Launceford 2/2, 21 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> 28 <b>yards</b> made).|$|R
50|$|Smith {{attended}} Bishop Luers High School in Fort Wayne, Indiana, {{where he}} was a letterman in football, basketball and track. In football, he won the Butkus Award as a senior, given to the best high school linebacker in the country, and was named the Mr. Football award winner for the state of Indiana. He helped Bishop Luers to 40-28 win over Indianapolis Cardinal Ritter in 2012 Indiana 2A title game while rushing for 150 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> scoring three touchdowns, as Bishop Luers became first Indiana 2A school to win four straight state titles. He finished with 1,265 rushing <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> 18 TDs on 176 attempts as senior in 2012 to go with 10 receptions for 66 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> more <b>TDs.</b> Defensively, he recorded 72 tackles (43 solo), 19.5 tackles for loss, eight sacks, two forced fumbles, one fumble recovery and seven pass deflections. In basketball, he played as a freshman, sophomore and junior, and was teammates with former Ohio State star Deshaun Thomas.|$|R
50|$|Auburn {{traveled}} to Starkville {{to kick off}} the SEC season with a Thursday night tilt with the Bulldogs. In a back-and-forth game, the Tigers pulled out a 17-14 victory when State's late attempt to tie or perhaps win the game failed. Cameron Newton followed up his debut by going 11/19 for 138 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> passing <b>TDs.</b> He also showed off his running ability once again by gaining 70 yards on the ground on 18 carries. Newton was Auburn's leading rusher for the second straight week. Sophomore Onterio McCalebb added 68 yards for the Tigers. The Auburn defense looked much improved from their week one game with Arkansas State and kept the Bulldogs in check most of the night. DT Nick Fairley led the charge on defense. He recovered a fumble, intercepted a pass, and had 1&thinsp;½ sacks. Fairley was rewarded for his performance by being named SEC Defensive Player of the Week.|$|R
50|$|Harrell, {{who threw}} for 445 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> while also {{running for a}} TD, {{was chosen as the}} {{offensive}} MVP. Tech cornerback Antonio Huffman was defensive MVP. Other top performers for Tech included Woods (109 yards and three TDs rushing) and Filani (nine catches for 144 yards and a TD).|$|E
50|$|Sophomore wide {{receiver}} Randy White, {{who had never}} caught a pass at FSU, grabbed four passes for 87 yards {{in the first half}} while Gainer, who had caught just five during the regular season, hauled in seven for 148 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs.</b> Smith’s 201 rushing yards came on 24 carries.|$|E
50|$|Missouri (8-2, 4-2 Big 12) {{took control}} with 17 {{points in the}} final 5:46 of the half, {{including}} a pair of touchdown passes from Chase Daniel to Maclin. Maclin had eight receptions for 118 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs,</b> four carries for 84 yards and a third TD on a 56-yard jaunt on a direct snap.|$|E
2500|$|Reserve sophomore {{running back}} Mikell Simpson racked up 119 <b>yards</b> rushing <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> {{to go along}} with 152 {{receiving}} yards, for 271 all-purpose yards, as 19th-ranked Virginia came from behind to defeat Maryland. The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|R
50|$|QB Joey Harrington had 414 yards off {{a record}} 62 {{attempts}} (33 {{of them were}} complete), but he also threw 3 INT's (one returned for a TD). Packers RB Ahman Green rushed for about 100 yards, including a 70 yd TD. Packers QB Brett Favre had 206 <b>yards</b> throwing <b>and</b> <b>two</b> 2 <b>TD's</b> <b>and</b> is closing on Dan Marino's all-time completions and touchdown records. Meanwhile, Favre's favorite WR Donald Driver had 10 receptions for 93 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> a touchdown. With the Dolphins, RB Ronnie Brown was limited to just 59 yards rushing on 15 carries <b>and</b> 63 <b>yards</b> receiving on 5 receptions. The leading receiver for Miami was WR Marty Booker, who had 7 receptions for 110 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> a touchdown. With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 1-6.|$|R
50|$|Gerhart, who led {{the nation}} with 1,736 yards rushing, ran for 135 on 32 carries <b>and</b> scored <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> in the first half. Tavita Pritchard went 8 for 19 for 118 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> interceptions filling in for Stanford {{starting}} QB, Andrew Luck. Stanford was making its first bowl appearance since losing to Georgia Tech in the 2001 Seattle Bowl.|$|R
50|$|Foles {{passed for}} 239 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> {{and ran for}} another score for the Wildcats, who finally beat USC {{for the first time}} in coach Mike Stoops' tenure by scoring the final {{touchdown}} in a defense-dominated game. Foles went 22 of 40 but made several clutch throws, including an early TD pass to WR Delashaun Dean.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 Brazzell {{signed with}} the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. During his brief stay in Hamilton, Brazzell had 22 catches for 252 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> in six games. Brazzell had {{signed with the}} Ti-cats on the promise that he would only play the wide {{receiver}} position, but the Ti-cats coaching staff had Brazzell play slotback for them. This outraged Brazzell, as he saw himself as a deep threat receiver, something that playing slotback did not let him do. On August 9, 2005, Brazzell {{was traded to the}} Winnipeg Blue Bombers in exchange for Canadian receiver Kamau Peterson. The trade quickly showed to be one sided, with Brazzell hauling in 12 passes for 307 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> in his first 3 games as a Bomber, surpassing his yard total and matching his TD total that he had posted in 6 games as a Ti-cat. Brazzell finished the season with 46 catches for 708 yards and 6 TDs.|$|E
50|$|Lyle Leong snared three {{touchdown}} passes from Harrell, who was 38-for-51 for 454 yards.

25|$|Brennan {{finished}} 37-of-50 for 401yards <b>and</b> <b>two</b> <b>TDs</b> but his pass {{attempt on}} fourth-and-14 from Oregon State's 26 fell short {{and so did}} Hawaii's comeback.|$|R
50|$|Moses was {{responsible}} for most of Denver's 217 yards gained through the air, finishing the game with 5 receptions for 168 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns. Morton completed 10/20 passes for 224 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns, with one interceptions. Stabler finished 17/35 for 215 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns with one pick. Garrett returned 3 kickoffs for 111 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> punts for 5.|$|R
25|$|Plunkett {{finished}} the game completing 14 of 18 passes for 261 <b>yards</b> <b>and</b> <b>two</b> touchdowns.
