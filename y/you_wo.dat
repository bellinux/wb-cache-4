More rumors surfaced saying that HIM was planning to dispose of Aaron so Fahrenheit could become a group of three instead of four, therefore complementing more with the prefabricated trio S.H.E. However, Fahrenheit stepped out and confirmed that Aaron is still in the group despite his inconvenient condition. To prevent more rumors from happening, as soon as Aaron was available he appeared more often in the future promotions with the other members, clearly seen using crutches.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{announcements}} {{for their}} debut album pre-order {{was released on}} August 30, 2006, the album broke past 10,000 copies. After its release on September 15, 2006, the album entered the G-music charts and was ranked #2. It was less than 1% below Jay Chou's Still Fantasy album, which came out two weeks prior to the release. Fahrenheit's album sold more than 80,000 copies, an impressive feat, in Taiwan within the first month. Ultimately on the G-music Mandarin Charts their album was ranked 11th for the top 20 of 2006 and stayed in the charts for 17 weeks. Their primary song, or zhuda (...) song, I Have My Youth (我有我的 Young, Wo <b>You</b> <b>Wo</b> De Young) was on Hong Kong's Global Rhythm List as the Top 16th song for weeks. Their duet with Hebe of girl group S.H.E also won them several popular awards. Fahrenheit {{was also the first}} new foreign boy band to have won third place for Best Group at Hong Kong's TVB8 Awards. Although unable to defeat their seniors S.H.E and Twins, who had won first place and second place respectively, they have beaten Hong Kong's local boy bands such as Sun Boy'z and Soler. In less than a year, Fahrenheit has already won eight awards. Despite the outburst of winning multiple awards, there had been debates where fans disagreed with the awards that they have won. The most debated topic was when Fahrenheit won HITO Music Awards 2007's Best Male Group award, arguing that Fahrenheit is too inexperienced to have won the award.|$|E

5000|$|After {{the death}} of Hu Yaobang on April 15, 1989, Jiang became deeply {{concerned}} and enthusiastic about the student movement. After school, he often went to Peking University and People's University to read the big-character posters, copy down slogans, and listen to speeches. Among those slogans, Jiang copied [...] "Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life!" [...] (gai si de mei you si, bu gai si de que si le).Jiang also participated in several student protests. On April 19, Jiang joined a sit-in in front of Xinhua Gate of Zhongnanhai (entrance to the government leadership compound) requesting that the government re-evaluate Hu Yaobang's achievements, and demanding {{to be allowed to}} express their respects to Hu. This protest was eventually broken up by military policemen. On May 13, when the student hunger strike at Tiananmen Square began, Jiang often volunteered as a night guard of student pickets, who were organized to keep order in the Square. On May 17, Jiang and his classmates organized a march in support of university students. Over two thousand students participated in this march, and {{this was the first time}} in the movement that high-school students had organized themselves to join a march. A photo recorded a moment of this march: A paper sign held up high by one of Jiang’s fellow marchers, the poster clearly stated their supports of the university students “If you all fall, we will still be here!” (Ni men dao xia, hai <b>you</b> <b>wo</b> men).|$|E
