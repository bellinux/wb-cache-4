40|$|Recent {{developments}} in boundary layer calculations have raised higher {{demands on the}} used turbulence models. To test these models, comparison must be made between the theoretical model and experimentally determined turbulent stresses (Reynolds stresses). Two methods are dominating {{in this kind of}} measurements, hot-wire and laser technique seems to be the most widely used method so far. In the present note the function of two <b>traverse</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which have been used in hot-wise measurements, are presented. The emphasis of this note is put on the solution of fundamental problems in connection with the movements of the hot-wire, and not on showing details and dimensions of the <b>traverse</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> The first <b>traverse</b> <b>mechanism</b> to be described has been used in a hot-wire technique, which is normal to the surface. When measuring all six different Reynolds stresses at one point of a profile this technique usually demands measured values from two probes. The second <b>traverse</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been used in the cross- as well as triple-wire technique. In the cross-wire method the hot-wire probe is traversed step by step through the boundary layer and rotated. However, in this case the rotated is performed around an axis, whish is parallel to the surface. Since the hot-wire probe in this case contains two hot-wires, all six turbulent stresses may be determined using only one probe. This triple-wire probe contains three hot-wires, and thus, only a translation of the probe normal to the surface is needed for the determination of the complete Reynolds stress tensor...|$|R

Due to the simplicity of the set-up it was equally useful for probe wall positioning and the velocity profiles captured clearly demonstrated that the optical set-up helped in resolving the near wall flow more accurately, regardless of the thinness of the boundary layer.

The report consists of the design and development of the various mechanical and electronic components to construct an instrument which manipulates the probe in a 2 -d plane. Based on the study of various probe <b>traverse</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and the consideration of the future experiments to be conducted, the basic manipulation requirements for the probe were found out. On the basis of the manipulation requirements, and the worst (design conditions) experimental conditions the components of the instruments are been selected and designed.

Also to provide extra freedom to the experimenter the manual mode is also been provided in which the operator can manually manipulate the probe using the electronic knobs provided.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{high-speed}} <b>traversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{using two}} electro-rheological clutches is described. An {{application of the}} <b>traversing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is in winding textile filaments onto spinning or weaving bobbins. The design specifications are a traverse speed of 5 m/s; a turn round period of 10 – 20 ms and a traverse length of 250 mm. The turn round position must be controllable and repeatable within 1 mm and the traverse length requires to be periodically varied in order to shape {{the ends of the}} resulting bobbin. These combined criteria of high speed and controllability makes the use of electro-rheological fluids an attractive proposition. The paper considers the effects of the main geometric and fluid parameters on the performance of the mechanism and uses this to outline the limiting performance of the mechanism, together with the effects on the precision of the mechanism. The paper also outlines control aspects of the mechanism and uses this to indicate important areas for consideration in the future development of electro-rheological fluids.

40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings at the layer, and the <b>yarn</b> <b>guides</b> (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to <b>guide</b> the weft <b>yarns,</b> to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|R
