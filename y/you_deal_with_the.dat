500|$|John Mangan from The Age was {{positive}} in his review, saying {{the song is}} a [...] "funky hoe-down sound". A reviewer from the publication The Backlot listed the song at number eleven on their [...] "Kylie Minogue's Best Songs, In Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "This stylistic mishmash (featuring a deep Celtic sound that, maybe, Alison Krauss could fiddle along with) is a hard-driving, adrenalized, sexualized quest for freedom. How do <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that Kylie sings, [...] "I am frightened, I'm aroused, I'm enlightened to the now' and totally sells it?" [...] Online critic Adrian Denning from his website Adriandenning.co.uk said [...] "Too Far flows well into the impressive, eastern flavored Cowboy Style. Either {{one of these two}} songs would have made better singles than the ones eventually chosen, by the way." [...] Sputnikmusic highlighted the track as an album stand out, commenting [...] "Cowboy Style a funky western jam that might possibly get country fans to do a line dance, this is the mother to Madonna's [...] "Don't Tell Me". Kylie's creativity to mix her style with a genre that can be a put off to the masses is a surprise and one of the albums highlights." [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] entered at thirty-nine on 18 October 1998. It is the lowest charting single from the Impossible Princess album.|$|E
500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{an email}} debate with Carmon, Whitaker asked about MEMRI's November 2000 {{translation}} {{of an interview}} given by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem to Al-Ahram al-Arabi. One question asked by the interviewer was: [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Jews who are besieging al-Aqsa and are scattered around it?" [...] which was translated as: [...] "How {{do you feel about}} the Jews?" [...] MEMRI cut out the first part of the reply and combined it with the answer to the next question, which, Whitaker claimed, made [...] "Arabs look more anti-semitic than they are". Carmon admitted this was an error in translation but defended combining the two replies as both questions referred to the same subject. [...] Carmon rejected other claims of distortion by Whitaker, saying: [...] "it is perhaps reassuring that you had to go back so far to find a mistake... You accused us of distortion by omission but when asked to provide examples of trends and views we have missed, you have failed to answer." [...] Carmon also accused Whitaker of [...] "using insults rather than evidence" [...] in his criticism of MEMRI.|$|E
