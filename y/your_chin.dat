500|$|Crash Bandicoot: Warped {{received}} critical acclaim. Johnny Ballgame of GamePro {{concluded that}} the game was [...] "a very strong contender for PlayStation game of the year" [...] and that the [...] "rowdy rowdy" [...] gameplay will keep your head spinning for days." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine considered the game to be [...] "the best 2.5D platformer ever released." [...] Ryan MacDonald of GameSpot said that Crash Bandicoot: Warped is [...] "easily the best Crash yet," [...] describing how all of its aspects were superior to previous installments in the series, and {{concluded that the}} game was [...] "the most fun I've had with a 3D platform game in a long, long time." [...] Mark Cooke of Game Revolution called the game [...] "a barrage of good things" [...] and said that the game's elements [...] "all come together perfectly." [...] Scott Alan Marriott of Allgame ("All Game Guide" [...] at the time) considered the game to be [...] "so impressive to watch that you'll have to keep one hand firmly below <b>your</b> <b>chin</b> to keep it from falling to the floor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of <b>your</b> <b>chin.</b> If a board held next to the frontside of your body came to <b>your</b> <b>chin</b> then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A good rule of thumb is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E

As the eight were led to the cells below the court, several gave raised fist salutes to relatives and friends in the public gallery, who shouted [...] "Keep <b>your</b> <b>chins</b> up" [...] and [...] "All the best". The Price sisters immediately went on hunger strike, soon followed by Feeney and Kelly, for the right not to do prison work and to be repatriated to a jail in Ireland. The bombers on hunger strike were eventually moved to jails in Ireland {{as part of the}} 1975 IRA truce agreed with the British. In 1983, Kelly escaped from Maze Prison and became part of an IRA ASU in the Netherlands, he was recaptured three years later by the Dutch authorities and extradited.|$|R

Oh, the Places You'll Go, Dr. Seuss. Hidden Markov models (hmms) and {{partially}} observable Markov decision processes (pomdps) provide useful tools for modeling dynamical systems. They are particularly useful for representing the topology of environments such as road networks and o ce buildings, which are typical for robot navigation and planning. The work presented here describes a formal framework for incorporating readily available odometric information and geometrical constraints into both the models and the algorithm that learns them. By taking advantage of such information, learning hmms/pomdps can be made to generate better solutions and require fewer iterations, while being robust in the face of data reduction. Experimental results, obtained from both simulated and real robot data, demonstrate the e ectiveness of the approach. ...|$|R
