Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, [...] "If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know—if you're going to go into supernatural—as a writer <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> 'Why? ...

The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 – Super Soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it {{ran out of gas}} on its way to victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E

You can't have all three; you can't even have any two out of the three in equal strength. The best art, indeed, comes so near nature as in a measure to unite all. But the best is not, and cannot be, as good as nature; and the mode of its deficiency is that it must lose some of the color, some of the light, {{or some of the}} delineation. And in consequence, there is one great school which says, We will have the color, and as much light and delineation as are consistent with it. Another which says, We will have shade, and as much color and delineation as are consistent with it. The third, We will have delineation, and as much color and shade as are consistent with it.|$|E

[...] Of her decision to come out, she said: [...] "I think when I became aware of my role in the media, I had to ask myself an important question 'Am I part of the problem?'

5000|$|Ed Gein was derided {{as being}} both lackluster and [...] "a disappointingly mild re-creation of true events" [...] by Variety's Robert Koehler. While Steven T. Boltz of PopMatters enjoyed Railsback's acting and the film's {{attempt to be}} {{historically}} accurate, he was critical of its occasional lapses into sensationalism and of its inconsistent characterization of Gein, and ended his review of the picture with, [...] "Is Ed Gein an attempt to bring the true story to light? I can't say. Did it? Well, yes and no. It's really a moot point. The question I guess <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> is this: Are you watching for historical accuracy or for entertainment?" [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times afforded the film moderate praise, commending the performances, its atmosphere, and its adherence to the fact, but went on to write, [...] "Ed Gein resists cheap humor in favor of moments that are inherently darkly comic, and tries for a seriousness of purpose, yet is at times awkward and under-inspired, creating a {{question as to whether}} so gloomy and repugnant a tale was worth telling simply for its own sake." ...|$|E

Housemate Andrew [...] "Andy" [...] Davidson admitted to appearing on a live sex show, while Caroline O'Shea had previously worked in a gay bar and sold sex toys. Craig Phillips owned his own building company, while Nick Bateman was a broker. Darren Ramsay was the only housemate this series to have a child.

40|$|People {{break down}} {{into two groups}} when they {{experience}} something lucky. Group number one sees it as more than luck, more than coincidence.

I’m sure the people in group number two are looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way. For them, the situation isn’t 50 - 50. Could be bad, could be good. But deep down, they feel that whatever happens, they’re on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah, there are those people. But there’s {{a whole lot of people}} in the group number one. When they see those 14 lights, they’re looking at a miracle. And deep down, they feel that whatever’s going to happen, there’ll be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. See, what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> is, what kind of person are you? Are you the kind who sees signs, sees miracles? Or do you believe that people just get lucky?
