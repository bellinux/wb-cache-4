50|$|Flowering plants {{within the}} {{grassland}} areas include: birdsfoot trefoil, buttercup, clover, flax, <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy,</b> and vetch. The clover {{is of particular}} importance as bacteria within the root system fix nitrogen in the soil which is then used by other plants. Poppies appear occasionally but are rare as the soil is not disturbed.|$|R

60|$|It was {{a lovely}} summer evening. The sun was low {{enough to make the}} shadows long and refreshing, as they lay upon the {{blooming}} grass of the wilderness, softly swaying in the breeze, all pale with its numerous chaffy blossoms, and varied by the tall buttercups that raised up their shining yellow heads, or by white clouds of bold- faced <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisies.</b>|$|R

The nectar-rich flowers attract insects, {{particularly}} bumblebees. The field is sometimes used for historical English Civil War battle re-enactments, horse shows and country fairs.|$|R
5000|$|The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve, Stoke Common Meadows, can {{be found}} in the vicinity.

50|$|Eastfield {{cemetery}} {{opened on}} the junction of Eastfield Road and Newark Avenue in 1919. Broadway cemetery, which opened in 1858, also backs onto Eastfield Road. Closed to new burials, {{this has been a}} designated county wildlife site since 1990. It contains approximately 150 species of flowers and plants, which include meadow saxifrage, <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy</b> and common knapweed. The Cross of Sacrifice was erected by the Imperial War Graves Commission in the early 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The River Wid {{forms the}} {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} park, and it is bisected by the Great Eastern Main Line. Most of the site is semi-natural grassland which has a diverse range of species. There are also areas of oak and hornbeam woodland, ponds and wetlands. There are birds such as moorhens and long-tailed tits, insects including large red damselflies and orange tip butterflies, and flowers such as the lesser stitchwort and <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{upper part}} of the hill is a steep park, divided into {{informal}} gardens, a small nature reserve and open grassland. The two-hectare nature reserve has been run since 1980 by the Avon Wildlife Trust who have their headquarters beside the park. The wildflower meadow includes <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisies,</b> <b>yellow</b> rattle and knapweed. A pond provides a breeding site for frogs, toads and smooth newts. The butterfly garden supplies food for caterpillars and many kinds of butterflies. Birds such as jay, bullfinch and blackcap are seen in the reserve. Native trees and shrubs have been planted, and the meadow is cut for hay in July.|$|R
50|$|The site {{includes}} {{for many}} types of grasses, such as red fescue (Festuca rubra), perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), crested dog's tail (Cynosurus cristatus), yellow oatgrass (Trisetum flavescens), meadow brome (Bromus commutatus), and meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum). The meadow is also rich in various herbs including typical hayfield species pepper saxifrage (Silaum silaus), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), black knapweed (Centaurea nigra), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum), common meadowrue (Thalictrum flavum), and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi).

Presently, however, it did begin to seem as if that hat was bewitched, for it led the nimble-footed Marjorie such a chase that the cows stopped feeding to look on in placid wonder; the grasshoppers vainly tried to keep up, and every <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy</b> did its best to catch the runaway, but failed entirely, for the wind liked a game of romps, and had it that day.

50|$|In the Wensum Valley {{immediately}} {{above the}} flood plain between Hellesdon and Drayton over 100 species of vegetation {{have been recorded}} including hawthorn, guelder rose, wild rose, blackthorn, scrub oak, gorse and broom. Many wild flowers can be found such as shepherd's purse, <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy,</b> white campion and meadow saxifrage. Closer to the river the soil becomes heavier and wetter and vegetation includes alder, elder, marsh marigold and willow. To the north of Drayton the way passes over a variety of soil types. On the chalky soils typical plants found are the sycamore, birch and chalk grassland species such as wild carrot, self heal, bird's-foot-trefoil, knapweed and mullein. On the sandy soils bracken, birch and gorse are the more dominant species. Also, of note, are lichens which are colonising many of the concrete structures and bridges along the track. Because {{of the variety of}} wild plants that are found, the way is an important area for insects, birds and small mammals.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the cliffs}} exhibits {{a complex of}} maritime and sub-maritime communities. The cliff slopes and tops are characterised by maritime grassland, heath and scrub communities with frequent species rich flushes, particularly on the north coast. The cliff faces support a maritime rock-crevice community with thrift Armeria maritima, rock samphire Crithmum maritimum, sea aster Aster tripolium and sea spleenwort Asplenium marinum as common components. On the shallow soils of rock ledges and outcrops, a maritime therophyte community occurs where typical species include:English stonecrop Sedum anglicum, thrift, buck's-horn plantain Plantago coronopus and kidney vetch Anthyllis vulneraria. The grassland communities of the cliff slopes are dominated by red fescue Festuca rubra which often forms a matressy sward, and Yorkshire-fog Holcus lanatus. Thrift, wild carrot Daucus carota, sea campion Silene maritima, sea plantain Plantago maritima and <b>ox-eye</b> <b>daisy</b> Leucanthemum vulgare are common. Where trampling occurs, or on thin soils, the grassland is characterised by buck's-horn plantain, ribwort plantain Plantago lanceolata, kidney vetch and spring squill Scilla verna. bluebell Hyacinthoides non-scripta is found in more sheltered areas and on upper slopes where it is typically associated with coarse grasses, mainly cock's-foot Dactylis glomerata and scrub communities.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Ox-eye</b> <b>Daisy</b> is very {{polymorphic}} and a {{large number}} of infraspecific taxa have been described by various authors (see, e. g. Briquet & Cavillier, 1916, 86 - 88, and H orvatic, 1935). The polymorphy undoubtedly is most striking when material from various parts of the whole range is considered. In a small area like Denmark the variation appears to be moderate. In the years 1949 - 56, we have collected material in various European countries for experimental cultivation and chromosome studies. In this material we were able to confirm the euploid series of chromosome numbers, 2 n = 18, 36 and 54 found by Dowrick (1952) in material from botanical gardens. The three cytotypes, however, apparently rarely occurred in the same area, suggesting three geographically distinct series of races. Dowrick (1952) states that there are no significant changes in form, apart from size and growth-rate, with increase in the degree of polyploidy and does not consider the cytotypes to be separate species. In our experiments, however, it is quite apparent that most diploids differ from the tetraploids in life-form (duration of life) and in some morphological characters. A taxonomic separation between the cytotypes, therefore, is not at all out of the question but an ex:haustive systemati...|$|R
