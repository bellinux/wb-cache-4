Kohli described it by saying, [...] "Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses and <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that person because that person is telling you everything that is happening in their life.

500|$|The episode, {{which first}} aired April 1, 1998, was an April Fools' Day prank by Parker and Stone on South Park fans, who were anxiously waiting {{to learn the}} {{identity}} of Cartman's father after the cliffhanger ending of [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", the first season finale. Instead, Parker and Stone presented an episode entirely focused on a Terrance and Phillip cartoon, with nothing in the story about Cartman's father. Upset fans wrote more than 2,000 angry e-mail complaints to Comedy Central {{within a week of}} the episode's original broadcast, and media outlets said some fans harbored a grudge against the show more than five years after the episode was broadcast. Stone said to Entertainment Weekly in response to the fan backlash, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> pissed off because you don't know who a little construction paper kid's father is, then there's really something wrong with you." [...] Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune said Comedy Central was [...] "punking out" [...] with the decision.|$|E

Later, the song went on to receive two Grammy nominations at the 38th ceremony for Best R Song—for Austin's composition—and for Best R Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, eventually winning the latter. [...] "We were in shock! We just put out music so that people could find a connection with what were saying, so we didn't know exactly how people would feel about anything," [...] Thomas says as she recalls TLC's winning moment. [...] "So when <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> kind of recognition, it says so much. The Grammys is like the Oscars of music, so we were just beyond happy to get one." [...] Shortly after winning, they announced their bankruptcy in an interview backstage of the show. The song's publisher, EMI, later received the 1996 ASCAP Pop Music Award for Publisher of the Year.|$|E

500|$|By 1890 Robey {{had become}} homesick, {{and so he}} {{returned}} to South London, where he took employment in a civil engineering company. He also joined a local branch of the Thirteen Club, whose members, {{many of whom were}} amateur musicians, performed in small venues across London. Hearing of his talent, the founder of the club, W. H. Branch, invited Robey to appear at Anderton's Hotel in Fleet Street, where he performed the popular new comic song [...] "Where Did <b>You</b> <b>Get</b> <b>That</b> Hat?". [...] Robey's performance secured him a number of private engagements for which he was paid a guinea a night. By the early months of 1891, Robey was much in demand, and he decided to change his stage name. He swapped [...] "Wade" [...] for [...] "Robey" [...] after working for a company in Birmingham that bore the latter name. It was at around this time that he met E. W. Rogers, an established music hall composer who wrote songs for Marie Lloyd and Jenny Hill. For Robey, Rogers wrote three songs: [...] "My Hat's a Brown 'Un", [...] "The Simple Pimple" [...] and [...] "It Suddenly Dawned Upon Me".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the album {{influenced}} post-punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it: [...] "We {{were introduced to}} Kraftwerk by [...] Ian Curtis, who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time. The tape was played at the venue over the PA system, to be heard by everyone. The first time was Pips [...] Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor {{in time to the}} track. It took us ages of pleading to get him back in." [...] Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division [...] "used to play Trans-Europe Express before we went on stage, to get us into the zone. It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum. Trans-Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music". Morris also said: [...] "It reminds me of Cabaret, the film, with all of the 1920s singing. [...] When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> marriage between humans and machines, and you get it right, it's fantastic. I have to say it's my favourite Kraftwerk album." [...] In the mid-1980s, Siouxsie and the Banshees' rendition of [...] "The Hall of Mirrors", on their album Through the Looking Glass, {{was one of the few}} cover versions that [...] Ralf Hütter hailed in glowing terms as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|Although Dannemann {{stated that}} Hendrix was alive when {{placed in the}} {{ambulance}} at approximately 11:30a.m. and that she rode {{with him on the}} way to the hospital, the ambulance crew later denied she was there. Statements from the paramedics who responded to the call support that they found Hendrix alone in the flat when they arrived at 11:27a.m., fully clothed and apparently already dead. Jones later commented: [...] " [...] we arrived at the flat, the door was flung wide open, nobody about, just the body on the bed." [...] Saua stated: [...] "There was just me and the casualty and Reg the driver. Nobody else." [...] Burdon stated: [...] " [...] didn't leave in the ambulance; she was with me". According to Jones, Hendrix's bowels and bladder had released some of their contents prior to the ambulance crew's arrival at the Samarkand. Saua stated that the vomit was dry when they arrived, making use of their aspirator ineffective. Saua commented: [...] "When we moved , the gases were gurgling, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> when someone has died". According to police officer Smith: [...] "The ambulance men were there, but Jimi was dead... There was really nothing they could do for him." [...] Smith also disputes Dannemann's claim that she was there with Hendrix at the flat and in the ambulance: No, I remember quite clearly the doors shutting on the crew and Jimi... there was no one about. If she had been in the flat, they would never have called us to come... But because no one was there, he was dead, and circumstances were a little odd, suspicious, they radioed... us in. It wasn't until later in the day that I found out that it was Jimi Hendrix. In 1992, after having conducted an extensive review of the events of September 18, 1970, the London Ambulance Service issued an official statement: [...] "There was no one else, except the deceased, at the flat when they arrived; nor did anyone else accompany them in the ambulance to St. Mary Abbotts Hospital." ...|$|E

2500|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> compliance out of a thug like Saddam is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair [...] for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E
