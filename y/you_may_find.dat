500|$|Press in Europe {{ranged from}} mixed to negative. The press in Germany {{did not like}} the film. At the Berlin premiere, a writer for The New York Times wrote [...] "Whatever you think of the {{director}} Charles [...] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is 'different.' He does things that make people talk about him. <b>You</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> his films ridiculous—but you won't forget them...Although in many ways [...] {{was one of the worst}} films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness". Press reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of The New York Times wrote that Vampyr was [...] "a hallucinating film", that [...] "either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter". For many years after Vampyrs initial release, the film was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer's weaker works.|$|E
500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive. Anna Smith of Empire called it [...] "formulaic and all-American", commenting that many scenes [...] "appear functional rather than inspirational", and that the film focused on the racial issue [...] "a little too heavily". Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character." [...] Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying [...] "on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly." [...] Nick Schager's of Slant Magazine lamented that the [...] "clichés are too numerous to mention", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has [...] "as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings." [...] Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it [...] "virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a [...] "shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good [...] "visual flair" [...] it [...] "is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation." [...] New York Posts Kyle Smith deemed it as [...] "uplifting but unimaginative", suggesting that [...] "Akeelah and the Bee is so warm and well-meaning that <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> yourself wanting to like it more than you really do." ...|$|E

[...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Finding Nemo isn't quite up there with the company's finest work -- there's finally a sense of formula setting in -- but it's hands down the best family film since Monsters, Inc." [...] C.W. Nevius of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That's in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film's subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, Finding Nemo is the best big-studio release so far this year." ...|$|E

2500|$|Henry Cheevers was {{the husband}} of Sarah Cheevers {{and the father of}} her children. The Cheevers family was settled in Slaughterford, Wiltshire. Henry Cheever’s {{religious}} beliefs are unclear, though in some letters, Sarah seems to be attempting to persuade him towards Quakerism. She wrote, “I am a witness of… the messengers of Christ, who ... directing you where <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> your saviour to purge and cleanse you from your sins, and to reconcile you to his Father.” ' Some historians believe that this indicates that her husband and children may not have been practicing Quakers, and might have been Protestants of a different denomination. Though families generally shared the same religious beliefs, various forms of Protestantism were popular in England in the period immediately following the English Civil War.|$|E

2500|$|French {{was made}} an Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 19 June 1911. The Second Moroccan Crisis was {{occasion}} for French to push again for greater Army-Navy cooperation. Admiral Fisher, recently retired as First Sea Lord, wrote (20 August 1911) that French {{had been to}} see him [...] "as the tool of Sir William Nicholson. I {{told him to go}} to Hell." [...] On 23 August Henry Wilson carried a CID meeting with a lucid presentation of the Army’s plans for deployment to France; Admiral Wilson’s plans to land on the Baltic Coast were rejected. French spoke to the Navy Club that year on the need for cooperation between the two services. The autumn 1911 manoeuvres were cancelled, supposedly because of shortage of water but in reality because of the war scare. [...] French accompanied Grierson and the French military attaché Victor Huguet to France for talks with de Castelnau, Assistant Chief of the French General Staff (Wilson—Director of Military Operations since August 1910—had already been over for talks in July). On the journey, French talked of how Douglas and Paget would command armies under him in the event of war, with Grierson as chief of staff. Plans for British deployment were especially welcome as French war plans were in a state of flux, with Joffre having been appointed commander-in-chief designate on 28 July. After his return from France in 1911 French inspected German cavalry manoeuvres in Mecklenburg, and was summoned from his bath to receive the Order of the Red Eagle. [...] On presenting him with a signed photograph of himself the Kaiser told him: [...] "You may have seen just how long my sword is: <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> it just as sharp".|$|E
2500|$|Fools and Worthless Liars was {{generally}} very well received by critics, with many {{noting that the}} band had progressed significantly. Ian Winwood, writing for Kerrang! magazine expressed some reservations about the 'generic' nature {{of some of the}} choruses, but also remarked that 'there are also moments when Fools and Worthless Liars is quite superb, and represents a stark stride forward for its creators'. This viewpoint is supported by Andy Ritchie, writing for Rock Sound: 'forget what you know about Deaf Havana. ...everything up until this point has just been a practise run'. He commended the band for writing a 'confident and precise rock record'. Tom Aylott, of punktastic.com, lauded the band for producing 'one of the best albums from a UK band this year' and noted that the 'most endearing quality isn’t the strength of the standout tracks, it’s that it doesn’t really seem to have any trouble staying consistent until the end'. He, too, highlighted the progress the band had made, expressing his opinion that the album was 'mature'. The departure of Ryan Mellor and the subsequent transition was also a focal point of a review by Nick Robbins of Alter the Press!, who commented; 'the move away from a pigeonholed sound... has really given Deaf Havana the freedom to explore their sound'. He also praised Veck-Gilodi, describing him as a 'fantastic vocalist, with a large enough range to sound like two different singers'. He concluded; 'delivering on every level, on nearly every track, ‘Fools And Worthless Liars’ is one of 2011’s best albums'. A less favourable review came from Oliver Thompson of Dead Press!. He agreed with many other critics that Fools and Worthless Liars was an opportunity for Deaf Havana to showcase their ability, but felt that 'the band appear dreary and fail to get out of second gear' on the album. He described the flow of the album as 'difficult', highlighting [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] as a 'weak filler track', and suggested that 'unless you were a die-hard Deaf Havana fan, <b>you</b> <b>may</b> <b>find</b> this album a tad tedious and eventually boring'. Ourzone Magazine and Glasswerk also gave the album positive reviews.|$|E
