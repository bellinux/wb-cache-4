Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that I myself could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> don't dig you." ...|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and everyone who is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|His {{birthday}} (14 December 1895) was the 34th {{anniversary of}} the death of his great-grandfather, Albert, Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been [...] "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: [...] "I really think it would gratify her if <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> proposed the name Albert to her". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: [...] "I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good". Consequently, he was baptised [...] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" [...] at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later. Within the family, he was known informally as [...] "Bertie". His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name [...] "may supplant the less favoured one". Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, Edward.|$|E
500|$|Acting in {{accordance}} with his vision of a Polish-led [...] "Międzymorze" [...] federation of East-Central European states, Piłsudski on April 22, 1919, issued a bilingual statement, in Polish and Lithuanian, of his political intentions — the [...] "Proclamation to {{the inhabitants of the}} former Grand Duchy of Lithuania", pledging to provide [...] "elections [...] take place on the basis of secret, universal and direct voting, without distinction between the sexes" [...] and to [...] "create an opportunity for settling your nationality problems and religious affairs in a manner that <b>you</b> <b>yourself</b> will determine, without any kind of force or pressure from Poland." [...] Piłsudski's proclamation was aimed at showing good will both to Lithuanians and international diplomats; the latter succeeded as the proclamation dealt a blow to the image of 'Polish conquest' and replaced it with the image of 'Poland fighting with Bolsheviks dictatorship and liberating other nations'; however the Lithuanians who demanded exclusive control over the city were much less convinced. Piłsudski's words also caused significant controversy on the Polish political scene; as they had not been discussed with the Sejm and caused much anger among Piłsudski's National-Democratic opponents; Polish People's Party [...] "Piast" [...] deputies demanded incorporation of the Vilnius Region into Poland and even accused Piłsudski of treason. [...] However, Piłsudski's supporters in the Polish Socialist Party managed to deflect those attacks.|$|E
