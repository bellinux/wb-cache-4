There was no further correspondence between the two, beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham, in February 1901, which read [...] "I can now see things from <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, and wish you success"—a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham's subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition.|$|E

Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while [...] "many critics like to think... Tintin and Alph-Art was set to be Hergé's last great masterpiece", he disagreed, describing this as [...] "surely just wishful thinking".

500|$|Edge {{compared}} the game favorably to System Shock {{due to its}} balanced combination of action and strategy, stating that {{in just two years}} Looking Glass [...] "has metamorphosed from one of the industry's secret technology powerhouses to a hugely respected developer in its own right." [...] John Payne of The Washington Post wrote, [...] "Depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, Terra Nova is either a stripped-down Mechwarrior or a souped-up Doom." [...] However, he stated that it was enjoyable regardless of which perspective was taken. While he described the game's animation as [...] "fluid", he found its graphics in general to be [...] "fairly blocky, even at a distance". He finished his review by stating that the game [...] "requires more practice than action fans are used to" [...] but provides [...] "a nice payoff". Next Generation Magazine wrote, [...] "Looking Glass has always been known for breaking the barriers of conventional gameplay, and it has done it again with Terra Nova". The magazine considered the game to be [...] "an all around stunning effort".|$|E

2500|$|Miyamoto's {{best known}} and most {{influential}} title, Super Mario Bros., [...] "depending on <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, created an industry or resuscitated a comatose one."

[...] G4 noted its revolutionary gameplay as well as its role in [...] "almost single-handedly" [...] rescuing the video game industry. The title also popularized the side-scrolling genre of video games. The New Yorker described Mario as the first folk hero of video games, with as much influence as Mickey Mouse.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the fighting, the division was used as political bargaining chip (among other arguments) during a series of back and forth telegrams between Churchill and Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin, discussing the possibility of diverting Australian troops to Burma rather than being allowed to return home. On 20 February, Churchill sent a telegram in which, he stated [...] "...your message of January 23, in which you said that the evacuation of Singapore would be 'an inexcusable betrayal'. Agreeably with <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view, we therefore put the 18th Division ... into Singapore instead of diverting them to Burma, and ordered them to fight it out to the end. They were lost at Singapore and did not save it, whereas they could almost certainly have saved Rangoon. I take full responsibility with my colleagues on the Defence Committe for this decision; but you also bear a heavy share on account of your telegram." [...] Two days later, Curtin retorted [...] "In regard to your statement that the 18th Division was diverted from Burma to Singapore because of our message, it is pointed out that the date of the latter was January 23, whereas in your telegram of January 14 you informed me that one brigade of this division was due on January 13 and the remainder on January 27." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1977, Cruyff {{announced}} his irreversible decision {{to retire from}} international football {{at the age of}} 30, despite still lean and wiry, after helping the country qualify for the 1978 World Cup. A move which was shrouded in mystery and met with disbelief back in late 1977, was only finally stripped of its mystique in 2008, when Cruyff lifted the lid on his decision in an interview with Catalunya Radio. It was while still living in Barcelona as a player in late 1977, Cruyff and his family became the victims of an armed attacker who forced his way into his flat in Barcelona. And the man who was then the ultimate football superstar was confronted with the choice between family values and a highly promising World Cup glory {{at the end of his}} international career. But for Cruyff, family comes first. In the interview with Catalunya Radio, he said that the attempted kidnap was the reason he decided not to go to the World Cup in Argentina in 1978. As he recalled, “You should know that I had problems at the end of my career as a player here and I don't know if you know that someone [...] a rifle at my head and tied me up and tied up my wife in front of the children at our flat in Barcelona. The children were going to school accompanied by the police. The police slept in our house for three or four months. I was going to matches with a bodyguard. All these things change <b>your</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view towards many things. There are moments in life in which there are other values. We wanted to stop this and be a little more sensible. It was the moment to leave football and I couldn't play in the World Cup after this.” ...|$|E
