In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} {{in quick succession}} two musicals which have secured Kelly's reputation as a major figure in the American musical film, An American in Paris (1951) and – probably {{the most popular and}} admired of all film musicals – Singin' in the Rain (1952). As co-director, lead star and choreographer, Kelly was the central driving force. Johnny Green, head of music at MGM at the time, said of him:Gene is easygoing as long as you know exactly what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> when you're working with him. He's a hard taskmaster and he loves hard work. If you want to play on his team you'd better like hard work, too. He isn't cruel but he is tough, and if Gene believed in something he didn't care who he was talking to, whether it was Louis B. Mayer or the gatekeeper. He wasn't awed by anybody, and he had a good record of getting what he wanted.|$|E

Aaliyah and Dash met through his accountant and formed a friendship. Dash has said he is unsure of how he and Aaliyah started dating and that the two just understood each other.

En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> is not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E

500|$|Eleanor {{dismissed}} Bamie's criticisms {{by referring}} to her as an [...] "aged woman." [...] Bamie and Eleanor eventually reconciled, and {{in an article in}} the Ladies Home Journal, [...] "How to Take Criticism," [...] Eleanor referred to her, saying, [...] "I can honestly say that I hate no one, and perhaps the best advice I can give to anyone who suffers from criticism and yet must be in the public eye, would be contained in the words of my aunt, Mrs. William Sheffield Cowles. She was President Theodore Roosevelt's sister and the aunt to whom many of the young people in the family went for advice. I had asked her whether I should do something which at that time would have caused a great deal of criticism, and her answer was: 'Do not be bothered by what people say as long as you are sure that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> what seems right to you, but be sure that you face yourself honestly.'" [...] Theodore's elder daughter Alice also broke with Eleanor over her campaign. Alice and Eleanor reconciled after Eleanor wrote Alice a comforting letter upon the death of Alice's daughter, Paulina Longworth.|$|E
500|$|At the fort, Moultrie {{ordered his}} men to {{concentrate}} their fire on the two large man-of-war ships, Bristol and Experiment, which took hit after hit from the fort's guns. Chain shot fired at Bristol eventually destroyed much of her rigging and severely damaged both the main- and mizzenmasts. One round hit her quarterdeck, slightly wounding Parker in the knee and thigh. The shot also tore off part of his britches, leaving his backside exposed. By mid-afternoon, the defenders were running out of gunpowder, and their fire was briefly suspended. However, Lee sent more ammunition and gunpowder over from the mainland, and the defenders resumed firing at the British ships; Lee even briefly visited the fort late in the day, telling Colonel Moultrie, [...] "I see <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> very well here, you have no occasion for me, I will {{go up to the}} town again." [...] Admiral Parker eventually sought to destroy the fort's walls with persistent broadside cannonades. This strategy failed due to the spongy nature of the palmetto wood used in its constructions; the structure would quiver, and it absorbed the cannonballs rather than splintering. [...] The exchange continued until around 9:00 pm, when darkness forced a cessation of hostilities, and the fleet finally withdrew out of range.|$|E
500|$|To ensure {{accuracy}} in scriptwriting, the serial employs {{a team of}} researchers to advise writers on nursing issues and health service politics. One medical advisor was given a cameo role in the series as an orthopaedic surgeon, and another, recovery nurse Rachel Carter, appears in Holby City as a scrub nurse. Another adviser, a heart surgeon, has occasionally left open-heart surgery to advise Holby City writers over the telephone. The programme utilises surgeons from different disciplines, who check scripts for accuracy. Carter believes this is particularly important in case viewers copy procedures they have seen in the show, such as CPR. Series star Amanda Mealing commented: [...] "We pride ourselves on being realistic. You need to know what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> and why. It is a complex and foreign thing to act out an operation. For training, I watched a number of real ones." [...] Cast members are taught how to give realistic injections, monitor blood pressure and check a pulse, and some are given the opportunity to observe procedures in real hospitals. Original cast member George Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital in preparation for his role as Anton Meyer, while Edward MacLiam observed laparoscopic surgery being performed before joining the cast as Greg Douglas in series twelve.|$|E

500|$|On the {{afternoon}} {{before he was}} executed, Bundy granted an interview to James Dobson, a psychologist {{and founder of the}} Christian evangelical organization Focus on the Family. He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would keep looking for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> nothing about that." ...|$|E
500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any good <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing.</b> Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E
500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E
