Redcliffe Baseball Club had no direct feeder clubs from junior PCYC. In 1991 the PCYC could not support baseball anymore and the seniors wanted feeder clubs to support them so they joined forces at the Silcock Street oval and named themselves the Peninsula Padres – based on the San Diego Padres.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{also became}} a highly {{controversial}} figure due to his lyrical content. [...] He was labeled as [...] "misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of [...] "making money by exploiting the world's misery." [...] During a radio appearance in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about [...] "slapping a pregnant bitch" [...] {{to the extent that}} she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP on-air. The rapper defended himself by saying, [...] "My album isn't for <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{experimenting with}} more pop-oriented music in her {{previous}} mentioned songs, Hilson {{opted for a}} more urban, hip-hop flavored sound for the song, due to her wanting to keep to her roots. While noting her less than stellar vocals on the track, critics praised Hilson's sassiness and attitude on the track and complimented Lil Wayne's verse, which {{has been called the}} best surprise rap since Lisa [...] "Left Eye" [...] Lopes on TLC's [...] "Waterfalls." [...] The song's accompanying music video features intricate Aaliyah and [...] "Soldier"-esque choreography, dance scenes such as the Bird Walk, and Hilson being flaunted by men. The scenes are intercut with mirror scenes with <b>younger</b> <b>kids.</b>|$|E

500|$|Susannah Schouweiler of Knight Arts wrote, [...] "at {{two hours}} and 45 minutes, plus a 20-minute intermission, [...] run time is an awfully long haul for the {{smallest}} circus-goers." [...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> who are still mastering stunts. Despite this, the performance is very impressive." ...|$|E
500|$|There is {{a slight}} {{difference}} in lyrics between the version used in [...] version and the one released on Shades of Purple. The Shades of Purple version includes the line [...] "then you start kissing me, what's that about?" [...] In the Pokémon version, the lyric is [...] "then you said you love me, what's that about?" [...] When asked about the lyric change in an interview, M2M replied [...] "the Pokémon people didn't find it appropriate to have kissing in the lyrics, because it was for <b>younger</b> <b>kids.</b> We think [...] was stupid. The original version is on , and that's the one {{we wanted to go}} with." [...] M2M had not heard of Pokémon until the song was chosen for the soundtrack, as the franchise was not yet popular in Norway.|$|E
500|$|California is the band's first release through BMG Rights Management, {{and also}} among BMG's first {{releases}} through its distribution {{deal with the}} Alternative Distribution Alliance. The album was initially slated to be released independently, but they decided to work with BMG when that label acquired Vagrant Records. Vagrant had a promotional team that, according to Blink's manager Lawrence Varra, understood the culture surrounding the band and genre. The deal allowed the band and its management to be in near-complete control of the release and promotion of California. [...] "We didn't {{have to listen to}} a major label spend the money they wanted to spend, [...] we'd just spend it ourselves the way we wanted to," [...] said Varra. Rather than [...] "window" [...] the album — an industry term for its release being exclusively physical {{for a period of time}} — the team chose to release California as wide as possible. [...] "We wanted the music to be accessible to the <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> who listen to it on YouTube and Spotify and different places," [...] he said. In addition, they employed ticketing tiers for the California Tour, making it possible for hardcore fans to obtain the best seats, but also allowing it to be affordable for more casual fans. However, a hit was not guaranteed: [...] "I was speculative leading up, and nervous. This record could have gone either way," [...] said Jon Cohen, EVP of recorded music for BMG.|$|E

500|$|Following {{an advance}} {{screening}} at CinemaCon on April 22, 2015, {{the film was}} well received by audiences. Praise was aimed for its smart storyline, although some wondered whether the concept was too complicated for young audiences and to attract family crowds. After premiering at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, the film attracted praise from film critics. Peter Debruge of Variety was effusive, calling it the studio's [...] "greatest idea" [...] and [...] "a stunningly original concept that [...] promises to forever change the way people think about the way people think." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips called it the studio's best since Up (also directed by Docter), a [...] "consistently inventive and a heartening corrective to recent, stockholder-driven inferiorities." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter deemed it an [...] "audacious concept" [...] that stands among the most [...] "conceptually trippy films" [...] for family audiences. [...] "With its quite literally cerebral bent, I think Inside Out might have some trouble fully connecting with <b>younger</b> <b>kids,</b> but grown-ups are likely to shed {{more than a few}} tears," [...] remarked Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair. The Guardians Peter Bradshaw felt it [...] "buoyant and sweet-natured," [...] though slightly inferior to Pixar's best. Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club, while overall positive on the film, said it [...] "trades the wordless gracefulness and sense of discovery of the animation studio's best work for explanatory voice-over and nonstop exposition," [...] also arguing that the Pixar animators could have been more visually adventurous to match the conceptual ambition.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the single}} was {{directed}} by Erik White and shot in Atlanta, Georgia. It premiered on November 19, 2008, {{two weeks before the}} single was released for airplay or download. It was featured on E! News on December 15, 2008. Rich Boy, Polow da Don, and Leah LaBelle make cameos in the clip. While it was reported that T.I. would appear in the video, a doppelgänger does instead. The video is set almost entirely behind white and black backdrops, besides one club scene. Hilsonperforms choreography such as the Bird Walk, which according to MTV Buzzworthy is Aaliyah-style choreography, while being flaunted by shirtless, muscular men and donning [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] finger rings. BET Sound Off noted that some of the choreography was similar to Destiny's Child's [...] "Soldier." [...] As Hilson continues to be flaunted and performs additional choreography, which includes crumping-like moves, the scenes are interspersed with <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> re-enacting the same scenes. Hilson appears alongside a speaker and a group of men dancing before the video cuts to Wayne. In this scene the rapper delivers his verse alongside Hilson in front of a black backdrop and on a couch. Near the end the younger girls and boys are shown performing Hilson and her dancers' moves, as the latter also continue to be flaunted by men. The video ends with Hilson being turned off by men at a club, with women in the club wearing [...] "off" [...] earrings like on Hilson's fingers.|$|E
500|$|Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News praised Kim Possible as [...] "an {{entertaining}} {{show that}} should indeed appeal to tweens, <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> {{and even their}} parents" [...] that [...] "plays with the superhero format {{in a way that}} doesn't take itself too seriously but doesn't play down to the viewers." [...] Tracy McLoone of PopMatters reviewed, [...] "Kim Possible includes adult-friendly humor, in the event that parents feel the need to watch tv (sic) with their kids. But nobody in or watching the series will ever be offended or over-stimulated, or even surprised." [...] While accepting main character Kim as a positive role model and acknowledging that the series sometimes teaches [...] "good lessons", Besty Wallace of Common Sense Media expressed concern about the show's emphasis on action and violence, explaining, [...] "lessons may get muddled and nearly lost as the heroes shimmy up rope ladders dangling from helicopters and dodge spinning tops of doom. As long as you're not expecting too {{much in the way of}} educational value, you'll probably have plenty of fun with this one." [...] Writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller opined, [...] "Ultimately, Kim Possible was just a solid show. It didn't skimp on plot or dialogue in favor of Wile E. Coyote explosions, and its tongue-in-cheek humor allowed it to be self-aware and hip at the same time." [...] Conversely, Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls author Lyn Mikel Brown was less receptive towards Kim herself, criticizing the show for promoting the beautiful and thin heroine as [...] "your basic average girl" [...] and apparent reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the fact that her [...] "biggest threat" [...] is Bonnie as opposed to evil. According to Brown, [...] "Being the kind of girl who's accepted or befriended by boys underscores a girl's power and sets her against other girls." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scitico – {{located in}} {{the eastern end of}} town. [...] Green Manor is {{considered}} part of Scitico. [...] This is a suburb in the purest sense, with winding roads, sidewalks, a park, and cul-de-sacs. Green Manor is approximately [...] from the main highway Interstate 91 and borders the town of Somers. [...] Across from Nathan Hale Elementary School is a residential park with tennis court, skate boarding ramps, and a playground for <b>younger</b> <b>kids.</b> [...] Green Manor Park contained a pool at one time but was removed {{due to the lack of}} maintenance by the town.|$|E
2500|$|Night of the Living Dead premiered on October 1, 1968 at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh. Nationally, it {{was shown}} as a Saturday {{afternoon}} matinée – as was typical for horror films at the time – and attracted an audience consisting of pre-teens and adolescents. The MPAA film rating system was not in place until November 1968, so even young children were able to purchase tickets. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film with such potent content for a horror film they were entirely unprepared for: [...] "I don't think the <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> really knew what hit them," [...] he said. [...] "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else." [...] According to Ebert, the film affected the audience immediately: ...|$|E

2500|$|AllGame's Brett Alan Weiss {{was more}} negative, giving the NES version 2.5/5 stars. He wrote that [...] "most of the puzzles [...] are childish and boring.

[...] The Simpsons trivia {{is kind of}} cool; you'll find {{yourself}} remembering fondly several of the earlier episodes. However, the questions begin repeating themselves a little sooner than they should." [...] He added that [...] "once you are through toying around with the puzzles, you'll find that the meat {{of the game is}} lame as well. The level design is far from clever, the controls are sluggish, and the action is dull." [...] Similarly, the authors of the book [...] wrote that [...] "the control is still lacking, though noticeably better than [...] ". A review in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica said the game was [...] "very playable, though not particularly original." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Kanarick of All Game Guide {{also gave}} Virtual Springfield a {{three out of}} five rating. He praised the game for its {{references}} to the television series, noting that [...] "The inside jokes and story-lines alone make the game worth it for those that are fans. For casual viewers and non-viewers, however, {{there is not enough}} here to warrant purchase of The Simpsons: Virtual Springfield." [...] Kanarick further wrote that while exploring Springfield was fun at times, [...] "it is also very tedious. Reading the map can be a problem, especially for <b>younger</b> <b>kids.</b> If you do not utilize the map to its full extent, you will most likely find yourself lost in the town and unsure of where to go next. Although it is a full town, you do at times feel very constricted, as you can only change directions at certain corners. The rest of the time you are just moving where the computer is telling you to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vana's {{criticism}} of the living conditions that candidates live {{in which they have}} zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King who left the process in the fourth task, following her departure she said: [...] "I can't tell you in exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I {{would have liked to have}} picked up the phone and just said, [...] "How are you guys? OK, Great." [...] I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have <b>younger</b> <b>kids</b> and it was OK for them. But for me, I started to get slightly irritated because I felt like why is this even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|E

2500|$|On July 19, 2002, Sierra {{announced}} {{the game was}} also being released for Game Boy Advance, developed by Saffire Corporation. Sierra also revealed the GBA version would feature more stealth and less combat than the GameCube version, and would follow {{the plot of the}} novel a little more closely. On February 24, 2003, they {{announced the}} game would also be released for PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows, with Inevitable Entertainment handling the PlayStation and Xbox versions, and The Fizz Factor developing the Windows version. Ken Embery, Sierra's executive producer on the game, stated [...] "the plan all along was to be multiplatform. But we were starting out with GameCube as the lead and were just holding our cards close to our chest before announcing all of our other titles. The PS2 is, of course, the most problematic of all the platforms for developers to deal with and {{we wanted to make sure}} that we had solid prototypes and running proof of concept versions before we made it public. Embery explained the art style of the game was influenced by the Super Mario and Legend of Zelda games, and in that sense, was aimed at a slightly younger audience than the Lord of the Rings films. Tory Skinner, of Vivendi Universal Games, further stated [...] "The Hobbit was written for a younger audience, so it made sense to create a game that would be enjoyable for <b>younger</b> <b>kids,</b> as well as adults. We looked at the different types of game we could do, and an action-adventure game with a heavy emphasis on the action seemed like the best way to go. We didn't want to make the game inaccessible by loading down gamers with hard-core RPG gameplay." ...|$|E
