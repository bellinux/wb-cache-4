25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and {{it was based on}} information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number was the White House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

50|$|Third-party {{providers}} {{sold more}} than 200 different assembler subroutines {{that could be used}} by System/36 and Advanced/36 programmers to exceed RPG II limitations. Some of the limitations of RPGII on the System/3, 32, 34 and 36 including the Advanced/36 was the 64K limit and the number of files you could have in a program. So if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> programming lines or had large arrays, it was easy to exceed the 64,000 bytes of object code. However, RPGII running on the as/400 and its follow on iseries and IBM I (those running os/400 or i5/OS in what is called S/36EE (execution environment)) those limits (the 64K bytes and the number of files) were either greatly expanded or removed.|$|E

50|$|NBC {{had tried}} unsuccessfully to do late night {{television}} with the comedian Jerry Lester and with Morey Amsterdam in the early 1950s, {{but that did not}} go over well with the viewers. I'm not certain the quality of the show {{had anything to do with}} it. At that point in time, you still had a limited number of television sets and television had still not come to a lot of the medium-sized cities around the country. I think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people in the network executive suites who were convinced 11 o'clock was just too late for people to stay up and watch television. If that original show (Broadway Open House) had been done five years later, they may have changed their minds, because they did a lot of the same kind of humor we did later... Any time a performer dies in the process of doing a television series or a Broadway show, it's a difficult proposition how to proceed in good taste. With Fred Allen, this was in the mid-1950s and while he was never as successful in television, he had been an icon in radio... This may have been the first time, or at least one of the first times, a performer in television died while in the midst of doing a regular show. A comedian named Don Hornsby was supposed to do NBC's first late-night show, but he died two weeks before the show went on the air, so the audience had not yet seen him. But Fred Allen was one of the great humorists in the history of entertainment to that time, and the nation was still in shock because people had just seen him the previous Sunday night.|$|E

40|$|Mr. Boyle: Thank you, Alan. First, I want {{to thank}} Jan Wenzel from our firm who is a 1999 Health Law Certificate {{graduate}} for pulling together some research material. With regard to Tom Hyatt’s comments, let me raise {{a couple of questions}} or comments to respond to those comments before I move into some of the other areas. First off, {{when you look at the}} test that was designed by the IRS in 1969 we really did not have many hospitals in large parts of the country that were participating in Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hospitals that were not Medicare/Medicaid providers. You also at that time did not have a very high population that was covered by Medicare and Medicaid. UPMC today, my guess is, 50 to 60 percent of their revenue or patient flow is from Medicare or Medicaid. So of course you have today very few hospitals that do not participate in Medicare or Medicaid because the percentage of the population that has gone into those programs has grown far beyond what was projected in the mid- 60 s and certainly by 1969...|$|E
