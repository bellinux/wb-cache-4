[...] Twins general manager Bill Smith said in December: [...] "I give Danny Valencia credit. He's down in Puerto Rico right now playing winter ball, {{and trying to get}} better.... <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> an underdog guy, somebody to step up when presented with an opportunity." [...] Hector Otero, the Twins scout who signed Valencia and who was the general manager of the Mayagüez club, said: [...] "I think he is a talented player. He definitely can throw. He worked on his defense–worked extra before games–and everyone knows he can swing the bat." ...|$|E
500|$|Adenhart {{made his}} Major League debut as the {{starting}} pitcher against the Oakland Athletics at home in Angel Stadium of Anaheim. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and walked five in two innings, earning a no-decision in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, [...] "I let down the team first. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> {{to go out and}} prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." [...] His second start was against the Kansas City Royals, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager Mike Scioscia saying that [...] "it was definitely a start in the right direction." [...] Adenhart earned his only career decision, a victory, on May 12, 2008, against the Chicago White Sox in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings en route to a 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He {{spent the rest of the}} 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. “It had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>want</b> a conclusion,” said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. “So it’s got to be original, it’s got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it’s got to be universal, that you feel like it could happen to anybody.” Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to head toward the ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. Said Mike Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was an added bonus to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E
