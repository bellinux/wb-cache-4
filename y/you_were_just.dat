500|$|In February 1971, after a one off {{performance}} at the Myponga Pop Festival in Australia, Black Sabbath returned to the studio to begin work on their third album. Following the chart success of Paranoid, the band were afforded more studio time, along with a [...] "briefcase full of cash" [...] to buy drugs. [...] "We were getting into coke, big time", Ward explained. [...] "Uppers, downers, Quaaludes, whatever you like. It got to the stage where {{you come up with}} ideas and forget them, because <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> so out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moss's first Formula One {{victory was}} in the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree, a race {{he was also the}} first British driver to win. Leading a 1–2–3–4 finish for Mercedes, {{it was the first time}} he beat Fangio, his {{teammate}} and arch rival, who was also his friend and mentor. It has been suggested that Fangio sportingly allowed Moss to win in front of his home crowd. Moss himself asked Fangio repeatedly, and Fangio always replied: [...] "No. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> better than me that day." [...] The same year, Moss also won the RAC Tourist Trophy, the Targa Florio (sharing the drive with Peter Collins), and the Mille Miglia.|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, Heifetz {{was elected}} as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the {{national}} fraternity {{for men in}} music, by the fraternity's Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. As he was aged 16 at the time, he was perhaps the youngest person ever elected to membership in the organization. Heifetz remained {{in the country and}} became an American citizen in 1925. An apocryphal story circulates that tells of an interaction with one of the Marx brothers: when he told the brother (usually Groucho or Harpo) that he had been earning his living as a musician since the age of seven, he received the reply, [...] "Before that, I suppose, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a bum." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Japanese began attacking Canton in {{the late}} 1930s, Dr. Cadbury, as a Quaker (and therefore, a pacifist) at first felt {{conflicted}} about supporting China's fighting in the war. However, he knew this was necessary for China to defend itself against Japan and for preventing as many deaths of innocent people as possible. When discovering that the USA {{was one of the}} largest arms suppliers to Japan, he urged the USA to support the Chinese in [...] "their fight for freedom," [...] and not Japan. One of his associates even said [...] "It seems as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> like one of us Chinese." [...] However, after the war, his support for the Nationalists of China wavered. This is because though he worked to rally the support of Americans for the Canton people, the Chinese (Nationalist) government gave very limited help to them.|$|E
2500|$|Warhol was gay. Interviewed in 1980, he {{indicated}} {{that he was still}} a virgin—biographer Bob Colacello who was present at the interview felt it was probably true and that what little sex he had was probably [...] "a mixture of voyeurism and masturbation—to use his [...] word abstract". Warhol's assertion of virginity would seem to be contradicted by his hospital treatment in 1960 for condylomata, a sexually transmitted disease. It has also been contradicted by his lovers, including Warhol muse BillyBoy who has said they had sex to orgasm: [...] "When he wasn't being Andy Warhol and when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> alone with him he was an incredibly generous and very kind person. What seduced me was the Andy Warhol who I saw alone. In fact when I was with him in public he kind of got on my nerves….I'd say: 'You're just obnoxious, I can't bear you." [...] Asked if Warhol was only a voyeur, Billy Name also denied it, saying: [...] "He was the essence of sexuality. It permeated everything. Andy exuded it, along with his great artistic creativity….It brought a joy to the whole art world in New York." [...] "But his personality was so vulnerable that it became a defense to put up the blank front." [...] Warhol's lovers included John Giorno, Billy Name, Charles Lisanby, and Jon Gould. His boyfriend of 12 years was Jed Johnson, whom he met in 1968, and who later achieved fame as an interior designer.|$|E
