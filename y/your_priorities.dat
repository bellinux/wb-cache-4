Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, <b>your</b> <b>priorities</b> shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. You want people to just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E

40|$|The {{problems}} that hamper {{the financing of}} sustainable forest management (SFM) are manifold and complex. However, forestry is also facing unprecedented opportunities. The multiple functions and values of forests are increasingly recognized {{as part of the}} solution to pressing global issues (e. g., climate change, energy scarcity, poverty, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss and raw material supply). Emerging initiatives to enhance forest carbon stocks and cut greenhouse gas emissions associated with forest clearing (known as REDD+), together with voluntary carbon markets, are offering additional funding options for SFM. Indigenous peoples, local communities and small scale farmers feature as key players in the discourse on implementing such initiatives. Based on the experience of countries developing national forest financing strategies and instruments, we suggest the following points be considered when financing such initiatives, particularly for small scale forestry: (1) Integrate financing of REDD+ and similar initiatives within broader national strategies for SFM financing; (2) Design REDD+ finance mechanisms that are ‘community ready’, i. e., tailored to local realities; (3) Consider existing livelihood strategies as the starting point; (4) Build on existing structures, but be mindful of their strengths and weaknesses; (5) Be strategic with <b>your</b> <b>priority</b> actions; and (6) Promote innovation, knowledge sharing and information exchange...|$|R

For some teenagers their celebration plans will involve alcohol – some will feel that they have to drink to celebrate even though they may not want to and others will feel even pressured to do so. It is important to remind teenagers that ‘not everybody is doing it’ and support teenagers not to drink; half of teenagers do drink regularly but half don’t,” said Ms Ryan. “At the same time we need to be very aware that a teenager who does drink may end up in situations where he or she feels uncomfortable or scared as a result of their own or someone else’s drinking. Teenagers need to know as parents that while you may not be happy with the fact they have been drinking, their safety is <b>your</b> <b>priority</b> and that they are to contact you if they are in trouble,” said Ms Ryan. “Unfortunately for both parents and children, teenagers tell us they have no problems accessing alcohol.
