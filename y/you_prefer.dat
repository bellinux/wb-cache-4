25|$|In the Dialogi de Vita Martini I, 26 by Sulpicius Seuerus (AD 363–425), {{one of the}} {{partners}} in the dialogue utters the rhetorical commonplace that his deficient Latin might insult the ears of his partners. One of them answers: uel Celtice aut si mauis Gallice loquere dummodo Martinum loquaris ‘speak Celtic or, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> Gaulish, {{as long as you}} speak about Martin’.|$|E
25|$|Here is {{what the}} {{operation}} consists of: you pose {{a series of questions}} to the unfortunate subject of the interrogation and he has to answer them one after the other. – What poet, what painter, what occupation, what pleasure, what sensation, etc. etc. do <b>you</b> <b>prefer?</b> The answers are written down, then the person signs and dates his interrogation and that's the game over.|$|E
25|$|Niggle's yearnings after {{truth and}} beauty (God's creations) are echoed in his great painting; after death, Niggle is rewarded with the {{realisation}} (the making-real) of his yearning. Or, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> Niggle's Tree always existed – he simply echoed {{it in his}} art. From a metanarrative viewpoint, Tolkien's Arda is itself a subcreation designed to honour the true stories of the real world. Thus, the Middle-earth legendarium, despite its lack of overt religious elements, {{can be interpreted as}} a profoundly religious work.|$|E

500|$|The filmmakers {{decided not}} to {{replicate}} the X-Men costumes {{as seen in the}} comic book. Stan Lee and Chris Claremont supported this decision. Claremont joked, [...] "you can do that on a drawing, but when you put it on people it's disturbing!" [...] Producer/co-writer Tom DeSanto had been supportive of using the blue and yellow color scheme of the comics, but came to conclude that they would not work onscreen. To acknowledge the fan complaints, Singer added Cyclops' line [...] "What would <b>you</b> <b>prefer,</b> yellow spandex?" [...] – when Wolverine complains about wearing their uniforms – during filming. Singer noted that durable black leather made more sense for the X-Men to wear as protective clothing, and Shuler Donner added that the costumes helped them [...] "blend into the night".|$|E

Lisa Tsering from The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Rajinikanth is such a badass that Chuck Norris is afraid of him." [...] She praised the filming locations, especially the [...] "Kilimanjaro" [...] song sequence, but criticised {{the length of the}} film's climax portions. Genevieve Koski from The A. V. Club believed that Enthiran was [...] "pretty good" [...] and concluded that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> elaborate costumes and dance music mixed in with your killer-robot action, expect to enjoy up to an hour of Enthiran." [...] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called Enthiran [...] "the best apocalyptic sci-fi-romcom-melodrama-dance-off date movie of the year." [...] Roger Moore, writing for the Orlando Sentinel, gave a mixed review, evaluating it as a [...] "melodramatic kitschy Indian musical about a robot built for national defense but who discovers his human side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} right for you, Clementina, if <b>you</b> <b>preferred</b> it--and--I should prefer it. But it wouldn't be right for her. She has given you hopes--she has made promises--she has talked to everybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} a man," [...] he replied, [...] "you would {{probably}} find some one whom <b>you</b> <b>preferred</b> to live for. Do you know, you are rather a morbid sort of person, Miss Zoe?" ...|$|R

500|$|Paul Browne from Jpopgo.co.uk {{enjoyed the}} track, asserting that, [...] "'Laser Beam' {{certainly}} stands {{out from the}} others with its crunchy melody and crisp production, even in its album mix incarnation here." [...] A staff editor from Selective Hearing was positive in their review; he/she said, [...] "It took some time but for Perfume fans this was definitely worth the wait. Neither track outshines each other and both are worthy of a-side status. Which one <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> depends on what your mood is." [...] A staff editor from CD Journal reviewed the single release, and was generally favorable; he.she labelled it an [...] "adorable pop tune". Another staff editor from the same publication reviewed the album mix, and praised the [...] "stylish" [...] new composition.

500|$|In {{his review}} of the album, Ben Ratliff of The New York Times writes: [...] "I did like the driving, {{collective}} muscle of the band, though, very much," [...] but he also describes its aesthetics as [...] "cluttered and gaudy". For PopMatters, Associate Music Editor Justin Cober-Lake writes: [...] "In many ways, it's a supreme accomplishment with difficult technique passages and broad soundscapes; on the other hand, it's a journey that's too long to take." [...] In {{his review of}} Corea's later work The Ultimate Adventure, Will Friedwald of The New York Sun writes: [...] "'To the Stars' was trite, electronic bubblegum music {{that sounded like a}} cheesy video-game soundtrack." [...] Writing in The Times, John Bungey comments that [...] "many of the pieces are straitjacketed into the cosmic concept", concluding his review with: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>prefer</b> hi-fi to sci-fi, then you will be hoping that Corea leaves the space helmet at home next time." [...] John L. Walters gave the album a negative review in The Guardian, writing that the album [...] "cries out for warning stickers - 'this album contains dangerously high levels of Scientology'", and that it [...] "drags some perfectly fine jazz musicians ... through conceptual purgatory".|$|E
500|$|Jack Garner of the Democrat and Chronicle {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 8 out of 10, {{concluding}} that he was pleasantly surprised at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite Fucks repetitive use of the word. In The Boston Globe Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of Film Threat said that {{the crux of the}} film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if <b>you</b> <b>prefer)</b> and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane". In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald, the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{has much}} to do with it," [...] said her mother, [...] "though you would never listen to me. I had set my heart upon it, but you have {{determined}} to thwart me. And yet there was a time when <b>you</b> <b>preferred</b> him to every one else." ...|$|R

[...] is featured {{on the cover of}} Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz's 1989 book The First Really Important Survey of American Habits. The overall result: 68 percent chose over. Sinrod explained, [...] "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ... Either people don't care, or they care so much that they practically cause bodily injury to one another." [...] Poretz observed, [...] "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the Miller Lite tastes-great/less-filling commercial." ...|$|E
