500|$|Robert insisted, against Atlantic Records' initial wishes, {{that he and}} Dean {{produce the}} album together. This freed the band from the {{constraints}} of any outside producer's schedule. The recording process could then be intertwined with tour dates, which, Dean said, resulted in improved performances on the record. Dean admitted they had been spoiled by working with producer Brendan O'Brien on previous releases. [...] "I'm not so good at walking around the control room with a pen and clipboard in my hands, marking down what takes are the best. It's a lot of work. But I like being the very best I can be, and when you're producing, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> on everyone's performances and wanting {{it to be the}} best it can be." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Jennifer Lee {{strongly}} {{believed that}} there couldn't be any other Anna but Kristen Bell, saying, [...] "It was definitely a wonderful surprise hearing her voice , not knowing {{that she had been}} classically trained. Also, she had such a warm, sweet voice. She was everything that we could've hoped for Anna." [...] Co-director Chris Buck shared Lee's ideas, commenting, [...] "Kristen Bell for Anna was the very first person that we saw. We did a lot of casting to find Anna, but she just hit it out of the park. From the beginning we loved her, and she just kind of became Anna and Anna became her. I don't know which one is which." [...] Idina Menzel was also surprised by her co-star's singing ability, stating that, [...] "I didn't know how great a singer she was. I quickly found out and need to constantly tell her because she doesn't tell anybody else! She's always playing it down." [...] Songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez later commended Bell's quick comprehension of her ideas, saying that she would collaborate with the actress for [...] "the rest of [...] life" [...] if she could. Anna's animator Becky Bresee commented that Bell's voice [...] "lends itself well, so <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> bits and pieces." ...|$|E

[...] "There is a {{creative}} {{fraction of a second}} when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> a picture.

That is the moment the photographer is creative," [...] he said. [...] "Oop! The Moment! Once you miss it, it is gone forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{believed}} that he earned the nickname [...] "Goembab" [...] {{when he was going}} along with his uncle Chintamanrao to Mumbai aboard a steamer. A friend on board the ship remarked to his uncle [...] "I hear <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> this Goembab (Gentleman from Goa) with you to Mumbai." [...] The person may have meant it as a teaser or as a derogatory term but the young and idealistic Waman took it in his stride and later used [...] "Shennoi Goembab" [...] as his pen-name.|$|E
2500|$|On March 11, 2016, HRC {{voted to}} endorse Republican US Senator Mark Kirk over his Democratic Party {{challenger}} Representative Tammy Duckworth in his re-election bid to the US Senate. [...] The endorsement {{was met with}} widespread surprise and criticism in news media and social media as HRC had given Kirk a score of 78 percent out of 100 percent on LGBT issues, while HRC awarded Duckworth a score of 100 percent. David Nir at Daily Kos called the endorsement as [...] "appalling as it is embarrassing" [...] and [...] "pathetic and stupid", while Slate observed that Democrat control of the Senate was effectively necessary for passing the Equality Act of 2015 and beneficial for many other LGBT equality issues, and thus {{it would be in}} line with the organization's stated goals for Duckworth to be elected rather than Kirk. Meanwhile, The New Republic stated that, in light of a recent internal report revealing HRC's [...] "serious diversity problem", [...] "Choosing the white male candidate in this race over the Asian-American female candidate—someone who happens to have a better voting record anyway—is probably the worst way of convincing your detractors that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> a core problem seriously." [...] HRC president Chad Griffin defended the endorsement in a column published by the Independent Journal Review, describing the senator's work on behalf of LGBT equality issues including co-sponsoring the Equality Act of 2015. Griffin stated: [...] "The truth is we need more cross party cooperation on issues of equality, not less", adding [...] "when members of Congress vote the right way and stand up for equality — regardless of party — we must stand with them. We simply cannot ask members of Congress to vote with us, and then turn around and try to kick them out of office." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 29 May 1942 it was {{announced}} that all Jews living in the occupied zone had to wear a yellow star of David with the words Juif or Juive written on it at all times by 7 June 1942. Ousby described the purpose of the yellow star [...] "not just to identify but [...] to humiliate, and it worked".On 14 June 1942, a 12-year-old Jewish boy committed suicide in Paris as his classmates were now shunning the boy with the yellow star. As a form of quiet protest, many Jewish veterans started to wear their medals alongside the yellow star, which led the Germans to ban all Jewish veterans from wearing their medals alongside the yellow stars of David due to being [...] "inappropriate", as it increased popular sympathy for men who fought and suffered for France. At times, ordinary people would show sympathy for Jews; as a Scot married to a Frenchman, Janet Teissier du Cros wrote in her diary about a Jewish woman wearing her yellow star of David going shopping: [...] "She came humbly up and stood hesitating {{on the edge of the}} pavement. Jews were not allowed to stand in queues. What they were supposed to do I never discovered. But the moment the people in the queue saw her they signed to her to join us. Secretly and rapidly, as in the game of hunt-the-slipper, she was passed up till she stood at the head of the queue. I am glad to say that not one voice was raised in protest, the policeman standing near turned his head away, and that she got her cabbage before any of us".By 1942, the Paris Kommandantur was receiving an average of 1,500 corbeaux (poison pen letters) a day. One corbeaux written by a Frenchwoman read:"Since <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>taking</b> care of the Jews, and if your campaign is not just a vain word, then have a look at the kind of life led by the girl M.A, formerly a dancer, now living at 41 Boulevard de Strasbourg, not wearing a star. This creature, for whom being Jewish is not enough, debauches the husbands of proper Frenchwomen, and you may well have an idea what she is living off. Defend women against Jewishness-that will be your best publicity, and you will return a French husband to his wife". In the summer of 1942, a committee consisting of SS Hauptsturmführer Theodor Dannecker, the Commissioner for Jewish Affairs Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, and general secretary of the police René Bousquet had been planning a grand rafle (great round-up) of Jews to deport to the death camps. On the morning of 16 July 1942, the grand rafle was launched with 9,000 French policemen rounding up the Jews of Paris, leading to some 12,762 Jewish men, women and children being arrested and brought to the Val d'Hiv sports stadium, from where they were sent to the Drancy camp and finally Auschwitz. The grand rafle was a joint operation; the overwhelming majority of those who arrested the Jews were French policemen. During the grand rafle, some 100 Jews warned by friends in the police killed themselves, while 24 Jews were killed resisting arrest. One Jewish Frenchwoman, Madame Rado, who was arrested during the grand rafle with her four children, noted about the watching bystanders: [...] "Their expressions were empty, apparently indifferent". When taken with the other Jews to the Place Voltaire, one woman was heard to shout [...] "Well done! Well done!" [...] while the man standing to her warned her [...] "After them, it'll be us. Poor people!". Rado herself survived Auschwitz, but her four children were killed in the gas chambers.|$|E
