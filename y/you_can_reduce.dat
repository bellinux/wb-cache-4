If tree limbs hang over a roof, they will increase problems with leaves in rain gutters, possibly cause roof-damaging ice dams, shorten roof life, and provide an easier path for pests to enter your attic. Leaves and twigs on skylights are unappealing, difficult to clean, and can increase the glazing breakage risk in wind storms.|$|R

It is very common for a customer environment to have a mixture of Virtual and Physical Servers.

5000|$|There {{continues}} to be more experimentation with the McDonald-Kreitman test and how to improve {{the accuracy of the}} test. The most important error to correct for is the error that α is severely underestimated in the presence of slightly deleterious mutations, as discussed in the previous section [...] "Sources of Error with the McDonald-Kreitman Test." [...] This possible adjustment of the McDonald-Kreitman test includes removing polymorphisms below a specific value from the data set to improve and increase the number of substitutions that occurred due to adaptive evolution. To minimize the impact of slightly deleterious mutations, it has been proposed to exclude polymorphisms that are below a certain cutoff frequency, such as <8% or <5% (there is still much debate about what the best cutoff value should be). By not including polymorphisms under a certain frequency, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>reduce</b> the bias created by slightly deleterious mutations, since less polymorphisms will be counted. This will drive the estimate of α up. Therefore, the degree of adaptive evolution estimated will not be so severely underestimated, deeming the McDonald-Kreitman test to be more reliable.|$|E
