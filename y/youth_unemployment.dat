5|$|All the {{implemented}} austerity {{measures have}} helped Greece bring down its primary deficit—i.e., fiscal deficit before interest payments—from €24.7bn (10.6% of GDP) in 2009 to just €5.2bn (2.4% of GDP) in 2011, {{but as a}} side-effect they also contributed to a worsening of the Greek recession, which began in October 2008 and only became worse in 2010 and 2011. The Greek GDP had its worst decline in 2011 with −6.9%, a year where the seasonal adjusted industrial output ended 28.4% lower than in 2005, and with 111,000 Greek companies going bankrupt (27% higher than in 2010). As a result, Greeks have lost about 40% of their purchasing power {{since the start of}} the crisis, they spend 40% less on goods and services, and the seasonal adjusted unemployment rate grew from 7.5% in September 2008 to a record high of 27.9% in June 2013, while the <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate rose from 22.0% to as high as 62%. <b>Youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> ratio hit 16.1 per cent in 2012.|$|E

5|$|When {{still in}} operation, the power {{stations}} appeared in films and television programs {{shot in the}} Newcastle area. They appeared in Payroll, a movie made in 1961, starring Michael Craig. One of two security van operators lives in Stella park, a housing estate above the power station. It is prominently in the background whenever the van operator's home is shown. In 1985, the Stella power stations are seen briefly in a shot in Seacoal, a movie made by Amber Films. They appear during a scene where the two protagonists, Ray and Betty, are travelling from Sunderland to Newcastle. (Lynemouth power station, a North East power station still in operation, is more prominent in the film.) In Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads?, a British sitcom broadcast between 1973 and 1974, the stations themselves did {{not appear in the}} series, but in the end credits their ash boat, Bessie Surtees, could be seen passing Spiller's Wharf near Byker. In 1981, it was featured in Swing Bridge Videos' Check it Out, a short film about <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the west end of Newcastle. In the mid-1990s, the decommissioned stations were photographed by north eastern artist John Kippin as part of his work The Secret Intelligence of the Silent.

25|$|Changes {{introduced}} by the Kohl government on pensions, the continued payment of wages {{in the case of}} sickness, and wrongful dismissal were all rescinded. In 1999, for instance, the wage replacement rate for sick pay (which was reduced from 100% to 80% of earnings under the previous Kohl Government) was restored to 100%. A programme on combating <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> was introduced, together new measures designed to out a stop to those designating themselves as “self-employed” for tax purposes, and new regulations on 630-DM jobs, which were subject {{for the first time to}} national insurance contributions.

40|$|Computing {{unemployment}} rate using a 40 {{hours a week}} benchmark implies that any person {{who has worked for}} less than 40 hours during the reference week is considered unemployed. This method has become outdated given the present realities of the working environment in Nigeria, particularly, considering the nature of certain activities in the service sector of the economy. This document presents the new definition and revised methodology that is used to re-compute the labour force statistics in Nigeria between 2010 to 2014 Q 4. The high rate of underemployment among age " 25 - 34 " years showcased the difficulty associated with <b>youth</b> and graduate <b>unemployment.</b> This is particularly worrisome because this category falls within the very active labour force population.

25|$|In December 2012, the European Commission {{presented}} {{a new strategy}} to decrease <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate, which is close to 23% across the European Union. The European Qualifications Framework calls for a shift towards learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools throughout the EU. Students are expected to learn skills that they will need when they complete their education. It also calls for lessons to have a stronger link to employment through work-based learning. Work-based learning for students should also lead to recognition of vocational training for these students.

25|$|On Thursday, 16 March 2006, tens of {{thousands}} of French university and school students marched to demand the government scrap a contentious youth jobs clause, known as First Employment Contract (CPE). The law, intended {{as a response to the}} 2005 riots, was intended to stimulate job growth and reduce the country's high <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> rate by allowing employers to fire employees aged under 26 within the first two years of their employment for any or no reason. Supporters of the law argued that such probationary arrangements are not unusual in Western countries and that the current system in France discourages employers from hiring people whom they may be unable to fire if they prove unsuitable for the job. Critics argue that it discriminates unnecessarily against the young and decreases job security. The union movement issued an ultimatum to Villepin to scrap the law by 20 March or face a general strike. This ultimatum expired without concession. A general strike was called for 28 March.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture in Tuvalu {{is focused}} on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of {{composted}} soil below the water table. Subsistence farming of coconut palms to produce copra and fishing remain the primary economic activities, particularly off the capital island of Funafuti. There is no apparent large income disparity among the residents, although virtually the only jobs in the islands that pay a steady wage or salary are with the government, which make up about two thirds of those in formal employment. About 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign flagged merchant ships. Population growth on the outer islands, the limits as to available land {{and the lack of}} employment opportunities, results in a flow of people from the outer islands to the capital in Funafuti with further pressure to migrate to Australia or New Zealand. There is high <b>youth</b> <b>unemployment</b> and few new jobs being created. Given the absence of natural resources (apart from tuna in the territorial waters), and the constrains imposed on the Tuvaluan economy by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale, practical policies are needed for improvements to the livelihoods of the growing numbers of young Tuvaluans who aspire to a more affluent lifestyle than older generations.|$|E
