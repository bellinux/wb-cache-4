50|$|The {{exercise}} {{is characterized by}} the two right angles formed by the body, one at the hips and one at the knees. The person enters into the 'chair', with the pad supporting the front of the upper thighs and locking the lower leg (typically at the ankle or heel), bending forward at the waist. As you bend forward, <b>your</b> <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> will become closer to the ground. When you have bent as far as comfortable, use the muscles of your lower back to straighten your body, extending <b>your</b> <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> upwards. Many people at this point extend to the point of a hyperextension and curve their backs beyond typical straightness.

We also explicitly model part self-occlusion in the DBN model, which allows to automatically detect the occurrence of self-occlusion and to minimize the effect of measurement errors on the tracking accuracy due to occlusion. Moreover, our method can handle both 2 D and 3 D <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> tracking within the same framework. Using the DBN model, <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> tracking can be achieved through probabilistic inference over time. ...|$|R

Another person will hold your ankles with the hands only. No other method of bracing or holding the feet is authorized.

The vertical position means that the base of your neck is above the base of your spine. After you have reached or surpassed the vertical position, lower your body until the bottom of your shoulder blades touch the ground. Your head, hands, arms, or elbows do not have to touch the ground. At the end of each repetition, the scorer will state the number of sit-ups you have correctly completed. A repetition will not count if you fail to reach the vertical position, fail to keep your fingers interlocked behind your head, arch or bow your back and raise your buttocks off the ground to raise <b>your</b> <b>upper</b> <b>body,</b> or let your knees exceed a 90-degree angle. If a repetition does not count, the scorer will repeat the number of your last correctly performed sit-up. The up position is the only authorized rest position. If you stop and rest in the down (starting) position, the event will be terminated. As long as you make a continuous physical effort to sit up, the event will not be terminated. You may not use your hands or any other means to pull or push yourself up to the up (resting) position or to hold yourself in the rest position. If you do so, your performance in the event will be terminated. Correct performance is important. You will have two minutes to perform as many sit-ups as you can.".|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{perception}} of human posture and gesture from vision input {{has an important}} role in developing intelligent video systems. In this paper, we present a novel gesture recognition approach for human computer interactivity based on marker-less <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking in 3 -D with multiple cameras. To achieve the robustness and real-time performance required for practical applications, the idea is to break the exponentially large search problem of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose into two steps: first, the 3 -D movements of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> extremities (i. e., head and hands) are tracked. Then using knowledge of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> model constraints, these extremities movements are used to infer the whole 3 -D <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> motion as an inverse kinematics problem. Since the head and hand regions are typically well defined and undergo less occlusion, tracking is more reliable and could enable more robust <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose determination. Moreover, by breaking the problem of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking into two steps, the complexity is reduced considerably. Using pose tracking output, the gesture recognition is then done based on longest common subsequence similarity measurement of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> joint angles dynamics. In our experiment, we provide an extensive validation of the proposed <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose tracking from 3 -D extremity movement which showed good results with various subjects in different environments. Regarding the gesture recognition based on joint angles dynamics, our experimental evaluation of five subjects doing six <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> gestures with average classification accuracies over 90 % indicates the promise and feasibility of the proposed system.

Before extracting variables related to <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> motion, acceleration signals require realignment to a global reference; however, {{the impact of these}} techniques on the resulting <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to examine the impact of four different realignment methods designed to correct acceleration signals on a range of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables in older adults and in patients with PD. Two minutes of continuous gait were measured in 54 community-dwelling older adults (71. 1 � 6. 7 years) and 60 people with PD (age: 68. 5 � 9. 1 years). Three IMUs placed on the 5 th lumbar vertebra, 7 th cervical vertebra and {{the back of the head}} recorded the acceleration of the <b>upper</b> <b>body.</b> A selection of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> variables sensitive to impaired <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> control in PD and four acceleration realignment methods were compared.

40|$|Human pose {{recognition}} {{has become}} an active research topic lately {{in the field of}} human computer interface (HCI). However it presents technical challenges due to the complexity of human motion. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose recognition using labeled (i. e., recognized) human body parts in depth silhouettes. Our proposed method performs human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> parts labeling using trained random forests (RFs) and utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize various <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. To train RFs, we create a database of synthetic depth silhouettes of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> and their corresponding <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> parts labeled maps using a commercial computer graphics package. Once the body parts get labeled with the trained RFs, a skeletal <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> model is generated from the labeled body parts. Then, SVMs are trained with a set of joint angle features to recognize seven <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. The experimental results show the mean recognition rate of 97. 62 %.

50|$|One pedal starts {{involved}} rearing {{back with}} your arms straight out and almost {{parallel to the ground}} with one foot behind and to aside the rear wheel. The other foot was on a pedal that was extended forward and the front tire pushing against the starting gate. When the gate dropped a rider would lunge forward placing his weight on the lead pedal, accelerating him out of the gate. If timed right with a quick reaction a racer can get a jump on the others out of the gate called the holeshot. By the early 1980s two pedal starts became the mode in which the vast majority of top racers used. It was almost exactly identical to the one pedal start except the trailing foot was on the trailing pedal as with the leading foot was on the leading pedal. The racer maintained his balance with the friction of the front tire pressed against the gate and the racer subtlety shifting his weight to counteract the imbalance. Getting out of the gate was similar to the one pedal start in that the racer lunged his weight forward against the handle bars while pressing his full weight and leg strength against the lead pedal. Simultaneously you use <b>your</b> <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> strength to quickly pull the bike forward with the handle bars. By the early 1980s most racers felt that this provided a quicker start to the old one pedal start with the advantage of not having to find the rear pedal with trailing foot. Since it is already on the pedal you can concentrate fully on starting and getting out of the gate a second sooner than anyone using a one pedal start technique. Ironically, the sanctioning bodies in the early 80's to cut down on gate jumping by those using the two pedal start who could time the cadence of the gate lights because it fell at a set period of time every time (they use starting lights much like those on a top fuel drag racing drag strip). In 1985 the ABA switched to dead man gates in which the green light didn't light and the gate fall in a predictable fashion making timing the gate difficult (the gate still fell the instant the light turned green of course). Concentrating on when the light turn green was critical with reaction time to that was critical. This made two pedal starts even more of a premium making one pedal starts unheard off by the mid to late '80s.|$|E

However, the limited empiric literature available on CT of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> makes a conclusion hard to draw.

40|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>body</b> {{power output}} {{is a key}} aspect of {{athletic}} ability and sporting performance. As a consequence, empirical-based research has aimed to identify {{the most effective and}} efficient ways to develop muscular power. However, identifying the effectiveness of an acute training stimulus or long-term training regime in developing muscular power requires accurate and valid measures of muscular power itself. Furthermore, tests of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output may prove beneficial for talent identification and fatigue monitoring purposes. Therefore identifying reliable and valid means of assessing <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> power output is essential to both the research and coaching community. Force platforms have been proposed as effective and reliable tools to assess both <b>upper</b> and lower <b>body</b> power output. The majority of research has investigated the efficacy of force-time derived performance measures of lower body power output during exercises such as the countermovement jump (3 - 5, 8 - 9, 12).

Methods: Twenty-two semi-elite RL players and 24 physically active but untrained men completed a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO 2 max test) on a treadmill and electronic arm ergometer in a randomized order. Percent body fat was calculated from the sum of six skinfolds. Results: Lower and <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> absolute (P= 0. 03 and P= 0. 02 respectively) but not relative VO 2 max was higher in the RL group compared to the control group. <b>Upper</b> <b>body</b> peak power (P= 0. 001), ventilation (P= 0. 05) and lactate concentration (P= 0. 03) were higher in the RL group compared to the control group.
