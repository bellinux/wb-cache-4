6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Bessie?' exclaimed Admiral Merrifield. 'We seem to {{have got}} a young {{firebrand}} {{in the midst of}} us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> ’ere business, Master Stephen?” Wilcox said as {{they watched}} the boat making its way slowly against the current.|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{wait till}} you clear your character; I'm not going {{to care for a}} {{deceitful}} impostor. What made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> prank?" ...|$|E
30|$|That <b>you</b> could <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> matter made me very surprised.|$|R
6000|$|Edie read {{it through}} slowly. 'Well, Ernest?' she said, {{looking up from}} it into his face. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> taking <b>this</b> mastership?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Louise {{tells me}} that <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{bringing}} <b>this</b> young man down to the shore {{with you when you}} come to see us next week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Mat," [...] says Mr. George {{when he has}} {{recovered}} himself, [...] "we must try the lawyer. Now, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> rascal?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much, sergeant," [...] the {{barrister}} said. [...] "Please remain here while we talk it over. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Mr. Pettigrew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I dunno. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> job of mine? Ain't {{it pretty}} slick?" [...] And Ike Rasmer {{surveyed}} {{his work with}} evident satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Margaret <b>this</b> time?' said Ethel, for Tom alone ever durst seriously {{touch on}} the {{undefined}} impression that all entertained of Flora's only child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> giving <b>this</b> boy {{a liberal}} education?" [...] said Mr. Sewell {{some time later}} in the evening, after Moses and Mara were gone to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I {{have not been}} very nice," [...] she said sadly. [...] "Never mind. <b>You</b> must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> evening, John, sometimes--as a sort of atonement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> performance?" [...] asked Tom, {{wheeling}} {{round to}} Polly, who still sat by Mrs. Shaw, {{in the shadow}} of the bed-curtains.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} going to ask your wife, Okiok, what she and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{business}} of making an angekok of poor Ippegoo," [...] said Rooney.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don Ippolito," [...] said Mrs. Vervain, {{turning to}} the priest, who had been {{listening}} intently to all this trivial talk, [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sketch?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He met her clear gaze. [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all <b>this</b> business, Eleanor?" [...] {{he asked}} abruptly. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I had {{a sort of}} fit in the cathedral?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't blame me; don't {{grieve for}} me. Read the rest. I want <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> with my thoughts--to {{feel about it}} as I feel at this moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours and Lady Tringle's, {{and your}} daughters', no doubt. At any rate, Sir Thomas, <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> again. I am sure <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it again. If {{you find that}} your daughter's {{happiness}} depends upon it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Louis, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> You {{had better}} keep hold of your uncle's hand, {{as well as}} mine, or you may get a nasty tumble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{a bewildering}} suggestion!" [...] he murmured, looking uncomfortably {{over the side}} of the boat. [...] "I say, Forrest, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Uncle C.?" [...] she said, {{after some}} pause. The uncle {{of the two}} young ladies had been {{listening}} thus far in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You were content--a month ago," [...] he said. [...] "You {{have been}} in London for two days, and you have come back a changed woman. Why must <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> leaving <b>this</b> place? Why need you go at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Olive Asher," [...] cried Mrs. Easterfield {{in a voice}} {{which was}} almost a wail, [...] "do {{you mean to say}} that you are to be {{considered}} in this matter, that for a moment <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> marrying <b>this</b> man?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will plead then at once my pardon and {{privilege}} this evening--And now," [...] (speaking {{as if he}} had succeeded in establishing some confidence with her ladyship,) [...] "what do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> blind story?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come up {{and have}} some breakfast with me," [...] said Mortimer, and he took me into his own chambers.--"Now, what DO <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Jackson?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, Barrymore; you can go." [...] When {{the butler}} had left us Sir Henry turned to me. [...] "Well, Watson, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{friendship}} remains {{just the}} same, Richard. Let me know frankly what <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> campaign, {{since you have}} now suddenly turned the current of the conversation in that direction?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Arthur," [...] she said, [...] "crime is {{a terrible}} thing, but {{nothing in the world}} can alter its punishment. If it is frightful for <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> what must it be for him? And you are guilty and he is not." ...|$|R
60|$|What <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> Let me hear. I {{shall have}} my second Book in {{readiness}} forthwith.|$|R
60|$|If <b>you</b> will <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{and will}} have the {{materials}} ready in a little basket, I will call for you at the office at half-past twelve on Tuesday, and take you up to the hall, where the table {{will be ready for}} you.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right; I wash MY {{hands of}} the matter. But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you're going to feel sick {{whenever}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> day." [...] And away he went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! {{we come to}} my old notions for my sisters. I {{thought they}} would have been governesses like myself, but they married; and now tell me, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> scheme of Miss Mohun and Agatha?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> lad?" [...] Mr. Rawlinson, who was {{in charge}} of the watch, asked him; as, after {{watching}} his opportunity, he made a rush to the side and caught a firm hold of a shroud.|$|E
6000|$|... "No wonder," [...] replied Holgrave, smiling; [...] "for I {{have told}} you a secret which I hardly began to know before I found myself giving it utterance. Remember it, however; and when the truth becomes clear to <b>you,</b> then <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{moonlight}} scene!" ...|$|R
6000|$|While I {{was saying}} all this--I suppose {{in a very}} excitable manner--my husband looked, as our young sailor-friend would phrase it, quite taken aback. [...] "You were always quick at contriving, Leah," [...] he said; [...] "but {{how in the world}} came <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> plan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And, in {{the mean}} time, the world went on dancing, and betting, and banqueting, and making speeches, and {{breaking}} hearts and heads, till the time arrived when social stock is taken, {{the results of the}} campaign estimated and ascertained, and the question asked, [...] "Where do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> going <b>this</b> year?" ...|$|R
