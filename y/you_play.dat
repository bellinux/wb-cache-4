5|$|It {{was first}} time I ever swung wood full time. I was {{learning}} how to play pro ball. I had never played every day in my life. That's totally different.... You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game.

5|$|Abbott {{has created}} several games, {{including}} card games, board games, and one equipment game. As a whole, his games {{are not of}} particular fame, although they have some unique elements that set them apart from mainstream games. For instance, the card game Metamorphosis is a complex trick-taking game. As <b>you</b> <b>play</b> the game, the rules change three times, so {{it is as if}} you are playing four different games that are threaded together.|$|E

It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm {{going to go out there}} and play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way <b>you</b> <b>play</b> the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. <b>You</b> <b>play</b> next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

25|$|I've always {{believed}} that <b>you</b> <b>play</b> to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when I was a kid, but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

Matthews played for Stoke's reserve team during the 1930–31 season, coming up first against Burnley.
