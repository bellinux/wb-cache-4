5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the body of a}} man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when it turns out to be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the first-half, it was Alavés who started the half the better of the two sides. Contra put a cross from {{the right side of}} the pitch into the penalty area, which was met by Moreno, whose header beat Westerveld to make the scoreline 3–2. Four minutes later Alavés had equalised. They were awarded a free-kick 25 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> goal and Moreno went straight through the Liverpool wall and into the goal past Westerveld. Liverpool reacted to the scoreline being levelled at 3–3 by substituting Stéphane Henchoz with Vladimír Šmicer. Steven Gerrard was placed in the right-back position as a result of the change. Three minutes later, Owen was brought down by defender Antonio Karmona, who was subsequently booked. Liverpool were awarded a free-kick, which Gary McAllister hit into the Alavés wall. In the 64th minute, both sides made substitutions. Liverpool replaced Emile Heskey with Robbie Fowler, while Alavés goalscorer Javi Moreno with Pablo.|$|E
5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away. A heavy propane tank was lofted and thrown 100 yards from one of the chicken houses, and 19 cattle on the property were killed. Remarkably, a family of four taking shelter inside the house were completely unharmed. The tornado maintained EF4 strength as it tore through the rural community of Shiloh, sweeping away numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes and killing 5 people at that location. Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people. Dozens of homes in Trenton were completely destroyed, 18 others sustained major damage, {{and tens of thousands of}} trees were downed in the area. A grocery store, two apartment complexes, and a funeral home were destroyed as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't been a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the {{governor}} this afternoon till I started for here." [...] The genuineness of the accent surprised Heyst, without convincing {{him of the}} truth of the words.|$|R
60|$|Then, to his astonishment, {{the hand}} he had laid upon the hat was {{snatched}} away, and next moment Hetty, {{with a red}} spot in her cheek, stood at least a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. She had moved so quickly {{that he was not}} quite sure how she had got there.|$|R
60|$|He {{lifted his}} hand. Makamuk swung the axe, a broadaxe for the {{squaring}} of logs. The bright steel flashed through the frosty air, {{poised for a}} perceptible instant above Makamuk’s head, then descended upon Subienkow’s bare neck. Clear through flesh and bone it cut its way, biting deeply into the log beneath. The amazed savages saw the head bounce a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the blood-spouting trunk.|$|R
25|$|In 2007 {{the farm}} {{was at the}} front line {{in the fight against}} foot and mouth disease as it was only three hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> where {{hundreds}} of cattle had to be killed.|$|E
25|$|The Alvin Independent School District opened Nolan Ryan Junior High School, {{located at}} 11500 Shadow Creek Parkway (FM 2234) in Pearland, Texas, {{just a few}} hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Nolan Ryan Expressway.|$|E
25|$|Clover's {{health was}} fragile {{throughout}} his life. He died of uraemia aged 57. He {{is buried in}} Brompton Cemetery, London. His grave is only 200 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> that of fellow anaesthetics pioneer, John Snow.|$|E

50|$|The {{shortest}} possible {{field goal}} under current strategies is slightly over 17 yards in American football and 8 yards in Canadian football (Canadian football requires {{the ball to}} be snapped at least one <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the end zone). Theoretically, a field goal could be attempted from a shorter distance {{as long as the}} holder stays behind the line of scrimmage (or via a drop kick at any point on the field), but in practice this has never happened.|$|R
50|$|The Italian {{operations}} during 1916 had one extraordinarily positive result: Austrian divisions {{were pulled}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces {{to organize a}} counter-offensive. The Brusilov Offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General Aleksei Brusilov believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close {{attention was paid to}} preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere seventy-five <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Austrian trenches.|$|R
25|$|Hoover bequeathed {{his estate}} to Tolson, who moved into Hoover's house after Hoover died. Tolson {{accepted}} the American flag that draped Hoover's casket. Tolson is buried a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 1934, {{the wreck}} of the ocean liner SS Morro Castle, which caught on fire and burned, beached itself near the city just <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Asbury Park Convention Hall; the city {{capitalized}} on the event, turning the wreck into a tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|The Winter Hill air {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} 27 February 1958 when the Silver City Airways Bristol 170 Freighter G-AICS, traveling from the Isle of Man to Manchester, England, crashed into Winter Hill (also known as Rivington Moor) several hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Independent Television Authority's Winter Hill transmitting station.|$|E
50|$|She {{was known}} by the {{incident}} at the football game between the teams of Brazil and Chile in the Maracanã Stadium, in a World Cup qualifier in 1989. A firework thrown by Mello landed about a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Chilean goalkeeper Roberto Rojas. Rojas then deliberately cut himself with a razor hidden in his glove {{in an attempt to}} have the match nullified and possibly have Brazil penalized by FIFA. Rojas, his head bloodied, was carried off the field; his teammates then refused to return claiming that conditions were unsafe. The match was unfinished.|$|R
60|$|Oblivious, therefore, to {{the storm}} raging a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, he smoked on with great contentment, till {{suddenly}} it struck him that, for a presumably devout lover, jilted that very night, he was displaying too little emotion. He debated swiftly within himself {{whether or not he}} should have a dash at manly grief, but {{came to the conclusion that}} it could not be done. Melancholy on this maddest, merriest day of all the glad New Year, the day on which he had utterly routed the powers of evil, as represented by Sir Thomas, was impossible. He decided, rather, on a let-us-be-reasonable attitude.|$|R
60|$|He sat up. His head bandage {{had become}} loose and got over one eye, and he whipped {{the whole thing}} off. Kurt was also sitting up, a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him, pink as ever, wrapped in blankets, and with an {{aluminium}} diver's helmet over his knee, staring {{at him with a}} severe expression, and rubbing his downy unshaven chin. They were both on a slanting floor of crimson padding, and above them was an opening like a long, low cellar flap that Bert by an effort perceived to be the cabin door in a half-inverted condition. The whole cabin had in fact turned on its side.|$|R
25|$|The match {{went ahead}} with around a {{thousand}} demonstrators (including Pete Seeger) corralled 100 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the field of play, which was surrounded by the police. No violence occurred at the game but a pipe bomb was set off {{in the early morning}} outside the headquarters of the Eastern Rugby Union resulting in damage to the building estimated at $50,000. No one was injured.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1866, the {{new town}} Perez-Dasmariñas had {{complied}} {{with the requirements of}} a typical Philippine town. A spacious town plaza {{at the center of the}} town with the church and the convent made of stone and bricks, a casa tribunal (courthouse) made of wood and nipa, a primary school for children and various houses made of nipa were built in designated areas. A cemetery was located around 200 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the church and surrounded with wooden fence.|$|E
25|$|Many {{residents}} {{left town}} with the legislators immediately after their adjournment on July 6. Those {{who did not}} were faced with a cholera outbreak in August. Fort Riley was also affected. Union Pacific Railroad lines reached the abandoned town in 1866 – {{as part of a}} transcontinental route approved by the Pawnee legislature – passing just <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the north side of the}} capitol. Its passage through Pawnee was due in part to the unreliability of the nearby river for navigation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bottazzi himself remarks {{upon this}} discrepancy. 'To whom does this hand belong?' he asked--'this hand, {{a half a}} <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the medium's head, seen while her visible hands are rigorously {{controlled}} by her two neighbors? Is it {{the hand of a}} monstrous long arm which liberates itself from the medium's body, then dissolves, to afterward [...] "materialize" [...] afresh? Is it something analogous to the pteropod of an amoeba, which projects itself from the body, then retreats into it only to reappear in another place? Mystery!' But this is not the most grewsome sight; one of the professors, stealing a glance behind the medium, saw remnants of legs and arms lying about the cabinet." ...|$|R
50|$|Fouls {{punishable}} by a direct free kick (i.e. handling {{the ball and}} most physical fouls), committed by the defensive team within the penalty area, may be penalised by a penalty kick. A penalty kick is taken from the penalty spot. The penalty spot is located 12 <b>yards</b> (10.97m) <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the goal line.|$|R
60|$|Just then, as Dorothy {{turned around}} to look at the {{whirling}} mountains, she was in time to see tiny Trot come flying from the nearest hill to fall upon the soft grass not a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> where she stood. Trot was so dizzy she couldn't stand at first, but she wasn't at all hurt, and presently Betsy came flying to them and would have bumped into the others had they not retreated in time to avoid her. Then, in quick succession, came the Lion, Hank and the Sawhorse, bounding from mountain to mountain to fall safely upon the greensward. Only the Wizard was now left behind, and they waited so long for him that Dorothy began to be worried.|$|R
25|$|In {{new housing}} developments, the NDCBU {{location}} is fixed by the developer, not the USPS, {{and may be}} located hundreds of <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the addressee's actual residence. A parcel locker for receipt of packages and a separate compartment for outgoing mail are usually built into the station. The mail carrier will have a key to a large door on one side that reaches all the compartments, and the residents or tenants will each have {{a key to the}} door into their individual compartment on the other side.|$|E
25|$|The site {{measured}} 55,000 square {{yards and}} included a cricket pitch and bowling greens. The rugby stadium was opened on 18 September 1886 by Alderman Riley, who kicked off before the Halifax v Hull F.C. match. Forward Ernest Williamson scored {{the first try}} (his only try for Halifax) and the home side {{went on to win}} in front of a crowd of around 8,000. As Thrum Hall was built on an old hilltop farm, it had a distinctive slope of 4 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the main grandstand touchline.|$|E
25|$|He {{collapsed}} in Mexico City on Saturday, December 6, 1924, while attending {{a meeting of}} the Pan-American Federation of Labor. It was recognized that his condition was critical and that he might not survive for long. Gompers expressed the desire to die on American soil, and he was placed aboard a special train and sped toward the border. Gompers was buried at the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Gompers is buried only a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> industrialist Andrew Carnegie, another important figure of industry in the Gilded Age.|$|E
50|$|Mary was {{a senior}} at Santa Clara High School in California. She had {{attended}} a beer party and left the party house {{late in the evening}} of Friday, September 9, 1977. Her body was found the next day approximately 300 <b>yards</b> <b>away,</b> hanging <b>from</b> a chain-link fence in Washington Park (now War Memorial Park) in Santa Clara. Coroner's evidence indicated that she had been raped and strangled.|$|R
60|$|It {{was between}} two and {{three in the morning}} when the trees of the central island were made out; they were not more than five hundred <b>yards</b> <b>away.</b> Presently <b>from</b> a {{projecting}} point, where a heavy mass could be made out, a cannon was fired. The shot flew overhead, but the effect was instantaneous. Shouts were heard on shore and the sound of oars in rowlocks.|$|R
50|$|Because {{breeding}} {{sites are}} usually {{close to the}} over-wintering burrows, migration to their breeding area is quick, and usually occurs during or immediately after a heavy rainfall. The breeding sites they choose are fishless ponds and vernal pools, filled with spring snow meltwater in northern latitudes. Some breeding ponds may be hundreds of <b>yards</b> (meters) <b>away</b> <b>from</b> their forest home in fragmented landscapes.|$|R
25|$|The City Ground is 300 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Notts County's Meadow Lane stadium, on {{the other}} side of the Trent. The two grounds are the closest {{professional}} football stadia in England and the second closest in the United Kingdom after the grounds of Dundee and Dundee United. When built, the ground was within the boundaries of Nottingham, which had been made a city the previous year and gave rise to the name of the stadium. A boundary change in the 1950s meant that the City Ground is now no longer within the city of Nottingham whilst Notts County's ground is.|$|E
25|$|The miners sank their shafts in {{turns of}} up to , each turn being a few <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{the bottom of the}} {{preceding}} one, along a gallery which may have been the working level reached by the earlier shaft. They climbed up and down their shafts using either footholes in the shaft walls or stemples, wooden steps built into the sides, an exhausting and dangerous way to start and finish a day's work. These climbing shafts were usually within the miners' “coe”, the limestone-walled cabin in which they stored tools, a change of clothes and food. Where the mine was on a hillside the vein could often be reached via an adit or tunnel driven into the slope.|$|E
25|$|The next boat {{to receive}} the Italian {{attention}} was MTB 316, only 50 <b>yards</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Scipione Africanos port side. The motor torpedo vessel caught fire and blew up {{just a few seconds}} after the cruiser's salvos struck home. The craft, commanded by lieutenant Richard Adams and with a crew of eleven, sank with all hands. The explosion took place so close to the cruiser that pieces from MTB 316s machinery and hull fell aboard Scipione Africano. The analysis of these remains produced some controversy, when Italian sources claimed to have sunk MTB 305, not at the Mediterranean theatre at the time, on the basis of an inscription from a recovered wooden panel.|$|E
6000|$|He stood {{perfectly}} still, half a <b>yard</b> or more <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her; and it {{flashed through}} her mind what a sort of lotus-eater's stupor had begun in him and was taking possession of her. Then he said-- ...|$|R
5|$|McCarty {{remained}} a {{presence on the}} field for the Knights in 2001, expanding his role by playing some snaps as a fullback. He rushed for 160 yards in that year's Burnaby Bowl, including three touchdowns as a halfback and one as a fullback. McCarty had another notable performance in a 67–7 blowout against the South Delta Sun Devils, running for 200 yards and three touchdowns. He also showed himself to be a capable receiver, including making five catches for 66 yards in a match against the Holy Cross Crusaders. McCarty also finished that game with 110 yards and two touchdowns on only three carries. Despite giving up only 19 points during the entire regular season, the Knights lost 32–26 in the quarter-finals of the playoffs against the Centennial Centaurs after McCarty was stopped one <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the endzone on the last play of the game.|$|R
5000|$|Pete Gray {{stood up}} and went to throw a '42' grenade and he was shot by a sniper in his left forearm. We thought the grenade had gone off. We punched his arm down onto the ground to staunch the bleeding, believing he'd lost half his right forearm and hand, but it was still there and his arm bent at the forearm instead of the elbow [...] - [...] a horrible thing to watch. ...There's 'incoming' everywhere, loads of stuff going down the range and then 'bang' my pal [...] "Fester" [...] Greenwood, gets it just above his left eye, only a <b>yard</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> me. That was a terrible thing. 'Fester' was such a lovely guy. Then it was 'Baz' Barratt. 'Baz' had gone back to try to get field {{dressings}} for Pete Grey and as he was coming back, 'bang', he got it in the back. This was when we just stalled as a platoon.
