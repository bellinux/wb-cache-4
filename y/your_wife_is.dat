500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{moderately}} positive review and awarded it a [...] "B". Adams highlighted the serious discussion between Darryl and Jim in the warehouse, noting that [...] "Jim's extrication {{is something to}} root for", and that it honored [...] "Craig Robinson's dedication to the show". While feeling {{that some of the}} episode's subplots were [...] "forced", he did, however, compliment the Pam and Nellie pairing due to [...] "Pam's past ability to break through [...] Angela and Dwight's defenses". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real until <b>your</b> <b>wife</b> <b>is</b> on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's been a while since The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking". He did, however, call it a [...] "particularly overstuffed episode", and felt that Erin's subplot could have been saved for a different episode.|$|E
