25|$|In 1971, some jam {{sessions}} {{with a group}} of musicians in London had resulted in two albums' worth of material, unofficially released without Vangelis' permission in 1978, titled Hypothesis and The Dragon. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn. A more successful project was his scoring of wildlife documentary films in the early 1970s made by French filmmaker Frédéric Rossif. The first soundtrack L'Apocalypse des animaux was released in 1973. In 1972, the student riots of 1968 provided the inspiration for an album titled Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit (Make <b>Your</b> <b>Dream</b> Last Longer Than the Night), comprising musical passages mixed with news snippets and protest songs; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the riots. He also did music for the 1973 Henry Chapier film Amore.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{mainstream}} narrative, {{it is assumed}} that Abraham's dream of sacrificing his son was a command by God. The verse in reference (i.e. 37:104-105) is in Surah As-Saffat and the quoted ayahs are translated by known Islamic scholar Abul A'la Maududi as [...] "We cried out O' Ibraheem you have indeed fulfilled <b>your</b> <b>dream.</b> Thus do we award the good do-ers." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the mid-1980s}} in Vancouver the {{influential}} Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all {{wind up in}} hardcore female bands. In 1987, the magazine Sassy premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. An article [...] "Women, sex and rock and roll" [...] published by Puncture, edited by Katherine Spielmann, in 1989 became the first manifesto of the movement. In 1991, a radio program hosted by Lois Maffeo entitled <b>Your</b> <b>Dream</b> Girl aimed at angry young women debuted on Olympia, Washington radio station KAOS.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the {{characters}} in the series are derived from mythological creatures. In some cases the creatures themselves appeared, and in other cases a character was designed to incorporate the characteristics of a mythological creature. Stories and situations made use of these mythological elements to create jokes and draw comparisons with the original mythology. For example, the Oni choose tag to decide their contest with Earth because the Japanese word for Tag, Onigokko, means [...] "game of the Oni". When Ataru grabs Lum's horns during their contest and she misunderstands his statement that he can get married, it is a reference to the myth that grabbing the horns of an Oni will make <b>your</b> <b>dream</b> come true.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell {{to state that}} [...] "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas". One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the [...] "surrealist ethos" [...] of relying [...] "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This {{can be seen in}} John Merrick's dream of his mother in The Elephant Man, Agent Cooper's dreams of the red room in Twin Peaks and the [...] "dreamlike logic" [...] of the narrative found in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that [...] "Waking dreams {{are the ones that are}} important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control <b>your</b> <b>dream.</b> I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose... right there is the power of cinema." [...] His films are known for their use of magic realism.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Staying Alive", {{was written}} and produced by Jay R Sillona and Keith Martin under Sillona's own recording label, Homeworkz Records. The song uses Auto-Tune, and features rap verses by Q-York and additional back-up vocals by beauty queen Krista Kleiner, who was Sillona's {{partner at the}} time. It marked {{the second time that}} Nina collaborated with Sillona, since their duet of [...] "Muli" [...] in early 2010. The song is described as [...] "another smoking track with bold and powerful lyrics: 'I shouldn't let them knock me down down down... I'm staying alive.'" [...] "However Much Love" [...] is an acoustic flute-driven song, considered as one of Nina's distinctly slow and sentimental ballads in the album. The lyrics speak of steadfast and unconditional love. Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a [...] "standout," [...] stating [...] "Nina's voice heightens the pain and vulnerability evoked by the lyrics and melody." [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an inspirational power ballad, written by Jude Gitamondoc. Nina insisted the song's inclusion with the purpose of encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. Its message is about not giving up on your dreams. Nina related the lyrics to her personal struggles, saying [...] "That's important for me because I, really, almost gave up [...] If this is what you always wanted to do, if this is <b>your</b> <b>dream,</b> don't lose hope. Go for it. Me, I almost gave up and if not for my faith and belief in God, I would have lost the hope that was left. So, just really keep on reaching for your dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the words}} of the Qur'an never {{explicitly}} state that Abraham's dream was a Divine command. The Quran only states that Abraham had a dream, which he interpreted as a command from God, and Abraham was eventually stopped by God Himself from [...] "sacrificing" [...] his son. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} Jewish/Christian narratives, and also the mainstream Sunni/Shia narratives which assume the biblical narrative is true. According to Islam, the problem with this interpretation is that it yields a logical contradiction, as it is clearly stated that no life can be taken without a just cause, and there was no just cause for Abraham to take the life of his son. There are non-mainstream translations and expositions of the Qur'an which harmonize the incident of Abraham's sacrifice and make the narrative of these verses consistent with the Quran's own laws, such as the one by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, who translates the key verses as follows: 'We immediately removed this thought from Abraham’s mind and called out to him, O Abraham. You considered <b>your</b> <b>dream</b> as Allah's command and laid your son for the purpose of slaughtering him! This was not Our command, but merely a dream of yours. Therefore, We have saved you and your son from this. We have done so because We keep those who lead their lives according to Divine guidance safe from such mishaps.' (37: 104-105). As for the term [...] "sacrifice", the meaning of this term as it relates to Ishmael in the following verses is explained as: [...] "As far as the son is concerned, We saved him for a far greater and tremendous sacrifice. (This great sacrifice refers to the fact that instead of keeping his leadership confined to Syria, We wanted him to become the custodian of Our House the Ka'bah, which was located in the far off barren land of Arabia and which had to become the center and gathering place of all those the world over, who believed in the unity of God (internal reference 14:37))." ...|$|E
