5|$|Lundy has {{attracted}} many vagrant birds, in particular species from North America. The island's bird list totals 317 species. This has {{included the following}} species, each of which represents the sole British record: Ancient murrelet, eastern phoebe and eastern towhee. Records of bimaculated lark, American robin and common <b>yellowthroat</b> were also firsts for Britain (American robin has also occurred two further times on Lundy). Veerys in 1987 and 1997 were Britain's second and fourth records, a Rüppell's warbler in 1979 was Britain's second, an eastern Bonelli's warbler in 2004 was Britain's fourth, and a black-faced bunting in 2001 Britain's third.|$|E
5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds {{that are at the}} southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, common <b>yellowthroat,</b> swamp sparrow, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as Virginia rail and sora.|$|E
25|$|The area {{is home to}} rare {{breeding}} {{populations of}} both Gray and red-shouldered hawks. Species which call the Preserve home include Abert's towhee, American yellow warbler, Anna's hummingbird, ash-throated flycatcher, Bell's vireo, black-chinned hummingbird, black phoebe, black-tailed gnatcatcher, brown-crested flycatcher, Bullock's oriole, canyon wren, common <b>yellowthroat,</b> Cooper's hawk, crissal thrasher, curve-billed thrasher, Gambel's quail, Gila woodpecker, greater roadrunner, hooded oriole, ladder-backed woodpecker, Lesser Goldfinch, Lucy's warbler, northern cardinal, phainopepla, song sparrow, summer tanager, tropical kingbird, vermilion flycatcher, western kingbird, willow flycatcher, yellow-billed cuckoo, and the yellow-breasted chat.|$|E
50|$|The common <b>yellowthroat's</b> song is a loud twichety twichety twichety twich. Its call is a soft jip.|$|R
50|$|Future {{studies are}} needed to {{understand}} specific migration patterns of common <b>yellowthroats</b> {{in other parts of the}} United States.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} scarce, and is outnumbered in winter by migrant common <b>yellowthroats,</b> but {{appears not to}} be endangered. The {{nominate}} subspecies, however, is either very rare or has gone extinct {{in the last years}} of the 20th century.|$|R
25|$|The Bahama oriole {{is unique}} to Andros Island. Critically endangered, it has an {{estimated}} remaining population of as few as several hundred. The great lizard cuckoo is found only on Andros, New Providence, and Eleuthera. The rare Kirtland's warbler—an estimated 600 remain—was first seen on the island in 1879 and some individuals winter on Andros. The endangered migratory Atlantic subspecies of the piping plover favours the rocky shores and sandy beaches of Andros. Other rare and uncommon birds found in the Andros environ include the Bahama <b>yellowthroat,</b> Bahama woodstar, Bahama swallow, West Indian whistling duck and Key West quail dove.|$|E
25|$|Birdwatching {{activity}} peaks {{each spring}} (usually April) when dozens of migratory bird species can {{pass through the}} park in a single day. Many birds land inside the parade grounds of Fort Jefferson where they are often observed at close range. Common migratory warblers include the northern parula, American redstart, prairie warbler, hooded warbler, palm warbler, black-and-white warbler, common <b>yellowthroat,</b> yellow-rumped warbler, ovenbird, northern waterthrush, black-throated blue warbler, blackpoll warbler, and Cape May warbler, with more than 20 additional warbler species having shown up at least once. Several raptor species as well as cattle egrets are often seen hunting songbirds. Until early 2013 a small freshwater fountain existed beneath several seaside mahoe and buttonwood trees, and was the only freshwater source for many miles. Maintenance issues necessitated its removal, but a replacement water barrel is scheduled for installation {{in the fall of}} 2013. Each year several bird guides offer tours of Dry Tortugas National Park during April and early May when daily bird lists can often reach 100 or more species.|$|E
500|$|Combined with Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake, the Jordan River {{offers one}} of the region's richest bird resources. Over 200 bird species use the river for {{breeding}} habitat or as a stop-over on their migratory routes. [...] Once-common native species such as the willow flycatcher, gray catbird, warbling vireo, American redstart, black tern, and yellow-billed cuckoo are no longer found along the river. The common <b>yellowthroat</b> and yellow-breasted chat are still found in small isolated populations. [...] The most common species now found are the black-billed magpie, mourning dove, western meadowlark, barn swallow, and the non-native ring-necked pheasant and starlings.|$|E
50|$|Other {{bird species}} known to inhabit the marsh include: red-winged blackbirds, common grackles, brown-headed cowbirds, sandhill cranes, common mergansers, double-crested cormorants, great blue herons, marsh wrens, tree {{swallows}}, common <b>yellowthroats,</b> ring-billed gulls, common moorhens, mallard ducks, wood ducks, Canada geese, barn swallows and soras.|$|R
50|$|All the <b>yellowthroats</b> {{have similar}} plumage, with yellow-green upperparts, yellow breast, and a mainly black bill. The adult male has a black {{facemask}} of variable extent, usually bordered above with a grey band. The female is similar, but lacks the black mask, {{and may be}} duller in plumage.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} freshwater marshes and lagoons, usually with cattails. It builds a cup nest of dead cattails {{which is usually}} attached to low on the stem of a living cattail. It lays 2-4 eggs, usually 3. Like other <b>yellowthroats</b> it forages low in vegetation and feeds on insects and other small invertebrates.|$|R
2500|$|Veracruz {{has been}} {{described}} as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere. There is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous Arsenura armida. As well as insects, the state is known for its many arachnids, and features over 25 species of tarantula (Theraphosidae), of which many are endemic. The state is part of Birdlife International’s Endemic Bird Area(EBA) project due to the number of endemic birds here. Some of these include green-cheeked amazon (Amazona viridigenalis), Tamaulipas crow (Corvus imparatus), Altamira <b>yellowthroat</b> (Geothlypis flavovelata) and crimson-collared grosbeak (Rhodothraupis celaeno). Despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas, it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well. Many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents (Peromyscus ochraventer, Neotoma angustapalata), the jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi) and coati (Nasua narica) [...] The endangered Baird's tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state's southern jungle regions, such as Biósfera Los Tuxtlas. This region is also the northernmost extent of the primate Alouatta palliata, or mantled howler.|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to common <b>yellowthroat,</b> Altamira <b>yellowthroat</b> and Bahama <b>yellowthroat,</b> with which it forms a superspecies, and was {{formerly}} considered conspecific.|$|E
50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of these {{closely related species}} is complicated, and it is sometimes difficult to define which forms merit species status. For example common <b>yellowthroat,</b> Belding's <b>yellowthroat,</b> Altamira <b>yellowthroat,</b> and Bahama <b>yellowthroat</b> are sometimes considered conspecific. Conversely masked <b>yellowthroat</b> can be split to three or even four species. The name 'yellowthroat' is sometimes used as an alternate name for the yellow-throated leaflove.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a fairly}} high level of bird {{biodiversity}} in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Birds living in the stream's watershed include worm-eating warblers, wood thrushes, ovenbirds, Eastern tufted titmouses, Eastern towhees, veerys, pileated woodpeckers, nuthatches, common <b>yellowthroats,</b> and American redstarts. Other bird species found in the watershed include scarlet tanagers, black-capped chickadees, and black-throated green warblers.|$|R
5000|$|Species {{of birds}} {{found within the}} park include purple martins, tree swallows, common <b>yellowthroats,</b> yellow-breasted chats, summer tanagers, blue grosbeaks, and indigo buntings. Sparrows are common in winter, namely the field, Savannah, song, swamp, white-throated, and white-crowned species. Barn owls {{have been known to}} {{frequent}} the old barns in the area. [...] Waterfowl include Canada geese and mallards.|$|R
50|$|Routes of {{migration}} vary {{based on the}} season and location of common <b>yellowthroats.</b> During fall migration, from August to October, common <b>yellowthroats</b> in Canada, Western, Eastern, and Central U.S., and regions outside of the United States all have unique migration routes. When migrating in the fall months, all adults and immature individuals tend to arrive at their migration destinations around the same time. Migration differences in timing and routes are also seen during the spring months from early February to late May in these same groups across the United States, Canada, and other areas. However, males generally arrive at their destination site before the females during the spring migration months. During both fall and spring migration, many birds take time to rest during a stopover period. Some individuals stay at their stopover destinations for several weeks or months while others spend {{only a few days}} resting before they continue on in their migration patterns to their final destination.|$|R
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to common <b>yellowthroat,</b> Belding's <b>yellowthroat,</b> and Bahama <b>yellowthroat,</b> with which it forms a superspecies. It has been {{considered}} conspecific with these species.|$|E
50|$|The {{salt marsh}} common <b>yellowthroat,</b> (Geothlypis trichas sinuosa), is a {{subspecies}} {{of the common}} <b>yellowthroat,</b> a New World warbler.|$|E
50|$|The song of Bahama <b>yellowthroat</b> is a loud wichety wichety wichety wich, {{similar to}} that of common <b>yellowthroat.</b> The call is a softer jip than that of common yellowthoat.|$|E
5|$|Wading and {{woodland}} {{birds are}} year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide {{an abundance of}} cover and food for sandpipers, great blue herons, great egrets, and green herons. The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated woodpeckers, woodcocks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, common <b>yellowthroats</b> and northern parulas.|$|R
50|$|As one of few {{riparian}} {{zones in}} a near-natural state along Alameda Creek, Quarry Lakes serves {{an important role}} is harboring migratory birds. Thanks to restoration projects in the park, the area has attracted wood ducks, great blue herons, snowy egrets, and other water birds. Nesting boxes and berry planting have also brought smaller birds like tree swallows, northern flickers, and salt marsh <b>yellowthroats.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{of these}} birds are marshes and other wet areas with dense low vegetation, {{and may also}} be found in other areas with dense shrub. However, these birds are less common in dry areas. Females appear to prefer males with larger masks. Common <b>yellowthroats</b> nest in low areas of the vegetation, laying 3-5 eggs in a cup-shaped nest. Both parents feed the young.|$|R
50|$|The song of Belding's <b>yellowthroat</b> is a loud wichety wichety wichety wich, {{similar to}} that of common <b>yellowthroat</b> but deeper, fuller, and with some buzzes. The call is a soft jip, again similar to common yellowthoat.|$|E

50|$|Through the {{lobbying}} {{of public interest}} groups, actions were initiated to restore Maplewood Flats back to its natural state. Landscape architect Patrick Mooney, designed all the major enhancement projects for Maplewood Flats, including the freshwater marsh. The projects were installed from 1995 to 2004. In 1997, the system was dedicated {{and is now a}} breeding ground for marsh wrens, common <b>yellowthroats,</b> wood ducks, American coots, blue-winged teal, red-winged blackbirds, pied-billed grebes, soras and virginia rails.|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of migration routes of many birds is limited and researchers have employed various methods to determine migratory patterns. Recently, parasites {{have been used}} to track migratory birds. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether haemosporidian parasite lineages detect significant geographic structure in common <b>yellowthroats</b> (Geothlypis trichas).

5|$|There {{are several}} old-growth forests with tree species and genera such as black oak, hickory, beech, cherry birch, sweetgum, red maple, and tuliptree. The forests also contain owls, bats, chipmunks, groundhogs, gypsy moths, rabbits, raccoons, opossums, coyotes. In addition, over 130 species of {{butterflies}} {{can be found}} in the park. In 1937, it was noted that the marshlands had fauna such as red-winged blackbirds, <b>yellowthroats,</b> green bottle flies, beetles, dragonflies, tadpoles, herons, kingfishers, and ospreys. Its flora included cattail, skunk cabbage, and moss.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>yellowthroats</b> {{are small}} songbirds that have olive backs, wings and tails, yellow throats and chests, and white bellies. Adult males have black face masks which stretch {{from the sides}} of the neck across the eyes and forehead, which are bordered above with white or gray. Females are similar in {{appearance}}, but have paler underparts and lack the black mask. Immature birds are similar in appearance to the adult female. First-year males have a faint black mask which darkens completely by spring.|$|R
50|$|The island {{especially}} provides important habitat to many guilds {{of birds}} including: seabirds, shorebirds, marshbirds, waterfowl, songbirds and raptors. During the summer, {{large numbers of}} double-crested cormorants, Virginia rails and various songbirds (Savannah sparrows and common <b>yellowthroats)</b> rely on the island for nesting habitat. In addition, Leach's storm-petrels have been confirmed nesting on the Island since 2002 (one of only two sites where this species nests in Massachusetts). During the fall migration, numerous species of raptors (such as peregrine falcons and Cooper's hawks) and neotropical migrants use the island as feeding and resting habitat.|$|R
