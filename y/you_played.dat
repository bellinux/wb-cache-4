[...] My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with. [...] They kept getting better and better. [...] When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. [...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while <b>you</b> <b>played.</b> [...] I got involved in that circuit. [...] I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where {{you really have to}} rely on words in those situations." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Jazz Me Blues" [...] {{was also}} {{important}} because it introduced {{what has been called}} the [...] "correlated chorus", a method of improvising that Beiderbecke's Davenport friend Esten Spurrier attributed to both Beiderbecke and Armstrong. [...] "Louis departed greatly from all cornet players in his ability to compose a close-knit individual 32 measures with all phrases compatible with each other", Spurrier told the biographers Sudhalter and Evans, [...] "so Bix and I always credited Louis as being the father of the correlated chorus: play two measures, then two related, making four measures, on which <b>you</b> <b>played</b> another four measures related to the first four, and so on ad infinitum {{to the end of the}} chorus. So the secret was simple—a series of related phrases." ...|$|E

500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played. It’s like playing the brother, or the cousin, of somebody that <b>you</b> <b>played</b> in another movie".|$|E
500|$|Green Hill Zone {{has also}} been {{recognized}} by critics as a classic, well-known video game level. It {{has been described as}} [...] "classic" [...] by Samit Sarkar of Polygon and by Jim Sterling and Chris Carter of Destructoid. Comparably, Joe Skrebels of Official Nintendo Magazine called it [...] "nostalgic", while Christopher Grant from Joystiq considered it to have a place [...] "in the center of your retro-gaming shrine". Kevin Wong of Complex stated that the game's and level's popularity were such that [...] "even if you didn't have a Genesis, this was the level <b>you</b> <b>played</b> at the department store while your parents went shopping." [...] Andy Kelly from Computer and Video Games called the Green Hill theme a [...] "monumental slice of Sega nostalgia", and GamesRadar writer Justin Towell also referred to it as classic. Anka has summarized that [...] "Green Hill Zone in the original game has gone down as an instantly recognisable piece of music in pop culture".|$|E

The six were honored on November 19, 1997 in a full military funeral at Arlington National Cemetery and a headstone commemorating all six airmen was placed at the site. Hambleton was unable to attend due to poor health, but a letter from him was read. He wrote, [...] "They deserve all the accolades that we, the living, can bestow upon them. Again, I thank them, I honor them, and I will always hold great faith in my heart with them." [...] Clark was present. He told {{the families of the}} downed fliers that [...] "Each of <b>you</b> <b>played</b> a distinct role and forming the character of these men who so willingly paid a very dear price to help me get out of the jungles of Vietnam.

500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if <b>you</b> <b>played</b> loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, you were playing too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|While Ray Davies {{had been}} {{instructed}} {{at the time}} to write [...] "Beatle-type" [...] material for commercial reasons, [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] was written as a more R composition. The song is centred on a guitar riff by Dave Davies, which has since been referred to as [...] "instantly identifiable." [...] American musicologist Robert Walser described [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] as [...] "the first hit song built around power chords." [...] The song has since been labeled as an early influence of the heavy metal genre, with critic Denise Sullivan of AllMusic writing, You Really Got Me' remains a blueprint song in the hard rock and heavy metal arsenal." [...] However, Dave Davies has since rejected the idea that the song is heavy metal, saying [...] "I've never really like that term, heavy metal. I think, in all humility, it was the first heavy guitar riff rock record. Just because of the sound—if <b>you</b> <b>played</b> it on a ukulele, it might not have been so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Muddy Waters {{recorded}} After the Rain {{the following}} year, incorporating {{elements of the}} sound of Electric Mud. According to Cosey, [...] "I'll never forget, as soon as I walked into the studio for the follow-up and Muddy saw me, he threw his arms around me, said 'Hey, how you doing, boy, play some of that stuff <b>you</b> <b>played</b> on that last album.'" [...] Following strong criticism of the album, Muddy Waters claimed that he disliked the album and its sound, {{and that he did}} not consider the album to be blues. He stated, [...] "Every time I go into Chess, [...] put some un-blues players with me [...] If you change my sound, then you gonna change the whole man." [...] In the biography The Mojo Man, Muddy Waters stated [...] "That Electric Mud record was dogshit. But when it came out, it started selling like wild, but then they started sending them back. They said, 'This can't be Muddy Waters with all this shit going on, all this wha-wha and fuzztone.'" [...] AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger panned the album as being [...] "crass".|$|E

500|$|According to Pokémon co-creator Ryan Long, {{the games}} were {{designed}} with the DS's unique features in mind, such as the Wi-Fi capabilities and slot for Game Boy Advance cartridges. The command buttons in the battle screen are large and color-coded; according to Masuda, this feature would facilitate gameplay for players unable to read. Also, the touchscreen interface was designed to encourage players to use their fingers rather than the stylus to manipulate the screen. Though most of the graphics in Diamond and Pearl are 2D, some of the background elements are 3D. The decision to retain 2D graphics in Diamond and Pearl drew criticism; in response, Tsunekazu Ishihara said that [...] "we wanted to maintain the original idea of Pokémon being a game that <b>you</b> <b>played</b> on this big map" [...] and explained that physically, {{the games were}} in three dimensions but was designed to [...] "maintain the original feel of the game". Responding to criticism {{over the use of}} Friend Codes in the games, Ishihara explained that it was a security measure taken to ensure that players {{would not be able to}} chat with strangers over the Wi-Fi connection. Nintendo released a statement detailing glitches found in Japanese releases of Diamond and Pearl. The glitches caused players to be stuck in an in-game wall or lose saved data. Nintendo has released patches to certain retailers in Japan to fix these glitches.|$|E
500|$|Alien: Isolation runs on a {{proprietary}} engine {{that was built}} from scratch by the Creative Assembly. The engine allowed the development team to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects {{as well as the}} alien's behavioural design. The engine's deferred rendering allowed artists to both place [...] "hundreds of dynamic lights in the scene" [...] and achieve great geometric detail. The alien itself was designed to look similar to H. R. Giger's original design for the creature from the film, including the skull underneath its semitransparent head. However, the designers did alter its humanoid legs with recurved ones to provide the alien a walk cycle that would hold up to scrutiny during longer encounters with the player. Between 70 and 80 different sets of animation for the alien were created. The alien's artificial intelligence was programmed with a complex set of behavioural designs that slowly unlock as it encounters the player, creating the illusion that the alien learns from each interaction and appropriately adjusts its hunting strategy. As gameplay designer Gary Napper explains, [...] "We needed something that would be different every time <b>you</b> <b>played</b> it. You’re going to die a lot, which means restarting a lot, and if the alien was scripted, you’d see the same behaviour. That makes the alien become predictable, and a lot less scary." [...] The save system was inspired by a scene in the film where Captain Dallas uses a key-card to access Nostromos computer, Mother.|$|E
500|$|Of the {{remaining}} songs, Rachel and Finn's performance of [...] "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" [...] attracted praise for Monteith's vocals, which Stack and Yahr commented [...] "sounded better than ever". [...] "Le Jazz Hot!" [...] received a split response. Burns wrote that Kurt [...] "pulled it off flawlessly", and Fallon called the performance [...] "far more moving and rousing" [...] {{than any of}} the songs in [...] "Grilled Cheesus". Stack and Benigno both graded it [...] "B+"; the latter deemed it [...] "very good" [...] but [...] "not transcendent". Reiter felt that the costumes and choreography overpowered the emotion of the piece, and Futterman found the number [...] "too self-indulgent and reminiscent of previous performances like 'Rose's Turn'." [...] Berk rated it two stars out of five, and commented, [...] "I get the idea, and the execution is commendable, but it still kind of sucked." [...] Rachel and Finn's deliberately offensive version of [...] "With You I'm Born Again" [...] received a [...] "C" [...] and [...] "C+" [...] from Benigno and Stack respectively. Both conceded that it was acceptable vocally, but as Stack acknowledged, [...] "the point of this song was to hate it, and I gotta say, Glee: <b>you</b> <b>played</b> me like a fiddle." [...] In December 2012, TV Guide named their rendition one of Glee worst performances. Regardless of being a send-up, Respers France found the number [...] "oddly endearing".|$|E

However, the {{magazine}} stated that fans may miss the spoken dialogue. Official Nintendo Magazine UK praised the Wii version's puzzles, story, and art direction, and complimented the new hint system, finishing with: [...] "One of the best point-and-click games ever, this will appeal to both newcomers and fans". Gaming and technology journalist James Woodcock said of the iPhone version: [...] "There {{are quite a few}} point and click adventures to choose from on the Apple iTunes Store and Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars is one of the finer selections if not the best to give your heartfelt attentions to and best of all travels with you in your pocket." [...] He also praised its story, puzzles, writing and art direction. Slide to Play also complimented the iPad version, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: Director's Cut HD is a great game that nearly anyone can enjoy. Our one caveat is that if <b>you</b> <b>played</b> through it on the iPhone, then the HD version probably doesn't offer enough new content to warrant another purchase. But if you're new to the game or you haven't played it in a while, this is the version to get. The iPad truly is the ideal platform for adventure games." [...] BeefJack praised the PC version's, puzzles, story, characters, new content and interface, but stated that audiovisual quality of older scenes is noticeably [...] "ropey", that there are too many sliding tile puzzles, and that [...] "the new jarring transition between old and new aesthetics lets it down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mpath {{integrated}} many features into Mplayer in {{an attempt}} to stay competitive and support its community. [...] Most of these features came with an update to Gizmo in December 1997, among them were voice chat, a chalkboard system in game channels that anyone could view known as ScribbleTalk, a built-in browser known as WebViewer, personal messaging, as well a ratings and rankings system for Plus members. [...] The voice chat only allowed one person to speak at a time, but became extremely successful to the point where half of all Mplayer's service usage was from voice chat. [...] Mpath soon after split off a division to focus on VoIP technologies in early 1999 catering to non-gamers. [...] Ranked games were played in a separate lobby than normal games. [...] Ranking was determined how well <b>you</b> <b>played</b> relative to your opponent's rank. [...] In some games, this rank was only provisional until <b>you</b> <b>played</b> a certain number of games. [...] Later on, the rank icon only appeared after enough games were played. [...] Users could also customize their profiles by choosing a portrait from a set of pictures and edit their profile with HTML, however this latter feature was removed in later versions of gizmo.|$|E
