500|$|During a November 26, 2013 radio interview, West {{explained}} why {{he believed that}} President Obama had problems pushing policies in Washington: [...] "Man, {{let me tell you}} something about George Bush and oil money and Obama and no money. People want to say Obama can't make these moves or he's not executing. That's because he ain't got those connections. Black people don't have the same level of connections as Jewish people...We ain't Jewish. We don't got family that got money like that." [...] In response to his comments, the Anti-Defamation League stated: [...] "There it goes again, the age-old canard that Jews are all-powerful and control the levers of power in government." [...] On December 21, 2013, West backed off of the original comment and told a Chicago radio station that [...] "I thought I was giving a compliment, but if anything it came off more ignorant. I don't know how being told <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> is an insult." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Precisely what I told you,' {{said the}} artful Ralph, turning to his friend, old Arthur. 'Precisely {{what made me}} {{consider}} the thing so fair and easy. There is no obligation on either side. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> and Miss Madeline has beauty and worth. She has youth, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money.</b> She has not money, you have not youth. Tit for tat, quits, a match of Heaven's own making!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Grizel," [...] he said impulsively, [...] "there's {{just one}} {{thing for you to}} do. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> and you maun run away afore he comes!" ...|$|E
60|$|BLANCO. No; {{but then}} you never worked when <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> enough to get drunk.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm a {{reformed}} character, now, Mr. McEachern. I <b>have</b> <b>money</b> of my own. It was left me. I hear <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> left <b>you,</b> too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better not. Judges {{are fairly}} testy about being 'seen.' It would look bad--especially after it got noised around that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> {{to spend on}} the case." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do as you choose; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> {{enough for}} all expenses, {{and it may}} be as well to hire a saddle horse to carry me back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> {{to carry}} to Mrs. Wildeve?" [...] said Christian's companion, after a silence. [...] "Don't {{you think it}} very odd that it shouldn't be given to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{seem to me}} {{very well}} placed for enjoying. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> and liberty and what is called in Europe a 'position.' But you take a painful view of life, as one may say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a centavo," [...] said Goodwin, firmly, [...] "until you are {{on board}} the Ariel. You would be drunk in thirty minutes if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I did, nearly--" [...] said Lady Laura; [...] "very nearly. You told me {{just now}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money,</b> and could {{therefore}} do as <b>you</b> pleased. I <b>had</b> no <b>money,</b> {{and could not}} do as I pleased." ...|$|R
5000|$|Then Lord Lurgan {{stepped forward}} and said, [...] "Gentlemen,If there's any among <b>you</b> <b>has</b> <b>money</b> to spend -For your grand english nobles I don't care a straw -Here's five {{thousand}} to one upon Master McGrath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the Mercato?" [...] said Tessa. [...] "Not to-morrow morning, {{because the}} patrigno will be there, {{and he is}} so cross. Oh! but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> and {{he will not be}} cross if you buy some salad. And there are some chestnuts. Do you like chestnuts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{way things}} have turned out, you can't; an' what's the odds {{if you wait}} two or three days? I'll see that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> enough to keep you goin' for a spell, anyhow, 'cause all the fellers what know you an' Plums will chip in to help." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Mackenzie--Margaret, {{will you}} share your lot with mine? It {{is true that}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money.</b> It is true that I have none,--not even a curacy now. But I don't think that any such {{consideration}} as that would weigh {{with you for a}} moment, if you can find it in your heart to love me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{plenty of}} <b>money.</b> It {{all depends on}} that. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> plenty of <b>money,</b> and your fancy goes that way, it is all very well. Come, we'll go upstairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|She stood {{a minute}} irresolute, {{and then she}} began again: [...] "Mr. Chung, I am too horrified to know what I ought to do. I can't grasp it and {{take it all in}} so quickly. If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> of your own, would you be able to run away and live somehow?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Quite proper. On two {{thousand}} a year {{a man can}} afford to be honest. Kick out lustily right and left!--After all, the world is like a spaniel; the more you beat it, the better it likes you--if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money.</b> Only don't kick too hard; for, after all, it has a hundred million pair of shins to your one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so, Sir Hugh, not so; 'tis {{for your}} sakes in truth since you {{remember}} {{you never told}} me what you would wish done--afterward. Your possessions also--where are they to be sent? Doubtless <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> and other things of value. Be sure that they shall be sealed up. I'll see to it myself, but--how shall I dispose of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you are so}} strange," [...] she protested. [...] "Over {{the hills}} there are the steam cars. They would take you {{to some of our}} {{beautiful}} cities where all is light and gaiety. You are safe here, whatever your troubles may have been. You say that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> and if you are lonely," [...] she added, dropping her voice, [...] "you need not go alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{not here}} to discuss that with you," [...] said I, [...] "but to be quit of you. And to that end I must talk of your position. Now, Mr. Drummond, I have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for. I know <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> of your own when you were {{borrowing}} mine. I know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> more since <b>you</b> were here in Leyden, though you concealed it even from your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can," [...] agreed Weston, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the <b>money.</b> The trouble is, I haven't. Saunders, I'm {{going back}} for those clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure, {{they are}} to be pitied, of course, and I feel for them; I did when I was a girl; for the same thing used to happen then. I don't know why Florida should be {{subjected}} to such embarrassments, too. It does seem sometimes as if it were something in the blood. They all get the idea that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{not going}} to bother you, Mrs. Cliff, with all that {{was said and done}} about this little business, which seemed simple enough, but which wasn't. There are people in this world who think that if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> you can buy {{anything}} you want, but such people might as well get ready to change their opinions if they ever expect to come into money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{instructions}} are quite elastic, as you heard," [...] said the lieutenant. [...] "I am merely ordered {{to keep you}} in Ostend, under my eye, until your case has been passed upon by the commandant or the general staff. Since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> you may enjoy every luxury save that of travel, and I ask you to command my services in all ways consistent with my duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right, once more. Well, dear me, just to {{see what}} would happen, I wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the <b>money.</b> And if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> it, what would you do with it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Johnny," [...] said he, [...] "do <b>you</b> think <b>you</b> <b>have</b> much <b>money</b> in your bank? <b>You</b> {{ought to}} <b>have</b> saved a {{considerable}} sum in nine years." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “They are not {{friends of}} mine, and I {{have a good}} deal to lose,” he said. “What I want to know is, if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>money</b> to spare would you buy the San Cristoval hacienda? There should be a profit in it at the price, but not if the patriots are likely to burn the sugar mill, or the {{administration}} to quarter troops there. You are responsible for this district!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that! You are free, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money,</b> {{you will}} travel {{about in the}} world and amuse yourself. In a week you will see more than stay-at-home people see in a year. How do we know what the future has in store for us? I have my own idea. She may be lost in the {{labyrinth}} of London, or she may be hundreds of thousands of miles away. Amuse yourself, Amelius--amuse yourself. Tomorrow or ten years hence, you might meet with her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} do that, Bill; {{but you might}} settle down in Rochester, and buy half a dozen barges, with a tip-top one you would sail {{yourself}}. You might {{have a couple of}} men and a cabin forward, and a nice roomy place for yourself and me aft; and you could just steer when you liked, or sit down and smoke your pipe and watch her going through the fleet as we worked through the swatchway. That would be more your sort, Bill, and mine too. I know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> enough laid by to get such a barge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So you see," [...] {{continued}} Mr. George, [...] "you {{would lose}} the interest on the money you pay for the chain every year; and besides that, you would lose {{a portion of the}} chain itself. When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>money</b> safely invested at interest, you have the interest every year, {{and at the end of}} the term you have your capital restored to you entire. But in such a purchase as this, you are sure, in the end, to sink a portion of it by wear, and tear, and depreciation; and this circumstance ought always to be taken into account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{certainly}} more than it's worth," [...] Mr. Waddington admitted, dolefully. [...] "However, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the <b>money</b> to throw away--two pounds, then." ...|$|R
