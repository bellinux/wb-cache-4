Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that."

This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> HMV and buy a copy on the high street".

500|$|Grand Theft Auto IV sees a {{shift in}} the series to a more {{realistic}} and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser said [...] "what we're taking as our watchword on [...] is the idea of what high definition actually means. Not just in terms of graphics, which obviously we are achieving, but in terms of all aspects of the design. [...] You know, trying to make something more realistic, more held together, but still retaining the overall coherence that the other games had." [...] Art director Aaron Garbut said {{one of the reasons they}} decided to set the game in New York because [...] "we all knew what an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city it is," [...] and since they were hoping the push the [...] "detail, variety and life" [...] to a high level, it seemed that [...] "basing the game in a city so synonymous with these things was a great fit." [...] Dan Houser added [...] "because we were working in high definition and we knew we'd need a shitload of research, we wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold." [...] The developers consciously avoided creating a block for block recreation of New York City; Dan Houser said [...] "what we've always tried to do is make a thing that looks real and has the qualities of a real environment, but is also fun from a game design perspective." [...] The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is far more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series. Although smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IVs predecessor , Liberty City is comparable to it in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>into,</b> and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. To achieve a realistic environment, the Rockstar North team, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, made two trips to New York for research, one at the start of the project (which was done with every previous Grand Theft Auto game) and another smaller one further into development. A full-time research team, based in New York, handled further requests for information ranging from the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood to videos of traffic patterns.|$|E

2500|$|San Andreas {{marked the}} {{technological}} pinnacle of the Grand Theft Auto III era (also {{known as the}} [...] "3D Universe") and also {{the end of that}} continuity (albeit for the handheld-focused Liberty City Stories and Vice City Stories spinoffs). Rockstar launched a new canon (the [...] "HD Universe") with Grand Theft Auto IV and Grand Theft Auto V for the seventh-generation consoles. The celebrity voice acting that had been so prominent in the [...] "3D Universe", especially in Vice City and San Andreas, was scaled back in the [...] "HD Universe". Rockstar also took a new direction in the series, focusing on realism and details instead of greater area and added content. For instance, although the exploreable sandbox area is smaller than San Andreas, the main setting for Grand Theft Auto IV is comparable to San Andreas in terms of scope when [...] "the level of verticality of the city, the number of buildings <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>go</b> <b>into,</b> and the level of detail in those buildings" [...] are taken into account. The goal for the HD Universe layout of Liberty City was to have no dead spots or irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts found in San Andreas state. Ars Technica wrote Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "slight regression of the series from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is surprising: there are fewer vehicles, weapons, and story missions, less character customisation, and even the size of the city itself is smaller".|$|E

Given the options of releasing the next chapter of a beloved game so that our fans can experience the story of Yakuza vs. not releasing it at all, we felt it was worth it to release it with 99% of the content intact.
