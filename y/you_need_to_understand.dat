500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that they can do that will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E
2500|$|The Dictionary was {{exported}} to America. [...] "The American {{adoption of the}} Dictionary was a momentous event not just in its history, but {{in the history of}} lexicography. For Americans {{in the second half of}} the eighteenth century, Johnson was the seminal authority on language, and the subsequent development of American lexicography was coloured by his fame." [...] For American lexicographers the Dictionary was impossible to ignore: [...] "America's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, argued fiercely over Johnson's legacy ... In 1789 [...] declared that 'Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be our standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.'" [...] "Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language. He defended Johnson's work, arguing that 'from the time of its publication, [...] has been, far more than any other, regarded as the standard for the language'." [...] Notwithstanding the evolution of lexicography in America, [...] "The Dictionary has also played its part in the law, especially in the United States. Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining 'first meanings', with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors' legislation ... Often it is a matter of historicizing language: to understand a law, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what its terminology meant to its original architects ... as long as the American Constitution remains intact, Johnson's Dictionary will have a role to play in American law." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand,</b> below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

All cultures make use of nonverbal communication but its meaning varies across cultures.

The relation of cross-cultural communication with deviance is that a sign may be offensive to one in one culture and mean something completely appropriate in another. This is an important field of study because as educators, business employees, or {{any other form of}} career that consists of communicating with ones from other cultures, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> non-verbal signs and their meanings, so you avoid offensive conversation or misleading conversation.

50|$|Degree summons {{were created}} {{specifically}} to restrain and interrogate a demon that {{is connected to}} a mortal. To perform a degree summons you need four things: The contract that was forged between fiend and mortal, the exact identity of the fiend, and lastly a means of controlling the fiend. The more powerful a fiend is, the higher the degree is needed to complete the summons. Summons range from 4th to 7th degree, 7th reserved for only the most dangerous fiends and royalty. If the summons is performed wrong, the fiend can be set free to turn on you. The actual summon requires chaining several incantations together using demon logic. Isaac explained {{that even if you}} know the name of the fiend, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the fiend's nature in order to form the right paths of logic. Almost always, Simon uses a fourth artifact, Solomon's Table, that was hidden away in a time pocket, to connect the paths. However, it is possible to perform a summons without the table by using Infernal Constellations or Coordinates. Simon used Coordinates while in the hospital to summon the fiend Haellock.|$|E
