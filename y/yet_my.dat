25|$|For myself, I am now in my 63rd year, <b>yet</b> <b>my</b> {{constitution}} is not seriously impaired, {{as you may}} conclude when I mention that I still am able to skate, to play at cricket occasionally with my sons, and that last year I rowed with them upon the Tay, a distance of eight miles, as stroke of a Four-oar? Nor when I think of others whom I knew {{as a young man}} at both Universities, can I remember any instance of injury being done to the health which could fairly be set down to the exercise of rowing as then practised. It is true we used to be told, even in those days, that no man in a Racing-Boat could expect to live to the age of thirty.|$|E
500|$|Ede Teller {{was born}} on January 15, 1908, in Budapest, Hungary (then part of Austria-Hungary), into a Jewish family. His parents were Ilona (born Deutsch), a pianist, and Max Teller, an attorney. He later became an agnostic. [...] "Religion {{was not an issue}} in my family", he later wrote, [...] "indeed, it was never discussed. My only {{religious}} training came because the Minta required that all students take classes in their respective religions. My family celebrated one holiday, the Day of Atonement, when we all fasted. <b>Yet</b> <b>my</b> father said prayers for his parents on Saturdays and on all the Jewish holidays. The idea of God that I absorbed was that it would be wonderful if He existed: We needed Him desperately but had not seen Him in many thousands of years." [...] Like Einstein and Feynman, Teller was a late talker. He developed the ability to speak later than most children but became very interested in numbers, and would calculate large numbers in his head for fun.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that <b>yet...</b> <b>My</b> problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

2500|$|The Protoevangelium was {{extremely}} popular, but it leaves {{open the possibility}} that Joseph might have had relations with Mary after the birth of Jesus ("she is not <b>yet</b> <b>my</b> wife..."). A few centuries later the developing doctrine that Mary was a virgin not only {{at the time of the}} conception and birth of Christ, but throughout her life, meant that this possibility had to be excluded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first to}} offer a {{solution}} was the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James, written about 150 AD. The original gospels never refer to Joseph's age, but the author presents him as an old man chosen by lot (i.e., by God) to watch over the Virgin. Jesus' brothers are presented as Joseph's children by an earlier marriage, and his years and righteousness explain why {{he has not yet}} had sex with his wife: [...] "I received her by lot as my wife, and she is not <b>yet</b> <b>my</b> wife, but she has conceived by the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couplet offers {{resistance}} to the reader. The reader wants something like [...] "I thought out love an everlasting day / And <b>yet</b> <b>my</b> trust thou didst, my love, betray." [...] These lines fit {{the spirit of the}} poem. Reading the sonnet with the couplet that Shakespeare wrote leaves the reader uncomfortable. Heather Dubrow claims the speaker is trying to fool himself; he accepts a one moral from the metaphor, that the friend's betrayal is justified by the sun, and neglects the moral the reader has been observing, the friend, like the sun, has been deceptive.|$|E

2500|$|While {{running for}} mayor in 1993, Coleman {{wrote in a}} letter to the City Convention Delegates: [...] "I have never sought any other {{political}} office. I have no other ambition other than to be mayor." [...] In the letter he said:I am a lifelong Democrat. Some accuse me of being the fiscal conservative in this race—I plead guilty! I'm not afraid to be tight with your tax dollars. <b>Yet,</b> <b>my</b> fiscal conservatism does not mean I am any less progressive in my Democratic ideals. From Bobby Kennedy to George McGovern to Warren Spannaus to Hubert Humphrey to Walter Mondale—my commitment to the great values of our party has remained solid.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2017, WWE {{commentator}} Mauro Ranallo took {{an absence}} from WWE, which Dave Meltzer reported had been triggered by hostilities with Layfield. The allegations {{coincided with the}} release of former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts' autobiography, in which he alleged that Layfield encouraged Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury to steal his passport. Angered WWE fans subsequently called on WWE to fire Layfield. On April 22, Newsweek reported that Ranallo and WWE [...] "mutually agreed to part ways", and Ranallo released a statement in which he said his departure had [...] "nothing to do with JBL". Layfield released a statement of his own, stating: [...] "Admittedly, I took part in locker room pranks that existed within the industry years ago. WWE addressed my behavior and I responded accordingly, <b>yet</b> <b>my</b> past is being brought up because of recent unfounded rumors. I apologize if anything I said playing ‘the bad guy’ on a TV show was misconstrued." ...|$|E
