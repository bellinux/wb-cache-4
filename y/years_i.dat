5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For <b>years</b> <b>I</b> was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

5|$|Over the <b>years</b> <b>I</b> {{have found}} that it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E

40|$|Intra-row weed {{emergence}} in row crops can {{be reduced}} {{by means of a}} biennial cultivation system that is based on an exhaustion of the weed seedbank in the upper soil layer of crop-free bands established in a preceding cereal crop, <b>year</b> <b>I,</b> prior to the row crop, year II. In this study, a series of field experiments is presented focussing more specifically on the influence of prevention of weed seed shedding and of different cultivation tactics in the system on intra-row weed emergence in the bands in year II. As the system excludes inverting soil tillage between <b>year</b> <b>I</b> and <b>year</b> II, the prevention of weed seed shedding in <b>year</b> <b>I</b> {{turned out to be a}} key factor for achieving the desired effect of the system. This was seen with spring barley grown in <b>year</b> <b>I</b> but not with winter wheat, where the system actually resulted in an increase of intra-row weed numbers in spite of the measures taken in <b>year</b> <b>I.</b> Cultivating the crop-free bands in spring barley in <b>year</b> <b>I</b> with conventional goose-foot shares in order to further enhance seed germination and mortality had no significant effects regardless of time and intensity. Results from two other experiments, where freshly shed weed seeds were incorporated into the soil, supported the finding that cultivating the bands was of no advantage...|$|R

In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two <b>years,</b> <b>I</b> refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
