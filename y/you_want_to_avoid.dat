40|$|How can {{human rights}} activists best reach audiences in a {{multichannel}} universe that is increasingly inundated with images of war, tragedy and suffering? Put in other terms, what are the representational challenges confronting activists {{in their attempts to}} effectuate concrete social change? For example, as an activist, <b>you</b> may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> represent as closely as possible the lived experience of repression, but <b>you</b> also <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> putting yourself and the community at further risk. An additional challenge is how <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> having your campaign lost in the sea of non-stop reality media. In her book Regarding the Pain of Others, Susan Sontag (2003) meditates on the meaning and the potential impact of photographs repre-senting war, violence, and suffering. Although she focuses on the issue of regard-ing, at a distance, the horrors of faraway violence, we argue that her essay is equally relevant to human rights workers attempting to develop representational strategies for communicating their local knowledge and experience of violations.

Without them we would judge a man simply by his work; but at present the newspapers are trying hard to induce the public to judge a sculptor, for instance, never by his statues but by the way he treats his wife; a painter by the amount of his income and a poet by the colour of his neck-tie. I said there should be a law, but there is really no necessity for a new law: nothing could be easier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head of the criminal classes.

40|$|Students {{are often}} {{confused}} by what constitutes plagiarism in academia and the seriousness {{with which the}} offense is treated. The objective of this essay is to explain the issue and provide examples to explain what is plagiarism. Plagiarism is the second {{worst thing you can}} do in academia (the worst thing is to fake your experiments). It is so bad of an offense that people who plagiarize are often fired and their careers are over. Authors who plagiarize in papers are often publicly denounced by their coauthors in public to save the coauthors ’ good names. PhD students who plagiarize are typically disowned by their advisors and thrown out of the program.

40|$|Abstract. Suppose {{you have}} to route agents through a network from a source node to a {{destination}} node in some optimal way; for instance by minimizing the total travel cost. Nothing new up to now – {{you could use a}} standard shortestpath algorithm. Suppose, however, that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> pure deterministic routing policies in order, for instance, to allow some exploration of the network, to avoid congestion, or to avoid complete predictability of your routing strategy. In other words, the routing policy is randomized. This problem, which will be called the randomized shortest-path problem, is introduced in this paper. The global degree of randomness of the routing policy will be quantified by the expected Shannon entropy spread into the network. Then, two models, allowing to compute the optimal policy under entropy constraints, are studied. One of these two models allows to compute this optimal policy by solving a simple, usually sparse, linear system of equations. 1...|$|E

Existing approaches {{try to avoid}} data redundancies by proposing compression techniques or succinct data structures. However, data re-dundancies in Linked Data are useful sometimes, e. g., ontology based data ac-cess can make use of A-Box redundancies to avoid unnecessary query rewritings. Either <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> it or make use of it, a good understanding about data re-dundancies will facilitate your task, e. g., identify the exact redundant parts which could be utilised or choose most effective techniques to compress a particular dataset. Unfortunately, little effort {{has been put on}} making the data redundancy explicit to data users. In this paper, we introduce a systematic categorisation for Linked Data redundancy, and propose a graph pattern based approach for efficient analysis. Analysis results on representative datasets lead to a main conclusion, that is redundant-aware techniques are demanded. ...|$|E
