50|$|The <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>elaenia</b> (Elaenia flavogaster) {{is a small}} bird of {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family. It breeds from {{southern}} Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula through Central and South America as far as northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|It makes a cup {{nest and}} lays two cream eggs with reddish blotches at the larger end. The female incubates for 16 days, with {{about the same}} period to fledging. Omnivorous mammals as small as the common {{marmoset}} (Callithrix jacchus) will eagerly plunder <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>elaenia</b> nests in the undergrowth—perhaps more often {{during the dry season}} when fruits are scarce—despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a common}} bird in semi-open woodland, scrub, gardens and cultivation. The <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>elaenia</b> is a noisy and {{conspicuous}} bird which feeds on berries and insects. The latter are usually caught from mid-air after the bird sallies from a perch, and sometimes picked up from plants. The species will also join mixed-species feeding flocks on occasion, typically staying quite some distance up in the trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} beardless tyrannulet is 10.2 cm long, weighs 7.5g {{and often}} resembles a tiny <b>yellow-bellied</b> <b>elaenia.</b> The head is dark brown or grey with an erectile crest and pale supercilium. The upperparts are grey-green becoming paler on the rump. The wings are brown with yellow feather-edging and two whitish, yellowish or cinnamon wing bars. The tail, which regularly is held cocked, is brown, the throat grey, the breast yellowish, and the abdomen yellow. The bill is black, {{but at least}} the base of the lower mandible is pale.|$|E
