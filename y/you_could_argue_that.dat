40|$|Lately, {{the concept}} of {{flexicurity}} has been enthusiastically discussed in the European Union. It has become commonplace to advocate flexicurity policy as the solution to all the economic problems of the EU countries. The European Commission has {{described it as a}} welfare state model with four components: flexible and reliable contractual arrangements, comprehensive lifelong learning strate-gies, effective active labour market policies and modern social security systems. However, although such policies may seem very desirable, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> the widespread use of such a vague concept as flexicurity is potentially dangerous. It is possible to identify at least four potential prob-lems: a tendency to mix up instruments and objectives, a tendency to pretend that all good things can be achieved simultaneously without the need to analyse difficult trade-offs, the view that social dialogue and consensus are always a desirable means to achieve a well functioning labour market, and the view that it is desirable to adopt common principles of flexicurity in the EU. The main danger is that the practice of trying to subsume a number of different policy approaches under the common heading of flexicurity leads to less clarity regarding the policy options available...|$|R
5000|$|Never Trust a Happy Song {{had some}} detractors. Huw Jones of Slant Magazine felt the album paled in {{comparison}} to the band's self-titled EP with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that [...] "Never Trust a Happy Songs finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore." [...] Writing for musicOMH, Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: [...] "On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove’s sound if they are to look forward." [...] Drowned in Sound's Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs. The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for Tiny Mix Tapes; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an [...] "indie equivalent" [...] to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that [...] "Considering what this record’s meant to be doing, then, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> reasonably <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> it does it pretty well.

5000|$|This view {{is closely}} {{connected}} to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments {{to support their}} own arguments.

However, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> this possibly leaves a libertarian based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters such as the Dust Bowl disaster.

It was estimated at the time that Westward would have a market value in the region of £400 million.|$|E

It's absolutely a vertical strategy - the company is like Apple after all - it's just that the product offering is far broader than anything even Gene Munster could imagine.

5000|$|Björk {{then set}} {{to make a}} record with a {{domestic}} mood featuring [...] "everyday moods and everyday noises translating into melodies and beats," [...] hence its working title Domestika. As she wanted to write her own songs in music boxes, Björk contacted a music box company, requesting see-through acrylic glass boxes because she wanted it to sound [...] "as hard as possible, like it was frozen." [...] She also began to use her laptop to write music, and decided to use instruments whose sound wouldn't be compromised when downloaded from sites such as Napster. Björk completed: [...] "I had loads and loads of beats for 'Hidden Place' but it still wasn't up enough. Matthew Herbert came for a visit {{in the studio and}} offered to do it. He ran away to his studio and came back after a few hours later with a DAT". She explains the song's title:'Hidden Place' is sort of about how two people can create a paradise just by uniting.

The recent crop of Sugababes singles all tripped over the same problem, attempting to find a way for the girls in the band to describe how sexy they are. We don't really need that bit explaining.

5000|$|Another {{philosophical}} approach {{often used}} when deciding land or farming issues is Libertarianism. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights {{including the right}} to acquire property. In a looser sense, Libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known Libertarian theorist is John Hospers. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the [...] "Tragedy of the Commons" [...] was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens. He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>argue</b> <b>that</b> Libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals.

Even excepting these critiques, the Libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the Dust Bowl disaster. Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers.|$|E
