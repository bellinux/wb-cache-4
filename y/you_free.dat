5|$|In his ancient-astronaut narrative, Icke {{argues that}} {{humanity}} has been genetically manipulated by the Babylonian Brotherhood, a hybrid race of human–extraterrestrial reptilians, {{also known as}} the Illuminati. He briefly introduced the extraterrestrial hypothesis in The Robot's Rebellion (1994), citing Bill Cooper's Behold a Pale Horse (1991), and expanded it in And the Truth Shall Set <b>You</b> <b>Free</b> (1995), citing Barbara Marciniak's Bringers of the Dawn (1992).|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} seven years—in The Robots' Rebellion (1994), And the Truth Shall Set <b>You</b> <b>Free</b> (1995), The Biggest Secret (1999), and Children of the Matrix (2001)—he {{developed}} his worldview of New Age conspiracism. His endorsement of the anti-Semitic forgery The Protocols of the Elders of Zion in The Robots' Rebellion, combined with Holocaust denial in And the Truth Shall Set <b>You</b> <b>Free,</b> led his publisher to refuse to publish his books, which were self-published thereafter. At {{the heart of his}} theories lies the idea that many prominent figures belong to the Babylonian Brotherhood, a group of shapeshifting reptilian humanoids who are propelling humanity toward a global fascist state, or New World Order. The reptilians use the rings of Saturn and the Moon, all reptilian constructs, to broadcast our [...] "five-sense prison": an [...] "artificial sense of self and the world" [...] that humans perceive as reality.|$|E

500|$|Ancient writers {{considered}} that Attic slaves enjoyed a [...] "peculiarly happy lot": Pseudo-Xenophon deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: [...] "as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, {{they take the}} greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, {{and they do not}} step aside to give <b>you</b> <b>free</b> passage". This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away {{at the end of the}} Peloponnesian War at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at Attica in Decelea. These were principally skilled artisans (kheirotekhnai), probably among the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by Antiphanes, The Runaway-catcher (...) , suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.|$|E
500|$|Icke's next manuscript, And the Truth Shall Set <b>You</b> <b>Free</b> (1995), {{contained}} a chapter questioning {{aspects of the}} Holocaust, which caused a rift with his publisher, Gateway. In addition to Holocaust denial, Icke claims {{in the book that}} Jews [...] "dominated the Versailles Peace Conference and created the circumstances which made the Second World War inevitable. They financed Hitler to power in 1933 and made the funds available for his rearmament." [...] After borrowing £15,000 from a friend, Icke set up Bridge of Love Publications, later called David Icke Books, and self-published that book and all his work thereafter. He wrote in 2004 that And the Truth was one of his proudest achievements.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi's views {{came under}} heavy {{criticism}} in Britain {{when it was}} under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, [...] "I {{would like you to}} lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give <b>you</b> <b>free</b> passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them." [...] George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' ...|$|E

500|$|The Edict of Tolerance in 1787 gave Protestants {{legal status}} and a {{congregation}} was formed under the pastorship of Paul-Henri Marron, {{who had been}} serving as the chaplain at the Dutch embassy. [...] The congregation gained permission to worship openly in 1789 during the revolution and met {{in a variety of}} places including a wine shop before gaining permission to rent Saint-Louis-du-Louve, the first building dedicated to Protestant worship in the history of Paris. [...] For the dedication of the new church, or temple as French Protestants referred to their buildings, Pastor Marron preached from the text, [...] "Soyez joyeux dans l’espérance, patients dans l’affliction, persévérants dans la prière," [...] (be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12)). [...] When the mayor, Jean Bailly, attended in person on 13 October 1791 Marron chose the passage, [...] "Vous connaissez la vérité et la vérité vous rendra libres," [...] (you will know the truth, and the truth will set <b>you</b> <b>free</b> (John 8:32)).|$|E
500|$|A {{few months}} after the {{publication}} of Newton's article, Lerone Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony, titled [...] "The Emancipation Orgasm: Sweetback in Wonderland," [...] in which he discussed the film's [...] "black aesthetic". Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that [...] "some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes." [...] Bennett concluded that the film is [...] "neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical, selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program, who acts out of panic and desperation." [...] Bennett described Sweetback's sexual initiation at ten years old as the [...] "rape of a child by a 40-year-old prostitute." [...] Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as [...] "emancipation orgasms" [...] and stated that [...] "it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom. And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 {{that they are going to}} be able to screw their way across the Red Sea. Fucking will not set <b>you</b> <b>free.</b> If fucking freed, black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|The Byrds' second album, Turn! Turn! Turn!, was {{released}} in December 1965 and while it received a mostly positive reception, critical consensus deemed it to be inferior to the band's debut. [...] Nonetheless, it was a commercial success, peaking at number 17 on the U.S. charts and number 11 in the UK. [...] Author Scott Schinder has noted that, along with Mr. Tambourine Man, the Turn! Turn! Turn! album served to establish the Byrds as one of rock music's most important creative forces, {{on a par with}} the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. [...] Like their debut, the album comprised a mixture of group originals, folk songs, and Bob Dylan covers, all characterized by the group's clear harmonies and McGuinn's distinctive guitar sound. [...] However, the album featured more of the band's own compositions than its predecessor, with Gene Clark in particular coming to the fore as a songwriter. [...] His songs from this period, including [...] "She Don't Care About Time", [...] "The World Turns All Around Her", and [...] "Set <b>You</b> <b>Free</b> This Time", are widely regarded by critics as among the best of the folk rock genre. [...] The latter song was even chosen for release as a single in January 1966, but its densely worded lyrics, melancholy melody, and ballad-like tempo contributed to it stalling at number 63 on the Billboard chart and failing to reach the UK chart altogether.|$|E

500|$|Vocalist David Draiman states that, lyrically, {{the album}} was {{inspired}} by various occurrences of bad luck that happened to him. [...] "I had a motorcycle accident, and I had my garage burn down with most of my vehicles," [...] Draiman commented. [...] "...I've had really bad relationships that I've {{been in and out}} of. They've left their mark", he concluded. The song [...] "Indestructible" [...] is [...] "an anthem for soldiers", Draiman comments. [...] "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong and that's what this whole body of work on this record does. It's music to help you feel strong," [...] he concludes. Cuts such as [...] "Deceiver" [...] and [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] are about [...] "really bad relationships". [...] "Inside the Fire" [...] is about [...] "standing over the body of my girlfriend, who just killed herself, and the Devil is standing over me, whispering in my ear to kill myself," [...] says Draiman. The song [...] "The Night" [...] is, [...] "just kind of meant to portray the night almost as like a living entity that sets <b>you</b> <b>free.</b> You're enveloped by it, enmasked by it," [...] Draiman comments. The band's vocalist also says the song [...] "Perfect Insanity" [...] is about [...] "toying with the idea of insanity. Coming at you from the perspective from the individual who is [...] and warning people around him, particularly his love interests, about his psychotic tendencies." [...] Draiman says the track [...] "Divide" [...] "is meant to detract from the idea 'oh, let's all be one, let's all be united!' Fuck that, be yourself, be an individual, stand out, make your mark, make an impact." [...] Commenting on the meaning of the song [...] "Façade", Draiman says it is, [...] "...a song {{from the perspective of a}} girl in a relationship where she's abused... she's thinking about killing him, like you see on the news." ...|$|E

2500|$|Community Chapel {{originated}} {{in a home}} Bible study led by Barnett. According to her book The Truth Shall Set <b>You</b> <b>Free,</b> Barnett’s wife Barbara worked {{as a representative of}} Burien Welcome Wagon, a committee for welcoming new members to the community, in the 1960s. In the course of this work, she met Keith and Joanne Gunn, recent arrivals from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and, though they were Lutheran, Mrs. Barnett invited them to a Pentecostal meeting at the church she and her husband attended. [...] Keith Gunn became interested in the Pentecostal experience of being [...] "filled with the Holy Spirit," [...] and invited Mr. Barnett, who had two years of education at a Pentecostal Bible college in Boise, Idaho, to start a Bible study in the Gunn's home for others similarly interested. [...] This Bible study grew and was soon incorporated as the church of Community Chapel.|$|E
