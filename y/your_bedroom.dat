25|$|Justice Scalia says that, {{generally}} speaking, {{the legislature}} {{has the power}} to make laws and the judiciary should only interpret the laws that are made or are explicitly in the Constitution. That is not Justice Brown's philosophy. It is simply intellectually dishonest and logically incoherent to suggest that somehow the Constitution recognizes an unlimited right {{to do what you want}} with your private property and yet does not recognize a right to privacy that would forbid the Government from intruding in <b>your</b> <b>bedroom.</b> Yet that seems to be the manner in which Justice Brown would interpret our most cherished document.|$|E
500|$|Curiosity {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from contemporary critics. Bill Lamb of About.com began his review stating {{that it is}} always interesting to have new artists making music both familiar and fresh. He went to describe the six [...] "electronic pop songs strong, almost too short to be satisfying but immensely repeatable." [...] Lamb also added that Jepsen's [...] "style is summery and bright without the emotional bogging down of [...] Lovato or the flat out drudgery of Jessie J" [...] Allmusic critic Jon O'Brien stated that, when compared to Jepsen's previous effort Tug of War (2008), the EP [...] "unexpectedly abandons her previous singer/songwriter approach {{in favor of an}} unashamed bubblegum sound which harks back to the early 2000s pop princess glory days of Britney, Christina, Jessica, and Mandy." [...] Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada described the musical style of the album as [...] "pop. But not in the annoying, auto-tune, and talentless way. Her perfectly pitched voice makes it clear that this girl has real talent." [...] Eadie summarized her review saying that Curiosity [...] "is filled with music that dances. And it is your choice to listen to it with or without a hairbrush (a.k.a. microphone) in front of <b>your</b> <b>bedroom</b> mirror. Overall a great EP. I can’t wait to put the top down and blast her tunes all summer." [...] Jen Appel of idobi Radio commented that, overall, Curiosity is the kind of extended play that brings attention from the teenage public due to its mainstream songs, and added, [...] "if you are looking for fun, lovable songs to make you smile, this is your go-to mix." [...] Appel only criticized the lyrical content, noting that it is [...] "very childish but seem to work with the music nonetheless." ...|$|E

50|$|There are two weigh-ins. The first weigh-in is {{when you}} weigh all your clutter from <b>your</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> It usually gets {{compared}} to an animal such as a panda or a jaguar. The final weigh-in {{is when you}} put your love it piles on the scales which tells you who has won.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "my {{daughter}} {{is in trouble}} about her baby, and wants my advice. Teething, and convulsions, {{and that sort of}} thing. As you are all going out for the evening, you don't want me, after I have put <b>your</b> <b>bedrooms</b> tidy. I can go to my daughter for an hour or two, I suppose--and Joseph (who isn't of much use, heaven knows) can take care of the house." ...|$|R

6000|$|DORA. But {{the love}} of sister for sister can never be old-fashioned. I have been unwilling to trouble you with questions, but you seem {{somewhat}} better to-day. We found a letter in <b>your</b> <b>bedroom</b> torn into bits. I couldn't make it out. What was it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, now, Scatcherd, you ain't; you're {{bad enough}} {{if you only}} knew it. And as for Winterbones, he has no {{business}} here up in <b>your</b> <b>bedroom,</b> which stinks of gin so, it does. Don't you believe him, doctor; he ain't well, nor yet nigh well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is clear enough. You came back by an {{unexpected}} way, and so he had no warning until {{you were at the}} very door. What could he do? He caught up everything which would betray him, and he rushed into <b>your</b> <b>bedroom</b> to conceal himself." ...|$|E
60|$|LINA. Old pal: {{this is a}} stuffy house. You seem {{to think}} of nothing but making love. All the {{conversation}} here is about love-making. All the pictures are about love-making. The eyes of {{all of you are}} sheep's eyes. You are steeped in it, soaked in it: the very texts on the walls of <b>your</b> <b>bedrooms</b> are the ones about love. It is disgusting. It is not healthy. Your women are kept idle and dressed up for no other purpose than to be made love to. I have not been here an hour; and already everybody makes love to me as if because I am a woman it were my profession to be made love to. First you, old pal. I forgave you because you were nice about your wife.|$|R

When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and happily {{together}} with our books and our music! You will find Margaret so improved {{when you come back}} again! I have a little plan of alteration for <b>your</b> <b>bedrooms</b> too, which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you SHOULD go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s {{all right}} for gentlemen like you," [...] he said civilly. [...] "But a man. like me can’t call his soul ’is own—or even ’is bedroom. Everybody takes {{advantage}} of ’im.

6000|$|... "However," [...] said Mr. Conant to Irene, [...] "I shall {{reserve the}} {{privilege}} of smoking my evening pipe in this den, for here is a student lamp, a low table and the easiest chairs in all the place.

6000|$|... "Yes. Unfortunately, {{just after}} father's death {{it was put}} {{in the hands of}} a local {{architect}} or builder, one of father's old friends, but not a very skillful workman, who made changes while the family were away. That's why <b>your</b> present <b>bedroom,</b> which was father's old study, had a slice taken off it to make the corridor larger, and why the big chimney and hearthstone are still there, although the fireplace is modernized. That was Flint's stupidity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now you {{had better}} go and lie down, and get a sleep {{for two or three}} hours," [...] the countess said, decidedly. [...] "You will have <b>your</b> old <b>bedroom,</b> and we have fitted up the next room as a sitting room.

60|$|You {{are afraid}} to poke your nose into any {{room in the house}} now; so, after walking {{up and down the stairs}} for a while, you go and sit in <b>your</b> own <b>bedroom.</b> This becomes uninteresting, however, after a time, and so you put on your hat and stroll out into the garden.
