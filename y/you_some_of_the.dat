500|$|Waugh's {{dissipated}} lifestyle {{continued into}} his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that {{year to a}} Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: [...] "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things that have happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations {{in the summer of}} 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921â€“22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E

6000|$|This {{unexpected}} caress {{brought the}} tears to the proud girl's eyes. [...] "Thank <b>you,</b> Nora. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience {{will agree with}} you, I hope." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pathfinder {{will remain}} near you, girl, {{and no doubt}} he will tell <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditions {{of this part of}} the world, or some of his own {{experiences}} with the Mingos." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will bring}} <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red that I color my roses and tulips with," [...] cried the Red Ryl; [...] "and {{then you can}} make the cat's lips and tongue red." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope," [...] he said earnestly, [...] "that {{you will}} give me the {{opportunity}} of looking after <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. I am quite alone, too, and I know no one on board." ...|$|E
60|$|VENABLES. I assure <b>you,</b> Comtesse, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neat {{things in}} his speeches convulse the house. A word has even been coined for them-- Shandisms.|$|R

60|$|I milked two cows this morning, {{and would}} send <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> milk, {{only that it}} is mingled with that which was drawn forth by Mr. Dismal View {{and the rest of}} the brethren.|$|E
6000|$|Send me a line {{whenever}} any {{one comes}} in from F. R., and inclose Mercedes's letter in yours. Take care of her, Dick, and may the future hold {{in store for}} <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sweetness I know now! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{out into}} the garden with me," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll give <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most delicious {{caramels}} you ever ate. They're a new variety, {{that no one can}} grow but me, and they have a heliotrope flavor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] exclaims Patty, [...] "what {{a dinner}} {{we shall have}} in the prodigal's honour! I shall make <b>you</b> all <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Naples biscuit Mrs. Brice told me of." ...|$|R

60|$|My mind is disturbed, {{and my body}} {{harassed by}} many labours; yet I cannot suffer you to depart, without endeavouring to express to <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{unbroken}} and higher feelings of my spirit, which have you at once for their cause and object.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{something}} to say, too," [...] she said resolutely. [...] "You have spoken for yourselves. I speak {{for the people of}} White Sands. There is a man in this settlement whom everybody loves. I shall tell <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> things he has done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{any more}} strange things in your bundle?" [...] asked the Eskimo, whose curiosity was awakened by what had already been {{extracted}} from it. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tee, or the fire-water, or any more of the thing that smokes--what you call it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I {{certainly}} hope you win, Jack," [...] said the girl, {{giving him a}} warm glance. [...] "I {{would like to see}} <b>you</b> take <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conceit out <b>of</b> Tommy Flanders." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We are, nevertheless," [...] Bransome declared, [...] "justified in {{pointing}} out to <b>you</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantages {{which you have}} gained from your alliance with us.

6000|$|... "We {{have yet}} a little while," [...] he said, [...] "before that happens which I have decreed.

6000|$|Nasmyth {{appeared}} to reflect. [...] "Well," [...] he answered, [...] "I suppose I {{was a little}} careless--in fact, I must have been. <b>You</b> see, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building gang had left their axes in the dynamo-room." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't {{shake your}} head like that," [...] she enjoined, {{with a little}} grimace. [...] "People will think I am trying to borrow money from you and that you are refusing me!
