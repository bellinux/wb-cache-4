Early in her career, when she was closely associated with her first husband Kenneth Branagh, she was somewhat unpopular and considered a [...] "". The public warmed to her after the separation, and she became one of the key actresses of the 1990s. Her status has continued to grow; in 2008, journalist Sarah Sands stated that Thompson has improved with age and experience, and Mark Kermode said of her performances, [...] "There is something about her which is— you just trust her. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> 'I'm in proper hands here.' ... She's up there with the great, I mean really great, British female performers".|$|E
2500|$|After {{signing with}} the CBA's Shanghai Sharks, Fredette {{has become a}} {{dominant}} player in the Chinese Basketball League, leading his team to the playoffs last season. He has also acquired the fan nickname [...] "Jimo Dashen," [...] which translates to [...] "The Lonely Master" [...] or [...] "The Lonely God" [...] in Chinese. Fredette commented on this during an interview: “It’s not necessarily the same sense that you think about being lonely. In America, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> you are by yourself and depressed and that type of stuff. But in this way, it more means that you're on top, and nobody is around you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Sargent (a {{close friend}} and {{photographer}} of the band) described their relationship as like [...] "first love, and all the jealousy and obsessiveness that comes with that" [...] - adding [...] "I think there's, y'know, obsession and jealousy on both of their sides. They bitch about each other to each other or to other people. They have a bond, intellectually and spiritually, like nothing I've ever seen ... but sometimes, you know, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>think,</b> God, why don't you just get a room?!" [...] In the same interview, a Radio One documentary, upon being asked just how close their relationship was, Doherty responded [...] "I love him. Wouldn't go, um - certainly not on Radio 1 - go into too much detail, but... we had lots of wonderful times together, yeah." [...] Barât, when questioned similarly, steadfastly denied that the relationship had involved anything [...] "physical". Barât has insisted that [...] "people are really into conjecture" [...] and has frequently denied having {{a sexual relationship with}} Doherty. However, in a 2011 interview when asked if the two had ever had a physical relationship he replied [...] "There have been moments in our relationship where physicality has ensued." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{trouble with}} you, Anne, is that you're {{thinking}} {{too much about}} yourself. <b>You</b> should <b>just</b> <b>think</b> of Mrs. Allan {{and what would be}} nicest and most agreeable to her," [...] said Marilla, hitting for once in her life on a very sound and pithy piece of advice. Anne instantly realized this.|$|R

2500|$|Commenting to Digital Spy {{about her}} return, Lawrence said: [...] "I've {{not been in}} the show for 11 years and it's not like I've ever thought [...] "I'll never go back", <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> that your chance to go back has gone. It never crossed my mind that the {{occasion}} would ever arise, so when I got the phone call, it was really odd. There was never any doubt that I'd do it for Mike [...] and it's not something that's really been done — I don't think someone's ever died off-screen and then they've done the funeral on-screen. I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again. There was some trepidation about how it was going to work. But as soon as we arrived, it was like 11 years of your life had been wiped out and you'd been there the day before [...] I had this really lovely scene with Sid [...] where I said: [...] "Isn't it strange, you imagine you’d come back and everything would be here waiting for us just like it was." [...] Diane's saying everything's moved on, but for me it was the opposite, I'd got back there and everything was the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. I pretty much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E

Did you intend to remain single, I cannot say how far your peculiar notions might enable you to prevail; but as you mean to marry, she, too, will have rights. I {{put it to you}} whether it would be honest on your part to ask her to abandon the rank which she will be entitled to expect from <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of it, Mr. Roden.

6000|$|... "Well, I don't {{see what}} there is to laugh at so much. When you ask me a thing I tell <b>you</b> <b>just</b> what I <b>think,</b> {{and it seems to}} set you off in a perfect gale. Don't you expect people to say what they think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Cousin Florence," [...] said Edward, [...] "you are {{a girl of}} {{moderately}} good sense, {{with all}} your nonsense. Now don't you (I know <b>you</b> do) <b>think</b> <b>just</b> so too?" ...|$|R

"Angela," [...] he said, {{changing}} his tone {{to one of}} hoarse earnestness, [...] "don't {{look at me like}} that, because, even if you are a bit put out at the trick I have played <b>you,</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> it was because I loved you so much, Angela. I couldn't help it, I couldn't really. It is not every man who would go through all that I have gone through for you; it is no joke to sham consumption for three months, I can tell you; but we will have many a laugh over that. Why don't you answer me, instead of standing there just like the Andromeda in my study?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Think of that!" [...] he concluded. [...] "That's the Amazon {{river in}} flood time in South America. And the world's full of places like that--everywhere, most likely, except Oakland. Oakland's {{just a place}} to start from, I guess. Now that's adventure, I want to tell <b>you.</b> <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> of the luck of them boys! All the same, some day I'm {{going to go over}} the Andes to the {{headwaters}} of the Amazon, all through the rubber country, an' canoe down the Amazon thousands of miles to its mouth where it's that wide you can't see one bank from the other an' where you can scoop up perfectly fresh water out of the ocean a hundred miles from land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's {{the same}} thing, smarty. No news, no pay. Hallo!" [...] he continued, his eyes {{suddenly}} riveted on the paper. Then, after {{the fashion of}} ordinary humanity, he stopped short and read the interesting item to himself. When he had finished he brought his fist and the paper, together, violently down upon the table. [...] "Now look at this! Talk of luck, will <b>you?</b> <b>Just</b> <b>think</b> of it. Here are WE--hard-working men with lots of sabe, too--grubbin' away on this hillside like niggers, glad to get enough {{at the end of}} the day to pay for our soggy biscuits and horse-bean coffee, and just look what falls into the lap of some lazy sneakin' greenhorn who never did a stoke of work in his life! Here are WE, with no foolishness, no airs nor graces, and yet men who would do credit to twice that amount of luck--and seem born to it, too--and we're set aside for some long, lank, pen-wiping scrub who just knows enough to sit down on his office stool and hold on to a bit of paper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, pshaw, now, mate, you think!" [...] pleaded the other. [...] "I'll {{take any}} sort of a job; I don't care what it is. I ain't got any o' that false modesty about me.

That's what the {{chaplain}} said just afore I left the--ship, 'n' I promised him I'd give work a try, anyway. Now <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>think</b> up something! I ain't in any hurry." [...] In proof he threw his soft hat on the desk, and took up one of the menus. [...] "This your bill of fare? Well, it ain't bad! Vurmiselly soup, boiled holibut, roast beef, roast turkey with cranberry sauce, roast pork with apple sauce, chicken corquettes, ditto patties, three kinds of pie; bread puddin', both kinds of sauce; ice cream, nuts, and coffee. Why, mate!" ...|$|E

First of all, you will die sooner than there is any {{occasion}} for; then Bella will pine, mope, get into bad health, and gradually fade away. That will break down my mother, whose susceptible spirit could not withstand the shock. Of course, after that my own health would give way, and the hopes of a dear little--well, that is to say, ruination and widespread misery would be the result of your unnatural and useless obstinacy." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>You</b> <b>just</b> have to <b>think</b> {{about the}} pyramids which are {{basically}} big tombs, {{and all the}} treasures that were entombed in the pyramids {{to get an idea}} of social hierarchy.

Not once have I {{said a word about}} love to you, and me loving you all the time. That's going some for a man that's used to having his own way. I'm {{somewhat}} of a rusher when it comes to travelling. I reckon I'd rush God Almighty if it came to a race over the ice. And yet I didn't rush you. I guess this fact is an indication of how much I do love you. Of course I want you to marry me. Have I said a word about it, though? Nary a chirp, nary a flutter. I've been quiet and good, though it's almost made me sick at times, this keeping quiet. I haven't asked you to marry me. I'm not asking you now. Oh, not but what you satisfy me. I sure know you're the wife for me. But how about myself? Do you know me well enough know your own mind?" [...] He shrugged his shoulders. [...] "I don't know, and I ain't going to take chances on it now. You've got to know for sure whether you think you could get along with me or not, and I'm playing a slow conservative game. I ain't a-going to lose for overlooking my hand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Kennedy, {{there are}} two things which I {{understand}} that you are very fond of. The one is adventure, and the other is an obstacle to surmount. The adventure must be the finding of your way out of this catacomb. The obstacle will be the darkness and the two thousand wrong turns which make the way a little difficult to find.
