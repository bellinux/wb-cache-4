500|$|According to Seymour's son Douglas, {{his father}} had been toying with the basic idea of drawing {{attention}} to the growing national debt since at least 1980, when during the holiday season he sent cards that said [...] "Happy New Year. <b>Your</b> <b>share</b> of the national debt is $35,000" [...] to senators and congressmen. In the early 1980s, when Seymour first developed the idea of a constantly updated clock, the technology required to implement the project was not yet available. Back then, the debt was quickly approaching $1 trillion.|$|E
500|$|The {{new republican}} {{government}} was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman. The Prime Minister was Mohsin al-Aini. Noman, however, remained in Beirut. He was doubtful {{of his colleagues}} reluctance {{to negotiate with the}} Hamidaddin family, preferring to expel it instead. On November 23, he resigned, and his place was taken by Hassan Amri. Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country's chiefs [...] "We have money, and you will have <b>your</b> <b>share</b> if you join us. If not, we will go on without you". The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes. 6,000 royalist regulars and 50,000 armed tribesmen known as [...] "the Fighting Rifles" [...] surrounded San'a, captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida, a main route for Russian supplies. In a battle twelve miles east of the capital, 3,200 soldiers of both sides were killed, and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists. Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum: [...] "Surrender the city or be annihilated". Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called [...] "a medical checkup". Foreign Minister Hassan Makki also left Yemen, leaving the government in charge of Amri. Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units [...] "to defend the republic". In Liberation Square, six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad, and their bodies were later strung up on poles.|$|E
2500|$|When Enid {{participated in}} the City Beautiful {{movement}} in the 1920s, Frank Iddings wrote the city song, [...] "Enid, The City Beautiful". [...] "You're {{right in the center}} where the best wheat grows and you've got <b>your</b> <b>share</b> of the oil that flows," [...] his lyrics read. These were the early staples of the Enid economy. Enid's economy saw oil booms and agricultural growth {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. The Great Depression, however, caused both of these staples to lose value, and many businesses in Enid closed. However, Enid recovered, prospering and growing in population until a second wave of bad economic times hit in the 1980s, when competition with the local mall and economic factors led Enid's downtown area to suffer. Since 1994, Enid's Main Street program has worked to refurbish historic buildings, boost the local economy, and initiate local events such as first Friday concerts and holiday celebrations on the town square.|$|E
