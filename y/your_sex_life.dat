Ten articles reviewed for quality and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. The analysis resulted in six categories that describe how the role of partner change after diagnosis, that the intimate relationship in many cases disappears, the men often feel a diminished masculinity but also that couples feel a dissatisfaction with the communication with the nursing staff. The results show that most men who have undergone treatment highlights the lack of information from health care, this is also confirmed by the women. For men with prostate cancer and their partners should dare to talk about sexuality, it is important that nurses raise the subject and makes the discussion more accessible.

The mental health of over-committed nursing staff was not affected. Higher reward for effort was positively correlated with <b>sex</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction. Conclusions No matter whether job stress was high or low, receiving a higher reward for effort led to better <b>sex</b> <b>life</b> satisfaction, which had a satisfying positive effect on the nurses' lives. To improve nursing care quality at the hospital, nursing administrators should assist nurses in confronting work stress via positive adjustment, which is associated with the nurses’ sexual harmony, and quality of life. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sex is an {{important}} part of life for many people, therefore dealing with erectile problems, living with the effects of physical injury, changes in your appearance or side-effects of treatment can have an enormous impact on <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> <b>life</b> and relationships. Normal sexual behaviour and erectile function depends on a complex interaction between various body-systems, including the brain, nerves, blood-supply and hormones. All of these systems (alone or in combination) may be affected following multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). For men, trauma may result in problems with achieving or maintaining erections (commonly referred to as erectile dysfunction; ED), problems with ejaculation, or how they think/feel about sex - all of these problems may have an indirect, if not profound impact on long-term functional recovery and overall quality of life. Following multiple trauma, spinal injury, or TBI, it is not unusual for some men to go through a period of reduced sexual drive (reduced libido). Apart from physical effects of injury, the way the body responds sexually also depends on thoughts and feelings – thoughts and feelings about yourself and others may be influenced by changes in mood, motivation, personality and thought-processes. This may be complicated by depression, emotional trauma following the injury, medication, or changes in hormone levels. As some men grapple with the changes and implications associated with their injury, many may initially ignore the importance of sexual difficulties, as they remain focused on physical rehabilitation and recovery of mobility. Other men may be reluctant to acknowledge sexual difficulties, due to cultural or personal reasons. There are a wide range of treatments and interventions that may be helpful for the man and his partner, which is why assessment of sexual function should be routinely incorporated into rehabilitation and follow-up services for trauma-survivors. The information below describes common sexual problems after TBI, SCI or multiple trauma and ways to improve sexual functioning...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Este estudo retrospectivo foi conduzido com uma amostra de conveniência de 25 mulheres portadoras de agenesia vaginal em seguimento no Ambulatório de Ginecologia Infanto Puberal. Quinze mulheres foram submetidas à cirúrgica modificada de McIndoe-Bannister Grupo Cirúrgico e 10 fora tratadas com a técnica de Frank Grupo Frank. Para a análise comparativa entre essas duas amostras, foram considerados os seguintes parâmentros: vaginometria final, efeitos adversos e satisfação sexual após o tratamento. Esses dados foram obtidos por meio dos registros nos prontuários médicos. A satisfação sexual foi aferida por questão simples: como está sua vida sexual? RESULTADOS: Houve diferença em relação ao comprimento da vagina tanto naquelas submetidas à técnica de Frank (comprimento inicial 2, 4 ± 2, 0 cm, após o tratamento 6, 9 ± 1, 1 cm, p PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the results of neovaginoplasty by a modified McIndoe-Bannister technique and by the non-surgical Frank technique. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted on {{a convenience sample of}} 25 women with vaginal agenesis undergoing surgical or conservative treatment at an Infant-Pubertal Gynecology Outpatient Clinic. Data were obtained from the medical records. Fifteen women underwent the surgical McIndoe-Bannister modified technique Surgical Group, and 10 women underwent the non-surgical Frank technique Frank Group. The following parameters were considered for comparative analysis between the two samples: vaginometry, surgical and non-surgical complications, and sexual satisfaction after treatment. Sexual satisfaction was assessed by a simple question: How is <b>your</b> <b>sex</b> <b>life?</b> RESULTS: There were differences related to vaginal length before and after performing exercises in both Frank Group (initial vaginal length 2. 4 ± 2. 0 cm versus 6. 9 ± 1. 1 cm after treatment, p< 0. 0001) and Surgical Group (initial vaginal length 0. 9 ± 1. 4 cm versus 8. 0 ± 0. 8 cm after treatment, p< 0. 0001). Increased vaginal length was observed in Surgical Group compared to Frank Group (Frank Group= 7. 0 ± 0. 9 cm versus Surgical Group= 8. 0 ± 0. 8 cm, p= 0. 0005). Forty percent of Surgical Group women had surgical complications versus no complications with the Frank technique. All women reported to be satisfied with their sexual life. CONCLUSION: The present data indicate that both the surgical and Frank techniques are effective for the treatment of vaginal agenesis, resulting in the construction of a vagina that pewrmits sexual intercourse and sexual satisfaction. The favorable aspects of the Frank technique are related to its low cost and to the low rates of major complications...|$|E
