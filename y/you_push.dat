If we didn't have it, we'd be doing crazy things and getting in sticky situations.” –Stephanie Gilmore.|$|E

500|$|Greg Sandow, from Entertainment Weekly, {{called it}} a [...] "delightful {{challenge}} to censorship". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine {{felt it was a}} [...] "cheeky" [...] song, also writing that it touched on themes Madonna would go on to explore more explicitly later in the 1990s. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a [...] "big-band blues [...] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] as [...] "naughty", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that [...] "one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when <b>you</b> <b>push</b> her back in time. 'Hanky Panky' {{is one of the few}} pop tunes to explore the erotic entertainment value in a good spanking." [...] Writing for The Pittsburgh Press, Peter B. King believed that the subject matter of [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] would surely receive [...] "flank", but defended Madonna saying that she had been singing about such topics for years by then.|$|E

40|$|Once upon a time, {{there were}} two large black boxes, A and B, {{connected}} by a long insulated copper wire. On box A {{there were two}} buttons, marked *a * and *b*, and on box B there were three lights, red, green, and amber. Scientists studying {{the behavior of the}} boxes had observed that whenever <b>you</b> <b>pushed</b> the *a * button on box A, the red light flashed briefly on box B, and whenever <b>you</b> <b>pushed</b> the *b * button on box A, the green light flashed briefly. The amber light never seemed to flash. They performed a few billion trials, under a very wide variety of conditions, and found no exceptions. There seemed to them to be a causal regularity...|$|R

2500|$|Singer turned {{producer}} Mario Winans, {{wrote and}} produced a song for the album called [...] "Wish Your Love Away" [...] where Norwood sings with angst for her lover [...] "who played her like a fool". Centred around a melody of [...] "serrated drums" [...] and a [...] "piping" [...] pan flute Norwood singles [...] "Remember that {{you told me you}} were with it, and all them other bitches you could do without." [...] "Do You Know What You Have?", helmed by Mike WiLL Made It, switches direction, with Norwood firing back at her love. In the lyrics she [...] "cuts down her man for failing to return her affections." [...] The subject content changes slightly on the Bangladesh-helmed [...] "So Sick", another record which was written by Garrett. On the song, Norwood addresses a lover who pushes her too far and [...] "violating her trust", it includes the lyrics [...] "How far do you think I'll let <b>you</b> <b>push</b> me before I cross the line?".|$|E
2500|$|Sarah Grant of Consequence of Sound {{stated that}} [...] "there is plenty to enjoy as <b>you</b> <b>push</b> and shove right to {{end of the}} album", and noted that [...] "Push proves that country is another {{possibility}} for the band that's never cowered from a genre risk". Theon Weber of Spin concluded, [...] "This isn't a great album, {{but it is a}} good one, in a year quietly blessed with a small crop of good records (Metric, Gossip) with dreamy synths and girls up front. It's also—in its confidence, its playfulness, and the slightly stoned degree to which it is relaxed—No Doubt's most accomplished party." [...] Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote, [...] "By and large, the more interesting tracks are stacked on the front end of Push and Shove, and the songs on {{the second half of the}} album are comparably safer, blurring together upon first listen." [...] Ryan Reed of Paste claimed that [...] "No Doubt has always been more than a platform for a gifted frontwoman, a fact Push and Shove seems to forget at times, downplaying the band's fluid chemistry in favor of soaring hooks and 'cranked to 11' dynamics", adding that the album is [...] "still a welcome return, even if it's a tad exhausting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when <b>you</b> <b>push</b> or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
