[...] Martin also argued that his driving did not cause the final caution: [...] " [...] Once you got the lead, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure you don't drive it in there and turn it sideways (and) slide it up the racetrack.

MS Dhoni was named Man of the Match for his powerful and match-winning batting display under pressure.

These soft skills included communication, presenting and speaking, team building and so on. Yet the continuing problem with this approach has been that despite lots of training, many people never actually improved their ability to communicate, get on with others, make good speeches or build teams. Public relations professionals around the world must find the “flat world” message very encouraging. This message is telling corporations that in a flat world, the biggest differentiator is your people. How do people effectively differentiate? We differentiate ourselves by becoming better communicators. PR campaign skills can come to the forefront as organisations seek to thrive in this new world using a strategic planning approach...|$|R
