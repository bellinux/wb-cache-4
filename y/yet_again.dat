5|$|The {{definition}} of the two sets is thus a historic one. Out of pure coincidence, the phoneme inventory of present-day colloquial Sinhala is such that <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> the śuddha alphabet suffices as a good representation of the sounds.|$|E
5|$|By the 2004 DVD, Jabba's {{appearance}} was modified <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> {{to match his}} appearance in Episode I. When Han steps on Jabba's tail, Jabba reacts more strongly, winding up as if to punch him. Also, {{in order to make}} Jabba look more convincing, shadows of Han can be seen on his body.|$|E

However, he succumbed <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> to world No. 2 Novak Djokovic in straight sets.|$|E
5|$|Felix Magath {{took over}} and led Bayern to two {{consecutive}} doubles. Prior {{to the start of}} the 2005–06 season, Bayern moved from the Olympiastadion to the new Allianz Arena, which the club shares with 1860 Munich. On the field, their performance in 2006–07 was erratic.

5|$|Gröning {{claims that}} this {{disrupted}} the relative tranquility his job gave {{him and he}} claims he <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> complained to his superior.

He has declared that he manipulated his life at Auschwitz so as to avoid witnessing the camp's most unpalatable aspects.|$|E

5|$|In 729, after a mixed {{performance}} {{against the}} Khazars, Maslamah was replaced <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> {{as governor of}} Armenia and Adharbayjan by al-Jarrah. For all his energy, Maslamah's campaigning failed to produce the desired results: {{by the time of}} his dismissal, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and been thrust once more into the defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{entered the}} fray <b>yet</b> <b>again</b> with this mobile guard. He feared a general {{attack on a}} broad front which he wouldn't be able to repulse and as a {{precaution}} ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings respectively to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army.|$|E

5|$|Pompey's death {{did not end}} {{the civil}} war, as Caesar's many enemies fought on.

Further restoration was undertaken in 1975.|$|E
60|$|Su-Su smiled, and {{her eyes}} were <b>yet</b> softer. <b>Again</b> she felt the soft hands at her throat. He was good to look upon, and the belt was indeed small, made for a smaller man; but what did it matter? She could make many belts.|$|R

When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

When she looks for Sonic (to save him again), she finds Shadow the Hedgehog after mistaking him for Sonic. Eggman attacks her with his mecha and Tails defends her; she then spends much of the remaining game searching for Chaos Emeralds with Tails and Knuckles. At the game's climax, Amy pleads with Shadow to help her and the other characters neutralize a catastrophic energy buildup at the space colony ARK. She reminds him of Maria Robotnik, his friend on the ARK before her death, and he agrees to help.|$|E
