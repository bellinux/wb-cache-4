First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then {{made available for}} download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me.

If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E

2500|$|Some speakers, {{especially}} those in frequent contact with the English language have created a grammatical calque of the English you-impersonal. The English impersonal utilizes the second person pronoun you, e.g. You can't live if you don't eat. Here, the word you does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as Syömättä ei elä, where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as passiivi) is used. When translated word-by-word, Sä et elä jos sä et syö, it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction sä of spoken language is used instead of the sinä of spoken language. Then, <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> {{understand that it is}} an Anglicism, or you can be offended by the commanding [...] "You there!" [...] tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.) ...|$|E

[...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
