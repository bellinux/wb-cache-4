5|$|All-weather {{lifeboats}} (ALBs) {{are large}} boats with enclosed wheelhouses and survivor spaces below deck, which are self-righting and {{can go out}} in all weather conditions. Some ALBs carry an inflatable Y-class lifeboat or Y-boat for inshore work, launched by mechanical arm. There are six classes of ALB motor life boats, with speeds ranging from 17 to 25 knots. The RNLI's aim {{is to provide a}} 25-knot lifeboat to every all-weather crew, and has begun construction of an All-weather Lifeboat Centre (ALC) in Poole which, when complete, will save £3million a year. The RNLI took over the ALC in 2015 with the expectation of becoming fully operational in 2019, when six Shannon-class lifeboats a <b>year</b> <b>will</b> be built.|$|E

Although as with all the British Isles it has a maritime climate, the local topography means summer warmth can become emphasised by a slight foehn effect off the surrounding hills. The record maximum stands at 35.8c(96.4f) set in August 1990. Typically 17.3 days of the <b>year</b> <b>will</b> reach 25.1c(77.2f) or higher and the annual warmest day should reach 29.8c(85.6f) according to the 1971–00 observing period.|$|E

5|$|The Judd School sixth form {{can be said}} to {{have been}} {{established}} as early as 1903in the wake of the Education Act of 1902when the Pupil Teachers Scheme was born and The Judd School was used a training centre for young teachers. However, normal pupils above the age of 16 were not permitted until 1919; previously special permission from the governors was required to stay on beyond this age. A 1952 government inspection stated that 42 students were in the sixth form. Judd's sixth form has significantly grown over the last decade, consisting of 308 students at the last Ofsted inspection in 2007. A minimum of 40 offers per <b>year</b> <b>will</b> be made to external applicants; girls are admitted in Year Twelve (aged 16) and make up about 16 percent of the sixth form. The sixth form has its own Common Room in the main school building, including a dedicated cafeteria and study area.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 2007, Columbia University {{announced}} a $400m to $600m donation from media billionaire alumnus John Kluge {{to be used}} exclusively for undergraduate financial aid. The donation is among the largest single gifts to higher education. Its exact value {{will depend on the}} eventual value of Kluge's estate {{at the time of his}} death; however, the generous donation has helped change financial aid policy at Columbia. Annual gifts, fund-raising, and an increase in spending from the university's endowment have allowed Columbia to extend generous financial aid packages to qualifying students. As of 2008, undergraduates from families with incomes as high as $60,000 a <b>year</b> <b>will</b> have the projected cost of attending the university, including room, board, and academic fees, fully paid for by the university. That same year, the university ended loans for incoming and current students who were on financial aid, replacing loans that were traditionally part of aid packages with grants from the university. However, this does not apply to international students, transfer students, visiting students, or students in the School of General Studies. In the fall of 2010, admission to Columbia's undergraduate colleges Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (also known as SEAS or Columbia Engineering) began accepting the Common Application. The policy change made Columbia one of the last major academic institutions and the last Ivy League university to switch to the Common Application.|$|E
