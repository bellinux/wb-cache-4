5|$|The Yankees won the World Series {{every year}} from 1936 to 1939 with a team that {{featured}} Gehrig and outfielder Joe DiMaggio, who recorded a record hitting streak during New York's 1941 championship season. New York set a major league record by winning five consecutive championships from 1949 to 1953, and appeared in the World Series nine times from 1955 to 1964. Mickey Mantle, <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berra,</b> and Whitey Ford were among the players fielded by the Yankees during the era. After the 1964 season, a lack of effective replacements for aging players caused the franchise to decline on the field, and the team became a money-loser for owners CBS while playing in an aging stadium.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds.

5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, and the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berra</b> made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E

5|$|In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería {{reclaimed}} {{a starting}} role {{when he started}} four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single {{in the eighth inning}} as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres {{that he was going to}} hit a home run. In the seventh inning, with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit a three-run home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berra,</b> Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the game, First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden escorted former Yankees catcher and World War II veteran <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berra</b> to the mound, {{where the}} {{ceremonial}} first pitch was thrown by {{a veteran of}} the Iraq War.

The Phillies scored first with a two-out solo home run by Chase Utley {{in the top of the}} third inning. Through the first five innings, Philadelphia starting pitcher Cliff Lee allowed no runs and three hits, striking out seven Yankees batters. In the top of the sixth, Utley hit another solo home run to give the Phillies a 2–0 lead. The starting pitchers Lee and CC Sabathia continued to pitch until the top of the eighth when Sabathia was replaced by Phil Hughes. Hughes walked the first two batters and was replaced by Dámaso Marte. Marte got two quick outs and was relieved by David Robertson, who walked Jayson Werth and gave up a two-run single to Raúl Ibañez. The Phillies added two more runs in the ninth with an RBI single by Shane Victorino and an RBI double by Howard. Lee finished with a complete game allowing one unearned run on six hits and striking out ten batters, not walking any of the hitters he faced.|$|E

50|$|A dual {{citizen of}} Canada and the United States, Thompson {{was born and}} raised in Monte Vista, Colorado.

50|$|Things {{changed in}} June 1998, when Boutons oldest son Michael wrote an eloquent Fathers Day {{open letter to}} the Yankees which was {{published}} in the New York Times, in which Michael described the agony of his father following the August 1997 death of Michaels sister Laurie at age 31. By juxtaposing the story of <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berras</b> self-imposed exile with that of his fathers de facto banishment, Michael created a scenario where not only were the Yankees placed under public pressure to invite his father back, but the article paved the road to reconciliation between Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Berra.|$|R

Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches <b>Yogi</b> <b>Berra</b> and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E
