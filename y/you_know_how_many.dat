500|$|<b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> verses I did {{for that}} song. I did {{a version of}} that before her album [...] even came out. I did two verses. I love these verses too, but they ended up going with André's verse and André killed it. [...] Then [...] reached out to me and {{she wanted me to}} get on the remix. I did two more verses. Out of the second set that I did, she picked the first verse. But my second verse, I just gotta say for the record… It was just too long, I think she was looking for {{something}} shorter and more to the point. [...] It's just a blessing to even be able to work with [...] I'm on my defensive rapper, like yo man. When you follow in André's 3000's shoes, you're expected to really go in. Just the fact to even be on the song with her and shoot the video with her and just be in her presence. She's such a hard working, incredible artist. I’ll never forget that day we shot the video, I'll never forget being able to be on that song, and hopefully we got more as time goes on[...]|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with io9 on 28 July 2009, creator Russell T Davies {{was asked about the}} controversy surrounding Ianto's death and the fan reaction campaign. He replied [...] "There's a campaign, because he was a coffee boy. But do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> packets of coffee they've received so far? Nine. So I think people writing online might sound like thousands of people, but they are nine." [...] However, those involved in the movement believe that this number is much higher due to a post tallying the coffee sent within the community. When asked about the backlash in a separate interview with Michael Ausiello, Russell T Davies said [...] "It's not particularly a backlash. What's actually happening is, well, nothing really to be honest. It's a few people posting online and getting fans upset". He also stated that the character was gone for good, and that his resurrection would devalue the [...] "entire plot." [...] He recommended that fans who wish to stop watching the show should watch Supernatural [...] "because those boys are beautiful", or [...] "look at poetry" [...] if they [...] "can't handle drama". Following these statements, the Save Ianto Jones website encouraged fans to contact BBC Wales rather than Davies, and temporarily presented on its front page the message [...] "Mr Davies has made it clear in recent interviews that he views his fans with contempt, and as disposable, which saddens us" [...] and asked not to be [...] "abused". At Comic-Con 2009, a fan claimed that Davies [...] "hurt" [...] a lot of internet fans with his decision to kill Ianto, which she called [...] "out of line." [...] Davies replied that he would not change his mind regarding the decision, adding, [...] "I've got to be blunt about this, there have been campaigns to send packets of coffee to BBC Wales in protest. There have been nine packets sent. I'm not taking the mickey, but that's a very small number." [...] Executive producer Julie Gardner stated [...] "We want people to be engaged, discuss and not always agree with us. At the end of the day, I make drama to support each author's vision. It's not a democracy. Whether people like it or not, it's storytelling." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek has criticised the Internet campaigns to resurrect the character, citing that the show would [...] "lose far more credibility" [...] if he were brought back. Brew also expressed doubt that the fans stating they would boycott a fourth series will do so. He summarised: [...] "Torchwood now needs to continue to have the courage of its convictions, and for that to happen, the reset switch simply isn't an option." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was a {{guest on}} The Howard Stern Show on April 10, 2008; {{when he was asked}} if he would direct Ghostbusters III and cast Howard, he said [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> times I get asked if I want to do Ghostbusters III? Looking at my career so far, I mean, if you just looked at my two films, I would make the most boring Ghostbusters movie. It would just be people talking about ghosts, there wouldn't be any ghost-busting in it." [...] Stern, a friend of Ivan Reitman, also {{revealed}} that he had seen Jason's early short films and was impressed enough to offer him the opportunity to direct an episode of Son of the Beach (a TV series he produced, a goofy parody of Baywatch), which Jason declined, citing that he was busy obtaining financing for Thank You for Smoking at the time.|$|E

2500|$|Sony Pictures {{spokesman}} Steve Elzer said {{a weekend}} take of about $30 {{million in the}} United States and Canada would be a solid number for a movie {{that is not a}} branded sequel. Sony distribution chief Rory Bruer said [...] "Certainly we {{would have liked to have}} done more, but this was always going to be a worldwide play." [...] The Hollywood Reporter reported Sony insiders estimate a potential loss at about $20 million if the film does not gross high overseas, though estimates of top executives at several rival studios are much higher. On Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Will Smith admitted he was also disappointed with the box office performance and joked [...] "Here's how I think about it, Jimmy, let's be honest. Three is the new one. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> ones it takes to make a three?"
