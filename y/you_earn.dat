25|$|The PAYE tax credit, {{which is}} also €1,650, is awarded to {{employees}} and others who pay tax under the Pay as <b>you</b> <b>earn</b> system (further details below), to compensate them for the time value of money effect; their tax is deducted from their incomes during the year, whereas the self-employed pay {{near the end of}} the year. The credit may not exceed 20% of the recipient's income during the year and it is not transferable between spouses.|$|E

25|$|PAYE (Pay As <b>You</b> <b>Earn)</b> is a {{significant}} contributor to tax being 45%. Given the high unemployment rate the tax is quite heavy. This of course captures those that pay and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by {{the large number of}} government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this {{is to be able to}} attract the right skills though the cost of living is high so it balances this out. A top-earning Zimbabwean spends a lot more money on necessities than say a South African top earner. This is more evident when a comparison with the United States or England is done.

500|$|The {{ownership}} of Chelsea by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich also caused friction between both clubs. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in May 2005: [...] "They are a financially doped club. They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's {{a kind of}} doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources. It puts pressure on the market that is not very healthy. They can go to Steven Gerrard or Rio Ferdinand and 'say how much do <b>you</b> <b>earn,</b> we'll give you twice as much.'" [...] Wenger admitted this put Arsenal at a disadvantage in the transfer market; in the case of Shaun Wright-Phillips, a long-term target, Chelsea's interest meant Arsenal needed to wait before making a bid. The player eventually joined Chelsea from Manchester City for £21 million.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the game's first trailer, New York City {{officials}} were appalled with the choice of their city as the inspiration for the setting of the game, stating that a game like Grand Theft Auto does not represent the city's crime levels accurately. A spokesperson for Mayor Michael Bloomberg said that Bloomberg [...] "does not support any video game where <b>you</b> <b>earn</b> points for injuring or kill police officers". Although points are not awarded in the game and the murder of police officers is discouraged to the player, the game often suggests to players that police officers must be killed in order to advance in the game's main story without difficulty. As a response, Jason Della Rocca, executive director of the International Game Developers Association, accused New York City officials of double standards, for criticising video games of using the city, but avoiding the argument in terms of other forms of entertainment, such as books, films and television shows.|$|E

2500|$|Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan pursued K-12 {{education}} reform through the Race to the Top grant {{program and the}} use of waivers for the No Child Left Behind Act. Race to the Top gives money to schools that meet certain reform goals, and the program helped encourage the adoption of more rigorous academic standards and new teacher evaluation systems. The program encouraged (but did not require) adoption of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. Obama also advocated for universal pre-kindergarten programs, and two free years of community college for everyone. Through her Let's Move program and advocacy of healthier school lunches, First Lady Michelle Obama focused attention on childhood obesity, which was three times higher in 2008 {{than it had been in}} 1974. In December 2015, Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act, a bipartisan bill that reauthorized federally-mandated testing but shrank the federal government's role in education, especially with regard to troubled schools. The law also ended the use of waivers by the Education Secretary. In post-secondary education, Obama signed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which ended the role of private banks in lending out federally insured student loans, created a new income-based loan repayment plan known as Pay as <b>You</b> <b>Earn,</b> and increased the amount of Pell Grant awards given each year. He also instituted new regulations on for-profit colleges, including a [...] "gainful employment" [...] rule that restricted federal funding from colleges that failed to adequately prepare graduates for careers.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{changing}} needs or personal preferences, {{a person may}} {{go back to work}} after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn [...] "too much", the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would [...] "only lose" [...] $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income [...] "squeeze" [...] is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the [...] "full" [...] amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 <b>you</b> <b>earn</b> above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.|$|E

50|$|Another {{method used}} to turn red blocks white is {{to push them}} into the walls. Although {{touching}} a red block directly causes you to lose points, you can indirectly move them by pushing a white block into a red block and pushing both. Jostling red blocks, either by making them {{fall to the ground}} or dropping blocks onto them from a significant height, will also convert them to white blocks. Each red block <b>you</b> turn white <b>earns</b> <b>you</b> ten points, but <b>you</b> can <b>earn</b> additional points by ricocheting bullets off walls before they strike the block. The gains are significant, allowing <b>you</b> to <b>earn</b> up to 300 points per block converted.|$|R
