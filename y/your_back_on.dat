He was working as a kitchen porter at the Greyhound Hotel at Hampton Court, in Middlesex, when someone pointed out a {{photograph}} of John Lennon in a newspaper and asked whether he was related to him. Alfred and Charlie visited one of the Beatles' Christmas shows at the Finsbury Park Empire in London. When the Beatles were filming a scene for A Hard Day's Night in the Scala Theatre in Soho in April 1964, Alf walked into Brian Epstein's NEMS office in Argyle Street with a journalist. [...] "I'm John Lennon's father", he explained to the receptionist. When Epstein was informed, he [...] "went into a panic", and immediately sent a car to bring John to NEMS office. Alf was shabbily dressed, with his unkempt, thinning grey hair greased back. He stuck out his hand, but John did not take it, saying [...] "What do you want?". Alf placated John somewhat by saying, [...] "You can't turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> your family, no matter what they've done." [...] Their conversation did not last long, as John soon ordered Alf and the journalist out of the NEMS office. The Beatles' personal stories were kept out of the newspapers—by agreement with journalists who were offered exclusive stories in return—but one day John opened a copy of the Daily Express and saw a photo of his father.|$|E

2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front of a familiar landscape, turn <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> it, bend down and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned <b>your</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will want to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
