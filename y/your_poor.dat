500|$|When {{the news}} of Rowe's {{pregnancy}} broke to Jackson's mother Katherine, the Jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed {{the mother of his}} unborn child. Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on the telephone to Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry [...] "that nice girl, Debbie" [...] and [...] "give your child a name, not like <b>your</b> <b>poor,</b> half-sister, Joh'Vonnie". The words resonated with the musician, {{who did not want to}} repeat his father's sins.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{position}} in the Norwegian metal scene was controversial from the beginning. Bryzak writes that [...] "standing up for their faith in Life and Hope, Antestor received serious death threats during this time {{from some of the}} major bands and key players of the scene." [...] When asked if the band ever played with other groups in the black metal scene, Antestor said in a 2000 interview with Tcu zine: [...] "We played with some early form of the band Old Man's Child once. Apparently they expressed their opinion of us with their legs {{and walked out of the}} venue during our set. It was their way of saying 'screw you Christians.'" [...] In the liner notes of Martyrium, Antestor corresponds in a slightly bitter tone: [...] "For those of you who despised us, disbelieved in us and misplaced your anger upon us, may God have mercy on <b>your</b> <b>poor</b> souls!" ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap <b>your</b> <b>poor</b> brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to do this sort of thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E
6000|$|... "Must I?" [...] {{said the}} housemaid, rising, {{on the whole}} with alacrity. [...] "What must be, must be, Miss Kimmeens. <b>Your</b> own <b>poor</b> Bella acts according, though unwilling. But go or stay, <b>your</b> own <b>poor</b> Bella loves you, Miss Kimmeens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'd {{do better}} without you, Captain Marvin," [...] said McGinty coldly; [...] "for {{we have our}} own police of the township, and no need for any {{imported}} goods.

2500|$|In May 2011, Tancredo {{represented}} the affirmative with Kris Kobach in a radio-broadcast debate {{of the motion}} [...] "Don't give us your tired, <b>your</b> <b>poor,</b> your huddled masses." [...] The two debated Mayor Julián Castro of San Antonio and Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA. Tancredo and Kobach were declared the victors based on before and after polling of the live in-attendance audience mostly by convincing much of the self-identified undecided audience members {{of the strength of}} the motion.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya bar Rav of Difti {{taught that}} Rabbi Joshua ben Korha deduced from the {{parallel}} {{use of the}} term [...] "base" [...] with regard to withholding charity and practicing idolatry that people who shut their eyes against charity are like those who worship idols. [...] says regarding aid to the poor, [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart [...] [...] [...] and your eye will be evil against <b>your</b> <b>poor</b> brother," [...] while [...] uses the same term [...] "base" [...] when it says regarding idolatry, [...] "Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you [...] [...] [...] saying: ‘Let us go and serve other gods there.'" [...] That Deuteronomy employs the same adjective for both failings implies that withholding charity and practicing idolatry are similar.|$|E
2500|$|The news reached Nicholas by {{telegram}} {{and he had}} {{the difficult}} task of telling his mother. She broke down and wept. He had seldom been out of her thoughts {{for the last few years}} and his death came as a terrible shock. His family were completely devastated. Nicholas was especially grief-stricken at losing his younger brother and childhood playmate. Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich wrote, [...] "Everyone was struck, as if by lightning, by this sad and unexpected news. Queen Victoria wrote to Nicholas II, [...] "Pray accept the expression of my sincerest sympathy in this great sorrow, for I know the affection you had for <b>your</b> <b>poor</b> brother Georgy, whose life was so sad and lonely." [...] The Dowager Empress telegraphed Queen Victoria, [...] "Thank you so much for kind sympathy in this terrible sudden bereavement... My poor dearest son died quite alone. Am heartbroken." ...|$|E

[...] "My mind is in much the same state at leaving Scotland, and going back to my work in London. I hardly know which I admire most--your beautiful country or the people who inhabit it. I have had some pleasant talk with <b>your</b> <b>poorer</b> neighbors; the one improvement I could wish for among them is a keener sense of their religious duties." ...|$|R
