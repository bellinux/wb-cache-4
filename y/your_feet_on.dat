2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... I asked her if she would executive-produce. I was hoping she would say yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or if maybe she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 4, 1970, Kasem, {{along with}} Don Bustany, Tom Rounds, and Ron Jacobs, {{launched}} the weekly radio program American Top 40 (AT40). [...] At the time, top 40 radio {{was on the}} decline as DJs preferred to play album-oriented progressive rock. [...] Loosely based on the TV program Your Hit Parade, the show counted down from #40 on the pop charts to #1—the first #1 was Three Dog Night's [...] "Mama Told Me (Not to Come)"—based on the Billboard Hot 100 each week. [...] The show, however, was {{not just about the}} countdown. [...] Kasem mixed in biographical information about the artists, flashback, and [...] "long-distance dedication" [...] segments where he read letters written by listeners to dedicate songs of their choice to far away loved ones. [...] He often included trivia facts about songs he played and artists whose work he showcased. Frequently, he mentioned a trivia fact about an unnamed singer before a commercial break, then provided the name of the singer after returning from the break. [...] Kasem ended the program with his signature sign-off, [...] "Keep <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> <b>on</b> the ground and keep reaching for the stars." ...|$|E

60|$|Women's rights {{societies}} have been laboring {{for many years}} after equality with man. With what result?
