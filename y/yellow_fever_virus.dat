5|$|Dengue fever virus (DENV) is an RNA virus of {{the family}} Flaviviridae; genus Flavivirus. Other {{members of the same}} genus include <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> West Nile virus, St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, and Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus. Most are transmitted by arthropods (mosquitoes or ticks), and are therefore also referred to as arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses).|$|E
5|$|The {{vaccine is}} {{produced}} by Sanofi and goes by the brand name Dengvaxia. It {{is based on a}} weakened combination of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> and each of the four dengue serotypes. Two studies of a vaccine found it was 60% effective and prevented more than 80 to 90% of severe cases. This is less than wished for by some.|$|E
5|$|Immunology is {{a science}} that {{examines}} the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, {{for which he was}} awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> by Walter Reed.|$|E

50|$|Zika {{virus is}} a mosquito-borne flavivirus {{closely related to}} the dengue and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses.</b> While {{mosquitoes}} are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents.|$|R
40|$|In {{the spring}} of 1928 the {{accumulated}} evidence concerning the etiology of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> presented seeming discrepancies which suggested {{that more than one}} independent disease had been investigated as <b>yellow</b> <b>fever.</b> To help overcome this confusion the International Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation undertook to bring together in one laboratory the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses</b> of West Africa and South America and to determine their relationship, The stud...|$|R
5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine. Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E
5|$|These {{laboratory}} tests are only of diagnostic value during the acute {{phase of the}} illness {{with the exception of}} serology. Tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies, types IgG and IgM, can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection. Both IgG and IgM are produced after 5–7 days. The highest levels (titres) of IgM are detected following a primary infection, but IgM is also produced in reinfection. IgM becomes undetectable 30–90 days after a primary infection, but earlier following re-infections. IgG, by contrast, remains detectable for over 60 years and, in the absence of symptoms, is a useful indicator of past infection. After a primary infection, IgG reaches peak levels in the blood after 14–21 days. In subsequent re-infections, levels peak earlier and the titres are usually higher. Both IgG and IgM provide protective immunity to the infecting serotype of the virus. In testing for IgG and IgM antibodies there may be cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses which may result in a false positive after recent infections or vaccinations with <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> or Japanese encephalitis. The detection of IgG alone is not considered diagnostic unless blood samples are collected 14 days apart and a greater than fourfold increase in levels of specific IgG is detected. In a person with symptoms, the detection of IgM is considered diagnostic.|$|E
25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include the West Nile virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, <b>Yellow</b> <b>Fever</b> <b>Virus,</b> and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. louping ill virus.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> {{is mainly}} {{transmitted}} through {{the bite of}} the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti, but other mostly Aedes mosquitoes such as the tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) can {{also serve as a}} vector for this virus. Like other arboviruses which are transmitted by mosquitoes, the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> is taken up by a female mosquito when it ingests the blood of an infected human or other primate. Viruses reach the stomach of the mosquito, and if the virus concentration is high enough, the virions can infect epithelial cells and replicate there. From there, they reach the haemocoel (the blood system of mosquitoes) and from there the salivary glands. When the mosquito next sucks blood, it injects its saliva into the wound, and the virus reaches the bloodstream of the bitten person. Transovarial and transstadial transmission of the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> within A. aegypti, that is, the transmission from a female mosquito to her eggs and then larvae, are indicated. This infection of vectors without a previous blood meal seems {{to play a role in}} single, sudden breakouts of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus {{is known}} to {{transmit}} pathogens and viruses, such as the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> dengue fever, Chikungunya fever, and Usutu virus. There is some evidence supporting the role of Ae. albopictus in the transmission of Zika virus.|$|E
25|$|The peak biting {{times for}} many {{mosquito}} species are dusk to dawn. However, A. aegypti, {{one of the}} mosquitoes that transmits <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> feeds during the daytime.

25|$|Flavivirus is a genus {{of viruses}} {{in the family}} Flaviviridae. This genus {{includes}} the West Nile virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> Zika virus and several other viruses which may cause encephalitis, as well as insect-specific flaviviruses (ISFs) such as cell fusing agent virus (CFAV), Palm Creek virus (PCV), and Parramatta River virus (PaRV).|$|E
25|$|Biosafety level 3 is {{commonly}} used for research and diagnostic work involving various microbes which can be transmitted by aerosols and/or cause severe disease. These include Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia psittaci, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, SARS coronavirus, Coxiella burnetii, Rift Valley fever virus, Rickettsia rickettsii, several species of Brucella, chikungunya, <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> and West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|Yellow fever {{is caused}} by the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> a 40– to 50-nm-wide enveloped RNA virus, the type species and namesake of the family Flaviviridae. It was the first illness shown to be {{transmissible}} by filtered human serum and transmitted by mosquitoes, by Walter Reed around 1900. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA is around 11,000 nucleotides long and has a single open reading frame encoding a polyprotein. Host proteases cut this polyprotein into three structural (C, prM, E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5); the enumeration corresponds to the arrangement of the protein coding genes in the genome. Minimal <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> (YFV) 3’UTR region is required for stalling of the host 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1. The UTR contains PKS3 pseudoknot structure which serves as a molecular signal to stall the exonuclease and is the only viral requirement for subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) production. The sfRNAs are a result of incomplete degradation of the viral genome by the exonuclease and are important for viral pathogenicity. Yellow fever belongs to the group of hemorrhagic fevers.|$|E
25|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} has identified seven genotypes of <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses,</b> {{and they are}} assumed to be differently adapted to humans and to the vector A. aegypti. Five genotypes (Angola, Central/East Africa, East Africa, West Africa I, and West Africa II) occur only in Africa. West Africa genotype I is found in Nigeria and the surrounding areas. This appears to be especially virulent or infectious, as this type is often associated with major outbreaks. The three genotypes in East and Central Africa occur in areas where outbreaks are rare. Two recent outbreaks in Kenya (1992–1993) and Sudan (2003 and 2005) involved the East African genotype, which had remained unknown until these outbreaks occurred.|$|R
50|$|Disease organisms {{transmitted}} by mosquitoes include West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, Everglades virus, Highlands J virus, La Crosse Encephalitis virus in the United States; dengue <b>fever,</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>fever,</b> Ilheus <b>virus,</b> malaria, Zika virus and filariasis in the American tropics; Rift Valley fever, Wuchereria bancrofti, Japanese Encephalitis, chikungunya and filariasis in Africa and Asia; and Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia.|$|R

25|$|While plant {{viruses and}} bacteriophages {{can be grown}} {{comparatively}} easily, animal viruses normally require a living host animal, which complicates their study immensely.

Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, {{including some of the}} Bunyaviridae (especially Rift Valley fever virus), Ebolavirus, many of the Flaviviridae (especially Japanese encephalitis virus), Machupo virus, Marburg virus, Variola virus, and <b>Yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus.</b> Fungal agents that have been studied include Coccidioides spp..|$|E
25|$|This {{mosquito}} {{has become}} a significant pest in many communities because it closely associates with humans (rather than living in wetlands), and typically flies and feeds in the daytime in addition to at dusk and dawn. The insect is called a tiger mosquito for its striped appearance, which resembles that of the tiger. Ae. albopictus is an epidemiologically important vector for the transmission of many viral pathogens, including the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> dengue fever, and Chikungunya fever, {{as well as several}} filarial nematodes such as Dirofilaria immitis.

40|$|We have {{examined}} and compared {{at the molecular}} level three strains of wild-type <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> (YF) <b>virus</b> isolated from Senegal in 1927, 1953 and 1965, termed French viscerotropic virus, Rendu and Dak 1279 respectively. Over the structural protein genes, Rendu differed from the other two strains by 8 % at the nucleotide level. Rendu also differed antigenically, possessing a ‘vaccine’-specific envelope (E) protein epitope (i. e. an epitope previously shown to be found on 17 D and French neurotropic vaccine viruses only and not wild-type strains of YF virus). Consequently, we propose that at least two distinct genotypes of wild-type YF virus have been present in Senegal. Since Rendu virus was isolated from a fatal case of YF, it would indicate that the vaccine-specific epitope on the E protein is not associated with attenuation of the viscerotropism of wild-type YF virus. The genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae contains some 70 enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA <b>viruses,</b> including <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> (YF) <b>virus.</b> Wild-type YF virus strains have been relatively poorly studied in recent year...|$|R
25|$|Though {{the main}} vector (A. aegypti) also occurs in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of Asia, the Pacific, and Australia, yellow fever has never occurred {{in these parts}} of the globe until the introduction of 11 cases by jet travel from an outbreak in Africa in 2016. Proposed explanations include {{the idea that the}} strains of the mosquito in the east are less able to transmit the <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus,</b> that immunity is present in the populations because of other diseases caused by related viruses (for example, dengue), and that the disease was never introduced because the shipping trade was insufficient, but none is considered satisfactory. Another proposal is the absence of a slave trade to Asia on the scale of that to the Americas. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was probably the means of introduction into the Western Hemisphere from Africa.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{yellow fever}} {{resulted}} in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths, with nearly 90% of these occurring in Africa. Nearly {{a billion people}} live {{in an area of}} the world where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, but not in Asia. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune, more people living in cities, people moving frequently, and changing climate. The disease originated in Africa, from where it spread to South America through the slave trade in the 17th century. Since the 17th century, several major outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the Americas, Africa, and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, yellow fever was seen {{as one of the most}} dangerous infectious diseases. In 1927 <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> became the first human virus to be isolated.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{scientists}} {{isolated the}} <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>virus</b> in West Africa. Following this, two vaccines {{were developed in}} the 1930s. The vaccine 17D {{was developed by the}} South African microbiologist Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the work of Ernest Goodpasture, Theiler used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a Nobel Prize in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the French neurotropic vaccine (FNV), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue. Since this vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of encephalitis, FNV was not recommended after 1961. Vaccine 17D is still in use, and more than 400 million doses have been distributed. Little research has been done to develop new vaccines. Some researchers worry that the 60-year-old technology for vaccine production may be too slow to stop a major new yellow-fever epidemic. Newer vaccines, based on vero cells, are in development and should replace 17D at some point.|$|E
40|$|Background: Aedes aegypti is the {{principal}} vector of dengue and <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses.</b> The availability of the sequenced and annotated genome enables genome-wide analyses of gene expression in this mosquito.

40|$|A {{chimeric}} <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> virus/West Nile <b>virus</b> (WNV) {{was compared}} to WNV alone as a biosafety level 2 reagent in the plaque reduction neutralization test for determining WNV infection histories.

Diagnostic assays for West Nile virus (WNV) (Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) infection in vertebrate blood samples often rely on the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), con-sidered the most sensitive and specific antibody detection test for arboviruses (2). However, WNV is characterized as a biosafety level 3 (BSL- 3) virus and thus is restricted in its use to specialized biosecure laboratories.

40|$|Abstract. Although much {{is known}} about the ecology, epidemiology, and {{molecular}} biology of mosquito-borne viruses, the viral factors that allow transmission by mosquitoes to humans or animals remain unknown. Using infectious clones of disseminating (Asibi) and non-disseminating (17 D) <b>yellow</b> <b>fever</b> <b>viruses</b> (YFV), we produced chimeric viruses to evaluate the role of different viral genes in dissemination. Previously, we showed that virus produced from an infectious clone containing the structural genes of 17 D in Asibi disseminated from the mosquito midgut at a rate of 31 %, indicating that some genetic determinants of dissemination must lie within the non-structural (NS) protein genes or 3 non-coding region (NCR). We chose to investigate the roles of NS 2 A, NS 4 B, and the 3 NCR in YFV dissemination. Substitution of the 17 D NS 2 A or NS 4 B into Asibi significantly attenuated YFV dissemination, demonstrating that this is a multigenic property. There was no difference in dissemination after substitution of the 17 D 3 NCR...|$|R
