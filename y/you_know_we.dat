And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|E

But, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the film}} leaves it mysterious, early script drafts {{made clear that}} HAL's {{breakdown}} is triggered by authorities on Earth who order him to withhold information from the astronauts about {{the purpose of the}} mission (this is also explained in the film's sequel 2010). Frederick Ordway, Kubrick's science advisor and technical consultant, stated that in an earlier script Poole tells HAL there is [...] "...something about this mission that we weren't told. Something {{the rest of the crew}} knows and that <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> would like to know whether this is true", to which HAL responds: [...] "I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know." [...] HAL then falsely predicts a failure of the hardware maintaining radio contact with Earth (the source of HAL's difficult orders) during the broadcast of Frank Poole's birthday greetings from his parents.|$|E
500|$|The Bomb Squad {{worked out}} an {{elaborate}} method {{that involved the}} members assembling different types of sounds in the studio. They proceeded to reconfigure and recontextualize fragments from various sources into their own compositions. Each member brought a different philosophy to composing music, arranging sounds, and working with technology, while sampled material was taken from singles, LP albums, and radio, among other sources. Hank Shocklee called the group [...] "a production assembly line where each person had their own particular specialty." [...] In his words, he came [...] "from a DJ's perspective. Eric [...] is coming from a musician’s perspective. So together, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> started working out different ideas." [...] Sadler advocated a more traditional, structured approach to songwriting, while Shocklee's approach was more experimental. As the main lyricist, Chuck D wanted to recontextualize the sampled material into his lyrics and create a theme for the album.|$|E

[...] Idolator's Sam Lansky wrote that he was unsatisfied, and that the video [...] "is more boundary-testing than the audio, it's all the things you'd expect: Futuristic, with some unsubtle product placement and a lot of ostensibly cool effects.

500|$|Like all {{the other}} tracks, album opener [...] "Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)" [...] borrows from [...] "preaching, {{shouting}} and ranting". The expression [...] "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, {{is based on a}} New York Post headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title [...] "Don't Worry About the Government" [...] from TalkingHeads' debut album, , into the lyric [...] "Look {{at the hands of a}} government man". [...] The [...] "rhythmical rant" [...] in [...] "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late."—is influenced by old school rap, specifically Kurtis Blow's [...] "The Breaks" [...] given to Byrne by Frantz. [...] "Once in a Lifetime" [...] borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes. Some critics have suggested that the song is [...] "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, [...] "We're largely unconscious. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, 'How did I get here?'." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Lawrence had met Hillenburg {{previously}} on Rocko's Modern Life. When {{working on}} the pilot episode of SpongeBob, Hillenburg invited him to audition {{for all of the}} characters. Since other voices had been found for the main cast already, Lawrence started out by voicing a variety of minor characters. This included Plankton, who was initially only set to appear in one episode. Mr. Lawrence recalls that Nickelodeon executives told Hillenburg, [...] "'we could stunt-cast this. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> could have Bruce Willis do this voice.' And Steve was just like, 'it's Doug , don't you hear it? This is the character! This is the guy!'" [...] Jill Talley, Tom Kenny's wife, voices Karen Plankton. Being a Chicago native, she uses a Midwestern accent for the character. Electronic sound effects are underlaid by the series' audio engineers to create a robotic sound whenever she speaks. Talley and Mr. Lawrence often improvise Plankton and Karen's dialogue. Lawrence called improvisation his [...] "favorite part of the voice over" [...] in 2009. He elaborated in a 2012 interview, saying, [...] "I always enjoy the back-and-forth.

The reissue has different cover artwork, as well as four bonus tracks – the track listing of which was revealed on February 1. The bonus tracks are: a new song recorded especially for the reiussue, titled [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", two re-recorded songs that were originally featured on their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason – [...] "Heartless" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] – and a cover of the Kelly Clarkson song, [...] "Since U Been Gone". The new tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio. In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release.

500|$|Big Boi {{also worked}} with other guest artists, {{including}} Jamie Foxx, T.I., and B.o.B. André 3000 was to appear on three tracks, and produce a track for Yelawolf. Big Boi was introduced to Yelawolf's music through his younger brother and invited him to record after seeing him perform. The track [...] "Follow Us" [...] features Vonnegutt, an act from Big Boi's Purple Ribbon label. He originally proposed a rock-influenced track for Yelawolf, but was persuaded by him to send the instrumental for [...] "You Ain't No DJ". According to Yelawolf, he [...] "wrote like 64 bars and turned in the huge verse", which was edited down to 16 and eight-bar parts of his original verse for the finished song. Big Boi also attempted unsuccessfully to collaborate with singer-songwriter Kate Bush, and managed to work with funk music pioneer George Clinton on [...] "Fo Yo Sorrows", an experience he related to [...] "Dorothy {{going to see the}} Wizard of Oz. He is the grandfather of funk; when George speaks, you listen. He's gonna give you that extraterrestrial funk; you gotta be thankful for the way he beams it down to you".

500|$|Music writers offered various {{interpretations of}} the video's style and concept. David Peisner of Spin wrote of the close-ups {{featured}} in the music video, [...] "As the camera sucks him in, it feels intimate and intrusive, revealing and voyeuristic". Music critic Jim Farber commented that D'Angelo's torso [...] "sways in grinding rhythm, tensing and releasing as his mouth curls in pleasure and his eyebrows narrow to measure an ecstatic contraction", while claiming that the video has [...] "nothing but close-ups of D'Angelo's buff body on the apparent receiving {{end of one of}} life's great payoffs". In his essay [...] "'Untitled': D'Angelo and the Visualization of the Black Male Body" [...] for his 1999 Wide Angle journal, journalist Keith M. Harris interprets the video to be a portrayal of D'Angelo's [...] "discursive play with masculinity and blackness". In his review of D'Angelo's Voodoo, Mark Anthony Neal of PopMatters wrote of the video in contrast to most music videos in R and hip hop at the time, stating [...] "One could call the video for 'Untitled (How Does it Feel)' narcissistic, but in an era when most R videos are nothing but 'bling, bling' and booty, D'Angelo's bare naked torso was refreshing". On the video's camera range and angle, Stephen Hill, a senior vice president for BET, had stated [...] "It stopped just north of the line where, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> would have had issues". A 2008 press release for D'Angelo described the music video as [...] "featuring D'Angelo as a shirtless Adonis that catapulted him into the stratosphere and firmly cemented his place as the reigning King of Soul." ...|$|E
