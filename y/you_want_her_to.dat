2500|$|In June, Raisman competed at the National Championships in St. Louis. She placed {{third in}} the {{all-around}} with a two-day combined score of 120.950, and finished first on beam (30.650) and floor (31.250). Károlyi said: [...] "She is just so solid. She goes out there and doesn't act like she's bothered by anything. She knows she's trained, she knows she's ready, and she doesn't put any extra pressure on herself. I really love {{to have this kind}} of gymnast. She gives her heart." [...] Sacramone added: [...] "I don't think she necessarily gets enough credit for how well she competes. At the last two world championships, I don't think she's made any mistakes. She's the backbone. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go and do something, do a solid routine, she's going to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why,--just this, ma'am. May I tell Miss Dolly {{straight}} out that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come back, and that I've {{been sent to}} say so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't leave me! There, I {{knew it was}} that. Why don't {{you want}} Nurse to leave you? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be with you every minute?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} would depend on what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do," [...] he said at last. [...] "The Hall is a good service, though they don't like the mistresses, and of course {{none of them would}} like to do {{anything}} that might risk their place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well?' echoed {{her mother}} in a {{different}} tone. 'I don't {{know what you were}} all saying, but I'm sure of this, that that woman was only looking <b>to</b> see what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say. I watched the cunning look of her eyes, and I would not give that for her word,' with a gesture of her fingers.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. PEARCE. Well, sir, {{she says}} you'll be glad <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> {{when you know}} what she's come about. She's quite a common girl, sir. Very common indeed. I should have sent her away, only I thought perhaps <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> talk into your machines. I hope I've not done wrong; but really you see such queer people sometimes--you'll excuse me, I'm sure, sir-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You monster!" [...] {{retorted}} Hans, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> wear weeds {{for you all}} her life--burn {{herself in}} perpetual suttee while you are alive and merry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{talk to me}} of English society! Thank goodness, in {{the first}} place, I don't live in it. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> give up her genius?" [...] he demanded.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here," [...] said Kenneth, sternly, [...] "you {{are getting}} morbid, young man, {{and pretty soon}} you'll be mad yourself. If Lucy is found do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see you in this condition?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not at all}} so sure of it. She {{has been}} made <b>to</b> believe that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stay, and {{therefore}} she has stayed. She is quite master enough of herself to ride out hunting with him again and then to refuse him." [...] And so Lady Albury doubted up to the Sunday, and all through the Sunday,--up to the very moment when the last preparations were {{to be made for}} the man's arrival.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you don't}} care for Kitty's {{pleasure}} at all, and <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> enjoy herself. Why don't you take {{some interest in}} the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] she said. [...] "Now we {{know where}} we are. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> to marry the Duchess, and {{therefore}} <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> have Lawrence. <b>You</b> think that I can stop it, and as I don't want him married, either, you come to me. That is reasonable. Now how can I prevent it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She {{will not}} feel that,' said Ethel; 'but indeed, Tom, I {{see what you}} mean, and like it. It is yourself, and not the conferrer of the benefit, that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> care for.' ...|$|E
60|$|CONRAD. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> {{be fully}} grown at eighteen. You want {{to force her}} into a stuck-up, artificial, {{premature}} self-possession before she has any self to possess. You just let her alone: she is right enough for her years.|$|E
6000|$|Nothing of {{the kind}} had been settled, but Olive helped Mrs. Burrage (this time) more than she knew by saying, [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> visit you, Mrs. Burrage? {{why do you want}} her socially? Are you not aware that your son, a year ago, desired to marry her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} is as you say, Master Geoffrey, though I {{never thought of it}} before. There is some reason, no doubt, why the craft moves up against the wind so long as the sails are full, instead of {{drifting}} away to leeward; though I never heard tell of it, and never heard anyone ask before. I dare say a learned man could tell why it is; and if you ask your good father when you go back I would wager he can explain it. It always seems to me as if a boat have got some sort of sense, just like a human being or a horse, and when she knows which way <b>you</b> <b>wants</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go she goes. That's how it seems to me -- ain't it, Joe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she persisted. [...] "She is very pretty. She {{is as good}} as she can be. She is rich. And if {{she were}} your wife <b>you</b> would <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> talk more than she does, you would be so glad <b>to</b> listen <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> I might say more about Amy, but I won't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I needn't {{tell you}} fellows," [...] he said gravely, [...] "that {{this place is}} a little unlike any other in Europe. You may think you're safe enough, but all the same I wouldn't trust a living soul. By-the-by, I saw Felicia as I came in. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> break down, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! fery goot!" [...] {{retorted}} the old {{man with}} a touch of sarcasm; [...] "you know fery well what Elspie will be sayin' to that, or you would not be so ready to let it rest with her. Yes, yes, she is safe to see her way to go the way that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't see {{anything}} remarkable. That is a neat, plain suit; {{the materials are}} good, and it's not unbecoming, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> look like a little school-girl; {{but it has not}} a particle of style, and no one would ever give it a second glance," [...] said Mrs. Clara, feeling that her last remark condemned the whole thing.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} been told to bring Nathalie Haldin here. Am I not right? Of course I am right. I was not in the room, but I know. I know Peter Ivanovitch {{sufficiently}} well. He is a great man. Great men are horrible. Well, that's it. Have nothing to do with her. That's the best you can do, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> become like me--disillusioned! Disillusioned!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've led me a nice {{dance on}} a wrong scent," [...] {{answered}} the runner, sulkily. [...] "But I {{never was a}} hard man where women are concerned. Go upstairs, and leave the door open, so that I can see in through it if I like. Hold your hat over your wrists, if <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> see the handcuffs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are," [...] he {{answered}} unconsciously. [...] "I {{am sure that}} <b>you</b> are. I <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> tell me the whole truth about this extraordinary marriage. We will find some way out of it." ...|$|R
40|$|Education and {{training}} institutions {{around the world}} used {{to be driven by}} a belief that teaching simply involved imparting knowledge to learners. This was based on the notion that a learner’s brain is an 'empty vessel', into which knowledge can be poured, and that if you poured in the right information, in the right sequence, the learner would automatically learn whatever <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> learn. Although most educators would now disagree with this notion, it is still the case that most educators/ trainers in higher education and workplace training are appointed {{on the basis of their}} subject knowledge and not their ability to teach in a learner-centred way. In recent years, the concept of constructivism has helped many educators to go beyond traditional rote learning techniques, and to engage their learners more fully in the learning process. In this unit, we take a bird's-eye look at the many ways in which you can support distance learners in their learning from a constructivist perspective. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{the only}} way, unless <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> ring for the servant to kick {{you out of}} the house. It's as well {{understood}} as A B C, among the people who do these things. I should say take jewelry instead of money if she were anything but a Russian spy; but they understand the thing so well, that you may go further with them than with others." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{you mind}} her, Mr. Warbles,' the woman said; 'she is a limb, she is, and no mistake, {{but she has}} got plenty of sense. But you had best talk to her {{straight}} if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> do anything; then if she says she will, she will; if she says she won't, you may take your oath you won't drive her. Now, Sal, be reasonable, and hear what the gentleman has to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. That's it. I'm {{afraid you}} might. An' {{consider}} how hard {{that would be}} for Columbine. She an' Jack were raised sister an' brother, almost. It would be hard on her. You see, Collie has a strange an' powerful sense of duty to Old Bill. If you killed Jack it would likely kill the old man, an' Collie would suffer all her life. You couldn't cure her of that. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, let it wait!" [...] exclaimed Jane. [...] "Such {{a ridiculous}} fuss {{to make about}} asking Agatha to write a letter, just because <b>you</b> happen <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> play <b>you</b> your duets! I am certain she is heartily {{sick and tired of}} them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then leave <b>her</b> alone <b>to</b> choose. Don't {{go about}} looking {{as though you}} had a knife in your heart, if you find her turn {{for a moment to}} some one else. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> choose <b>you,</b> do you, just because you are a weakling, because her great kind heart can't bear the thought of making you miserable? Stand on your feet like a man and take your luck.... Can I take off my hat? I can't eat in this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite. You see a girl {{alone for}} about five minutes a day, and if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be your wife, you've got to charge into it as if you were trying to grab the gold ring on a merry-go-round." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us ask Mamma; {{she will}} tell us what is best to do first, for she knows all sorts of {{literary}} people, and won't say any more than <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to.</b> I'm bent on having my way, Becky, and the more modest you are, the surer I am {{that you are a}} genius. Real geniuses always are shy; so you just make up your mind to give me the best of your pieces, and let me prove that I'm right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} make it my {{business}} to find out all about it," [...] said Mrs Keswick. [...] "Mr Brandon has promised to attend to this matter for me, and I must write to him, to know what he has been doing. Well, Mrs Null and Miss March seem to be very good friends, and I dare say my niece could manage things so as to give you the chance you want. I'll go to the house now, and send her over to you, so that you can tell her what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> say or do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> follow Rideau {{you shall}} have the boat for nothing, and we'll both come along," [...] said Redmond. [...] "Gilby, {{get down to}} the beach and see to the gear and crew. Meantime, you are coming {{straight}} into the factory to get some food. Where is Rideau making for? That I don't know, but he'll probably try to get on board the Minella if he's afraid of you. She's billed on a stopping trip for Lagos, but she'll edge close round Twin Point Bluff, and he'll no doubt try to board her there. There's a nice southwester blowing now, and under the big lugsail we ought to overhaul the canoe before he does so. She can't have got far until the breeze sprang up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not entirely; {{but talk}} and {{testimony}} {{are two different}} things. Suppose they call daughter to the stand? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>her</b> cross-examined as <b>to</b> what basis there was for this gossip? They know something of Cliff's being let out, and that will inflame them. He {{may be at the}} mill this minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are talking}} {{of an old}} native African woman?" [...] said the governor, looking at Corny. [...] "I have heard of <b>her.</b> It seems <b>to</b> be {{generally}} agreed that she belonged to a royal family {{in one of the}} African tribes. And <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> restore <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> regal station?" ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{would be}} such a joy to me if I could go and tell Christina that you'd consented. It would make such a {{difference}} to me, <b>you</b> see. I <b>want</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be fond of me, and I know she'd never forget if I'd been able <b>to</b> do <b>her</b> a good turn like that. Oh, Arthur, won't you? ...|$|R
