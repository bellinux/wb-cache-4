6000|$|... "This is {{an ancient}} gamekeeper's shelter," [...] he explained, [...] "built {{a long time ago}} and almost {{forgotten}} now. What Craig did, without a doubt, was to hide in this. The Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>man</b> who took the affair in hand found distinct traces here of recent occupation. That is how he made his first escape." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Craig {{came along}} through here," [...] he explained. [...] "The groom and the Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>man</b> {{who had been}} sitting by his side {{followed}} him. They searched for an hour but found no trace of him at all. Then {{they returned to the}} house to make a report and get help. I will now show you how Craig first eluded them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does seem}} so, indeed," [...] the {{inspector}} agreed. [...] "To me he looks terrible ill. But there's one thing sure, he's having all {{the care and}} attention that's possible. And now, sir, I'll not intrude further upon your time. I'll just make my report, and you'll probably have {{a visit from the}} Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>man</b> sometime within the next few days." ...|$|E
60|$|As we {{came out}} of the Stylites Arms, Poirot drew me aside by a gentle {{pressure}} of the arm. I understood his object. He was waiting for the Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>men.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{think the}} {{appearance}} of the two Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>men</b> was rather a shock--especially to John, though of course after the verdict, he had realized that {{it was only a matter}} of time. Still, the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done.|$|R
50|$|On the day, Brandon Jacobs {{rushed for}} 107 <b>yards,</b> <b>Manning</b> {{completed}} 18 of 31 passes for nearly 150 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, {{and the defense}} notched six sacks: 2.5 for Michael Strahan, 1.5 for Justin Tuck, 1 for Aaron Ross and 1 for Umenyiora. Pierce and Madison provided the two Giants' interceptions.|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, of course," [...] he began, [...] "that Craig {{was arrested}} at Liverpool in {{consequence}} of communications from the New York police. I understand that it was with great difficulty he was discovered, and it is quite clear that some one on the ship had been heavily bribed. However, he was arrested, brought to London, and then down here for purposes of identification. I {{would have gone to}} London myself, and in fact offered to do so, but on the other hand, as there are many others on the estate to whom he was well-known, I thought {{that it would be better}} to have more evidence than mine alone. Accordingly, they left London one afternoon, and I sent a dogcart to the station to meet them. They arrived quite safely and started for here, Craig handcuffed to one of the Scotland Yard men on the back seat, and the other in front with the driver. About half a mile from the south entrance to the park, the road runs across a rather desolate strip of country with a lot of low undergrowth on one side. We have had a little trouble with poachers, as there is a sort of gipsy camp on some common land a short distance away. My head-keeper, to whom the very idea of a poacher is intolerable, was patrolling this ground himself that afternoon, and caught sight of one of these gipsy fellows setting a trap. He chased him, and more, I am sure, to frighten him than anything else, when he saw that the fellow was getting away he fired his gun, just as the dog-cart was passing. The horse shied, the wheel caught a great stone by the side of the road, and all four men were thrown out. The man to whom Craig was handcuffed was stunned, but Craig himself appears to have been unhurt. He jumped up, took the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the officer, undid them, and slipped off into the undergrowth before either the groom or the other Scotland <b>Yard</b> <b>man</b> had recovered their senses. To cut a long story short, that was last Thursday, and up till now not a single trace of the fellow has been discovered." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lestrade's lack {{of ability}} is {{frequently}} exaggerated in adaptations, which often characterise {{him as a}} bumbling idiot.

This version had the <b>Yard</b> <b>man</b> as a well-meaning fool patronised by the detective, whose help he greatly appreciated, rather in the manner of that series' version of Doctor Watson (Nigel Bruce). Lestrade is nonetheless a capable officer, and Holmes never questions his honesty or his willingness to solve a case. In the book Sherlock Holmes: The Man and His World by H.R.F. Keating, Keating notes that despite Holmes' accusations of his lack of observational skills, he knows Holmes craves the outré and uses this to collect his interest in the case of [...] "The Adventure of the Six Napoleons".|$|E

Parties, clearances, packing, and so forth. I got all this done between drinks and hangovers. Last night there was a party at a huge {{plantation}} for the graduating class. We must have drunk the place dry. I never saw so much booze and beer. The joint was really jumpin’. The man that owns the place is a millionare [sic], and he has one of these brawls for every class at Darr. He had three pigs barbequed for us right over the open pits in his <b>yard.</b> <b>Man</b> was that good. I’m leaving Friday at 12 : 10. We’re going by Pullman I think, and we might have a stopover in New York. I’ll call you from there if we do. If it’s for two or three hours, maybe you could come down and see me there. It depends on the hour and the time I have though. We might go straight through to Newbourgh [sic], however. I still have no more details for you, honey. I won’t have too much time off in Basic. I’ll be flying day in and day out, and nights too. I imagine I’ll get some weekends off, though. And Christmas, too! It sure is a break. I love you honey, give my love to Bob.
