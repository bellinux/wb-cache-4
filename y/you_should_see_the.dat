"Electric Chapel" [...] {{has been}} {{compared}} to the work of Madonna, with NMEs Dan Martin saying that [...] "if you'd ever wondered what that Madonna doing the soundtrack to Blade Runner might have sounded like... then wonder no more." [...] Genre-wise, Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone referred [...] "Electric Chapel" [...] to as an electro rock recording, while Robbie Daw of Idolator dubbed the song as being of the pop metal genre, attesting that unlike fellow song from Born This Way, [...] "Heavy Metal Lover", [...] "Electric Chapel" [...] possesses an actual metal-edge. Gaga recorded the chorus a number of times, channeling the vocals of bands like Duran Duran, and singers Cher and Billy Idol.
