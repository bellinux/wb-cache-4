500|$|Ideas {{alluding}} to romance are prevalent throughout the episode. The development between Shane Walsh and Lori Grimes continues in [...] "TS-19", which showcases a flashback featuring Shane being conflicted {{with the decision}} to leave an unconscious Rick Grimes in the hospital—who Shane initially presumes to be dead. Kirkman asserted that the sequence added dimension to the storyline, and concluded that by {{the ending of the}} episode, the audience will no longer identify Shane as an antagonist. [...] "Up until the sixth episode, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that Shane actually is a bad guy, that he lied to Lori and made her believe that he was dead in order to facilitate him moving in on her," [...] said Kirkman. [...] "The flashback does a great job of telling you that that's not true: He tried to save Rick, he wanted to save Rick. He was kind of up against the wall there and actually did believe that Rick was dead." [...] Lincoln said of the flashback: [...] "You realize Shane's loyalty as a friend and as a man—and also his weaknesses. He still can't make a decision without his partner, and you realize he's flawed—everybody is under incredible duress, you see the state of the world is so extreme and terrifying that people are making split-second decisions under great duress. Is Shane barricading Rick in, or is he trying to prevent him being taken by the walkers? There are many different ways to construe what Shane has done and that's the beauty of the show is that there's no clear and definite answers, you make your own mind." [...] Other themes prominent in the episode include suicide and terror.|$|E
500|$|St. Anger {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; the album holds {{a score of}} 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying: [...] "While it's an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion {{for the first time}} in years." [...] Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like [...] "a band jamming together in a garage for the first time, and the band just happened to be Metallica." [...] Talking about the album, Greg Kot of Blender said, [...] "It may be too late to rehabilitate Metallica's image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage." [...] Writing for NME, Ian Watson said that: ...the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that, as with their emotional selves, they've taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There's no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a [...] "punishing, unflinching document of internal struggle—taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield's brain. St. Anger is an immediate record." [...] Barry Walter of Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in [...] "St. Anger", stating: [...] "No wonder there's an authenticity to St. Anger's fury that none of the band's rap-metal followers can touch." [...] He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: [...] "There's no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation." ...|$|E

500|$|During the off-season, the Capitals {{made several}} player changes. One {{of the players}} that was not {{retained}} by the team, Matt Bradley, started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa. In the interview, Bradley said his former team was [...] "a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren’t disciplined the way they should have been," [...] which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team {{was not able to}} advance past {{the second round of the}} Stanley Cup playoffs. He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well, but went with his star players. He further noted that Boudreau was a [...] "great coach" [...] who had been put in a tough position. When asked to point out examples, Bradley stated that Alexander Semin [...] "could easily be the best player in the league," [...] but he [...] "just doesn’t care," [...] further noting, [...] "When you've got a guy like that, you need him to be your best player, or one of your best players, and when he doesn't show up, <b>you</b> almost <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that he wants to be back in Russia."

40|$|Andrea Camilleri's La forma dell'acqua (1994) is {{the first}} of his {{acclaimed}} series of Inspector Montalbano novels. Its translation into English in 2002, by the also much acclaimed Stephen Sartarelli, as The Shape of Water, allowed Anglophone readers to access not only an example of high-quality Italian crime fiction but also an example of crime fiction that is about translation. Sartarelli's version will not be analyzed here in terms of its translation qualities, since I am quite unable to speak Italian; it will be analyzed, instead, as a vehicle for a will to translation, or translatability, that is always already present in the original text. Our focus here will be on the choice of the liminal space of the beach to mark the liminal edge of this first novel (the limen of the series). The Shape of Water, as an enigmatic title (paratextual puzzle) and philosophical paradox, will be shown to correspond to the text's wilful vacillation between body (original as exemplary textness) and intentionality (translation as textuality, both re-actualized translated version and virtual otherness or translatability). The ramifications of this (un) marking of liminal territory on the mystery it contains (or fails to contain) will be explored. While there is some truth in Carlo Vennarucci's (2003, s. p.) statement as to the excellent translation of Italianness in The Shape of Water - "Stephen Sartarelli does an admirable job in translating Camilleri's novel from the Italian. While reading The Shape of Water, <b>you</b> always <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that this is an Italian mystery about Italian characters and written by a superb Italian author" - it seems equally clear that Italianness (versus both Italian otherness and foreignness) is being signed "in translation", both by Camilleri and his translator, which is to say, problematized and decentred. Translation and translatability will be explored here as reflexive stagings of textuality, which in turn focus our readerly attention on the ironic and reflexive ways that Camilleri and his detective negotiate the shape of water...|$|R

Tom Dawson of Total Film gave the film four stars and called it [...] "a timely testimony to the power of peaceful resistance." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave Budrus four out of five stars stating that [...] "this involving film is an eye-opener." [...] He also argues that [...] "what is so arresting about Bacha's film is that it shows something about the Israeli wall that I hadn't grasped. It doesn't just simply separate the Israelis from the Palestinians, but wanders on to the Palestinian territory, meandering and looping around: the idea is not merely to stop movement into Israel but covertly to impose paralysis within the Palestinian zone itself." [...] Tom Huddleston of TimeOut London gave it four out of five stars and argues that, [...] "In refusing to romanticise the villagers or demonise their aggressors, she presents a stark and wholly believable portrait of the Middle East conflict in microcosm, while her welcome focus on character over political point-scoring gives Budrus a weighty emotional kick." [...] Liz Haycroft of Little White Lies - Independent Film Magazine gave Budrus three out of five stars and states, [...] "By incorporating interviews with an Israeli Border Police captain and a spokesman from the military police, Budrus presents a relatively balanced view of the dispute, particularly for those unfamiliar with the regional politics. And yet from the very beginning, it’s difficult to fathom how one country can enter a region and declare parts of it their own, without expecting some kind of resistance. The people of Budrus, and their choice of peaceful protest, can only be admired." [...] Derek Malcolm of The Evening Standard gave the film four out of five stars and notes that the [...] "film seems designed to prove what can be done by relatively peaceful means. But it is at its best when we see how Morror gradually moves into a position of moral strength. You can scarcely believe the foolishness of the Israeli authorities, but <b>you</b> never <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that <b>the</b> film is taking sides."

5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} novel was published, author Cornelia Funke sent {{a copy of}} Inkheart along with a note to Brendan Fraser, {{explaining}} that he was her inspiration for the character of Mo. [...] "So I get this book. It {{shows up in the}} mail. 'Dear Brendan,' it's inscribed, 'Thank you for inspiring this character.' I can feel my leg getting pulled already. 'What? Where’s Ashton Kutcher?' 'I hope that <b>you</b> <b>get</b> a chance to read this aloud to your kids one day. Best wishes, Cornelia Funke.' I had no idea from a bar of soap who she was, so I Googled her. Wow, so much work, she’s prolific. I think part of the story is that a little girl who was bilingual, I think she was a Brit but she spoke German fluently, had discovered a copy of Tintenherz which she loved and read, and wrote to either it was Cornelia or the publisher and asked why isn't this published in English? And I think Cornelia probably wanted to {{know the answer to that}} question too. So once it was, it just became a snowballing thing and then that really got her out there and led to the acclaim and popularity of her work." [...] It was this that motivated director Iain Softley and the casting department to consider Fraser first for the role in the film. Fraser told Softley that if it was determined that he was not right for the role, not to feel obligated to use him on the project. Softley was ultimately impressed with Fraser's performance and contracted him for the film. Public auditions were held for the role of Meggie Folchart [...] with the intention of casting an unknown actress, however the role eventually went to Eliza Bennett who had already worked extensively on television and film at the time. Funke, was quoted as saying that [...] "we had our second screening (summer 2007), which went well, and I really loved the movie, but they are still changing things, especially at the end." [...] Inkheart was filmed at Shepperton Studios near London, England and on location in Balestrino, Albenga, Entracque and Laigueglia, Italy, in 2006 and 2007. [...] A lot of the things that we tried to do are more to do with optical illusion, the sleight of hand....It feels very organic and very real, and I actually think it makes the magic more effective. I think that there is a sort of discounting that goes on in the minds of an audience when they know that it's sort of a computer world or a digital world. It's like, 'Oh, they can do anything. They can press a button for however many weeks they need at a machine.' Whereas if <b>you</b> actually <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that it's something more like the craft of illusion, I think that it's more magical, actually.

[...] Wentz further elaborated: [...] "They're testing out their new super suits {{for the first time in}} the scene. Some of it works—some of it doesn't. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that they're stepping into a bigger role. The story's in the DNA of Fall Out Boy. It is an authentic story and it's who our band is—we've always identified with the underdog." ...|$|E

And yet, {{you want to}} devour the next episode immediately." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times called it [...] "...a trustworthy family drama but with aliens." [...] He continued, [...] "It's 'Jericho' meets 'V', with the good from both and the bad discarded. It'll raise the summer-TV bar significantly." [...] Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B+ and wrote, [...] "A similar, gradually developed, but decisive conviction makes Falling Skies an engaging, if derivative, chunk of dystopian sci-fi." [...] He continued, [...] "...Falling Skies rises above any one performance; it's the spectacle of humans versus aliens that draws you in." ...|$|E

Jon Azpiri from All Music gave Thug on da Line a 4/5 {{rating and}} wrote: [...] "After listening to Krayzie Bone {{on his second}} solo album, Thug on da Line, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that he is dealing with some personal demons. After years of personal and professional strife, Krayzie raps about his frustration with thug life in his patented singsong style on tracks like [...] "Can't Hustle 4 Ever" [...] and [...] "Talk to Myself"." [...] Evan Serpcik from Entertainment Weekly gave Thug on da Line an A- Rating and wrote: [...] "On Thug on Da Line, Krayzie melds his precision, rapid-fire rhymes, and delicately sung choruses with expansive R&B tracks that groove like a ghettoized Neville Brothers tune. Rest assured, references to gats and thugs abound, but most often they are contextualized into tales of longing and regret." ...|$|E
