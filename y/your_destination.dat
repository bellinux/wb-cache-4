"Your {{common sense}} will, I am sure, sustain my {{objection}} {{and realize that}} it was better that I should direct my own movements and appear only at the exact moment when my presence was needed.

You will not now fail to reach <b>your</b> <b>destination.</b> From henceforth I take command of this expedition, and I must ask you to complete your preparations to-night, so that {{we may be able to}} make an early start in the morning. My time is of value, and the same thing may be said, no doubt, in a lesser degree of your own. I propose, therefore, that we push on as rapidly as possible, until I have demonstrated what you have come to see." ...|$|E
60|$|At custom-houses the {{multitude}} file tediously through, hot and irritated, and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks {{and make a}} mess of everything; but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still. Perhaps you arrive at <b>your</b> <b>destination</b> in a rain-storm at ten at night--you generally do. The multitude spend half an hour verifying their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses; but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moment's loss of time, and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured {{two or three days}} in advance, everything is ready, you can go at once to bed. Some of those other people will have to drift around to two or three hotels, in the rain, before they find accommodations.|$|E

I had hoped that I should meet with you before you left California; but supposing that by that time you had reached <b>your</b> <b>destination,</b> or were, at least, far on your way, I yielded to the solicitations of my sister and made some excursions in California, intending then to follow you to Philadelphia and there to advertise for Mr. Craig, if he could not otherwise be found. However, by the rarest and most fortunate of chances, we have met thus early, and for this I can never be too devoutly thankful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] Mr. Fentolin declared. [...] "Well, I admit frankly {{the truth}} of what you say. Your--shall we say capture, was by way of being a {{gigantic}} fluke. My nephew's instructions simply were to travel down by the train to Harwich with you, to endeavour to make your acquaintance, to follow you on to <b>your</b> <b>destination,</b> and, if any chance to do so occurred, to relieve you of your pocket-book. That, however, I never ventured to expect. What really happened was, as you have yourself suggested, almost in the nature of a miracle. My nephew showed himself to be possessed of gifts which were a revelation to me. He not only succeeded in travelling with you by the special train, but after its wreck he was clever enough to bring you here, instead of delivering you over to the mercies of a village doctor. I really cannot find words to express my appreciation of my nephew's conduct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As to the laughter," [...] said Challenger, [...] "you {{will bear}} in mind that, like yourselves, I have not been exempt from the {{stimulating}} cerebral effects of the etheric poison. But as to the horror with which universal death appears to inspire you, I would {{put it to you}} that it is somewhat exaggerated. If you were sent to sea alone in an open boat to some unknown destination, your heart might well sink within you. The isolation, the uncertainty, would oppress you. But if your voyage were made in a goodly ship, which bore within it all your relations and your friends, you would feel that, however uncertain <b>your</b> <b>destination</b> might still remain, you would at least have one common and simultaneous experience which would hold you to the end in the same close communion. A lonely death may be terrible, but a universal one, as painless as this would appear to be, is not, in my judgment, a matter for apprehension. Indeed, I could sympathize with the person who took the view that the horror lay in the idea of surviving when all that is learned, famous, and exalted had passed away." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{manners of}} the Cornish of all ranks, {{down to the}} lowest, are remarkably {{distinguished}} by courtesy--a courtesy of that kind which is quite independent of artificial breeding, and which proceeds solely from natural motives of kindness and from an innate anxiety to please. Few of the people pass you without a salutation. Civil questions are always answered civilly. No propensity to jeer at strangers is exhibited--on the contrary, great solicitude is displayed to afford them any assistance that they may require; and displayed, moreover, without the slightest appearance of a mercenary motive. Thus, if you stop to ask your way, you are not merely directed for {{a mile or two}} on, and then told to ask again; but directed straight to the end of <b>your</b> <b>destination,</b> no matter how far off. Turnings to the right, and turnings to the left, short cuts across moors five miles away, churches that you must keep on this hand, and rocks that you must keep on that, are impressed upon your memory with the most laborious minuteness, and shouted after you over and over again {{as long as you are}} within hearing. If the utmost anxiety to give the utmost quantity of good advice could always avail against accident or forgetfulness, no traveller in Cornwall who asks his way as he goes, need ever lose himself.|$|E
