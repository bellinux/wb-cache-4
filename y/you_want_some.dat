500|$|Ringo Starr {{identified}} {{his initial}} inspiration for [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] as having come from Marc Bolan, the singer and guitarist with English glam rock band T. Rex. In a 2001 interview with Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer, Starr described Bolan as [...] "a dear friend {{who used to}} come into the office when I was running Apple Movies, a big office in town, and the hang-out for myself, Harry Nilsson and Keith Moon". Over dinner one evening at Starr's home outside London, Bolan had used the word [...] "boogaloo" [...] so often that it stuck in Starr's mind, after which the beat and melody for the song came to him overnight. When discussing the composition on VH1 Storytellers in May 1998, Starr explained: [...] " [...] was an energised guy. He used to speak: 'Back off boogaloo... ooh you, boogaloo.' 'Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>some</b> potatoes?' 'Ooh you, boogaloo!'" [...] Starr also recalled having to take the batteries out of his children's toys that night, in order to power a tape recorder and make a recording of the new song.|$|E

He brought it back, all gold--you remember, Mr. Walter, <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> silver to pay your cab. [With a certain contemptuous compassion] Here, let me see. You've got the wrong cheque.|$|R

60|$|NAPOLEON (dropping his rhetorical style). It's plain enough. <b>You</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> {{letters that}} belonged to me. You have spent the morning in {{stealing}} them--yes, stealing them, by highway robbery. And you have spent the afternoon in putting me in the wrong about them--in assuming that it was I who wanted to steal YOUR letters--in explaining that it all came about through my meanness and selfishness, and your goodness, your devotion, your self-sacrifice. That's English.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Percival, in {{your own}} solid English words, <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> {{thousands}} and I <b>wanted</b> <b>some</b> hundreds, {{and the only way}} of getting them was for you to raise the money for your own necessity (with a small margin beyond for my poor little hundreds) by the help of your wife. What did I tell you about your wife on our way to England?--and what did I tell you again when we had come here, and when I had seen for myself the sort of woman Miss Halcombe was?" ...|$|R

He's a {{powerful}} snorer, and that's one of the awful sounds. The other was the dripping of salt water; for <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>some,</b> and the girl got it in a leaky pail.
