There was no one in the room and he spent a happy half-hour among treasures of old reading and triumphs of old morocco. He had a great esteem for good literature, he held that it should have handsome covers. The daylight had begun to wane, but whenever, in the rich-looking dimness, he made out the glimmer of a well-gilded back, he took down the volume and carried it to one of the deep-set windows. He had just finished the inspection of a delightfully fragrant folio, and was about to carry it back to its niche, when he found himself face to face with Lady Demesne. He was sharply startled, for her tall slim figure, her preserved fairness, which looked white in the high brown room, and the air of serious intention with which she presented herself, all gave something spectral to her presence. He saw her countenance dimly light, however, and heard her say with the vague despair of her neutrality: “Are <b>you</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> books? I’m afraid they’re rather dull.” ...|$|R

50|$|According to oral tradition, {{the people}} of Ososo {{migrated}} from “Ogbe” in present day Benin City in the 17th century during the era of fierce and violent inter-tribal wars between Benin kingdom and its neighbours and due to general disenchantment with the harsh economic realities of their day. The migration took the people first to Idah in Kogi state. Not comfortable with the people there they moved on to Ajaokuta, there to Uname - Orugbe by the river Niger and finally to Idoani in ososo from where they expanded down from the rocks to the present location. The early settlers were attracted to Ososo because of its rocks, caves, temperate climate, springs and fertile lands. We can not rule out our affiliation with Kogi state when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> traditional chiefs' mode of dressing with the long red cap called oji and the name Tokura which is a title in Igala. The expansion of descendant family lineage brought about the present four clans that the town is now made up of.

If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> top ten in America, “I'm Into Something Good”, it was us. All Hermits. There was only a piano added on.

That got to number two. “Mrs. Brown You've Got a Lovely Daughter” got to number one. “I'm Henry the VIII”. Number one. “A Must to Avoid”. Number eight. “Listen People”. “Leaning on the Lamppost”. That's six in the top ten with Jimmy Page or anybody else not involved! Another seventy of the tracks on the albums is only the Hermits. I think I worked it out, and I think in only thirty percent of all the songs ever recorded the Hermits didn't do the backing, but the Hermits were always on the vocals doing the harmonies.

5000|$|Because of the Master Chief's {{large role}} in {{previous}} games, significant effort was expended on the Spartan units. Lead designer Dave Pottinger said the design team [...] "started out just accepting and embracing {{the fact that the}} Spartans have to be the coolest unit in the game. If they're not, it's not going to meet the Halo fans' expectations." [...] To position the Spartans as [...] "kingmakers" [...] in gameplay, the team gave them what it considered to be the [...] "coolest" [...] unit ability: hijacking enemy vehicles. The developers hoped players would become attached to individual Spartans in the campaign and gave each one an individual name; skirmish units were left nameless. The character design of the Spartans was meant to emphasize their relative inexperience and the setting of the game, which takes place decades before the events of the main trilogy. Devine commented on the Spartans' look:...We felt because it was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as experienced as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of a}} war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up.

A key rule for the casting team was [...] "no wankers allowed", as Featherstone put it.

40|$|Against {{the odds}} CUE: In The Gambia?s Kombo district, land-grabbing for {{settlement}} purposes is {{the order of}} the day. Yet one community there has gone against all the odds. With assistance and support from the Department of Forest Services, they have claimed their rights to their traditional forest, and resolved to preserve it for future generations. Two years ago the Jabang Kunda clan created the Falaa Community Forest Park, a protected area of about four square kilometres. They also established a management committee to enforce rules about how the forest could be used. Now the entire clan, young and old, men and women, are involved in management and conservation of the park, and those who break the rules are fined. Ismaila Senghore spoke to Momodou Bojang, the head of the management committee, about why the clan had decided to claim their rights, and how they are both using the forest and protecting it for the future. IN:		?We are right here in ? OUT:		? benefit of our future generation. DUR?N	 4 ? 33 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ismaila Senghore reporting from The Gambia. Transcript Senghore	We are right here in the Falaa Community Forest Park, and it is situated just about a kilometre or so in the outskirts of the village of Jamburr, towards the west. This place, just the air that you breathe in here, and the trees that you see around, and of course the singing birds will tell you it is a natural forest that really needs preservation. I {{think this is one of}} the reasons that might have lead the Jabang Kunda clan to conserve this forest of theirs. But as we have Mr. Momodou Bojang, who is the head of the management team here, I would like to ask him some of the reasons that lead the clan to conserve this forest. Mr. Bojang. Bojang	[Vernac. ] We were greatly inspired to take up this community forest initiative, because if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>our</b> environment, the natural forest is dying out completely, and we should try to conserve that little remaining natural forest that we have, at least for the benefit of our future children. That being the case, this has motivated us to do all that we can to make sure that natural things in the forest, such as animals, which our forefathers were seeing, and ourselves are seeing, to make sure that they still remain in the forest for the benefit of our children in the future. Senghore	What conservation and management practices do you carry out on the forest? Bojang	[Vernac. ] First of all, we make all effort to make sure that the forest is being protected against fire by making a firebelt around the forest. Senghore	How do you ensure that whatever you extract from the forest, you replace adequately, to ensure the regeneration and conservation of the forest? Bojang	[Vernac. ] After cutting some trees we replace them with beneficial trees such as malaina, mahogany and other trees, to replace them in the forest. Senghore	What are the resources that you expect this forest can generate when it is in full operation? Bojang	[Vernac] In the long run, if the forest is well developed in the future, when all animals and birds, some tree species and wild fruits will be available in the forest, and that can encourage eco-tourism in the area, and in our community in particular. Senghore	Now what kind of support have you received from either government, or from whatever source it might have come from? Bojang	[Vernac. ] The Department of Forestry do assist us in bringing seedlings, malaina seedlings, cashew-nut seedlings and also in providing us with some skills and techniques in how to bring up a community forest, during the process. Senghore	How far do you think you reserve the rights of ownership of your forest, and how does that right affect your inspiration in your management activities? Bojang	[Vernac. ] With the concept of community forest, the land belongs to the community of Jamburr, and more so to our clan, and this has been testified by our surrounding people, all confirm that this land belongs to us. It has been documented by the Department of Forestry Services that the land belongs to us as a community forest. This has encouraged us as we are now assured of the total ownership of the land, and we now embark on developing the land to make it a successful community forest. Senghore	Finally Mr. Bojang, do you think others would like to emulate your example because of your success? Bojang	The only advice I would have for the entire country and the community at large is, let everyone endeavour to at least make sure that we conserve the little remaining forest that we have in our environment, for the benefit of our future generation. End of track. In The Gambia?s Kombo district land-grabbing for settlement is the norm. However, one community has stood against this, asserting their traditional rights to their forest, and carrying out extensive conservation work to preserve it for future generations...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a case study of}} a project {{recently}} launched by the Danish newspaper JydskeVestkysten. On the 8 th of January 2008 the paper started a web based project with participatory journalism encouraging citizens to register as ‘citizen journalists’ the purpose being creating brand loyalty and increased income through advertising. The citizen journalists upload articles and pictures directly on the public and official website jv. dk. Then professional journalists select and to some extend edit some of the articles and then publish them in the newspaper JydskeVestkysten. We found it interesting to investigate a project in progress and wanted to do our study with a goal of ending up with different guidelines for improving the project of civic journalism. First we talked with the people involved in the project that is both journalist and the managing editor and the executive editor. In their opinion – how can civic journalism contribute to conventional news coverage, what was the ambition/reason behind the project and does it work so far? They explained that it was intended to establish a place for the papers readers to express themselves freely about anything in any way. During this first phase they have deliberately lowered their quality standards to get as many as possible to register – when the citizen could see that their work were acknowledged and rewarded because it got elected to be published in print is considered a great factor of motivation. The end product both online and on print was marred by many grammatical errors, strange and even unintelligible stories the reason primarily being that no resources had been spend on the project. It was up to each local editor to find the means necessary for the project to work. There was also an economic reason for them launching the project – more unique users equal more money from advertisers. We then decided to have a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the product itself to determine what they write about, what is selected to the newspaper, what is not and why? We <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and analysed articles from one week and ended up with 196 online and uncensored articles and 120 from the newspaper. In the end we wanted to investigate whether or not the ideology and ambition behind the project match the real thing. First we needed to categorise the articles to understand about what and how the civic journalists write. What we concluded from this was that the more an article looked like conventional journalism the more likely it was to be ‘upgraded’ to the printed version. So even if the citizen journalists are encouraged to write about anything in any way, it is not the case when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the outcome. <b>Our</b> investigation enabled us to provide JydskeVestkysten with several recommendations including more educated recourses, demand more information about each citizen registering, more categories for articles online, courses for the registered citizens and a policy for the project to streamline the outcome...|$|R
