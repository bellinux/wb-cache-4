Friedman said the governmental speech-monitoring should go beyond those who actually advocate violence, and [...] include also those whom former State Department spokesperson Jamie Rubin calls [...] "excuse makers". In his July 22 column, Friedman wrote against the [...] "excuses" [...] made by terrorists or apologists who blame their actions on third-party influences or pressures. [...] "After every major terrorist incident, the excuse makers come out to tell us ... why the terrorists acted. These excuse makers are just one notch less despicable than the terrorists and also deserve to be exposed. When <b>you</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open society like London, where anyone with a grievance can publish an article, run for office or start a political movement, the notion that blowing up a busload of innocent civilians in response to Iraq is somehow [...] "understandable" [...] is outrageous. [...] "It erases the distinction between legitimate dissent and terrorism" [...] Mr. Rubin said, [...] "and an open society needs to maintain a clear wall between them." [...] As part of their response to this column, the editors at FAIR encouraged their readers to contact Friedman and inform him that [...] "opponents of the Iraq War do not deserve to be on a government blacklist-even if they oppose the war because they believe it encourages terrorism".|$|E

Meanwhile, stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in your own homes.Remember there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you could be exposing yourselves to greater danger. If you leave, you may find yourself without food, without water, without accommodation and without protection. Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.Make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished. If mains water is available, this can be used for fire-fighting.

Use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes. Water means life. Don't waste it.Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for fourteen days or more.
