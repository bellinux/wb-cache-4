[...] Initially published quarterly, it was released in the months of December, March, June, and September. The newspaper was intended to replace a myriad of newsletters from individuals schools and departments in the university. An editorial in the first issue described its initial intended purpose as one that would [...] "keep <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> the 'times' at Pitt" [...] - from the changing face of the campus to the activities of the alumni, from the antics of the students to the deeper emotional involvements of education today." [...] By the 1970s, the University Times was being published bi-weekly, and by 1979, faced controversy when the university planned to end its publication because of [...] "apparent dissatisfaction about controversial stories" [...] when the paper ran articles about faculty disagreements with the administration and an article about a dispute between two deans. A unanimous 42-0 vote from the university faculty assembly requested the university rescind its plan to end the paper. The paper again faced controversy over the alleged censorship of a 1994 story on the first gay wedding to occur in the university's Heinz Memorial Chapel. However, Leon Haley, then publisher of the newspaper, defended the decision in saying that it was [...] "not university policy to write stories about events at Heinz Chapel. These events are personal and private." [...] Ken Hall, one of the men married in the ceremony, also stated that he [...] "didn't want any notoriety or controversy to mar the occasion." ...|$|E

40|$|What you've {{asked me}} to talk about today is {{basically}} what can libraries do with all the stuff they have and continue to get. Where do we put it all; {{what do we do with}} it? As we know, libraries have three core functions: collecting, organizing and preserving the key documents of the human enterprise. And, with apologies to Saint Paul, the greatest of these is preservation. For without preservation neither of the first two ultimately matter. My assignment this morning is to bring <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> one specific aspect of the preservation function, library repositories, and indeed, library repository developments in the US. The plan for this morning's presentation is the following: after a brief background review to give us a context for American developments we will examine first the various kinds of print repositories and then the various initiatives for electronic repositories. Because other presentations at this conference deal with electronic repositories, the main focus today will be on U. S. print repositories...|$|E

40|$|For all {{practical}} purposes, {{research in this}} country {{on the problem of}} bird hazards to aircraft began in 1960 with the crash of an Electra turboprop that carried 62 people to their deaths and was attributed to ingestion of starlings into the engines. In this paper I intend to review the problem and present some of the answers found by investigators in this country and, to lesser extent, abroad. The discussion will be roughly divided into two parts: 1) what: causes the problem, when, and where; and 2) what has been and is being done at airfields to reduce it. Dr. Seubert of the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center described the problem in Europe at this conference 3 years ago, so I will try to bring <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> the problem here. We at the Denver Wildlife Research Center have been actively engaged in few specific studies at airfields. Although we mailed a questionnaire to airport managers at 190 installations in the 22 mainland states west of the Mississippi River in 1961 and made follow-up personal visits to 25 commercial and military airfields at seasons of the year when most problems had reportedly occurred, it appeared that none would last long enough for us to undertake studies. Since then we have attempted primarily to solve crop depredation, feed lot, and roost problems with the idea that knowledge obtained from them could be adapted and applied to bird hazard problems as they arose at airfields...|$|E
40|$|In {{bringing}} <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> DOE's geothermal R and D programs, {{they are}} going to emphasize first those elements that may be of special interest to a reservoir engineering audience, because the activities in support of an improved understanding of hydrothermal reservoirs deserve attention. Reservoir definition, brine injection, and reservoir stimulation technologies are major elements of the Hydrothermal Research Program, and in total they account for nearly 50 % of the fiscal year (FY) 1985 hydrothermal research budget. These elements fall into the essential R and D category; that is, while some basic technologies have been borrowed from the petroleum industry for geothermal service, they are often ill-suited to geothermal requirements, and cannot be used without significant technological innovations. Into this category fall the current reservoir technology, brine injection, and reservoir stimulation projects that are listed in Table 1. The reservoir technology projects include: (1) development of methods for characterizing and mapping reservoir parameters, processes, and spatial dimensions; (2) development of methods to predict and monitor reservoir changes from fluid extraction; (3) evaluation of existing methods and development of new methods for predicting the location and mapping faults and fractures in geothermal reservoirs; and (4) testing of new analysis techniques using field case studies. Brine injection projects include: (1) development of physical and mathematical models to determine the behavior of geothermal reservoirs during injection; (2) tracer testing to determine rapid flow paths between wells; and (3) analysis of pressure responses in the field to injection into one or more wells...|$|E
40|$|Greetings from Ann Arbor, where {{philosophy}} is thriving! I {{hope you have}} had a restful summer. The academic year 2004 - 2005 was among the most eventful in the Philosophy Department’s recent history, and I would like to bring <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>date</b> <b>on</b> some of the more noteworthy developments. Faculty News: This has been a year of accomplishment and a year of change for our faculty. Let’s begin with the accomplishments. Michigan remains among the strongest Philosophy Departments anywhere, and the intellectual world recognizes it. Larry Sklar has been elected president of the Philosophy of Science Association (he assumes the position in 2006). Though only a handful of the best philosophers of science ever get to hold this prestigious office, Larry’s election came as no surprise {{to those of us who}} know how critical his work has been in setting the agenda for the philosophy of physics in our day. Peter Railton, whose many seminal contributions to moral philosophy, the philosophy of science and epistemology make him one of the most versatile thinkers around, was one of only four philosophers elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences this past year. He is the sixth member of the Department to receive this exceptionally rare and high honor. Allan Gibbard was elected to the American Philosophical Society. Founded by Ben Franklin in 1743, this was the Nation’s first learned society, and it remains among its most prestigious. Despite its name, the APS has traditionally been very stingy when it comes to admitting philosophers: only sixteen have been elected to its ranks since 1975, and all are household names (in philosophers ’ households, anyhow). This well-deserved honor indicates the hig...|$|E
