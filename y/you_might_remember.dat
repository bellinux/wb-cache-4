500|$|Backstage at SNL, Hartman {{was called}} [...] "the Glue", a name coined by Adam Sandler, {{according}} to Jay Mohr's book Gasping for Airtime. However, {{according to a}} biography on Hartman's life entitled <b>You</b> <b>Might</b> <b>Remember</b> Me: The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas, author and {{staff writer for the}} Chicago Sun-Times, the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman's frequent on-screen collaborator Jan Hooks. Hartman often helped other cast members. For example, he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright. SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name: [...] "He kind of held the show together. He gave to everybody and demanded very little. He was very low-maintenance." [...] Michaels also added that Hartman was [...] "the least appreciated" [...] cast member by commentators outside the show, and praised his ability [...] "to do five or six parts in a show where you're playing support or you're doing remarkable character work". Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989, sharing the award with the show's other writers. He was nominated in the same category in 1987, and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E

[...] "If he {{makes you feel like}} a million dollar bill," [...] Whitney sings on the chorus, 'Say oh-oh-oh, say oh-oh-oh'. The Voice is deeper and raspier than <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember,</b> but she's still capable of going for a money note. 'Million Dollar Bill' won't be storming any barns in a hurry, but it's a classy, dignified and thoroughly likeable comeback effort. Whitney, it's good to have you back." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com gave a mixed review saying, [...] "The good news on [...] "Million Dollar Bill" [...] is the performance is undeniably the Whitney Houston we all know. [...] The down side is it's all almost too familiar. The arrangement courtesy producer Swizz Beatz is very old school R [...] Alicia Keys has written a song that fits very well with her tradition of [...] "old soul" [...] songs, but Whitney Houston has failed to give it a new twist that would successfully make the old stunningly new again.". He also gave the song 3.5 stars out of five.|$|E

[...] BBC Music rated the song three our of five stars, and wrote: [...] "The chorus is catchy and memorable, so you'll be humming that, but <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>remember</b> how the verses go ...

50|$|Source {{confusion}} or unconscious transference, {{involves the}} misattribution {{of the source}} of a memory. For instance, an individual may recall seeing an event in person when in reality they only witnessed the event on television. Ultimately, the individual has an inability to remember the source of information in which the content and the source become dissociated. This may be more likely for more distant memories, such as childhood memories. In more severe cases of source confusion, you can take fictional stories you heard from when you were younger and assimilated these stories being your childhood. For example, say your father told you stories about his life {{when he was a child}} every night before you went to sleep when you were a child. When you grow up, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> mistakenly <b>remember</b> these stories your dad told you as your own and integrate them into your childhood memories.|$|R

[...] He brought back his eyes to her face. [...] "And the very day before they were going to let me out."

I brought you chiefly {{to look at that}} Madonna, believing that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> other Madonnas, unlike her; and might think it desirable to consider wherein the difference lay:--other Madonnas not by Sir Joshua, who painted Madonnas but seldom. Who perhaps, if truth must be told, painted them never: for surely this dearest pet of an English girl, with the little curl of lovely hair under her ear, is not one.|$|E
60|$|I {{have now}} {{finished}} this imperfect account. It is but {{an apology for}} not having brought the process itself before you. I have done the best I could under the circumstances; and I know your kindness well, for if I were not aware that I might trust to it, I would not appear here so often as I have done. The gradual loss of memory and of my other faculties is making itself painfully evident to me, and requires, every time I appear before you, the continued remembrance of your kindness to enable me to get through my task. If I should happen to go on too long, or should fail in doing what <b>you</b> <b>might</b> desire, <b>remember</b> it is yourselves who are chargeable, by wishing me to remain. I have desired to retire, as I think every man ought to do before his faculties become impaired; but I must confess that the affection I have for this place, {{and for those who}} frequent this place, is such, that I hardly know when the proper time has arrived.|$|R

5000|$|... blue cathedral has {{received}} a positive response from critics. Tim Smith of The Baltimore Sun lauded, [...] "The music seems to emit and reflect light as it moves from stillness to exuberance and back again, tapering off ethereally. If you didn't know the personal story behind it, the music could still touch your heart; when you do know that story, it can touch your soul." [...] David Patrick Stearns of the The Philadelphia Inquirer also praised the piece, writing: Listeners don't {{need to know that}} blue cathedral was written as a memorial for Higdon's deceased brother: You're so enveloped by the grief, hope and intuitive musical invention welling up through the rich orchestration that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>remember</b> many specific details about the music from one hearing to the next. I've heard it a lot, and though it's hardly dense or difficult, every encounter feels like a new one. Travis Rivers of The Spokesman-Review similarly remarked: blue cathedral produced an otherworldly atmosphere of floating sound, yet the work never seemed directionless. The work opened with very soft bell-like sounds and quiet solos beautifully played by flutist Bruce Bodden and clarinetist Chip Phillips. As the work gained intensity many of the orchestra principal players also joined with impressive solos. At the height of wave of sound, the celestial quiet of the beginning returned, accompanied with muted strings and the sound of softly ringing Chinese Reflex Bells and the eerie sound of tuned water-filled glasses being rubbed along their rims. The work was wonderfully effective besides being friendly to the ear.|$|R

They 're early people, I 'm glad to say"; {{and his eyes}} seemed to muse over the proper fold for these damp sheep. [...] "Are you Oxford men, by any chance?" [...] he asked, as if that might throw some light upon the matter. [...] "Of Mary's? Really! I'm of Paul's myself. Ladyman--Billington Ladyman; <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> my {{youngest}} brother. I {{could give you a}} room here if you could manage without sheets.

6000|$|... "As it well might, Doctor, not but I daresay that's true. Anyhow, if {{the other}} is the true thing, and you should all see old England again with some of the stuff in that dead-house, I've got three nieces living down at home whom <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember.</b> Don't say nothing of what I told you to the Captain till this night's game is played, seeing that it might upset him, and he'll need to keep cool up to ten o'clock, and {{afterwards}} too, perhaps. Only if we shouldn't meet again, say that Samuel Quick sent him his duty and God's blessing. And the same on yourself, Doctor, and your son, too. And now here comes the Professor, so good-bye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But for me, of course, at the time, the {{separation}} was terrible. Each morning, I read with feverish interest {{the reports of}} your health, and longed, day after day, to hear of some distinct improvement. And {{yet at the same}} time, I was terrified at every approach to complete convalescence: I feared that if you got better at all, <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> too quick, and that then the sudden rush of recollection might kill you or upset your reason. But by-and-by, it became clear to me you could remember nothing of the actual shot itself. And I saw plainly why. It was the firing of the pistol that obliterated, as it were, every trace of your past life in your disorganised brain. And it obliterated ITSELF too. Your new life began just one moment later, with the Picture of the dead man stretched before you in his blood on the floor, and a figure in the background disappearing through the window." ...|$|E

6000|$|After a pause {{he turned}} to the angry Cissy, {{standing}} by the piano, radiant with glowing cheeks and flashing eyes, and said slowly, [...] "I reckon you gave the parson as good as he sent. It kinder settles a man to hear the frozen truth about himself sometimes, and you've helped old Shadbelly considerably on the way towards salvation. But he was right about one thing, Miss Trixit. The house IS {{in the hands of the}} law. I'm representing it as deputy sheriff. Mebbe <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> me--Jake Poole--when your father was addressing the last Citizen's meeting, sittin' next to him on the platform--I'M in possession. It isn't a job I'm hankerin' much arter; I'd a lief rather hunt hoss thieves or track down road agents than this kind o' fancy, underhand work. So you'll excuse me, miss, if I ain't got the style." [...] He paused, rubbed his chin thoughtfully, and then said slowly and with great deliberation: [...] "Ef there's any little thing here, miss,--any keepsakes or such trifles ez you keer for in partickler, things you wouldn't like strangers to have,--you just make a little pile of 'em and drop 'em down somewhere outside the back door. There ain't no inventory taken nor sealin' up of anythin' done just yet, though I have to see there ain't anythin' disturbed. But I kalkilate to walk out on that veranda for a spell and look at the landscape." [...] He paused again, and said, with a sigh of satisfaction, [...] "It's a mighty pooty view out thar; it just takes me every time." ...|$|E
6000|$|But farther, you remember, I hope--for I {{said it in}} a {{way that}} I thought would shock you a little, that <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>remember</b> it--my statement, that art had never done more than this, never more than given the {{likeness}} of a noble human being. Not only so, but it very seldom does so much as this, and the best pictures that exist of the great schools are all portraits, or groups of portraits, often of very simple and nowise noble persons. You may have much more brilliant and impressive qualities in imaginative pictures; you may have figures scattered like clouds, or garlanded like flowers; you may have light and shade as of a tempest, and colour, as of the rainbow; but all that is child's play to the great men, though it is astonishment to us. Their real strength is tried to the utmost, and as far as I know, it is never elsewhere brought out so thoroughly, as in painting one man or woman, and the soul that was in them; nor that always the highest soul, but often only a thwarted one that was capable of height; or perhaps not even that, but faultful and poor, yet seen through, to the poor best of it, by the masterful sight. So that in order to put before you in your Standard series the best art possible, I am obliged, even from the very strongest men, to take the portraits, before I take the idealism. Nay, whatever is best in the great compositions themselves has depended on portraiture; and the study necessary to enable you to understand invention will also convince you that the mind of man never invented a greater thing than the form of man, animated by faithful life. Every attempt to refine or exalt such healthy humanity has weakened or caricatured it; or else consists only in giving it, to please our fancy, the wings of birds, or the eyes of antelopes. Whatever is truly great in either Greek or Christian art, is also restrictedly human; and even the raptures of the redeemed souls who enter [...] "celestemente ballando,"[188] the gate of Angelico's Paradise, were seen first in the terrestrial, yet most pure, mirth of Florentine maidens.|$|E
