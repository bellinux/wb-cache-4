60|$|DORA. So <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> you old dears. But {{you know}} better. Bobby came to me: I didnt come to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Granser, {{what for}} do <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> {{so much what}} nobody knows?" [...] he asked. [...] "Scarlet ain't anything, but red is red. Why don't you say red, then?" ...|$|E
60|$|DUCHESS OF BERWICK. [Affectionately.] My dear one! <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> {{the right}} thing. Mr. Hopper! James! Agatha {{has told me}} everything. How cleverly you have both kept your secret.|$|E
6000|$|... "Course she does; ain't <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> you'll {{remember}} us in your will, because {{father was}} your favorite nephew, and all that? I'll {{tell you a}} secret, if you won't let Polly know I spoke first. You'll find it out to-night, for you 'd see Van and she were sweethearts in a minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{have often}} noticed,' <b>you</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying.</b> The story {{has nothing to}} do with you. Obliterate yourself. I see that will be your stiffest job.|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{the voices}} of the air! Oh, from no one else; I never let other people speak of <b>you.</b> They <b>always</b> <b>say</b> you're 'charming,' and that's so flat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you would say so," [...] Myra said indignantly. [...] "Whatever you do <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> it is luck, as if luck could do everything. I have no {{patience}} with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> my dear. It {{is of no}} use {{to renew}} it all, but I wish you would control yourself. Now, Mary, call Blanche, and you and Ethel take your arithmetic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{of course}} not. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> what you mean, and you don't change. That {{is what is}} so {{beautiful}} in you. You can't understand a nature that is one thing to-day and another thing to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I have a {{right that}} you should say that--I {{have a right}} that <b>you</b> should <b>always</b> <b>say</b> it. I think he has behaved very foolishly, but I don't blame him----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that depends}} on its subject. To tell the truth, I was {{thinking}} that these lights resembled a little your conversation; all the wondrous things <b>you</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> or telling us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never thought}} that,' said Dolores. 'I {{think you have}} some {{different}} prayers from mine. Old nurse taught me long ago. I wish <b>you</b> would <b>always</b> <b>say</b> yours with me. You make them nicer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, papa, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> Mr. Wakem {{has brought}} Philip {{up like a}} girl; how came you to think you should get any {{business}} knowledge out of him? Those abrupt questions sounded rather oddly. Philip thought them queer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> {{those were}} horrid days in La Vend√©e; {{that you had}} nothing to eat, and no bed to sleep in, nor shoes to your feet; and that you and father couldn't get married for ever so long, because of the wars?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, would you--WOULD you? Oh, {{how good}} you always are, Pen! And <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> what you think. I wish there was some one coming to see you too. That's all that I don't like about it. Perhaps----He was telling about his friend there in Texas----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I dare say; that's what <b>you</b> men <b>always</b> <b>say.</b> But if he don't {{look out}} he'll find missus'll {{be too much}} for him. What'd he do if she were to go away from him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will come here often, Monsieur Kennedy. I am sure that I shall like you very much, and I think that <b>you</b> would <b>always</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> thought, and tell me the real truth about things." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{opens to}} Lena and Yulia {{speaking}} in Russian, which translated means [...] "Hello / Hello / Can {{you see the}} wind? / So what? / Just look {{out of the window}} / So what? / There was sun yesterday / So what? / Why are <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> the same thing? / I am an answering machine". The song then begins, featuring a prominent synthesizer beat throughout the duration of the song, with lyrics regarding to events played down to seem like [...] The chorus features repetition of the phrase [...] "show me love".|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, mother, it's sure {{good to hear}} you," [...] said Belding. She always cheered him, and now {{he grasped}} at straws. [...] "I'm not myself these days, don't mistake that. Tell us what you think. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> you feel things when you really don't know them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> {{my darling}} child; {{but you always}} go away and leave me. This is a dream, no doubt like all the rest; but oh, it seems very very real! You never wept before, {{although}} you often smiled. Surely {{this is the best}} and brightest dream I ever had!" ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned quickly. [...] "Will, <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> my {{troubles}} are imaginary. Why can't you be scientific? I've {{been reading}} {{an article about}} these new nerve-specialists, and they claim that lots of 'imaginary' ailments, yes, and lots of real pain, too, are what they call psychoses, and they order a change in a woman's way of living so she can get on a higher plane----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> that Valeria H. Montague's {{stories are}} silly and not true to life, {{so that is}} no argument," [...] {{retorted}} Felicity, who knew more about cooking than about history, and evidently imagined that the Lady Jane Gray was one of Valeria's titled heroines.|$|R
5000|$|Carton's book No {{is a love}} word {{offers a}} seven-part formula for {{learning}} the three No's you should never say to children, and the four No's <b>you</b> should <b>always</b> <b>say.</b> It teaches parents to get the [...] "No"-how, {{and learn how to}} say it fairly, firmly, calmly and consistently.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{time for}} you to answer now,' the Queen said, looking at her watch: 'open your mouth a LITTLE wider when <b>you</b> speak, and <b>always</b> <b>say</b> [...] "your Majesty."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What sweet things <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> to me!" [...] she murmured. [...] "But don't you see, Bartley, that I didn't think {{enough of}} him? That's what baby {{seems to have}} come to teach me." [...] She pulled a little away on the pillow, so as to fix him more earnestly with her eyes. [...] "If baby should behave so to you when she grew up, I should hate her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE (coming at {{him again}} {{on her way back}} to her work). Yes, you do: you IMITATE him. Why do you tuck your {{umbrella}} under your left arm instead of carrying it in your hand like anyone else? Why do you walk with your chin stuck out before you, hurrying along with that eager look in your eyes--you, who never get up before half past nine in the morning? Why do you say [...] "knoaledge" [...] in church, though <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> [...] "knolledge" [...] in private conversation! Bah! do you think I don't know? (She goes back to the typewriter.) Here, come and set about your work: we've wasted enough time for one morning. Here's a copy of the diary for to-day. (She hands him a memorandum.) ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the museums}} {{you will find}} acres of the most strange and {{fascinating}} things; but all museums are fascinating, and they do so tire your eyes, and break your back, and burn out your vitalities with their consuming interest. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> you will never go again, but you do go. The palaces of the rich, in Melbourne, are much like the palaces of the rich in America, and the life in them is the same; but there the resemblance ends. The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large, and not often beautiful, but in the Melbourne case the grounds are often ducally spacious, and the climate and the gardeners together make them as beautiful as a dream. It is said {{that some of the}} country seats have grounds--domains--about them which rival in charm and magnitude those which surround the country mansion of an English lord; but I was not out in the country; I had my hands full in town.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or if {{questioned}} in any way,--say that I did it. Tell the exact truth. <b>You</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> that nothing but truth ever serves. Let the truth serve now. I shall not blench. Your saying {{it all in}} the House of Lords won't wound me half so much as your looking at me as you did just now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; <b>you</b> know he <b>always</b> <b>says</b> {{he is our}} Mentor. And I wish {{he would}} change into a goddess with a helmet and a shield, with an ugly face, and go off in a cloud. Do you think he will, Estelle?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's how I {{always think}} of her! I say I've known her ever since I used to go and stop at their place when I was at school, and I know {{exactly the sort of}} things that put her back up. She's a what-d'you-call-it. I mean to say, one of the old school, don't you know. And you're so dashed impulsive, old girl. You know you are! <b>You</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying</b> things that come into your head." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to," [...] said my uncle. [...] "But {{why do you}} try {{and hide}} your taste under these mere formalities in frames? Why do <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> 'I pass' {{in the game of}} decoration? Better a mess of green amateurs and love therewith, than the richest autotypes and dull complacency. Have what you like. There {{is no such thing as}} {{absolute}} beauty. That is the Magna Charta of the world of art. What is beautiful to me is not beautiful to another man, in art as in women. But take care to get the art that fits you. Frankly, that 'Love and Death' suits you, Bagshot, about as much as a purple toga would. Orchardson is in your style. I tell you that the greengrocer who buys an original oil painting for sixteen shillings with frame complete is far nearer artistic salvation than the patron of the popular autotype. Surely you will wake up presently, Bagshot, and wonder what you have been about.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it's not that," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{know it is}} ridiculous, Chris, I know it, but {{the doubt}} will arise. I cannot help it. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>say</b> I am so sanely rooted to the earth and reality and all that, but--perhaps it's superstition, I don't know--but the whole occurrence, the {{messages}} of Planchette, the possibility of my father's hand, I know not how, reaching, out to Ban's rein and hurling him and you to death, the correspondence between my father's statement that he has twice attempted your life {{and the fact that}} in the last two days your life has twice been endangered by horses--my father was a great horseman--all this, I say, causes the doubt to arise in my mind. What if there be something in it? I am not so sure. Science may be too dogmatic in its denial of the unseen. The forces of the unseen, of the spirit, may well be too subtle, too sublimated, for science to lay hold of, and recognize, and formulate. Don't you see, Chris, that there is rationality in the very doubt? It may be a very small doubt--oh, so small; but I love you too much to run even that slight risk. Besides, I am a woman, and that should in itself fully account for my predisposition toward superstition.|$|E

5000|$|Knutsen and Morris, the {{two players}} who {{combined}} for the fatal slapshot, expressed remorse following Cecil's death. Morris, who deflected the puck, explained, [...] "You try to say, 'It {{happens all the}} time,' but you can't. I don't {{know how many times}} pucks get deflected over the glass, but it doesn't make it any better. <b>You</b> can <b>always</b> <b>say,</b> 'It's not my fault,' but <b>you</b> <b>always</b> feel like it is, a little." [...] Knutsen, who was given the option of sitting out the next game by Blue Jackets coach Dave King but chose to play, told reporters, [...] "I think about it all the time. It was a terrible accident, and I cannot get it off my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Knightley {{shook his}} head at her. Her father fondly replied, [...] "Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for {{whatever}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>always</b> comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You've got me,' she said. 'Why {{should you}} NEED others? Why must you {{force people to}} agree with you? Why can't you be single by yourself, as <b>you</b> are <b>always</b> <b>saying?</b> <b>You</b> try to bully Gerald--as you tried to bully Hermione. You must learn to be alone. And it's so horrid of you. You've got me. And yet you want to force other people to love you as well. You do try to bully them to love you. And even then, you don't want their love.' ...|$|R
