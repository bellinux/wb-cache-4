It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, the {{building}} became vacant, {{and was given}} to Prince Edward, Prince of Wales, by his father, King George V. The king had originally expressed surprise at Edward's request asking him [...] "What could <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> want that queer old place for? Those damn weekends I suppose", but then smiled and gave his permission. Edward's previous residence had been York House, part of St. James's Palace in London, which he had thought [...] "more an office than a home." [...] He would later write that he [...] "created a home at the fort just as my father and grandfather had created one at Sandringham... here I spent some of the happiest days of my life." ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 November 2008, {{marking the}} 90th {{anniversary of the}} end of the First World War, {{together}} with Harry Patch and Bill Stone, Allingham laid a commemorative wreath for the Act of Remembrance at The Cenotaph in London. Allingham was invested as a Scout on 18 November 2008, 100 years after he first joined as a youth. He said he was only able to spend six weeks with his local group as a boy. Allingham celebrated his 113th birthday on , at an event hosted by the Royal Navy. He received a signed birthday card from First Sea Lord Sir Jonathon Band and saw a Mark 8 Royal Navy Lynx flying overhead while he was sitting outside in his wheelchair. When asked the secret of his long life, Allingham said, [...] "I don't know, but I would say, be as good as <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> can." ...|$|E
500|$|Spotnitz wanted [...] "Deadalive" [...] {{to open in}} a {{way that}} would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E
500|$|As {{reported}} in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the première (and only performance to date) on 15 November 1969 of Stockhausen's work Fresco for four orchestral groups (playing in four different locations) {{was the scene of}} a scandal. The rehearsals were already marked by objections from the orchestral musicians questioning such directions as [...] "glissandos no faster than one octave per minute" [...] and others phoning the artists union to clarify whether they really had to perform the Stockhausen work as part of the orchestra. In the backstage warm-up room at the premiere a hand-lettered sign could be seen saying: [...] "We're playing, otherwise we would be [...] ". During the première the parts on some music stands suddenly were replaced by placards reading things like [...] "Stockhausen-Zoo. Please don't feed", that someone had planted. Some musicians, fed up with the monkeyshines, left after an hour, though the performance was planned for four to five hours. Stockhausen fans protested, while Stockhausen foes were needling the musicians asking: [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> participate in such crap?" [...] ("Wie könnt ihr bloß so eine Scheiße machen!"). At one point someone managed to switch off the stand lights, leaving the musicians in the dark. After 260 minutes the performance ended with nobody participating any more [...]|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a fictional education film called Lava and You, which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film {{was inspired by}} actual [...] "Duck and Cover" [...] films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls {{in the case of}} a nuclear weapon attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the Vietnam War, the military conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. Patrick Duffy, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows Dallas and Step by Step, appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: [...] "He's just super bland. Like, how could <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> be a fan of Patrick Duffy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rathbun's 1992 arrest {{caught the}} {{attention}} of her friend Donald Abrams, clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, and a physician at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH). He was in Amsterdam attending an AIDS conference when he learned of Rathbun's arrest by way of CNN. [...] Rick Doblin of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies read about Rathbun's arrest in the newspaper. [...] He {{sent a letter to the}} AIDS program at SFGH proposing that [...] "Brownie Mary's institution" [...] should consider conducting clinical trials of cannabis on the wasting syndrome in AIDS patients. Inspired by Rathbun's arrest, Abrams and Doblin collaborated to develop a protocol to test the effects of cannabis on appetite and body weight. Five years later, after two of their proposed studies were rejected by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), their third research protocol, [...] "Short-Term Effects of Cannabinoids in Patients with HIV-1 Infection", was finally approved in 1997. [...] The study was funded with $978,000 from the National Institutes of Health with cannabis supplied by NIDA., DEA. : [...] "The results of that study were extremely promising and I think very surprising to NIDA in that we, one of the common concerns that NIDA had put forth was that we know that marijuana hurts the immune system, how could <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> talk about using marijuana with people who are immuno-compromised? [...] And what Dr. Abrams found is that marijuana did not hurt the immune system, did not increase viral load, did not negatively interact with the protease inhibitors and actually did facilitate, increase caloric intake as well as weight gain, and also oral THC was included in this study as well as a placebo." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the period}} to follow, {{in spite of}} his preoccupations but {{especially}} after he had begun to overcome them, Verdi had kept in touch with the librettist.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Keys stated that she [...] "eliminated all of the boundaries and all the limitations, {{so that you can}} feel your freedom and express your freedom in every way <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> can". The Element of Freedom was scheduled to be released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a couple of more things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason. In {{an interview}} with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, she stated that it [...] "seems unfair to have to rush these songs that were still coming and not allow them to be the best songs they could be. It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E
2500|$|Robert Cooke of Drowned in Sound {{was also}} {{impressed}} and awarded {{a score of}} eight out of ten, despite stating it [...] "falls short of the dizzying intensity of its masterpiece of a predecessor." [...] He praised frontman Scott Hutchison in particular, describing his performance as still having the [...] "same tremble in the voice, the same elegance in the guitar tone, the same march of the Military Tattoo in the rhythm – but a renewed purpose". Free music magazine, The Fly, awarded the album four ½ out of five stars. Iain Moffat claimed that Scott Hutchison {{has one of the}} [...] "most underrated voices in rock" [...] as well as praising the [...] "lyrical sharpness" [...] of the album. He summarised his review by adding, [...] "what more could <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> want from Frightened Rabbit’s third album? They’re hurling themselves fearlessly at the bright lights, and coming back all the stronger for it." [...] Dave Simpson of The Guardian praised the album's [...] "sharp" [...] songwriting, stating, [...] "most of their songs – with themes of escape, freedom and reinvention – have huge impassioned choruses that are made to be shouted from the nearest available mountain". Awarding four stars, he also added, [...] "The Rabbit are a band overdue a breakthrough, and fans of everyone from Arcade Fire to the similarly revamped Maccabees will find much to love here." ...|$|E
