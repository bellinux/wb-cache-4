5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together to the point where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

[...] "Down in the Deep South cotton country, no ambulance driver, or white driver, would even have thought of putting a colored person off in a hospital for white folks." ...|$|E
2500|$|After a decade's isolation, cricket in the Republic was weak. Standards, attendances {{and child}} {{participation}} were all falling. Overseas the game had been revolutionised by the World Cup and World Series Cricket but isolation had deprived South Africa of these commercial and competitive engines. Then in 1979 Doug Insole, an English representative on the ICC, told SACU's Ali Bacher: [...] "Until apartheid goes, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> about {{getting back into}} world cricket." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She isn't {{your wife}} any longer!" [...] exclaimed Sue, passionately excited. [...] "You MUSTN'T {{go out to}} find her! It isn't right! You CAN'T join her, now she's a {{stranger}} to <b>you.</b> How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> such a thing, my dear, dear one!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Crow {{has stated}} that her musical inspirations are not {{restricted}} to one genre—she likes anything with a drum beat. In 2008, she told Ellen DeGeneres that [...] "If it didn't have a drum beat, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> just <b>forget</b> about it!" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget.</b> Men easily forget. And I forgive. That is {{how women}} help the world. I see that now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, Grant," [...] {{she said}} steadily. [...] "I shall tell his brother. I know the Strang breed. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> old sake, so can I. If you don't do something, he'll kill you. Why, even Tom Daw would if I asked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why aren't you {{satisfied}} with me?--I'm not satisfied with you. Paul used {{to come to me}} and take me like a man does. You only leave me alone or take me like your cattle, quickly, to forget me again--so that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Master Copperfield,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'God bless <b>you!</b> I never <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> all that, <b>you</b> know, and I {{never would}} if I could.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Berrie looked {{round at}} the forlorn shops, the {{irregular}} sidewalks, the grassless yards. [...] "It isn't very pretty, that's a fact; but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> always <b>forget</b> it by just {{looking up at}} the high country. When you going up to the mill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes you do, McMurdo," [...] cried Sherlock Holmes, genially. [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have <b>forgotten</b> me. Don't you {{remember}} the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms {{on the night of}} your benefit four years back?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad news?" [...] said Sally. [...] "Then I guess Thorn sha'n't {{worry you}} any more; but it's just when things look worst the turn comes. That {{team will be}} bolting soon, Thorn. I'll sit right back in the corner, and until {{you want to talk}} to me <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> I'm there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} it would make me detestable!" [...] he cried, bitterly. [...] "I had to tell you, to explain what I did. I couldn't help doing it. But now if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> it, and never think of me again, I can go away, and try to atone for it somehow. I shall be guided." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sun went}} down in murky flame and the very shadows were hot, but deep in the night I was roused by a delicious puff of {{mountain}} air, and calling to Zulime, suffering in her berth, I said, [...] "Worry no longer about the heat. From this hour on, every moment will be joy. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> the weather in Colorado." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> so soon what I {{proposed}} {{to you the}} other night? Why, take you from this place, and carry you away with me abroad." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. He's {{going away}} for four months. Do {{you think that}} frightens me? He's loved me for ten years. I've loved him for ten years. Do <b>you</b> think he <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> me in four months? He'll come back.|$|R
6000|$|I laughed, but Bes did not {{laugh at}} all, only {{turned to his}} wife who already ruled him {{as though he were}} indeed a slave, and said, [...] "Lady Karema, make {{yourself}} as beautiful as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and <b>forget</b> that <b>you</b> have ever been a Cup or anything useful, since henceforth you must be a queen, that is if you please my people." ...|$|R
6000|$|Wetherford {{caught him}} up. [...] "I reckon I {{understand}} what you mean. You consider Lize and me undersirable parents--not just the kind you'd {{cut out of the}} herd of your own free will. Well, that's all right, I don't blame you so far as I'm concerned. But <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> me, consider me a dead one. I'll never bother her nor you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no trouble," [...] the Captain replied, [...] "and {{apart from}} the disagreeable nature of your business, I am delighted {{to have you on}} board. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> your suspicions about this fellow Craig, I shall do my best to make your trip a {{pleasant}} one as far as Port Said, or on to India if you decide to take the trip with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I shut up my shop, {{paid him}} every attention, {{taking him to}} the bath, giving him my most {{beautiful}} robes. I examined my accounts, and found that I had doubled my capital--that is, that I now possessed two thousand sequins. I gave my brother half, saying: [...] "Now, brother, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> your losses." [...] He accepted them with joy, and we lived together as we had before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Davie, Davie," [...] I thought, [...] "was {{ever seen}} such black ingratitude? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> old favours and old {{friends at the}} mere whistle of a name? Fie, fie; think shame!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lyn Gardner {{reviewed}} {{a performance}} {{in which the}} father was played by Sophie Okonedo: 'Watching her, never for a moment do you forget {{that she is a}} woman, and Crouch cannily ensures with his stream of stage directions that <b>you</b> never <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> that she is an actor. Nonetheless, as the evening wears on, neither do you doubt that she is a middle-aged man. She looks the same, but she is different.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you have}} once lived with them," [...] he said, [...] "once really understood, <b>you</b> never <b>can</b> <b>forget.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> travel or amuse {{yourself}} in any way, but their faces are always coming before you, their voices seem always in your ears. It {{is the one}} eternal sadness of life. And the strangest part of it is, that just as you who have once really understood <b>can</b> never <b>forget,</b> so {{it is the most}} difficult thing in the world to make those people understand who have not themselves lived and toiled amongst them. It is a cry which you cannot translate, but if once you have heard it, it will follow you from the earth to the stars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you did {{dream of}} it?" [...] {{continued}} Georgiana, hastily; for she dreaded lest a gush of tears should interrupt {{what she had}} to say. [...] "A terrible dream! I wonder that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> it. Is it possible to forget this one expression?--'It is in her heart now; we must have it out!' Reflect, my husband; for by all means I would have you recall that dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brooke laid a {{hand that}} quivered a little on her shoulder. [...] "Barbara," [...] he said, [...] "I am not vainer than most men, and I know what I have done, but unless what once seemed beyond all hoping for was about to come to me, you and I would not have met again beside the river. It simply couldn't happen. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> all that has gone before, and once more try to believe in me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything that I can say in Oswald's favour. I {{will say}} nothing of the duel; but beyond that you have no right to demand my secrecy with her. Yes; you had better go, Mr. Finn, for I am hardly well. And {{remember}} this,--If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> this little episode about Miss Effingham, so will I forget it also; and so will Oswald. I can promise for him." [...] Then she smiled and gave him her hand, and he went.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear! how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> so? That wasn't {{her looks}} at all. We {{all agreed that}} she was quite interesting-looking. Her hair was just fair, and that was all. But I shan't say {{anything}} more about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'My dear Bunny, if you'd do {{that much}} for a poor fellow like me who can't get over the ground as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> I'd never <b>forget</b> the favor as long as I live. You are the one person in all the big woods who can get around quickly enough to save my life!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, be careful," [...] said Mr. Stokes, as {{they set}} off. [...] "Be bright and cheerful; be a sort o' ladies' man to her, same {{as she saw}} you with {{the one on the}} 'bus. Be as unlike {{yourself}} as <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> and don't <b>forget</b> yourself and call her by 'er pet name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why do I look wretched? Because I am {{given over}} to a curse that you cannot understand, and I am not alone. Where are those who plotted against you? George dead, Bellamy gone, Lady Bellamy paralysed hand and foot, and myself--although I did not plot, I only let them be-- accursed. But, if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> the past, why do you not come back to my house? Of course I cannot force you; you are free and rich, and can suit yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such {{was their}} proclamation, {{and they took}} arms against me to enforce it, to pull you down from the place to which I had raised {{you out of the}} dust. Yet <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> it, and in your purblind folly turn to these very men to right the wrongs you fancy I have done you. Do you think that men, holding you in such esteem as that, can keep any sort of faith with you? Do you think these are the men who are likely to fortify and {{maintain}} your title to the crown? Ask yourself, and answer for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well; we {{must take}} this glimpse, such as it is, into the {{interior}} of the young man,--fine buoyant, pungent German spirit, roadways for it very bad, and universal rain-torrents falling, yet with coruscations from a higher quarter;--and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>forget,</b> if need be, the [...] "Literature" [...] of this young Majesty, as you would a staccato on the flute by him! In after months, on new occasion rising, [...] "there was no end to his gibings and bitter pleasantries on the ridiculous reception Broglio had given him at Strasburg," [...] says Valori, [Memoires, i. 88.]--of which this Doggerel itself offers specimen.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewer Ryan Harvey's {{assessment}} of this novel, Moore's first, praises the author for his [...] "strengths ... in crafting a clever, dense plot with immense, epic scope, and populating {{it with an}} imaginative flood of action and monsters." [...] Harvey also criticizes him for [...] "two tremendous flaws; first, [...] "overwriting to an incredible degree" [...] and second, a structure that is [...] "choppy and ... start-and-stop ... {{making it difficult to}} keep up continual interest in the plot." [...] But the book [...] "does have some delicious moments where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> almost <b>forget</b> the overall problems" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgotten it! No, Miss Burton; she cannot think that. Do {{you believe}} that men or women <b>can</b> <b>forget</b> such things as that? <b>Can</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>forget</b> her brother? Do you think people ever forget when they have loved? No, I have not {{forgotten}} her. I have not forgotten that walk which we had down this lane together. There are things which men never forget." [...] Then he paused for an answer.|$|R
6000|$|Are {{not these}} dread words {{for a nation}} bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice? Christians! every time that you pray that the kingdom of Christ may come, <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>forget</b> that prophecy associates, in dread fellowship, the day of vengeance with the year of his redeemed? ...|$|R
