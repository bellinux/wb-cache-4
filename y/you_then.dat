It {{allowed the}} player {{to act as}} the General Manager of the Raw or Smackdown brands (or ECW brand in WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008). After {{choosing}} a brand, and selecting {{to participate in the}} WWE Draft, or using a default roster, <b>you</b> <b>then</b> start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstar and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. You must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches than your rival brand. At {{the end of the year}} at WrestleMania, Vince McMahon will give The General Manager of the Year award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.|$|E

However, {{he was unable to}} travel to Shu Commandery because the roads leading there had been damaged and cut off. He {{had no choice but to}} relocate to Jing Province and station there.|$|E

25|$|The private {{language}} {{argument is}} of central importance to {{debates about the}} nature of language. One compelling theory about language is that language maps words to ideas, concepts or representations in each person's mind. On this account, the concepts in my head are distinct from the concepts in your head. But I can match my concepts to a word in our common language, and then speak the word. <b>You</b> <b>then</b> match the word to a concept in your mind. So our concepts in effect form a private language which we translate into our common language and so share. This account is found for example in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, and more recently in Jerry Fodor's language of thought theory.|$|E

500|$|While Rand {{was working}} as a script reader for Paramount Pictures, her boss put her in touch with the Bobbs-Merrill Company. A {{recently}} hired editor, Archibald Ogden, liked the book, but two internal reviewers gave conflicting opinions. One said it was a great book that would never sell; the other said it was trash but would sell well. Ogden's boss, Bobbs-Merrill president D.L. Chambers, decided to reject the book. Ogden responded by wiring to the head office, [...] "If this is not the book for <b>you,</b> <b>then</b> I am not the editor for you." [...] His strong stand won Rand the contract on December 10, 1941. She also got a $1,000 advance so she could work full-time to complete the novel by January 1, 1943.|$|E
500|$|Point System - Depending on the {{character}} and LARP, your PC will {{have some form of}} Body and/or Armor that is measured nominally. Weapons also have a numerical value assigned, where upon a successful weapon strike you deal 'damage' equal to the number associated with your weapon type. This damage is dealt against your opponents Body/Armor.

If they are wearing armor in that location, then the 'damage dealt' effects their Armor Points (AP), versus if you strike a location without armor you deal damage against your opponents Body Points (BP). The majority of LARP's utilize this system.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{speaks about}} {{two women who}} chose not to end a {{friendship}} because {{of a man who}} has cheated both of them. Its theme is one of female independence. Beyoncé told MTV News that [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] is about female empowerment, in keeping with the theme of the album: [...] "It's about a guy who's kind of playing both of us, and instead of us arguing over the guy we say, 'Forget him. Let's stick together. He's a beautiful liar." [...] The chorus features the lines, [...] "Let's not kill the karma, let's not start a fight" [...] with the female protagonists bonding in their mutual betrayal. Beyoncé and Shakira sing with staccato, intense vocal approach throughout the song. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I didn't know about <b>you</b> <b>then,</b> till I saw you with him again" [...] earnestly while Shakira later adds [...] "I walked in on your love scene, slow dancing". In the end, the female protagonists conclude, [...] "we can live without him", referring to their cheating lover.|$|E

Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: [...] "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not <b>you...</b> <b>Then</b> when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you." [...] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan. He spent six months at the hospital, where he met and formed a strong friendship with [...] "Chink" [...] Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future American foreign service officer, ambassador, and author Henry Serrano Villard.|$|E
500|$|Johnson gained {{high office}} {{due to his}} proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and {{self-employed}} tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the [...] "plebeians"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, [...] "Johnson {{was always the same}} to everyone... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen." [...] Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, [...] "you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none {{of the rest of us}} Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use <b>you.</b> <b>Then</b> we did not want you to go to the Senate but the people would send you." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{he lived with}} fellow actor Jerome Flynn and earned money by signing fan mail for the {{successful}} star of Soldier Soldier. In his debut feature film, Hear My Song (Peter Chelsom, 1991), Nesbitt played Fintan O'Donnell, a struggling theatrical agent and friend of Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar). A New York Times critic wrote, [...] "the jaunty, bemused Mr. Nesbitt, manages to combine soulfulness with sly humor". The praise he received made him self-assured and complacent; in 2001, he recalled, [...] "When I did Hear My Song, I disappeared so far up my own arse afterwards. I thought, 'Oh, that's it, I've cracked it.' And I'm glad that happened, because <b>you</b> <b>then</b> find out how expendable actors are." [...] His attitude left him {{out of work for}} six months after the film was released. Until 1994, he mixed his stage roles with supporting roles on television in episodes of Boon, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Covington Cross, Lovejoy, and Between the Lines. In 1993, he appeared in Love Lies Bleeding, an instalment of the BBC anthology series Screenplay and his first appearance in a production directed by Michael Winterbottom; he later appeared in Go Now (1995), Jude (1996) and Welcome to Sarajevo (1997). A Guardian journalist wrote that [...] "he showed himself to be a generous supporting actor" [...] in Jude and Sarajevo.|$|E

500|$|According to Perry, {{the song}} is about [...] "falling {{in love with a}} foreigner". James Montgomery of MTV News also noted that Perry sings about a [...] "lover from {{different}} dimension". For its single release, the song was reworked to feature two verses from Kanye West, in which he raps about [...] "extraterrestriality". [...] "E.T." [...] opens with the first rap verse by West containing the lines [...] "I got a dirty mind / I got filthy ways / I'm trying to bathe my Ape in your milky way / They callin' me an alien / A big-headed astronaut". Then, using metaphors about extraterrestrials, Perry sings, [...] "You're not like the others / Futuristic lover / Different DNA". The chorus has Perry addressing her lover: [...] "Kiss me, kiss me / Infect me with your love and / Fill me with your poison", claiming to be [...] "ready for abduction". West contributes a second verse to the track, before Perry's final refrain, with heavily auto-tuned vocals: [...] "I know a bar out in Mars / Where they driving spaceships instead of cars". He finishes with a reference to the fictional animated character Shrek and lyrics about [...] "alien sex": [...] "I'mma disrobe <b>you</b> <b>then</b> I'mma probe you / See, I abducted you so I tell you what to do." [...] Ben Kaplan from National Post noted West's presence on the track was similar to the work on his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{explores the}} idea that Reyes made a deal that {{involved}} becoming the Ghost Rider, {{and now he has}} [...] "this thing in" [...] him that wants to murder people which Reyes is [...] "ambivalent" [...] about. Bell said that this is the main aspect of their version that grounds him in [...] "a sadness ... and a weight", particularly when interacting with his brother Gabe. In terms of the season's overarching plot, Bell said it was important to tell Reyes' origin story in the episode, rather than earlier or later, because it also reveals the [...] "truth about Eli, and they're very connected." [...] He also drew comparison to the Marvel Netflix television series which often wait to tell the origin story of their heroes later in the season, using flashbacks, saying, [...] "It kind of helps {{to know more about the}} character, and be emotionally invested in the character, before <b>you</b> <b>then</b> go back and show what turned them into this person. And so part of it was that if you just began with a guy and showed the origin right away, I don't know if it would have been as compelling, I don't know if it would have been as emotional as I think it is. Bell noted that the series always shows Reyes' transformations into Ghost Rider as painful, but when that is shown happening for the first time in this episode [...] "he screams in pain like a lunatic".|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, Quesada stated that, beyond {{connecting}} to themselves, the Netflix series would {{connect with the}} films and other television series. In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity [...] "certainly" [...] exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in [...] In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to The Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into Thor 2 and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before <b>you</b> <b>then</b> start co-mingling". In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying [...] "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [...] They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of Winter Soldier or [...] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season.
