5000|$|An {{example of}} a cybertext is 12 Blue by Michael Joyce. Depending on what link you choose or what portion of the diagram on the side you pick you will be {{transferred}} to a different portion of the text. So in the end, you do not really finish reading the entire story or 'novel' you go through random pages and try piecing the story together yourself. You may never really 'finish' the story. But, {{because it is a}} cybertext the 'finishing' of the story is not as important as its impact on the reader, or on the conveyance. Stir Fry Texts, by Jim Andrews, is a cybertext where there are many layers of text, and as you move your mouse over the words, the layers beneath them are 'dug' through.The House is another {{example of a}} cybertext where one might assume a description of the piece as follows:It is an unruly text, the words don't listen, you are not supreme. You are guided through the piece. This is a cybertext with minimal control.

40|$|Time series {{analysis}} of herbivore data with weather included as covariate {{is commonly used}} {{as a mean to}} shed light on the state and ecology of the studied population. Conclusions about the herbivore population are drawn from statistical parameter values and presence/absence in the most parsimonious model. However, this procedure is only reliable if the statistical parameters have general interpretations regardless of system characteristics. Here we investigated the extent to which this is true by deriving six different vegetation-herbivore-systems and analyzing their respective statistical parameters. The analysis was done in both continuous and discrete time. It turned out that both density parameters (a(1) and a(2)) and rainfall coefficients change with biological interactions and amount of average rainfall, and they do so in different ways in different systems. This means that there is no valid general interpretation of them and, most important, the probability of detecting density dependence and effects of rainfall vary between systems. Hence, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> inference about the biological processes from statistical analysis without knowing the system that you study and what model best describes the interactions within it...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} that you familiarize yourself with the project before beginning work. This means that you not only discuss the project at length with me or your immediate supervisor, but that you also do a thorough literature review of the proposed project and exhibit an understanding the literature you have unearthed. Discuss this with me. In preparation for laboratory work, you must also read the safety handbook entitled Safety in Academic Chemistry Laboratories and sign a form stating that you have read and understood this book. You must be prepared when you come into the laboratory. This means you know what experiment is to be performed and exactly how to do it.

Laboratory Performance You must work an adequate number of hours in the laboratory each week to complete the proposed work (minimum 10 hours/week).

40|$|Welcome to the Nephrology rotation. I {{hope that}} you will enjoy your {{experience}} on your service this month. There is a wealth of renal medicine and general internal medicine to be learned during your time on service. You will be working with Dr. Poole, Dr. Stafford, Dr. Holt or Dr. Franklin while on service. Below are some of the expectations of the residents while on service. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. 1. Rounds will typically begin at 9 : 00 AM in the dialysis unit 2. Try to see most of the patients before we round 3. Our patient list can usually be obtained in the Erlanger computer 4. Renal clinic is the 1 st and 3 rd Thursday of the month at 1 : 00 PM in the Whitehall Building 5. Typically my office will call you with new consults or admissions. Make sure all consults go through the office first so they can determine who needs to see the consult. 6. Once you have finished the consult, you can call my office to let them know you are finished. 7. After we have “staffed ” the consult, then please dictate the consult with a copy going to my office. Also all H&P’s and Discharge Summaries on patients admitted to our service need to be dictated as well. 8. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> it to work or need to be off please let me know via email or on rounds. 9. The attendings work in a “hospitalist ” system, and we typically rotate weekly. Dr. ’s Holt and Poole cover each other’s service and Dr. ’s Franklin and Stafford cover each other. 10 Ideally you should receive a list of patients from the resident going off service, and you should likewise check out the patients as you exit the rotation.

5000|$|Through {{adolescence}} in AGF, he was, {{among other}} things, {{to become a}} Danish champion and to win the unofficial European Championship. He normally plays on the central midfield but {{can also be used}} as a winger and central defense - where he also was used in the national team Denmark U2. In his youth in AGF Gjesing played as a striker, scoring many goals. Later, he was retrained to play defense, and finally he took a ride up in midfield, where he has represented AGF's Danish Superliga teams at both central and edge. Gjesing was in his youth in AGF nicknamed Mubas. This happened because some of his teammates told him at one of the world's best players was called this. Gjesing jumped on it and has ever since been nicknamed Mubas. [...] "I have set myself the goal that I would be the best workout every time. And I try to live. If you go into each workout, and will be the best no matter what, so <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> fail to <b>make</b> progress." [...] Gjesing was seriously injured with a ligament injury in October 2011, and was out nine months. After that, he had a major operation and rehabilitation. He was loaned in August 2011 to Hobro IK, since he was currently not open for playing time at AGF, and he can get some playing time in Hobro, and come back to stronger AGF.|$|R

You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon." [...] Lu Su then headed to Lü Meng's camp. After some drinks, Lü Meng asked Lu Su, [...] "You've received an important appointment and you're going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?" [...] Lu Su lackadaisically replied, [...] "I'll adapt to the situation when the time comes." [...] Lü Meng then said, [...] "The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is nonetheless a person with the might of bears and tigers. How <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> preparations beforehand?" [...] Lü Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su {{on how to deal with}} Guan Yu.

At twelve o'clock the last party returned, and as I thought you might have some {{difficulty}} in getting on board after that, I got into the boat and rowed ashore, and engaged the men to wait as long as I wanted them. I thought perhaps you had missed your way, and did not feel uneasy about you, for there being three of you together it was scarcely likely you had got into any bad scrape. I was beginning at last to think you had perhaps gone to an hotel for the night, and that it was no use waiting any longer, when I heard your voices coming along the quays. The night is so quiet that I heard your laugh some distance away, and recognized it. I then strolled along to meet you, when I saw those four fellows come out into the moonlight from a shadow in the wood. I guessed that they were up to mischief, and started to run at once, and was within fifty yards of you when I saw the scuffle and caught the glint of the moon on the blade of a knife. Another five or six seconds I was up, and then there was an end of it. Now we are close to the ship.
