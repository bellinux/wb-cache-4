500|$|Walker {{released}} his twenty-third single, [...] "Say No More", for Giant in early 2001. It {{was the first}} single release from his sixth studio album of the same name, peaking at number 33 on the country chart; the only other single, the Jerry Kilgore co-write [...] "If <b>You</b> <b>Ever</b> <b>Feel</b> Like Lovin' Me Again", reached number 27. The latter song was promoted by Giant's parent company, Warner Bros. Records Nashville, as Giant had closed in late 2001. Walker co-produced the album with veteran producers Byron Gallimore and Blake Mevis, and session guitarist Brent Mason. The album also included a song that Walker wrote in high school, and a cover of Ritchie Valens's [...] "La Bamba." [...] Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic rated it three stars, with her review saying that [...] "the sensitivity on this album is so expressive that it {{makes you want to}} run right out and hug the one you love." [...] Country Standard Time critic Mike Clark considered it a transition to a more country pop-oriented sound, describing the album as being [...] "full of bad lyrics and overwrought production clichés." ...|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{elements}} of the series, Zombiepowder.s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, easy to follow, and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was [...] "the entire sum and substance" [...] of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap: [...] "The theme is fighting. Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine. But if <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>feel</b> like it please try to use your mind as you read," [...] and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a [...] "great shōnen tale", but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.s [...] "wall-to-wall" [...] action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.|$|E
