25|$|I {{must tell}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, {{equality}} – {{of all men}} and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past. There are probably former relationships – slavery relationships and familial relationships from old days and of the older generations, maybe, or descendants who wish to continue to be in relationships with descendants of their old masters, for familial reasons, or out of affinity, and maybe also for economic interests. But (slavery) is something that is totally finished. All people are free in Mauritania and this phenomenon no longer exists. And I believe that I can tell you that no one profits from this commerce.|$|E
25|$|The {{only means}} {{which have been}} placed in my power of 'raising the wages of colliers' has been by endeavouring to beat down all those {{restrictions}} upon trade which tend to reduce the price to be obtained for the product of their labour, & to lower as much as may be the taxes on the commodities which they may require for use or for consumption. Beyond this I look to the forethought not yet so widely diffused in this country as in Scotland, & in some foreign lands; & I need not remind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> order to facilitate its exercise the Government have been empowered by Legislation to become through the Dept. of the P.O. the receivers & guardians of savings.|$|E

500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} of yesterday, & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled <b>you.</b> <b>That</b> <b>in</b> small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have seen}} Jake as an {{ambiguous}} representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, {{in the bar}} scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he {{is less than a}} man. Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women. Hemingway's writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, [...] "I couldn't tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> New York. It'd mean I was a faggot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing in the United Irishman, on 12 February, Mitchel {{anticipated}} the Government's {{response to his}} open letter to Lord Clarendon: [...] "Yes, of course you will prosecute before long; in self-defence, I hope, you must... I intend, then, to pay special regard to the jury lists, to excite public attention continually to the jury arrangements of this city; and, above all, to publish a series of interesting lectures on [...] "the office and duty of jurors", more especially in cases of sedition, where the [...] "law" [...] is at one side, and the liberty of their country at the other... this same anticipated prosecution {{is one of the}} chief weapons wherewith we mean to storm and sack the enchanted Castle. For be it known to <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> such a case you shall either publicly, boldly, notoriously, pack a jury, or else see the accused rebel walk a free man out of the Court of Queen's Bench – which will be a victory only less than the rout of your Lordship's redcoats in the open field. And think <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> case of such a victory, I will not repeat the blow? and again repeat it,— until all the world shall see that England's law does not govern this nation? ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a letter}} {{sent to the}} French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the {{director}} of the French Cultural Center insisted on its neutrality amidst growing tension in Palestine. He wrote in 1935 :"I have the honor to inform <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the present state of things, the center remains politically uninvolved. It is so true that it is considered pro-jewish by the Arabs and Germans, pro-Arab by the Jews, as far as the English are concerned, they seem to not care about our label and let us work in peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Dragon {{version of}} OOTS {{featured}} the same main cast of six adventurers, but saw them adventuring in an unspecified underground location. None of the villains or supporting characters from the online strip appeared, {{with the exception}} of Mr. Jones and Mr. Rodriguez, who appeared together twice. Burlew has stated that the events of the Dragon strips take place in an alternate universe from the online strip, and events in one storyline do not affect the other. This status quo was broken {{for the sake of a}} joke, however, when a character in the online strip referred to the July 2006 Dragon strip by claiming that [...] "I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> one of the Dragon Magazine comics, so I'm not even sure that's the same continuity." ...|$|E
