25|$|There are variances {{about the}} Momotarō's process of growth; {{one is that}} he grew up to meet the {{expectation}} of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he {{grew up to be}} a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō {{is one of the most}} famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.|$|E
25|$|By the 2000s and 2010s, {{an influx}} of {{residents}} seeking affordable family housing had pushed property prices up. In 2015, houses {{in various parts of}} Windsor Terrace sold for about $1.2 million to $2 million in 2015, and apartments cost from $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to more than $1 million for a three-bedroom apartment. Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|A blind item about a [...] "popular gay character" [...] {{wondering}} if he might be bisexual after an [...] "encounter" [...] was published on February 10, 2011, by Michael Ausiello, Editor in Chief of the entertainment news website TVLine. A [...] "firestorm of speculation" [...] was set off, and centered on Blaine. Glee showrunner and co-creator Ryan Murphy sent an email to the Perez Hilton website, published on February 14, that stated, [...] "Blaine is NOT bi. He is gay, {{and will always be}} gay. I think it's very important to <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> that they know this character is one of them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Care Bears Movie II {{is a sort}} of pre-sequel that, I suspect, {{requires}} its {{audiences to}} have some prior knowledge of Care Bears," [...] Vincent Canby said in his New York Times review. [...] "Very <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> may love this, but anybody over the age of 4 might find it too spooky." [...] Hal Lipper of the St. Petersburg Times remarked that it [...] "is an enormously engaging cartoonquite a feat when you consider the saccharine psychobabble passing for dialogue". The Miami Heralds Bill Cosford gave it {{two and a half stars}} out of four, the same rating he had applied to its predecessor. Edward Jones commented that [...] "The animation can't compare with the best of Disney. Take a look at Sleeping Beauty [...] and you'll see the difference." [...] Likewise, Italian critic Paolo Mereghetti complained, [...] " [...] ugly sequel with awkward animation, and not even the small fry will find it fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Songs {{featured}} in the pilot are [...] "Where is Love?" [...] from Oliver!, Aretha Franklin's [...] "Respect", [...] "Mister Cellophane" [...] from Chicago, Katy Perry's [...] "I Kissed a Girl", [...] "On My Own" [...] from Les Misérables, [...] "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" [...] from Guys and Dolls, [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease, REO Speedwagon's [...] "Can't Fight This Feeling", Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] and [...] "Don't Stop Believin' and [...] "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin' by Journey. The director's cut version also includes an acoustic rendition of John Denver's [...] "Leaving on a Jet Plane". Murphy {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained: [...] "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and <b>young</b> <b>kids,</b> for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] The score of the episode features a cappella covers of instrumental songs provided by The Swingle Singers. Dance routines were choreographed by Zach Woodlee.|$|E
500|$|In {{early summer}} 1981, while Raiders of the Lost Ark was being promoted, Columbia Pictures met with Speilberg {{to discuss the}} script, after having to develop Night Skies with the {{director}} as the intended sequel to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. However, the head of Columbia Pictures' marketing and research development, Marvin Atonowsky, concluded {{that it had a}} limited commercial potential, believing that it would appeal to mostly <b>young</b> <b>kids.</b> The President of Columbia's worldwide productions, John Veitch, also felt that the script wasn't good or scary enough to draw enough crowd. On the advice of Atonowsky and Veitch, Columbia Pictures CEO Frank Price passed on the project, calling it [...] "a wimpy Walt Disney movie" [...] and thus putting it in a turnaround, so Spielberg approached the more receptive Sid Sheinberg, president of MCA, the then-parent company of Universal Studios. Spielberg told Sheinberg to acquire the E.T. script from Columbia Pictures, which he did for $1 million and struck a deal with Price in which Columbia would retain 5% of the film's net profits. Veitch later recalled that [...] "I think [...] we made more on that picture than we did on any of our films." ...|$|E

500|$|Murphy was {{responsible}} for selecting all of the songs covered on the album, and strove to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits. He {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained, [...] "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and <b>young</b> <b>kids,</b> for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] Music supervisor P.J. Bloom cleared the song rights with their respective publishers, and music producer Adam Anders rearranged the tracks for the Glee cast. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered for use at a reduced licensing rate, which surprised Murphy, who had believed {{he would not be able}} to afford the rights given that it had been a number one hit for Rihanna. Neil Diamond had some reluctance over licensing [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] to the show, and retracted clearance after it had already been recorded. Bloom was able to convince him to reverse his decision, and Diamond went on to also license his song [...] "Hello Again" [...] for use on the show at a later date.|$|E
500|$|Josh Selig was {{inspired}} to create the show after watching puppeteers perform with their bare hands {{on the set of}} Ulica Sezamkowa in Warsaw, Poland. He noted the amount of expression conveyed by the more skilled actors' hands. Selig pitched the show to Noggin under the working title Pipo, but it was later renamed Oobi to mirror the characters' eyes with two O's. Viacom registered the Oobi title as a trademark on July 5, 2000. Elements of the series were intentionally made simple and old-fashioned, so that young children could easily understand the storylines and relate to the characters. In an interview with Gothamist, Selig stated, [...] "Simple is good. Everything about Oobi is stripped down to the bare essentials: the writing, the puppets, the educational goals. What is left—when it all works—are clear stories and emotional performances unencumbered by lots of fur or feathers." [...] He expanded upon this idea in an article for The New York Times, in which he noted that [...] "in the same way the puppets are very bare, the way they speak is quite distilled ... we've found it's really attractive to <b>young</b> <b>kids.</b> They like the clarity and simplicity." [...] The show was also specifically created to encourage preschool-aged viewers to use their imaginations and play with their own Oobi puppets.|$|E

They loved that this show was about optimism and <b>young</b> <b>kids,</b> for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] A minority of those approached refused to allow their music to be used, including Bryan Adams, Guns N' Roses and Coldplay; however, in June 2010, Coldplay reversed their decision, allowing Glee the rights to their catalog. Adams posted on his Twitter account that the producers of Glee had never requested permission from him and urged them to [...] "pick up the phone". Composer and musician Billy Joel offered many of his songs for use on the show, and other artists have offered use of their songs for free. A series of Glee soundtrack albums have been released through Columbia Records. Songs featured on the show are available for digital download through iTunes up to two weeks before new episodes air, and through other digital outlets and mobile carriers a week later. Glee music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom have begun to add original music to the show, including two original songs, [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] and [...] "Get It Right", on the March 15, 2011 episode.|$|E

We tested on <b>young</b> <b>kids,</b> we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and we {{came to the conclusion that}} anyone can play this game.

2500|$|On May 17, 2007, Method Man was {{captured}} in New York City for marijuana allegations. His SUV was pulled over near the Battery Tunnel toll booths for having an expired inspection sticker.

[...] The arresting officer noticed two blunts and a plastic bag containing marijuana in plain view. Upon further inspection more marijuana was found under the driver's seat. Method Man was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, criminal possession of marijuana, DWI, and driving an uninspected motor vehicle. He reached a plea agreement to perform community service including rapping to <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> about the dangers of drugs.|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> where he'd lived. It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E

During the time before the fight, Shamrock {{was going through a}} divorce and {{had to take care of}} his <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> during the day, which severely cut into his training time for the fight. Despite this, Shamrock dominated Fujita throughout the entire fight, stopping takedowns from the Japanese wrestling champion and landing hard strikes, but eventually had his corner throw in the towel because he felt like he was having a heart attack. He was evaluated after the fight and it was determined that he was suffering from heart palpitations.|$|E

In 1996, Tkautz joined the series Pacific Drive, where she played a model, Bethany Daniels. This role had a major effect on Tkautz, who played the first long-term HIV positive character on Australian TV. She described how [...] "I did a lot of research on the role and a lot of charity work with HIV , especially <b>young</b> <b>kids</b> who had contracted the disease". The series later gained a cult following. When Pacific Drive was cancelled in 1998, Tkautz joined the cast of Medivac (1998) as Nurse Evie Morrison.
