50|$|The {{growth of}} credit was more {{conspicuous}} {{than that of}} the money supply. During the bubble period, banks were increasing borrowing activity and at the same time, also financing from capital markets substantially increased {{against the backdrop of the}} progress of financial deregulation and the increase of stock prices.

30|$|Insofar {{as we are}} {{interested}} in tracking down asymmetries along the business cycle, we divide periods in which the economy is expanding (measured by positive employment growth on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis)</b> from those periods that the economy is contracting (negative employment variation) 11. Moreover, we further divide periods according to the unemployment rate level being above or below the mean of the whole period considered (1987 – 2013). This distinction allows us to check, for instance, whether if downward pressure on wages when employment is falling is more intense after a long recession–when unemployment is also high–or not. In principle, there are different reasons to think this would be the case if, for example, a long recession has left the economy with a large stock of unemployed workers posing extra pressure on wage adjustment. However, the opposite could be true if, for example, the composition of the unemployment rate is biased towards a high percentage of long-term unemployed (possibly less attached to the labor market), resulting in a lower downward pressure on wages.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we set out}} the {{economic}} grounds for restrictions on long working hours and conduct an empirical analysis using surveys {{from the perspective of}} behavioral economics.

Moreover, among male management personnel who had a characteristic tendency to procrastinate in their assignment as a child, the probability of working for long hours of at least 60 hours per week is significantly higher. On the other hand, among female workers and male workers other than management we find no evidence that procrastination encourages long working hours. It is possible that the long working hours resulting from procrastinatory behavior by male managers bring negative externalities to the workplace, and it is therefore necessary to have a commitment mechanism to compel employees to complete tasks during regular working hours. ...|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing posted strong {{gains in}} Austria, but the WIFO {{business}} survey indicated a slight cooling {{of the business}} climate. Unemployment continues to rise despite substantial employment expansion. The deficit in the current account is shrinking markedly. In {{the first quarter of}} 1998, real GDP rose by 4. 2 percent on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> This favorable development was mainly due to the expansion in the manufacturing sector {{as well as to the}} rise in construction activity, owing to clement weather at the beginning of the year. Manufacturing activity continues at a lively pace. The results from the most recent business survey signal, however, that growth rates will decline somewhat. A high level of output is expected over the next few months, but compared to the survey from April there are signs of a slight restraint. The growth in demand and in output is shifting markedly from the basic-goods industry, which expanded significantly at the beginning of the recovery, to those sectors which are more dependent on domestic demand. So far, foreign demand has also held up. The expansionary effects of the upturn in the economies of Austria's west and east European trading partners, as well as the improvement in the competitive position of Austria's export sector still outweigh the negative effects of the economic crisis in the Far East. Merchandise exports post high growth rates, markedly above those recorded for imports. According to the foreign trade statistics, exports rose by 9 percent from January to April, on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> The balance of payments statistics record a surge in exports of 12 percent for the first five months of the year, resulting in a reduction of the trade deficit by ATS 3 billion, compared to 1997. This development and the turnaround in the tourism balance contributed to a narrowing of the deficit in the current account by ATS 5 ½ billion. The economic recovery is spreading to domestic demand. With the rise in per-capita income remaining rather modest, the rise in disposable income can be largely attributed to sizable employment gains. With a real growth rate of 1 ¼ percent in the first quarter, private consumption has become an important element of aggregate demand. During the first four months, retail sales exceeded last year's level by 2 percent in real terms, partly as a result of the upswing in tourism. Construction activity, which was buoyed by special factors in the first quarter of 1998, remains flat, however: demand for new housing is weak, but civil engineering is booming. The expansion of demand and production has had a positive impact on the labor market. In July, dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) exceeded the level in the corresponding period of 1997 by 39, 000 (by 30, 000 on average during the first seven months). The service sector posted the highest increase (33, 000 in the second quarter); even the manufacturing industry created 2, 000 additional jobs. Nonetheless, unemployment continued to rise as a result of demographic and institutional factors, as well as of the heavy inflow of labor from hidden unemployment (July + 4, 500). The unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) was 4. 6 percent of the total labor force according to the definitions of the EU Labour Force Survey, and 7. 3 percent of the dependent labor force according to the traditional Austrian method of calculation. There were 8 unemployed persons for every vacant job registered with the employment placement service. The number of vacancies is on the increase, however.

40|$|Quarterly {{national}} accounts, {{based on}} the ESA 2 nd edition concept, are {{for the first time}} available in Austria. Faced with a shortage of primary statistics that meet the quarterly demand in terms of prompt availability and accuracy, WIFO has developed an econometric model to estimate quarterly series. This IS-LM Model for small open economies (SMOE) with fixed exchange rates yields quarterly series for the entire demand side. Provisional estimates for current quarters will be a synthesis of the model's results and recent information from the supply side, for which reliable and quick data are available. WIFO plans to publish quarterly data within three months of the end of each quarter. Since key statistical data on the relevant quarter will necessarily take some time to collect, revisions will have to be made more frequently. A first glance at the original as well as seasonally adjusted data reveals that there are only modest fluctuations in quarterly GDP series. The greatest seasonal fluctuation can be found in investment in construction whereas import figures show the least erratic movement. In the first quarter of 1998 real GDP grew by 4. 2 percent on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> Seasonally adjusted GDP increased by over 1. 4 percent over the previous quarter. Despite the crisis in the construction sector its real value added soared by 10. 2 percent over the year, due to the mild climate. Manufacturing output (including mining) surged by 8. 9 percent, caused by the brisk foreign demand as well as domestic investments. Exports of goods and services rose by 12. 8 percent and gross fixed capital formation by 8. 6 percent. So far, consumer spending has been muted, inching up by 1. 2 percent in the first quarter.

40|$|Although {{economic}} activity is expanding in the EU countries, private consumption remains subdued {{as a result}} of restrictive fiscal policies. In Austria, too, income growth was dampened by measures to consolidate the public sector deficit. The first measures were implemented in the middle of 1996; they triggered pre-emptive purchases before and caused buying restraint after this date. As pre-emptive purchases are usually balanced within a year, these effects were still noticeable {{in the first half of}} 1997. Thus, consumer expenditures, adjusted for price increases, declined by 1 percent on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis</b> in the first half of 1997. The demand for durable consumer goods (first half of the year – 9. 4 percent), for automobiles in particular (– 22. 2 percent), reacted most strongly to the change in income and to the fiscal measures. According to model calculations, the fiscal consolidation measures implemented at the beginning of 1997 reduced the income of private households by about 2 percent. The modest decrease in consumer spending in the first half of the year (– 1 percent) implies a decline in the saving ratio by 1 percentage point. Thus, Austrian consumers have not reacted to the small reduction in income with cautionary saving and have helped to smooth {{economic activity}}. As the year-on-year effect of pre-emptive purchases will no longer be felt in the second half of 1997, private consumption will expand slightly (+ 0. 5 percent) for the whole year. This forecast is supported by the trend in retail sales: the sales slump of 3. 3 percent (in comparison to the level one year earlier, elevated by pre-emptive purchases) in the months from January to May was followed by a gain of 2. 3 percent during the months from June to August (average of the months from January to August: – 1. 2 percent).

40|$|For {{a number}} of years there has been a growing {{awareness}} of the importance of shareholder value for financial strategy and management. At the same time, there has been growing concern that the traditional accounting measures of performance have serious inherent limitations that may lead to poor financial decision-making. This study starts off by providing an overview of the main accounting earnings-based measures, as well as the most important criticisms leveled against them. The concepts of Economic Value Added (EVA) and Market Value Added (MVA), which are currently regarded as the most important indicators of shareholder value and financial performance, are examined, along with some research evidence supporting them (and other evidence opposing them). Various aspects of EVA and MVA are discussed, including different ways of calculating them, and their link to other financial concepts such as net present value (NPV) and operating and financial leverage. After a discussion of the main drivers of EVA, namely the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the performance spread and the invested capital (IC), the financial strategy matrix is introduced. The financial strategy matrix has been used in this study to evaluate companies in terms of internal value creation (performance spreads) and cash flow management (sales growth compared to the sustainable growth rate). A selection of companies listed on the JSE was ranked according to their relative performance in terms of internal value creation (performance spreads) and the results of some individual companies and sectors were placed on the financial strategy matrix. The statistical tests done on the data have indicated that the sales growth minus the sustainable growth rate does not contribute significantly to shareholder value and an alternative variable was recommended. Further tests have revealed that significant correlation between MVA and EVA could only be found if the median results over a ten-year period were used. The correlation between MVA and the main drivers of EVA was found to be weak on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> It is hoped that the results and perspectives gained from this study will be helpful to financial managers who aim to optimize their approach to shareholder value management.

40|$|Even in {{the current}} {{recovery}} the regional growth pattern of Austria's economy remains characterized by an unusually high degree of uniformity. Structural factors and the improvement in locational factors {{in the eastern part}} of Austria determine the pace of the upswing, which is more highly synchronized than in previous business cycles. Austria's value added – excluding agriculture and the energy sector – grew by 3. 2 percent in the first quarter of 1994 on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> About half a percentage point is accounted for by an increase in construction output that made up for weather-induced output losses in the winter of 1993; nonetheless, the signs of an incipient upswing are clear. Manufacturing output has advanced at an above-average pace and employment has risen by 26, 000 (+ 0. 9 percent) on a seasonally adjusted basis since the beginning of the year. When Germany, laboring under reunification, abandoned its role as Europe's engine of growth, the traditional pattern of a gradual West-East transmission of the business cycle vanished. Styria (+ 3. 1 percent), Carinthia (+ 3. 8 percent), Upper Austria (+ 3. 5 percent), and Salzburg (+ 3. 6 percent; value added excluding agriculture and energy) followed the same pattern; in Tyrol (+ 2. 3 percent) and Vorarlberg (+ 4. 0 percent) the deviations are mostly due to a base effect. Economic activity in the eastern region also expanded by 3. 2 percent, but Vienna, with a growth rate of only 2. 1 percent, lagged behind Lower Austria (+ 5. 0 percent) and Burgenland (+ 5. 9 percent). In distribution, finance, insurance, and real estate, as well as the public sector and other service sectors production facilities have for some time now been shifted from the centers to surrounding areas. It is quite possible that Burgenland has entered the take-off phase of economic growth: during the last two years economic activity grew at a rate that was 5 percentage points higher than in the rest of Austria, with about half of this extra gain due to additional jobs, the other half due to higher productivity growth. Construction activity in Burgenland has soared. A remarkable side effect of the unusually high capacity utilization is that the seasonal gap narrowed by one third, an indication that seasonal unemployment is, in part, only a bad habit carried over from the past.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to determine whether}} the changes made to the Income Tax Act, 58 of 1962 between 1996 and 2012, in respect of fringe benefits, allowances, deductions, tax tables and rebates, where these changes apply to individuals, have resulted in relieving the tax burden placed on individuals in South Africa. The research was conducted by means of a critical analysis of documentary data with specific reference to the Income Tax Act, annual amendments to the Income Tax Act, statistics relating to tax collections, the National Budget and the Annual Budget Speeches as tabled by the Minister of Finance. These sources were utilised to analyse the amendments to the Act that have taken place over the last sixteen years, where they impact on the tax liability of an individual. A hypothetical example incorporating all the variables identified in the analysis of the tax amendments was used to provide a detailed analysis of the tax payable by an individual on an inflation-adjusted <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> The research found that, whilst personal income tax is still the largest contributor to the national budget of South Africa, its contribution has decreased from 40. 2 percent in 1996 to 34. 3 percent in 2010. This decrease is partly attributable to the extensive tax reforms undertaken by Government with respect to the tax tables, resulting in a reduction in the marginal tax rates and increased tax rebates which had the effect that the individual taxpayer (as illustrated in the hypothetical example) experienced a decrease in the average rate of tax. In contrast to this, the increase in the taxable income of the hypothetical taxpayer exceeded the average rate of inflation over the period. Furthermore, the actual revenue collected by the government from personal income tax has increased by approximately eleven percent per annum, which far exceeds the average inflation rate of 6. 23 percent. The research indicated that this could be the result of the increase in the taxable value of fringe benefits, specifically medical aid contributions and company cars, as well as the inclusion of the full amount of allowances in taxable income and the limits placed on the deductions an individual may claim. The result is a broadening of the tax base of the individual taxpayer. Therefore, although the government may have achieved its goal of a fairer tax system, the amendments made to fringe benefits, allowances and deductions have resulted in an increase in the average taxable income of individuals. ...|$|E
40|$|Exports and {{manufacturing}} output {{continue to be}} the mainstay of Austria's economic upswing. Economic activity in retail trade and construction remains subdued, but not as sluggish as in Germany. Price stability persists. Despite impressive employment gains, unemployment is markedly higher than one year ago. According to preliminary data, Austria's economy grew by 2 ½ percent in real terms in 1997; this growth rate is about as high as in the EU on average, but ¼ percentage point higher than in Germany. With merchandise exports expanding at double-digit rates, foreign trade continues to be the driving force of the cyclical upswing. According to the foreign trade statistics of the Central Statistical Office, shipments to countries outside of the EU expanded rapidly, with sales to Eastern and South-Eastern Europe posting the highest gains. A substantial trade surplus is being built up vis-à-vis these regions. The vigorous export growth has boosted economic activity in the manufacturing sector; output is estimated to have expanded by 4 ½ percent in 1997. According to the WIFO business survey, expectations continue to be optimistic. The development of employment in this sector suggests that the steep increase in the output of intermediary and investment goods can no longer be supported by drawing on productivity reserves. While at the beginning of 1997 job losses amounted to 14, 000 on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis,</b> the number of persons on the manufacturing payroll in January 1998 was just slightly below the level recorded in January 1997 (– 1, 500). In the first two months of 1998 dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) substantially exceeded the level recorded during the same period of 1997 (+ 23, 000 and + 24, 000). To the cyclical relief in the demand for labor in manufacturing must be added the persistent rise in labor demand in two sectors, the producer-oriented services sector and the public sector. The employment gains have mostly benefited female workers, many of whom are employed in part-time jobs. The favorable employment trend cannot give rise to a sanguine evaluation of the labor market, however, because unemployment is still on the rise: in February the number of jobless exceeded last year's level by some 7, 000. But this increase is partly due to institutional factors. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4. 5 percent of the total labor force according to Eurostat calculations, and 7. 1 percent of the dependent labor force according to the traditional Austrian method. There were 15 unemployed for each vacancy. Price stability continues to characterize Austria's economy: at the level of consumer prices, the rate of inflation was as low as 1. 2 percent in January, with rental prices posting the highest increase (3. 7 percent). Various factors, such as the very moderate rise in labor costs, the restrained domestic demand, intense competitive pressures, and the drop in energy prices, contributed to this favorable performance. Austria's integration into the EU has also exerted considerable downward pressure on prices; this price effect is now spreading from manufactured goods to services. Rising Unemployment despite Vigorous Employment Growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{turbulence}} on {{the international}} financial markets has markedly slowed down {{the growth of the}} global economy. Exports and manufacturing output in Austria were increasingly affected by these developments in the fall of 1998; the business climate worsened in the fourth quarter in the manufacturing sector. Despite these setbacks, domestic demand remained robust. Consumer confidence continued on its upward trend in October, thanks to rising purchasing power, improved labor market conditions, and lower inflation. The economic upswing in Austria has been weakening as a result of unfavorable international conditions. The slowdown of the international economy triggered by the Asian crisis has been exacerbated by the financial turmoil in Russia and Latin America. The deterioration in the global economy is manifest in the performance of Austria's merchandise exports: after posting two-digit growth rates {{in the first half of}} 1998, exports (according to the statistics compiled by the Austrian National Bank) grew by only 7 percent in the third quarter on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> Exports to South-East Asia, to OPEC, and to Russia declined sharply. The weakening of export growth has adversely affected the manufacturing sector. The growth rate of the value of output declined from 9 percent in the first half of the year to about 5 percent in the months July and August; output and profitability in the basic-goods industries was particularly hard hit by the plunge in internationally traded commodities. The business climate in manufacturing continued to worsen in the fourth quarter. The balance of negative and positive output expectations was barely in the positive range, as weak foreign orders and adverse price expectations darkened the outlook. The assessment of the cyclical position varies markedly from sector to sector. While prospects deteriorated significantly in the basic-goods sector, expectations remained basically stable in the investment and consumer goods sectors. The negative impact of foreign trade on Austria's economy was alleviated by the pick-up in domestic demand, as households, after several meager years, again experienced substantial real income gains. This resulted from lower inflation (deep cuts in prices of crude oil and of raw materials), a rise in employment, and higher income growth. Domestic demand was also boosted by the persistent decline in interest rates. In the third quarter, retail sales (adjusted for price increases) exceeded the level of the corresponding quarter of last year by 3 ¼ percent. A sustained deterioration in international economic conditions is bound to have a negative impact also on investment activity, however. The coordinated cut in base interest rates in the EU at the beginning of December was aimed at countering the danger of a deeper slump. In the 1990 s, Europe's economy was shaken by a series of financial and currency crises. The recession of 1993, which was deepened by a restrictive monetary policy, was followed by the currency crisis of 1995 - 96, and then by the financial crisis of 1998. The challenge to stabilization policy under these circumstances consists less in deploying its traditional fiscal instruments than in preventing or containing crises on the liberalized financial and foreign exchange markets. The realization of the European Monetary Union on 1 January 1999 is an important step in this direction. Diverging Trends in Austria's Economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} upswing {{continued in the}} first quarter of 1994 (gross value added excluding agriculture and forestry: + 2. 8 percent on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis),</b> despite growing pessimism due to exchange rate turbulences. The regional pattern of economic growth was dominated by manufacturing output, which benefited most from the export boom. Provinces with a high concentration of firms supplying parts to other enterprises or producing investment goods were especially favored. In the west, the export-based manufacturing sector increased output by some 10 percent over last year's level. Economic growth in the western provinces was slowed down, however, by weather-related production losses in the energy sector and poor results in winter tourism. Nonetheless, {{in the first quarter}} of 1995 the west of Austria (defined according to the NUTS-I regions) achieved a growth rate 0. 5 percentage points higher than the Austrian average. Economic growth in the eastern region (2. 7 percent) remained almost unchanged from the previous quarters, because export gains to East-Central Europe were offset by the negative effects of more intense import pressure. The eastern region is burdened with a large share of industries which had been protected from foreign competition before Austria's accession to the EU (such as the food and beverage industry), and with low-wage industries which are now threatened by competition from the reform countries in Eastern Europe. Good results from the energy sector (thermo power plants) and international city tourism were not sufficient to compensate for the markedly weaker growth of output in manufacturing (+ 4. 7 percent). In the south, economic growth slowed down significantly at the beginning of the year as a result of demand shortfalls and changes in foreign exchange rates (+ 2. 0 percent). Setbacks in the construction industry and in retail trade, which lost market shares to shops across the border, reduced the growth rate in the south by 1 percentage point. Special factors that operate over time as well as differences in the economic structure result in large regional growth differentials. Upper Austria posted the highest growth rate (+ 5. 3 percent), followed by Lower Austria (+ 4. 3 percent), Vorarlberg (+ 3. 6 percent), and Styria (+ 3. 2 percent). Provinces with below-average growth rates (Vienna + 2. 0 percent, Tirol + 1. 7 percent, Salzburg 0. 8 percent) are those whose economies are dominated by services. In Burgenland (+ 0. 1 percent) and Carinthia (– 0. 4 percent), the least developed provinces, economic activity stagnated; for Burgenland, the first quarter of 1995 marks the end of a period of extraordinarily high growth. Even though the current {{economic upswing}} has not buoyed the labor market significantly, employment expanded faster (with some impact on unemployment) in the more dynamic provinces. In the first quarter, when unemployment is mostly determined by seasonal factors, the highest unemployment rates were recorded in Burgenland (12. 1 percent), Carinthia (11. 8 percent), and Styria (10. 5 percent), the lowest in the western provinces, especially in Salzburg and Vorarlberg.

40|$|The {{growth in}} exports and {{manufacturing}} output markedly levelled {{off in the}} late fall of 1998. A more sanguine picture was presented by the strong real income and employment gains and the stabilisation of unemployment. In the EU, the business climate in the manufacturing sector stabilised. The situation in the crisis regions of the global economy, however, remains tenuous. Economic activity in Austria slowed down considerably {{in the second half}} of 1998, but the downswing did not turn into a recession at the end of the year, as had been feared by some observers. The WIFO business survey in manufacturing has shown a deterioration in the business climate since the spring of 1998; in the first quarter of the current year the assessment of entrepreneurs stabilised, however. This stance corresponds to the European Commission's business climate surveys in manufacturing, which showed no further worsening in December and January. At the same time, consumer confidence in the EU attained a record high. The deceleration in economic growth of Austria's major trade partners is reflected in Austria's exports, which declined in October and November on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis</b> in nominal terms according to preliminary estimates by the Central Statistical Office (data collected by the National Bank, however, record an increase). The decrease was particularly pronounced for exports to countries outside the EU; sales to the EU stagnated. The sluggish performance of exports dampened industrial output, which rose by only 1 percent (adjusted for the number of working days) in October/November, compared with the same period of the previous year. Employment in manufacturing stagnated in December and January compared with one year earlier; this suggests that manufacturing production did not suffer a major setback at the end of the year. Austria's tourism industry recovered significantly from the slump of recent years. Preliminary reports on the performance of the winter season painted an optimistic picture; overnight stays and turnover increased steeply. It is still too early to assess the long-term effects of the avalanches in February. The turnaround in tourism in tandem with the employment gains and the rise in real income have provided a strong boost to consumer spending. In the fourth quarter of 1998, retail sales expanded by some 2 percent in real terms. The development of real income is likely to remain strong and to buoy private consumption. In January, the index of contractual wage rates was up 2. 4 percent from 12 months earlier. Inflation has vanished, with the consumer price index practically unchanged since April 1998. In January of 1999, the year-on-year change was only 0. 5 percent (0. 3 percent for the EU's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices). Developments on the labour market give cause for optimism. In February, dependent employment (excluding persons in military service and on parental leave) exceeded the level of the same month of last year by 26, 000 or 0. 9 percent; the rise in unemployment by 1, 400 persons can be attributed to bad weather. In the private service sectors, the expansion in employment continued unabated, but remains concentrated in low-wage branches where part-time work is significant. The number of jobs is stagnating in manufacturing, while construction records marked employment losses, owing to the weak demand in structural engineering and inclement weather. In February, the (seasonally adjusted) unemployment rate was 7. 1 percent of the dependent labour force according to the traditional Austrian method of calculation, and 4. 4 percent of the total labour force according to the EU Labour Force Survey. Private Consumption Continuous as Mainstay of Economic Activity in Austria...|$|E
40|$|The {{most recent}} WIFO {{business}} survey {{indicates that the}} downturn in manufacturing {{is coming to an}} end. With exports remaining weak, domestic demand continues to be the engine of economic activity in Austria. The main factors are the persistent price stability, the rise in employment, and the favourable performance of tourism. In March and April, unemployment declined compared to one year earlier. The April WIFO business survey recorded more favourable responses from manufacturing enterprises than earlier surveys. The cyclical position of manufacturing has worsened since spring of 1998 {{as a result of the}} economic and financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Latin America. Prices collapsed in several branches; exports declined markedly, and investors became nervous. In the second quarter of 1999, however, the business climate in the basic-goods sector, technical manufacturing, and consumer-goods sector ceased deteriorating. The outlook for prices improved somewhat, and production and sales expectations for the next few months remained stable. New export orders are still rather low. This is reflected in the foreign trade data, which record stagnating exports in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the beginning of 1999. On the other hand, there were also positive signals from abroad: the persistently strong economic activity in the USA, the improvement in the Ifo business climate index for Germany, and the ECB's interest rate cut. Robust domestic demand has helped to stabilise economic activity in Austria. As a result of a rise in employment, higher wage settlements, and price stability – the inflation rate was only 0. 1 percent according to the EU's Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, 0. 4 percent according to the national Consumer Price Index – the consumers' purchasing power rose significantly. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the net household income (including social transfers) exceeded the level of the corresponding period in 1997 by 2 ½ percent in real terms. The increase in disposable income induced a marked expansion of retail sales (adjusted for price changes + 2 percent). The strength of the retail sector is also due to tourism, which recorded an excellent winter season: the number of overnight stays from November to March was about 7 percent higher than in the same period one year earlier; turnover rose by almost 8 percent. The improvement in the tourism balance (ATS + 10 billion) together with the fall in prices of merchandise imports made an important contribution towards lowering the deficit in the current account to ATS 54 ½ billion (– 2 percent of GDP). In the spring, unemployment declined slightly on a <b>year-on-year</b> <b>basis.</b> This was the result of two factors. The first factor is the hefty expansion in employment; in the first four months of the current year, dependent employment (excluding persons on parental leave and in military service) exceeded the level of the same period last year by 34, 000. The employment losses in the construction industry and the stagnation in manufacturing were more than offset by the steep increase in the number of jobs in the service sector; most of the jobs created were part-time jobs with below-average earnings, however. The second factor contributing to the improvement in the labour market is the intensification of training activities within the framework of the National Action Plan. In April, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4. 5 percent of the total labour force according to the EU Labour Force Survey, and 7. 0 percent of the dependent labour force according to the traditional Austrian method of calculation. There were 8 persons looking for a job per each vacancy registered by the Labour Market Service. Signs of Stabilisation in Manufacturing, Decline in Unemployment...|$|E
