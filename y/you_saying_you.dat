5000|$|MGM {{screened}} {{the movie}} and, just like Hill said, the test screening audience hated it. Hill would later remark:We limped in, in post {{we had a}} tremendous amount of effect stuff to do. They decided they wanted to preview the movie without the effects. I said this was insane, it's a science fiction movie. The effects had to be added. They wanted to see how it played. I told them it would be like shit, terrible, very bad preview, you will give up on the movie. These previews under these conditions are political. [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> won't preview the movie?" [...] I said [...] "You own the God damn thing. If you want to preview it, I can't prevent you, but I won't go." [...] They saw this as defiance. Taking this into consideration and after more arguments with MGM, Hill quit the project.|$|E

Kyrax2 had noticed that the makeup of every panel she had been to at the convention was overwhelmingly male. At the panel, during the question period, she asked the panelists if they were committed to hiring more women.The response that she received from Dan Didio {{was that he was}} [...] "committed to hiring the absolute best writers and artists," [...] to which she asked, [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> can't find any great women writers or artists?" [...] According to Kyrax2, the audience reaction was furious: People yelled at me to 'sit down!' and shouted out Gail Simone’s name over and over again. I said, [...] "Yes, I met Gail Simone yesterday. I like her very much. But I've attended all these other panels, and with the exception of her and one female editor, they’ve all been male." ...|$|E

5000|$|Smit and Mellman {{returned}} for a five-episode series all set at Grossmalerman's studio in Brooklyn, this time with Mellman co-starring as Grossmalerman's studio assistant, Neil. New York performance artist Jibz Cameron plays Joyce, the artist's girlfriend, Scissor Sisters' Ana Matronic and off-Broadway actress Jenn Harris as visiting art dealers, Louise and Regina of Windsor & Gristle. Funded by a Kickstarter campaign with artist and videomaker Joshua White directing {{in front of a}} live studio audience, the episodes start with news of Grossmalerman's wife having died at a party; the artist is left to care for their 11-year-old daughter, Tracy (Sadie Parker) and he is less than up to the task. Other plot lines include a haunted Basquiat painting, which produces lines like [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> choose to live a ghost just because of its social ranking?," [...] Louise and Neil having an affair, the artist going through at least three iterations of work, and even further chaos. Carmine Covelli (ex-Julie Ruin member) and Brian Osborne also star.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a younger}} {{son of a}} minor nobleman, William had no lands or fortune to inherit, and had {{to make his own}} way in life. Around the age of twelve, when his father's career was faltering, he was sent to Normandy to be brought up in the {{household}} of William de Tancarville, a great magnate and cousin of young William's mother. Here he began his training as a knight. This would have included basic biblical stories and prayers written in Latin, as well as exposure to French romances, which conferred the basic precepts of chivalry to the budding knight. [...] In addition, while in Tancarville’s household, it is likely that Marshal also learned important and lasting practical lessons concerning the politics of courtly life. According to his thirteenth-century biography, L'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal, Marshal had enemies at Tancarville’s court who plotted against him — presumably men threatened by his close relationship with the magnate. [...] He was knighted in 1166 on campaign in Upper Normandy, then being invaded from Flanders. His first experience in battle came with mixed reviews. According to L'Histoire, everyone who witnessed the young knight in action agreed that he had acquitted himself well in combat. However, as medieval historian David Crouch explains, “War in the twelfth century was not fought wholly for honour. Profit was there to be made…” [...] On this front, Marshal was not so successful, as he was unable to parlay his combat victories into profit from either ransom or seized booty. As described in L'Histoire, the Earl of Essex, who was expecting the customary tribute from his valorous knight following battle, jokingly remarked: “Oh? But Marshal, what are <b>you</b> <b>saying?</b> <b>You</b> had forty or sixty of them — yet you refuse me so small a thing!” In 1167 he was taken by William de Tancarville to his first tournament where he found his true métier. Quitting the Tancarville household he then served in the household of his mother's brother, Patrick, Earl of Salisbury. In 1168 his uncle was killed in an ambush by Guy de Lusignan. William was injured and captured in the same skirmish. It is known that William received a wound to his thigh and that someone in his captor's household took pity on the young knight. He received a loaf of bread in which were concealed several lengths of clean linen bandages with which he could dress his wounds. This act of kindness by an unknown person perhaps saved Marshal's life as infection setting into the wound could have killed him. After a period of time, he was ransomed by Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was apparently impressed by tales of his bravery.|$|E
