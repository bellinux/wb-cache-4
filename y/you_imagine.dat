5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. And can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

25|$|Albrekt Larsen has {{advanced}} this explanation by a {{comparative study of}} how trust increased in Denmark and Sweden {{in the latter part}} of the 20th century while it decreased in the US and UK.

In this model social trust is not about relations to people you meet (as in Putnam's model) but about people <b>you</b> <b>imagine.</b>|$|E

25|$|After Labour's 1997 {{election}} victory Banks {{was appointed}} a {{minister in the}} Department for Culture, Media and Sport, responsible for sport. During this time, he called for foreign players in the English Premiership to become eligible to play for England ("can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> seeing Cantona and Giggs swapping the Red of Manchester for the White of England?"). He also caused consternation by suggesting the football teams of the four constituent parts of the UK merge {{to compete in the}} Olympic Games, which eventually occurred for the 2012 Olympics.|$|E
500|$|However, many {{note that}} the {{behavior}} of fans at games is not respectful.

500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project I {{spent a lot of time}} on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

[...] She and Twist separated in 1981 [...] and were divorced in 1983. [...] She sold the Bistro and changed her name back to Lennon by deed poll, later commenting about why it was financially necessary: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> I would have been awarded a three-year contract to design bedding and textiles [...] with the name Powell? Neither did they. When it is necessary to earn a living, it is necessary to bite the bullet and take the flack." ...|$|E

The oldest orca in captivity is the 50-year-old Lolita {{who is at the}} Miami Seaquarium. The average lifespan for a captured orca is 20 to 30 years. Of Granny's age, Captain Pidcock of Ocean Ecoventures Whale Watching said [...] " [...] it’s mind-blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old.

500|$|Tynan, {{who could}} be brutally {{critical}} when he thought Richardson miscast, nevertheless thought there was something godlike about him, [...] "should <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> the Almighty to be a whimsical, enigmatic magician, capable of fearful blunders, sometimes inexplicably ferocious, at other times dazzling in his innocence and benignity". Harold Hobson wrote, [...] "Sir Ralph is an actor who, whatever his failure in heroic parts, however short of tragic grandeur his Othello or his Macbeth may have fallen, has nevertheless, in unromantic tweeds and provincial hats, received a revelation. There are more graceful players than he upon the stage; there is none who has been so touched by Grace." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E

The offended Tatiana ran from the room, [...] "pale as death." [...] Maria eyed the man and said, [...] "Why are you not disgusted with yourselves when you use such shameful words? Do <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> that you can woo a well-born woman with such witticisms and have her be well disposed towards you? Be refined and respectable men {{and then we can}} get along." [...] Ivan Kleschev, a 21-year-old guard, declared that he intended to marry one of the grand duchesses and if her parents said no he would rescue her from the Ipatiev House himself.|$|E
500|$|About casting, Singer said, [...] "You pick {{people not}} {{for what they}} are, but what <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> they can turn into." [...] To {{research}} his role, Spacey met doctors and experts on cerebral palsy and talked with Singer about how it would fit dramatically in the film. They decided that it would affect only {{one side of his}} body. According to Byrne, the cast bonded quickly during rehearsals. Del Toro worked with Alan Shaterian to develop Fenster's distinctive, almost unintelligible speech patterns. According to the actor, the source of his character's unusual speech patterns came from the realization that [...] "the purpose of my character was to die." [...] Del Toro told Singer, [...] "It really doesn't matter what I say so I can go really far out with this and really make it uncomprehensible." ...|$|E
500|$|Native Americans {{opposed to}} mascots {{point to the}} oversimplification of their culture by fans [...] "playing Indian" [...] with no {{understanding}} of the deeper meaning of feathers, face paint, chants, and dancing. Richard Lapchick, director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, wrote: [...] "Could <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> people mocking African Americans in black face at a game? Yet go to a game {{where there is a}} team with an Indian name and you will see fans with war paint on their faces. Is this not the equivalent to black face?" [...] The unofficial mascot of the Redskins team was Zema Williams (aka Chief Zee), an African American man who attended games beginning in 1978 dressed in a red faux-"Indian" [...] costume, complete with feathered war bonnet and tomahawk. Other fans often dress in similar costume for the games.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] was {{directed}} in February 1997 by Gregg Masuak, and filmed in a theatre {{located in the}} north of London. It features the Spice Girls singing and dancing solo in front of various colourful backgrounds whilst filmed with a steadycam. Other scenes show the group performing on a stage in front of an energetic crowd. In addition, there are many background performers doing unusual tricks. Chisholm wrote about the shoot: [...] "We shot the video for 'Who Do You Think You Are' in a really mad club—a real dive. The toilets were horrible and we had to have our make-up done in a Winnebago. The vibe was excellent, though—I think it was my favourite video because it was such good fun. I felt like a proper pop star. [...] It was just how <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> it when you're young".|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{when the}} New England Patriots held their victory celebration after winning their first Super Bowl {{and the first}} {{championship}} {{for the city of}} Boston since the Celtics won the 1986 NBA Championship, linebacker Larry Izzo fired up the crowd, chanting [...] "Yankees suck!" [...] The chant would become a fixture of Patriots Super Bowl victory rallies following their victories in Super Bowls XXXVIII in 2004 and XXXIX in 2005, which were sandwiched around the Red Sox 2004 World Series win. Dan Shaughnessy wrote about the chant: [...] "Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> a Giants or a Jets celebration in New York City in which a New York player would take the time to chant, 'Red Sox suck? Shaughnessy opined that should such a thing occur, it would be more likely at a Jets celebration, as a Giants celebration, like those of the Mets and the Rangers, {{would be more likely to}} feature such chants made in reference to the Philadelphia teams, as one of the Giants' primary rivalries is with the Philadelphia Eagles.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, the band had to remove two of the {{original}} tracks over allegations of copyright infringement. The two tracks, [...] "'Purity" [...] and [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", were inspired by a story that was published online about a girl named Purity Knight, who was kidnapped and buried alive. The website, called Crime Scene, presents fictional stories as real life crime cases. Originally, the website didn't include any disclaimer saying that it was a work of fiction. Many viewers believed that the story was true, including Slipknot frontman, Corey Taylor."I still think the story's real. It fucked our whole world up when we read it. Can <b>you</b> <b>imagine</b> a girl being buried in a box and have all this lecherous bullshit drip down on her from this guy? It just hurts your head." [...] The case was further {{complicated by the fact that}} audio samples from the authoring website were included in [...] "Frail Limb Nursery", which serves as a prelude to [...] "Purity".|$|E
