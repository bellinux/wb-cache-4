500|$|Fincher {{decided to}} use the digital Thomson Viper Filmstream camera to shoot the film. Fincher had {{previously}} used the Thomson Viper {{over the past three years}} on commercials for Nike, Hewlett Packard, Heineken and Lexus which allowed him to get used to and experiment with the equipment. He was able to use inexpensive desktop software like Final Cut Pro to edit Zodiac. Fincher remarked in an interview, [...] "Dailies almost always end up being disappointing, like the veil is pierced and <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for the first time and think, 'Oh my god, this is what I really have to work with.' But when you can see what you have as it's gathered, it can be a much less neurotic process." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{just sort}} of sits there with her {{cigarette}} and her hair, and she would pull stuff— these very disparate elements— and put them together into this ensemble, and you'd go, [...] "Come on, Pat, you can't wear that with that." [...] She'd say, [...] "Eh, just try it on." [...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, but it works on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle. <b>You</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> and you go, [...] "That shirt, that tie, that jacket, that vest? What?" [...] But it works.|$|E
500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968. The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> I want you to think how nice it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E

500|$|During the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, {{controversy}} arose when Jordan {{was seen}} gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, {{the night before}} {{a game against the}} New York Knicks. In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah." [...] When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, [...] "No." ...|$|E
500|$|Miller later {{noted that}} unlike other episode scenes {{such as in}} [...] "Grey Matters", Walter's {{breakdown}} at the supermarket [...] "came largely out of nowhere. It was a thought experiment that took {{on a life of}} its own." [...] Miller continued that at the time, he and Stentz thought they were writing Olivia-focused episodes, but [...] "In retrospect, we really wrote a four-part story about Walter, his relationship to children, and the struggle between Walter-who-was and Walter-who-is. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> that way, his decision at the end of 'Northwest Passage' becomes the moment where he reconciles those things. He doesn't resolve them, but he comes to grips with them. Once again in retrospect, I think that's what the supermarket breakdown was really about. This happens — you think a scene is about one thing when you're in the middle of it, and realize it's something else entirely when you look back. Characters can be sneaky motherfuckers that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any way <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> Episode Two stands out, {{even among the}} Half-Life series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns {{and the introduction of}} side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile." [...] The New York Times enjoyed the gameplay, saying, [...] "The battles in Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes." ...|$|E

500|$|Both Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave Enthiran {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Chopra criticised the film's {{portions}} in the second half, describing them as [...] "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, [...] "Robot rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." [...] Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar [...] "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." [...] She concluded that, [...] "Whichever way <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> [...] is one of those rare films that give you just enough material to pull you in, and enjoy yourself." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave {{a rating of}} three out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from [...] that keeps the film fresh." [...] Mayank Shekhar, writing for Hindustan Times, rated it three stars and said, [...] "Leave aside jokes running on the Internet. This film, just a few feet too long, is fine entertainment by itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{supervised}} {{the composition of}} the DVD packaging {{and was one of the}} first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video [...] "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: [...] "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> the more you'll get out of it." [...] The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title [...] "Fight Club" [...] was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, [...] "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside." [...] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: [...] "From a retail standpoint, [...] has incredible shelf-presence." ...|$|E
500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> you'll see the big effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed {{for the first time the}} standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to say," [...] replied Mr. George. [...] "It was such a complicated case {{that you could not}} decide it either way. The question was like a piece of changeable silk. You could make it look green or brown, just according to the way <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> When <b>you</b> come to read the history you will see just how it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|In like manner, a gentian {{does not}} produce the {{sensation}} of blueness if <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> But it has always the power of doing so; its particles being everlastingly so arranged by its Maker. And, therefore, the gentian and the sky are always verily blue, whatever philosophy may say to the contrary; {{and if you do}} not see them blue when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, <b>it</b> is not their fault but yours.[52] ...|$|R

500|$|Additional {{commissions}} from important {{clients as}} well as notable buildings continued in the 1970s. Construction on the Koubek-designed , $23 million L'Enfant Plaza Hotel and office building began until June 1971. In July 1970, construction began on his 37-story, pink granite United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company Building in Baltimore. It was the largest building yet constructed in the United States to employ the slipform method of continuously poured concrete. The USF Building successfully sparked the economic revival of the Inner Harbor. Opened in 1974, as of 2010 it remained the tallest building in Baltimore. Forty years later, it is considered a Baltimore landmark. Richard Burns of Design Collective Inc. has said, [...] "In my opinion, his USF tower, now Legg Mason, {{is one of the}} best if not the best office buildings in downtown Baltimore. It is simple, direct and honest..." [...] David Wallace, whose Wallace Roberts and Todd designed the master site plan for the Inner Harbor, declared it the [...] "linchpin for the Inner Harbor. If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from a boat, it's a punctuation point at one corner of the Inner Harbor, signifying where the central business district meets the waterfront." [...] Construction started on his eight-story 2021 K Street NW office building in November 1970. In the summer of 1971, he completed his site plan for Friendship Heights, a [...] site straddling the boundary between the District of Columbia and Maryland border at Friendship Heights/Friendship Village. The plan contemplated several high-rise office buildings, a loop roadway around the site, pedestrian concourses, and several multi-story shopping malls clustered around the intersection of Wisconsin Avenue and Western Avenue. (The project was built throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s.) In March 1971, the American Automobile Association commissioned him to design a six-story, $10-million headquarters for the group at 8111 Gatehouse Road in Fairfax, Virginia. Eight months later, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) began construction on a Koubek-designed headquarters at 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW, three blocks northwest from his 1965 office building and across the street from the Philippine Embassy. In March 1974, developer Melvin Lenkin commissioned Koubek to design an all-glass Modernist building for 1900 M Street NW. [...] Koubek designed an eight-story cubist building with an all-glass facade; cutaway, cantilevered front corner; and ground floor arcade. In March 1975, the National Bank of Washington, one of the city's oldest and most storied banks, commissioned a new operations center (4340 Connecticut Avenue NW) from Koubek. In May 1975, Koubek joined a consortium of prominent local architects to design the Washington Harbor complex of buildings on the Georgetown waterfront. The three-block-long, eight-building complex, which contained luxury condominiums, office space, restaurants, luxury retail space, a boardwalk, and plaza, was the first large-scale redevelopment of Georgetown's waterfront in the city's history. By the end of 1975, The New York Times was reporting that Koubek's firm had designed roughly half the office buildings built in the District of Columbia since the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Francis fears some clerics [...] "become {{wolves and}} not shepherds; ... careerism {{and the search}} for a {{promotion}} [...] come under the category of spiritual worldliness", deceitfully trying to appear holy. Francis became known for his snarky remarks. He said of clerical vanity: [...] "Look at the peacock; it's beautiful if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from the front. But if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from behind, you discover the truth. ...Whoever gives in to such self-absorbed vanity has huge misery hiding inside them".

5000|$|Hauer's enthusiasm {{caught the}} {{imagination}} of his colleague at Yale, Norman Carlberg. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist Josef Albers. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit formalism and even minimalism which held itself aloof {{from some of the}} other artistic trends of the time, such as the pop art and post-modernism that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle [...] "you analysed, <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> something, but <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

2500|$|Crime la Elsinore is {{a return}} to prose satire, in this case {{directed}} at the theatrical environment. The setting is a fictional theater in provincial Călăraşi, deriving its name from the Getic ruler Dromichaetes, and the protagonists, Cosmin Ciotloş notes, are composite portrayals rather than the [...] "masked" [...] characters of Căderea Bastiliei. He argues: [...] "Whichever way <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids, the novel stands only to gain." [...] The narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of Shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions. The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from Pierre Beaumarchais, Euripides and Molière, while adopting the format of a detective novel.|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so that when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.|$|E
