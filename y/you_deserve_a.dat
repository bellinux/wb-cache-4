500|$|The {{prosecution}} called 64 separate witnesses. Essone, Mbene, and Aubame {{claimed that}} {{their involvement in}} the coup was {{due to a lack}} of development in the Gabonese army. [...] Judge Leon Auge, the judge in the case, said that if [...] "that is the only reason for your coup d'état, <b>you</b> <b>deserve</b> <b>a</b> severe penalty." [...] Essone said that almost all Gabonese military officers knew of an imminent coup beforehand, while Aubame affirmed his position that he did not participate in its planning. According to him, he formed the provisional government in a constitutional manner, and at the request of some [...] "putschists". He reasoned that the French intervention was effectively an illegal act of interference, an assertion which Gondjout and the former education minister, Jean Marc Ekoh, shared. Ekoh had served as Foreign Minister during the coup. The Gabonese actor said that it should be the French troops being tried, not he and his comrades: [...] "If we'd been able to put up a few more Gabonese soldiers against the French, we'd have won— and we shouldn't be here today." ...|$|E
