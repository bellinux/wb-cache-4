5|$|The Little Applegate River's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled about 11,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Latgawa, Shasta, and Dakubetede Native American tribes. The first non-indigenous settlers {{arrived in the}} early 19th century. Two boomtowns—Sterlingville and Buncom—were founded in the 1850s and grew rapidly as gold and other precious metals were discovered. They slowly declined in population as the supply of gold was exhausted; only three buildings remain in Buncom, while Sterlingville was abandoned and later destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Big Butte Creek's {{watershed}} {{was originally}} settled over 8,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Klamath, Upper Umpqua, and Takelma tribes of Native Americans. In the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s, {{most of the}} Native Americans were either killed or forced onto Indian reservations. The first non-indigenous settlers arrived in the 1860s, naming the creek after Snowy Butte, an early name for Mount McLoughlin. In the late 19th century, the watershed was primarily used for agriculture and logging. The small city of Butte Falls was incorporated in 1911, and remains the only incorporated town within the watershed's boundaries.|$|E

5|$|The Nile {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans {{the opportunity to develop}} a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization.

5|$|The city of Vijithapura, {{which the}} Mahavamsa {{refers to as}} Vijitha Nagara, had been founded nearly three hundred <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> brother in law of king Panduvasudeva.

The wall had four wrought iron gates on the north, south, east and west. The Rajavaliya describes Vijithapura as a fortress second only to Anuradhapura.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} in the {{sanctuary}} that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is planning to break a seal made hundreds of <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending {{the descendants of the}} Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E

5|$|Madagascar's varied fauna and flora are {{endangered}} by human activity. Since {{the arrival of}} humans around 2,350years ago, Madagascar has lost more than 90percent of its original forest. This forest loss is largely fueled by tavy ("fat"), a traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practice imported to Madagascar by the earliest settlers. Malagasy farmers embrace and perpetuate the practice {{not only for its}} practical benefits as an agricultural technique, but for its cultural associations with prosperity, health and venerated ancestral custom (fomba malagasy). As human population density rose on the island, deforestation accelerated beginning around 1400 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, the central highlands had been largely cleared of their original forests. More recent contributors to the loss of forest cover include the growth in cattle herd size since their introduction around 1000 years ago, a continued reliance on charcoal as a fuel for cooking, and the increased prominence of coffee as a cash crop over the past century. According to a conservative estimate, about 40percent of the island's original forest cover was lost from the 1950s to 2000, with a thinning of remaining forest areas by 80percent. In addition to traditional agricultural practice, wildlife conservation is challenged by the illicit harvesting of protected forests, as well as the state-sanctioned harvesting of precious woods within national parks. Although banned by then-President Marc Ravalomanana from 2000 to 2009, the collection of small quantities of precious timber from national parks was re-authorized in January 2009 and dramatically intensified under the administration of Andry Rajoelina as a key source of state revenues to offset cuts in donor support following Ravalomanana's ousting.|$|E

25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a lock {{mechanism}} that uses pins of varying lengths to prevent the lock from opening without the correct key. Pin tumblers are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E
