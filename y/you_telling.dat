500|$|Back to the Future {{opened on}} July 3, 1985, on 1,200 screens in North America. Zemeckis was {{concerned}} the film would flop because Fox had to film a Family Ties special in London and {{was unable to}} promote the film. Gale was also dissatisfied with Universal Pictures' tagline [...] "Are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me my mother's got the hots for me?".|$|E
500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to go make our own version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E

5000|$|Sheehan {{attracted}} {{international attention}} in early August 2005, when she traveled to President Bush's Prairie Chapel Ranch, just outside Crawford, Texas, demanding a second {{meeting with the}} President. She told members of Veterans for Peace, [...] "I'm gonna say, 'And <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me, what the noble cause is that my son died for.' And if he even starts to say freedom and democracy, I'm gonna say, bullshit. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> me the truth. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> me that my son died for oil. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> me that my son died to make your friends rich.... <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> me that, <b>you</b> don't <b>tell</b> me my son died for freedom and democracy." [...] She also vowed not to pay her federal income tax for 2004 {{because that was the}} year her son was killed.|$|R
2500|$|He {{added that}} at first the {{organization}} had considered denying the false information with a written message, [...] "but when the news agencies began to publish it we decided to hold a televised interview, and here I am before <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> you I was not poisoned." ...|$|E
2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't seem to me to coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2006, 22-year-old Melinda Duckett {{committed}} suicide following an interview conducted by Grace concerning {{the disappearance of}} Duckett's 2-year-old son Trenton. Grace interviewed Duckett {{less than two weeks}} after the child went missing, questioning her for her alleged lack of openness regarding her son's disappearance, asking Duckett [...] "Where were you? Why aren't <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> us where you were that day?" [...] Duckett appeared confused and was unable to answer whether or not she had taken a polygraph test. When Grace asked her why she could not account for specific details, Duckett began to reply, [...] "Because I was told not to," [...] to which Grace responded, [...] "Ms. Duckett, you are not telling us for a reason. What is the reason? You refuse to give even the simplest facts of where you were with your son before he went missing. It is day twelve." [...] According to the CNN transcript, Duckett replied, [...] "(INAUDIBLE) with all media. It's not just there, just all media. Period." [...] Grace then moved on to a psychologist who asserted that Duckett was [...] "skirting around the issue." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Enough," [...] said Hurlstone hoarsely; [...] "say no more. Only I implore <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> {{me what to}} do now to save her. I will--if <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> me to do it--leave her forever." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rowe was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} the on-camera host as well and he appeared in taped footage as himself during the first season of shooting. As filming of the first season was nearing completion, Discovery greenlighted production on another Rowe project, Dirty Jobs, under the condition that Rowe choose only one show on which to appear on camera. As Rowe relates the story, Discovery told him that the two shows would be airing back-to-back on the same night, thus, [...] "We can't have <b>you</b> <b>telling</b> us stories about six dead fishermen on camera and making a fart joke with your arm in a cow's ass." [...] Most of the footage Rowe shot during the first season became part of the first season's [...] "Behind the Scenes" [...] episode. After the third season of Deadliest Catch, Rowe began hosting a post-season behind-the-scenes miniseries entitled After the Catch, a roundtable discussion featuring the captains relating their experiences filming the preceding season's episodes. A season 3 episode of Dirty Jobs (2007-2008) saw Rowe return to Alaska {{to take part in a}} job tangentially related to the fishing industry — diesel fuel spill cleanup. Another episode that same season featured Rowe at work on board the F/V Legacy doing trawl fishing and at-sea shellfish and other seafood processing, during which Rowe made numerous references to the crab fishing of Deadliest Catch.|$|E
