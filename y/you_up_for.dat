500|$|To avoid {{confusion}} with Larter and Carter, Cook {{was required to}} dye her hair brown for the role. [...] "I like being a chameleon. It opens <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> so much more in this work. You don't get typecast," [...] Cook professed. Landes also denied plots regarding Thomas and Kimberly's relationship. [...] "It's kind of a protected relationship, more like a brother/sister thing than a love interest. They didn’t want to go there, I guess. They did go that way in an earlier draft of the script but they didn’t want it to seem like the cop is like lascivious or something. So what they have now, hopefully, {{is a little bit}} of chemistry and you get the idea that through tragedy something good will come. So it ends in an optimistic way, that maybe they can be together but there’s no real love story," [...] Landes articulated.|$|E
500|$|The season saw {{drastic changes}} to the series' alien mythology. In the premiere episode, [...] "Herrenvolk", Williams—the actor who played Mulder's {{informant}} X—was written out of the show. He said that, [...] "Carter called me up personally [...] 'Got good news, got bad news. The good news is we're gonna bring <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> another episode this week. The bad news is you're gonna take a bullet." [...] The writers created a new character, Marita Covarrubias, to function as Mulder's informant. Carter felt it would be [...] "more interesting for Mulder's next contact to be a woman", noting that he [...] "wanted there to be some suspicion about whether Mulder would become involved with her romantically. [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] also introduced the killer bees, who {{would go on to}} play a larger part in the 1998 film. Carter described the fourth season as [...] "maybe the most intense and difficult season of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{unusually large}} amount of in-camera effects {{were used for the}} pilot in place of {{computer}} generated imagery, including [...] "upside-down day"; shots of Haller using his abilities, where multiple takes of debris were filmed in controlled camera movements and then overlayed on shots of Stevens acting on his own; a montage that appears as a single camera movement, pulling [...] "back in slow motion as we see David Haller’s childhood progress"; and a one-shot action sequence—actually filmed in two shots that were later connected with visual effects—that saw the camera mounted on a cable and run down a hill side. Hawley admitted {{that it would be a}} challenge for the series' other directors to maintain this quality of visuals with much less time to film each episode: Hawley had 21 days to film the pilot, but the subsequent episodes were only scheduled 8 days of filming each. Some of these shoots ultimately had to be extended to 10 or 11 days filming to meet Hawley's vision, which he said were [...] "not good calls to have but what are you going to do? It’s a huge show." [...] Keller felt that each episode in the season was noticeably different from the others, calling the series a uniquely [...] "director-driven show. It's almost like the episode prior doesn't set <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> how the next episode is going to go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Portillo's defeat {{represented}} a 17.4% swing to Labour. Symbolising {{the loss of}} the election by the Conservative Party, it has been referred to as [...] "the Portillo moment", and in the cliché [...] "Were <b>you</b> <b>up</b> <b>for</b> Portillo?" [...] (i.e., [...] "Were you awake/did you see Portillo's result announced on television?") Portillo himself commented, thirteen years later, that as a consequence [...] "My name is now synonymous with eating a bucketload of shit in public." ...|$|E
