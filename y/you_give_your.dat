[...] In the 1971 biopic, George Hamilton (as Evel) emphasizes in the opening monologue that a man does not go back on his word.|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{also told}} the Dutch {{newspaper}} de Volkskrant that Voldemort was modeled on Hitler and Stalin, as a megalomaniac and paranoid figure, {{and that she}} was influenced by the Second World War, which is [...] "anchored in all our minds": discussing Draco Malfoy, she claimed [...] "Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy.

2500|$|The oral {{evaluations}} {{are intended}} to also help the evaluator improve {{his or her ability}} to give constructive feedback to other Toastmasters. Learning to give feedback develops many skills, some of which include: effective listening; how to motivate, encourage and support other members; and how to develop and present a short evaluation with minimal preparation.

That, as spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics and moral conduct, and always shall question and argue, even if his accusers — Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus — withdraw their accusations against him. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of Athens asks his fellow citizens: [...] "Are you not ashamed that <b>you</b> <b>give</b> <b>your</b> attention to acquiring {{as much money as}} possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yonder iceberg; look at it! There's {{the nose}} and chin, exactly, of the {{extraordinary}} hag <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>your</b> silk pocket-handkerchief to at parting. Now, I never saw such a miserable old woman as that before; did you?" ...|$|R
