5|$|On July 23, the IAU issued Circular 6187 to {{announce}} the joint discovery of the new comet. Per Hale, calculations indicate that Hale–Bopp likely last appeared {{on the order of}} 4000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> any record of this previous encounter had not yet been positively identified from ancient records. It has also been determined that Hale–Bopp will not return to the inner solar system until approximately 4385.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} star-formation {{scenario}} for Betelgeuse {{is that it}} is a runaway star from the Orion OB1 Association. Originally a member of a high-mass multiple system within Ori OB1a, Betelgeuse was probably formed about 10–12 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> has evolved rapidly due to its high mass.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} of Carpathia and Pannonia has been ongoing since 20 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> has {{decreased}} during the Quaternary. No eruptions have occurred in the Holocene. The last volcanism occurred at Ciomadul in the last glacial age. Sparse basaltic volcanism has also occurred in the area, forming monogenetic volcanic fields.|$|E

5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} {{far side}} of the Moon and was found by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It is an area of concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E
5|$|The Snake River Plain is a {{volcanic}} province {{that was created}} {{by a series of}} cataclysmic caldera-forming eruptions which started about 15 million years ago. A migrating hotspot thought to now exist under Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park has been implicated. This hot spot was under the Craters of the Moon area some 10 to 11million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> 'moved' as the North American Plate migrated southwestward. Pressure from the hot spot heaves the land surface up, creating fault-block mountains. After the hot spot passes the pressure is released and the land subsides.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for starfish is ancient, {{dating back to}} the Ordovician around 450 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> it is rather poor, as starfish tend to {{disintegrate}} after death. Only the ossicles and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> <b>But</b> {{the vast majority of the}} land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E
5|$|About 298 {{million years}} ago Permian forests started to cover the continent, and there were tundras as late as 15 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow {{extensive}} vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor soil quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The flora of the continent largely consists of bryophytes. There are about 100 species of mosses and 25 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, {{all of which are}} found in the Antarctic Peninsula: Deschampsia antarctica (Antarctic hair grass), Colobanthus quitensis (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native Poa annua (annual bluegrass). Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in the area before the last {{glaciation}} between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea. The oldest signs of habitation on the marshes are prehistoric Clactonian flint blades possibly from 400,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> few other prehistoric remains have been recorded here.|$|E

The Japan trade deficit with other countries was over 1 trillion yen in April 2014, and it went down to 909bn yen ($8.9bn, £5.2bn) in May 2014. But the country is still running a trade deficit for the 23rd straight month.|$|R

5|$|Throughout history, the Earth's {{atmosphere}} and biogeochemical cycles {{have been in}} a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems. The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability. The evolution of the earliest organisms, likely anaerobic methanogen microbes, started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane (4H2 + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O). Anoxygenic photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H2S + CO2 + hv → CH2O + H2O + 2S). Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the Great Oxidation) did not begin until approximately 2.4–2.3billion <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1billion years prior.|$|E
5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this temporal and spatial evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E
5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when the Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
50|$|Latin {{dedication}} is a Latin quatrain in elegiac couplet {{addressed and}} {{dedicated to the}} Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It expresses patriotism and loyalty to the Grand Dukes and emphasizes that the Lithuanian Reformation serves not only God but the country as well.

60|$|The ten-year {{arrangement}} was due a <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> failed to connect. At least completely. A year's compromise was arranged. A new arrangement must be effected {{before the last}} day of this year. Otherwise the two countries become separate entities. The Emperor would still be King of Hungary--that is, King of an independent foreign country. There would be Hungarian custom-houses on the Austrian border, and there would be a Hungarian army and a Hungarian foreign office. Both countries would be weakened by this, both would suffer damage.|$|R

5|$|Due to {{the small}} range of the bluebuck {{at the time of}} European {{settlement}} of the Cape region in the 17th and 18th centuries compared to the much wider area evidenced by fossil remains, it is thought the species was already in decline before this time. The bluebuck was the sole species of Hippotragus in the region until 70,00035,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> the roan antelope appears to have become predominant about 11,000 years ago. This might have coincided with grasslands being replaced by, for example, brush and forest, thereby reducing what is presumed to be the preferred habitat of the bluebuck, the grasslands. The results of the sea level changes in the early Holocene may also {{have played a role in}} the decline of the species, and left only the southern population to survive into historical times.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>but</b> due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a felt-tip pen, and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E
5|$|Paleo-Indians {{visited the}} area about 12,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>but</b> {{did not leave}} much archaeological {{evidence}}. Northern Shoshone created trails through the Craters of the Moon Lava Field during their summer migrations from the Snake River to the camas prairie, west of the lava field. Stone windbreaks at Indian Tunnel were used to protect campsites from the dry summer wind. No evidence exists for permanent habitation by any Native American group. A hunting and gathering culture, the Northern Shoshone pursued elk, bears, American bison, cougars, and bighorn sheep— all large game who no longer range the area. The most recent volcanic eruptions ended about 2,100 years ago and were likely witnessed by the Shoshone people. Shoshone legend speaks of a serpent on a mountain who, angered by lightning, coiled around and squeezed the mountain until liquid rock flowed, fire shot from cracks, and the mountain exploded.|$|E
