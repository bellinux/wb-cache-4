The outcome was that 57.5% of Wales' population indicated their sole national identity to be Welsh; a further 7.1% indicated it to be both Welsh and British. No Welsh national identity was indicated by 34.1%. The proportion giving their sole national identity as British was 16.9%, and another 9.4% included British with another national identity.

50|$|As {{the rule}} {{evaluation}} {{is based on}} calling simpler and simpler rules, at the bottom {{there should be some}} primitive rules that do the actual work. That is where CDL1 is very surprising: it does not have those primitives. You have to provide those rules yourself. If you need addition in your program, you have to create a rule that has two input parameters and one output parameter and the output is set to be the sum of the two inputs by your code. The CDL compiler uses your code as strings (there are conventions how to refer to the input and output variables) and simply emits it as needed. If <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> adding rule using assembly, then you will need an assembler to translate the CDL compiler's output to machine code. If you describe all the primitive rules (macros in CDL terminology) in Pascal or C, then you need a Pascal or C compiler to run after the CDL compiler. This lack of core primitives can be very painful when you have to write a snippet of code even for the simplest machine instruction operation {{but on the other hand}} it gives you great flexibility in implementing esoteric abstract primitives acting on exotic abstract objects (the 'machine word' in CDL is more like 'unit of data storage', with no reference to the kind of data stored there). Additionally large projects made use of carefully crafted libraries of primitives. These were then replicated for each target architecture and OS allowing the production of highly efficient code for all.|$|E

Or would you rather use a descriptive phrase, or even a metaphor, to summarily reveal your organization’s culture? Metaphor analysis, as a means to uncover organizational culture, is an increasingly popular strategy for qualitative researchers. In interpretative qualitative studies, metaphors comprise a form of linguistic analysis which assists researchers who are interested in an intensive but short-term evaluation of organizational culture (Patton, 2002; Schmitt, 2005). Since language serves as a pivotal cultural artifact, metaphors emerge from that sphere as a particularly expressive language form...|$|E

[24] Patients reporting meaningful change (much worse, worse, improved, much improved) were included in the responsiveness analysis to detect the ability of the PROs to measure meaningful levels of change.

40|$|Caring {{for people}} with chronic and complex health needs has become an ever-larger part of {{everyday}} nursing. The World Health Organization has identified common and preventable risk factors that are {{the primary cause of}} chronic illness worldwide—hypertension, tobacco use, hyperglycaemia, physical inactivity, and overweight or obesity. Nurses now need an expanded range of skills and expertise that will enable them to work effectively with people whose chronic and frequently complex health issues may be seen as difficult and challenging. This article invites you to think about your experiences of caring {{for people with}} chronic and complex conditions.

30|$|Animal-assisted {{intervention}} (AAI) is {{an approach}} recently {{introduced into the}} hospital environment {{to improve the quality}} of hospitalization and provide important benefits for patients with chronic diseases and long-term hospitalizations. This work aims to verify the effects of animal-assisted activity (AAA) on the expression and quality of self-reported pain in hospitalized children and adolescents, while considering the subjects’ subjectivity. The participants were 17 hospitalized children/adolescents of both genders, aged 7  years and older, who complained of pain. Two therapy dogs were selected for the intervention according to the criteria of international protocols. The participants were asked an open question (“How would <b>you</b> <b>describe</b> <b>your</b> pain?”). After the question, an AAA session, which lasted between 5 and 10  min, was held with random activities spontaneously chosen by the subject. The open question was asked again at the end of the session, without the presence of the dog. Positive effects were observed in this population with regard to a decrease in self-reported pain. These results suggest that there is a possible symbolic elaboration of pain by the subject, in which the dog might represent acceptance and affection at a moment of great emotional suffering.|$|E
