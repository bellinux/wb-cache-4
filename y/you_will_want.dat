500|$|An EDM and pop {{song that}} was solely written and {{produced}} by D'banj himself. According to Don Boye from tooXclusive, the singer's approach {{on the track}} was simple, consisting of an [...] "amazing beat" [...] with fairly [...] "basic lyrics". Lyrically, [...] "Finally" [...] details the singer's [...] "subliminal" [...] and [...] "egotistic" [...] side, featuring the protagonist begging: [...] "You will love me finally / You will need me finally / <b>You</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> me finally".|$|E
500|$|On 16 December 2013, {{the anniversary}} of the attack, activists held {{memorials}} throughout New Delhi in memory of the victim widely known as Nirbhaya, meaning [...] "fearless". Members of women's organisations lit candles in her memory and protested against exploitation of women. University students and others organised a candlelight march at the bus stand in South Delhi where Nirbhaya and her friend, Pandey, boarded the bus in which the rape and beatings took place. At a commemorative prayer meeting political leaders resolved to increase efforts to improve women's security. Speaking with the victim's mother, former chief minister Sheila Dikshit said that Delhi's society and the various authorities will work together to build a permanent legacy to her daughter: [...] "...whatever <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> in her memory, we will try to fulfill. And we will try with a conviction that such an incident is not repeated with anybody else in the future". [...] The victim's parents spoke at a memorial saying that they were proud of the courage that their daughter showed, which they believe [...] "has spurred more women to speak out instead of hiding the crimes committed against them".|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>want</b> to pick it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
