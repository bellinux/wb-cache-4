[...] "Between the Lines" [...] was written with The Animals, The Zombies and Paul Revere & the Raiders in mind, and Weiland considered [...] "Cinnamon" [...] to {{be a combination of}} 1960s British pop and Ian Curtis (of Joy Division). [...] "Huckleberry Crumble" [...] was inspired by Aerosmith, specifically [...] "Same Old Song and Dance". Dean admitted to the similarities: [...] "The arrangement is almost the same: riff, solo, verse, chorus, solo, back to a second verse—it's pretty much the same setup." [...] He also noted how the song sounded different {{depending on the type of}} instruments used to play it.

[...] "Basically, it's the end of the world; the entire nation is zombies", stated Gardner. [...] "And [...] are trying to get from the east coast to the west coast". For one shooting scene, Gardner said, [...] "There were 160 zombies, in prosthetics, on set in an amusement park".
