500|$|Reviewers have {{suggested}} various interpretations. According to Christina González of The Escapist, Pyramid Head acts as [...] "judgement personified, a dark butcher," [...] and [...] "James' masochistic delusion" [...] which punishes him for Mary's death. Ken Gagne of Computerworld {{suggested that the}} monster [...] "represents James' anger and guilt." [...] A critic for IGN, Jesse Schedeen, considered Pyramid Head's role throughout the Silent Hill series to be [...] "a manifestation of a person's guilt", commenting: [...] "Pyramid Head is just there to help <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> your penance in the most painful and grotesque way possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{collapsing}} {{economic boom}} and the publicity surrounding the corrupt real estate deals, {{the severity of}} the disaster in Southeast Florida was downplayed. The Tampa Tribune owner Peter O. Knight described the situation as [...] "trivial". The Tampa Board of Trade sent a telegraph to the United States Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C., on September17, informing them that the damage had been [...] "exaggerated". The board even considered protesting news agencies that write [...] "exaggerated" [...] reports and warned that there would be requests for retraction. Knight was harshly criticized for marginalizing the disaster, with Palm Beach County Red Cross Chairman Howard Shelby responding with a telegraph stating, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> as a spokesman for the entire state, won't you kindly make a personal visit here?", while the Okeechobee News called Knight [...] "a jackass".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's going to stand up and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E

500|$|When Leslie {{notes to}} the camera crew {{that they seem to}} be getting along just like when they made love five years earlier, she realizes he was drunk then too. When the bar closes, the two decide to keep {{drinking}} alongside the pit outside Ann's house, which Leslie plans to turn into a park. When Leslie asks whether he thinks the park will ever be made, a pragmatic Mark says it will be a difficult process with a lot of red tape, but she remains optimistic. During a fight, Andy admits to Ann that he postponed having the casts removed, but explains it was because, [...] "I really, really like it when <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> me food." [...] Ann throws him out, and Andy sees Mark kiss Leslie. Leslie stops his advances because she does not want to move forward when he is drunk. As Mark starts to leave, he falls into the pit. An amused Andy tells Ann, who rushes out to help him while Andy goes back inside and watches television.|$|E
500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Rock Show" [...] were improvised by the actors. Paul Schneider made up his own {{dialogue}} during the scene in which he and Poehler sit next to the pit and he talks about it as if it is already a park. Poehler's laughter at his jokes in this scene is her genuine reaction. Pratt also improvised much of his own dialogue, including his rationale to Ann for why he lied about his leg casts: [...] "I really, really like it when <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> me food." [...] Pratt also changed the reaction his character had to Mark falling into the pit. The script originally called for Andy to be serious and concerned, but Pratt changed it so his character thought the fall was funny. Pratt also improvised the songs he sang during an early scene in the episode, in which Andy makes up songs about random items in Ann's living room out of boredom from wearing the casts for so long. One of the songs he sings is about a lamp, and included the lyrics, [...] "I wish you were a lamp that would light up when you get touched." [...] Pratt thought of the song because he had recently gotten such a lamp as a gift from a friend.|$|E
500|$|In 1976 Hordern {{joined the}} RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he {{appeared}} as Prospero for Trevor Nunn in The Tempest, an engagement which the actor {{found to be}} unpleasant because of his poor relationship with the show's director, Clifford Williams. After that came a short run of Love's Labour's Lost in which he played Don Adriano de Armado opposite Alan Rickman and Zoë Wanamaker. Hordern was the oldest member {{of the company and}} found it difficult to adjust to the behaviour and attitudes of some of the younger and less experienced actors. He found it different from the 1950s: non-intimate, characterless, and lacking in morale because management preferred discipline rather than offering guidance and assistance to their young actors. Writing in his 1993 biography, Hordern wrote: [...] "Being at Stratford again after all these years was rather like being on a battleship or an aircraft carrier that doesn't often come into harbour. You are at sea for long periods and away from the rest of your service and if the captain of your ship is a good one then the ship is happy; if not, then the commission <b>you</b> <b>serve</b> is very unhappy because you are a long way from land. At Stratford that season I was a long way from land." [...] Later, in 1976, Hordern portrayed the kingly father of the Prince (played by Richard Chamberlain) in the musical film adaptation of Cinderella, The Slipper and the Rose, and returned to the role of George in Stoppard's Jumpers at the Lyttelton Theatre. The theatre critic Kenneth Hurren [...] "enjoyed it immoderately" [...] and thought the revival revealed a [...] "tidier play than it look". Hordern compared it to the 1972 version by saying: [...] "It is unquestionably a busy little number, and my first impression of the piece, back in 1972, was that it had more decoration than substance, and that the decoration was more chaotic than coherent." ...|$|E
