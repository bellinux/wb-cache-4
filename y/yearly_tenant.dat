60|$|In the {{following}} spring a vexatious incident occurred in Warwick Street. The highly-considered county member, who was the <b>yearly</b> <b>tenant</b> of Mr. Rodney's first floor, and had been always a valuable patron, suddenly died. An adjourned debate, a tough beefsteak, a select committee still harder, and an influenza caught at {{three o'clock in the}} morning in an imprudent but irresistible walk home with a confidential Lord of the Treasury, had combined very sensibly to affect the income of Mr. Rodney. At first he was sanguine that such a desirable dwelling would soon find a suitable inhabitant, especially as Mr. Waldershare assured him that he would mention the matter to all his friends. But time rolled on, and the rooms were still vacant; and the fastidious Rodneys, who at first would only listen to a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenant,</b> began to reduce their expectations. Matters had arrived at such a pass in May, that, for the first time in their experience, they actually condescended to hoist an announcement of furnished apartments.|$|E

I do not tell you that your bedroom floors is firm, for firm they are not. The gas-fitter himself allowed, that to make a firm job, he must go right under your jistes, and it were not worth the outlay as a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenant</b> so to do. The piping is carried above your jistes, and it is best that it should be made known to you.’ ...|$|E
50|$|This was a {{fulling mill}} originally. It {{was known as}} Powle Mill in 1629. It {{was part of the}} manor of Newnham Court (owned by Sir John Astley), which had been in the {{ownership}} of Boxley Abbey. The mill was later converted to papermaking. John Swinnock was the tenant from 1708-1728, being followed by William Gill. He was followed by Joseph Cordwell, who was the tenant until 1756. The mill at this time being owned by the Earl of Aylesford. In 1756, the mill was let to Abraham Fearon, a watchmaker from Soho. Clement Taylor was the dext tenant, until his death in 1776, followed by his son James as a <b>yearly</b> <b>tenant.</b> James Whatman Jr bought the mill in June 1785 and Poll Mill worked in conjunction with Turkey Mill from then on. The mill was demolished in 1836 in order to create the Lake at Mote Park, Maidstone.|$|E
50|$|The clauses {{relating}} to custom affected {{only a minority}} of the 600,000 tenant farmers in Ireland. Therefore, it was the clauses {{relating to}} <b>yearly</b> <b>tenants</b> unprotected by custom which formed the most important clauses in the Act. Although the clauses on compensation for improvements were significantly better than previous legislation, their power was limited by the complicated procedure for claiming and assessing compensation. The overall effect, however, was to strengthen the position of the tenant by presuming that the improvements were his work.|$|R
