50|$|Take fiction as an example: If a {{librarian}} isn't sure where to shelve a book, {{that may be}} because the material is interstitial in some way, not fitting comfortably into a single, conventional literary category.

5000|$|The {{agency in}} charge of admitting new {{citizens}} is the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, commonly abbreviated as USCIS. It is a bureau of the Department of Homeland Security. It offers web-based services. The agency depends on application fees for revenue; in 2009, with a struggling economy, applications were down sharply, and consequently there was much less revenue to upgrade and streamline services. There was speculation that if the administration of president Barack Obama passed immigration reform measures, then the agency could face a [...] "welcome but overwhelming surge of Americans-in-waiting" [...] and longer processing times for citizenship applications. The USCIS has made efforts to digitize records. A USCIS website says the [...] "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is committed to offering the best possible service to you, our customer" [...] and which says [...] "With our focus on customer service, we offer you a variety of services {{both before and after}} <b>you</b> <b>file</b> your case."

50|$|Sepang {{starts with}} a long pit {{straight}} where the DRS zone exists - {{it is important to}} get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. You brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as <b>you</b> <b>file</b> round the corner, similar to Shanghai's first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track. Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 - known locally as the Langkawi Curve - a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the Genting Curve. Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here. Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging 'Sunway Lagoon' curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for overtaking as you can brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin {{but you have to be}} careful not to get re-overtaken as you come into turn 1.|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{that you}} work for the Department of Transportation for the state. You are fifty-five years old and {{have been working for}} the Department for over twenty years. One day, you walk into work and your {{supervisor}} says, 2 ̆ 2 You 2 ̆ 7 re fired: you are too old. 2 ̆ 2 Undoubtedly, your employer violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). As mandated by the ADEA, <b>you</b> <b>file</b> a charge of age discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Commission investigates and grants you the authority to file a civil suit in federal court. In court, the judge informs you that the ADEA is not applicable against the states. You petition the court to amend your complaint, you now wish to assert a § 1983 claim against your supervisor in his official capacity for violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court denies your claim based on circuit precedent: the ADEA is the exclusive remedy for age discrimination in employment. Until 2012, every circuit to consider the issue concluded that the ADEA precludes a § 1983 equal protection remedy. In 1989, in Zombro v. Baltimore City Police Department, the Fourth Circuit held that the ADEA precludes constitution-based § 1983 age-discrimination claims. Incorrectly, the court applied a preclusion analysis reserved for statute-based § 1983 claims. Since that time, most circuits have relied on the Fourth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s problematic analysis and holding, those decisions have effectively eliminated a federal remedy for state employees suffering from age discrimination in employment. The dependence on Zombro suggests that courts do not understand the applicable preclusion analysis. In 2012, the Seventh Circuit in Levin v. Madigan became the first circuit to hold that the ADEA does not preclude § 1983 equal protection claims. Although the Seventh Circuit applied an improper analysis, it is the only circuit to engage in a comparative evaluation of the rights offered under the ADEA to the rights offered under § 1983 equal protection claims. The Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision diminishes the precedential value of Zombro and its progeny. Based on Supreme Court precedent, this Comment demonstrates that no circuit court has applied the proper preclusion analysis to the ADEA 2 ̆ 7 s preclusion of § 1983 equal protection claims. As such, it proposes the proper standard for determining the preclusion of constitution-based § 1983 claims. Finally, this Comment applies its proposed test to the ADEA and § 1983. By expanding on the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s comparative evaluation, this Comment concludes that the ADEA does not preclude § 1983 equal protection claims...|$|E
