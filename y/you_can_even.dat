500|$|The episode {{features}} guest stars James Earl Jones and Carrie Fisher, actors {{from the}} Star Wars film series. It was first {{announced that they}} would be appearing on the show on January 12, 2014. The day after, Steve Molaro revealed the basic plot outline for the episode, although he refused to explain exactly what Fisher's [...] "very small, very funny, very weird part" [...] would be. The episode was filmed on January 21, 2014. In real life, James Earl Jones {{is said to be a}} [...] "good sport" [...] when meeting Star Wars fans, similar to his character in the episode. Jim Parsons described having James Earl Jones around as [...] "pretty insane" [...] and said [...] "there's no way ever <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> realize the amount of work he's done." ...|$|E

I just shot the video in New York, and will be premiering an exclusive sample of it online. So check back soon.

500|$|Lyrically, Aguilera compares {{her love}} to office equipment, from paperclips to rubber-bands, {{as a metaphor}} for a relationship. The lyric [...] "A rubber band is what I call your love for me, cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline" [...] was spoken by Aguilera at the beginning. The part [...] "If I was a ruler I'd try to set you straight, but your love is like a sharpener, it really grates" [...] was praised by several critics, while the lines [...] "A rubber band was an analogy, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> say it's a metaphor" [...] were {{described}} by others as unnecessary, with Becky Bain for Idolator calling it [...] "dumber-than-dumb". Toward the closing moments, she sings, [...] "Paper clips they couldn't even hold us together... when your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with your party carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which your party is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{described}} Knowles as [...] "adorable and funny" [...] in the nostalgic, 60s-inspired {{video for}} [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". She {{also said that}} her retro-style is [...] "supercute" [...] and charming. On August 3, 2010, Bain claimed that [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] {{is one of the}} videos that should have been nominated for Video of the Year at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, and she later said on September 8, 2010, that the clip for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] should have been nominated instead that of [...] "Video Phone", in the category for Best Female Video at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] also made number nine in Rap-Ups Best Videos of 2010. In February 2012, Kat George of VH1 placed the video at number one on her list of [...] "The 6 Best Sets of Devastated Raccoon Eyes in Music Video History", writing, [...] "Beyoncé wins best panda eyes on the strength of melodrama... and because she looks really hot in vintage style lingerie. Clearly tortured, Beyoncé's panda eyes are paired with martinis, cigarettes, and {{just the right amount of}} crazy to make the whole thing unbearably sexy." [...] In 2013, John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E! Online placed the video at number three on their list of Knowles' ten best music videos, writing, [...] "It's like a trip back in time. Except with sexier outfits, which were definitely missing from the '60s. So good call, Beyoncé! <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>even</b> upgrade history!". In January 2010, the video garnered a nomination in the category of Outstanding Music Video at the 42nd NAACP Image Award.|$|E

2500|$|According to his biographer Joe Haines, the Labour Member of Parliament Robert Maxwell had {{the idea}} for a popular 'Buy British' {{campaign}} around {{the same time as the}} 'I'm Backing Britain' campaign emerged. Through an intermediary, Maxwell approached broadcaster David Frost, who gave a personal donation of £1,000 and invited Maxwell to appear on his television show on 5 January. On television Maxwell told viewers to [...] "think before buying. Buy the home product or service first whenever <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> <b>even</b> if it means buying less for a time". Maxwell tried to amalgamate his campaign with that of the Industrial Society, but the Society refused him. He therefore set up a rival [...] "Help Britain Group".|$|E
