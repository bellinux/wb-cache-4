25|$|Angles, {{times of}} day, and other {{cyclical}} quantities require modular arithmetic to add and otherwise combine numbers. In all these situations, {{there will not}} be a unique mean. For example, the times an hour before and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It is also possible that no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E

He said: [...] "wo medals absolutely is a pass ... so we're really pleased with that but we're absolutely disappointed we didn't get the mission done to win that gold medal, but I tell you what, we are absolutely determined to get it done in four years' time. It hasn't been easy, we've come in under the most difficult of circumstances that I've ever seen a team [...] at a major Games." [...] Chris Nunn, Chef de Mission, pointed to the future by stating that [...] "We really need to focus on having good-quality athletes who are robust and have financial support to get overseas.

2500|$|The {{reason behind}} Chavez's {{departure}} {{was that he}} had another conflict with the band. Chavez brought his wife with him on the band's 2010 tour.

6000|$|Mr. Castle {{assisted}} his pupil to dress, {{and when}} that was done to his entire satisfaction he said, in a stern voice, [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> act all right, and if you slip up on it and don't do it as you ought to, I'll give you such a whipping {{when you come out}} of the ring that you'll think Job was only fooling with you when he tried to whip you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 125. If {{you live}} in a {{mountain}} or hill country, your only danger is redundance of subject. Be resolved, in the first place, to draw a piece of rounded rock, with its variegated lichens, quite rightly, getting its complete roundings, and all the patterns of the lichen in true local color. Till <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> it is of no use your thinking of sketching among hills; but when once you have done this, the forms of distant hills will be comparatively easy.|$|E

60|$|If you are {{a philosopher}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> thing: {{you can go to}} the top of a high building, look down upon your fellow-men 300 feet below, and despise them as insects. Like the irresponsible black waterbugs on summer ponds, they crawl and circle and hustle about idiotically without aim or purpose. They do not even move with the admirable {{intelligence}} of ants, for ants always know when they are going home. The ant is of a lowly station, but he will often reach home and get his slippers on while you are left at your elevated station.|$|E

If you think necessary call on the governors of [...] States to send a force into Louisville to meet the enemy if he [...] should cross the river. You clearly never should cross except [...] in rear of the enemy. Now {{is one of the}} finest opportunities [...] ever presented of destroying one of the three armies of the [...] enemy.

When <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> you will have a right to call yourself a navigator. If you come to me at twelve o’clock to-morrow I will show you how to work a quadrant. The theory is easy. You have but to take the angle the sun makes with the horizon at its moment of highest ascension. In practice, however, this is far from easy, and you will be some time before you can hit upon the right moment. It requires patience and close observation, but if you have these qualities you will soon pick it up.” ...|$|E
60|$|One lady of my {{acquaintance}} is a Poor Law Guardian {{and secretary}} to a labour bureau.

It is the skirt-dancing and the poker work that cannot brook rivalry. The modern woman has begun to find children a nuisance; they interfere with her development. The mere man, who has written his poems, painted his pictures, composed his melodies, fashioned his philosophies, in the midst of life's troubles and bothers, grows nervous thinking what this new woman must be whose mind is so tremendous that the whole world must be shut up, so to speak, sent to do its business out of her sight and hearing, lest her attention should be distracted.|$|E

5000|$|You must be {{aggressive}} {{in the air}} {{but not to the}} extent of recklessness. Always be ready to take the initiative, but only when you have the enemy aircraft at a disadvantage.
