500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think <b>your</b> <b>gut</b> instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{at the start}} of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner. In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4–5 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category, it's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... because <b>your</b> <b>gut</b> feeling is one thing and the statistics are another. Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... the least interception percentage. He didn't lead in yards per ... percentage of explosive plays. I consider an explosive play a play of 16yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third.|$|E

500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't trust <b>your</b> <b>gut.</b> I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
500|$|WME {{decided to}} price each market {{different}}ly, having {{a total of}} four different price points. In most markets each ticket would cost $62 (U.S.), while on bigger cities the tickets price were between $130 (US) to $140 (US). However, in minor cities the tickets were cheaper and its price points would not suffer great variations. One of the various points that was subject of attention was the decision to sell the front seats prior to the back ones. If that did not occur, it would mean that the front seats would be too expensive; The Moonshine Jungle Tour did not suffer from this problem. Unlike the prior tour, where Mars' live performances were circumscribed to theaters and ballrooms, in January 2012 it was settled that the concerts were scheduled to be in arenas. This decision was based upon his successful debut tour, not only for the amount of sold out concerts, but also due to his [...] "dynamic performances". John Marx, an associate and personal manager at the music division of WME, explained, regarding the previous decision, that [...] "analytics only give you so much...it has to do with what's in <b>your</b> <b>gut</b> and what you think." [...] Since the beginning there were plans to schedule dates in United Kingdom and Europe, a leg of the tour that took around two months to be completed. Concerts were also scheduled in Australia and New Zealand for early 2014, as well as 40 stages in North America. In the end, more seats were added to venues due to overwhelmingly strong ticket sales. It was Mars' first world tour to not reach South America.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bjelland {{moved from}} Portland to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland. She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't {{know how to play}} when I met her. Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel it, from <b>your</b> <b>gut,</b> instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater {{appeared}} to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the [...] "Daisy ad". It portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy, counting up to ten. Then a baritone voice took over, counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming [...] "In your heart, you know he's right.". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said [...] "In your heart, you know he might" [...] and [...] "In <b>your</b> <b>gut,</b> you know he's nuts". Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05percent of the vote, making it the highest ever share of the popular vote. At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 15.95million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in 1972. In the Electoral College, Johnson defeated Goldwater by margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936—a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a house with a 295–140 Democratic margin.|$|E
6000|$|The {{story of}} the {{following}} adventure--this deplorable confession, one may say--will not have been written in vain if it impresses on young minds the supreme necessity of carefulness about details. Let the [...] "casual" [...] and regardless who read it--the gatless, {{as they say in}} Suffolk--ponder the lesson which it teaches: a lesson which no amount of bitter experience has ever impressed on the unprincipled narrator. Never do anything carelessly whether in fishing or in golf, and carry this important maxim even into the most serious affairs of life. Many a battle has been lost, no doubt, by lack of ammunition, or by plenty of ammunition which did not happen to suit the guns; and many a salmon has been lost, ay, and many a trout, for want of carefulness, and through a culpable inattention to the soundness of <b>your</b> <b>gut,</b> and tackle generally. What fiend is it that prompts a man just to try a hopeless cast, in a low water, without testing his tackle? As sure as you do that, up comes the fish, and with his first dash breaks your casting line, and leaves you lamenting. This doctrine I preach, being my own [...] "awful example." [...] "Bad and careless little boy," [...] my worthy master used to say at school; and he would have provoked a smile in other circumstances. But Mr. Trotter, of the Edinburgh Academy, had something about him (he usually carried it in the tail-pocket of his coat) which inspired respect and discouraged ribaldry. Would that I had listened to Mr. Trotter; would that I had corrected, in early life, the happy-go-lucky disposition to scatter my Greek accents, as it were, with a pepper-caster, to fish with worn tackle, and, generally, to make free with the responsibilities of life and literature. It is too late to amend, but others may learn wisdom from this spectacle of deserved misfortune and absolute discomfiture.|$|E
