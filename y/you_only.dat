5|$|Charles Gray {{was cast}} as villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, after playing a Bond ally named Dikko Henderson in <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice (1967). David Bauer, who plays Morton Slumber, had also {{previously}} appeared in that film, uncredited, as an American diplomat.|$|E
5|$|George Lazenby {{was signed}} on to play Bond for OHMSS. Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the {{beginning}} of filming <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme The Saint. After <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball.|$|E

5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, inviting Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{also takes}} {{credit for the}} {{greatest}} number of actors in a Bond film either to have appeared or to go on to appear {{in the rest of the}} Eon series – besides Ursula Andress in Dr. No, Vladek Sheybal appeared as Kronsteen in From Russia with Love, Burt Kwouk featured as Mr. Ling in Goldfinger and an unnamed SPECTRE operative in <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice, Jeanne Roland plays a masseuse in <b>You</b> <b>Only</b> Live Twice, and Angela Scoular appeared as Ruby Bartlett in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Jack Gwillim, who had a tiny role as a British army officer, played a Royal Navy officer in Thunderball. Caroline Munro, who can be seen very briefly as one of Dr Noah's gun-toting guards, received the role of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. Milton Reid, who appears in a bit part as the temple guard, opening the door to Mata Bond's hall, played one of Dr. No's guards and Stromberg's underling, Sandor, in The Spy Who Loved Me. John Hollis, who plays the temple priest in Mata Bond's hall, went on to play the unnamed figure clearly intended to be Blofeld in the pre-credits sequence of For Your Eyes Only. John Wells, Q's assistant, appeared in For Your Eyes Only as Denis Thatcher. Hal Galili, who appears briefly as a US army officer at the auction, had earlier played gangster Jack Strap in Goldfinger.|$|E
