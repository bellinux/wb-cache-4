Unlike in most previous approaches, our architecture is fully distributed and includes agents who preserve the privacy and autonomy of their users. These agents learn models {{of each other in}} terms of expertise (ability to produce correct domain answers) and sociability (ability to produce accurate referrals). We study our framework experimentally to study how the social network evolves. Specifically, we find that under our multiagent learning heuristic, the quality of the network improves with interactions; the quality is maximized when both expertise and sociability are considered; pivot agents further improve the quality of the network and have a catalytic effect on its quality even if they are ultimately removed. Moreover, the quality of the network improves when clustering decreases, reflecting the intuition that <b>you</b> need <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> outside your close circle to get the best information...|$|R
5000|$|... {{the very}} big {{issue is that}} if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> about Settlers 2, {{a lot of people}} have a lot of ideas how to improve it. This leads to a very big problem. You can add a lot of {{features}} to the game, but it instantly defocuses what the game is all about. For example, if you allow direct control of the military or give more detailed control about what is transported from where or asking an individual woodcutter to chop down a tree because it's in the way because you want to build a farm, it completely changes the game. We decided not to change any of these game mechanics at all. It wasn't easy to tell people that.|$|E

[...] Leeb cited travelling with the band as important inspiration, mentioning trips to Russia as example: [...] "Front Line has always liked iconic symbolism and going to countries like that really inspired me lyrically." [...] "It seemed like wherever we looked there was something for us to get into. We didn’t have to make up any stories or create anything that wasn’t already in front of us.", he concluded. Similarly, the album title arose from the band's perception of the outside world. Guitarist Jared Slingerland said in a conversation with The Rumpus, [...] "I mean, I.E.D., it's obvious what it is, but because it's still kind of a sensitive issue, Bill came up with the idea of 'electronic device.' There's obviously some overlap there." ...|$|R

During November and December 1979, US TV stations aired the 31-minute Back to the Egg special, as Wings undertook a nineteen-show UK tour, the first leg of the proposed world tour.

5000|$|Because {{he was now}} a walk-on, he was {{no longer}} bound by many {{restrictions}} that the NCAA places on student-athletes, most significantly those dealing with off-campus employment. In addition, he had wanted to live off campus, especially in his final season, but Xavier athletic department policy generally requires scholarship athletes to live in university housing; being a walk-on enabled him to fulfill this desire. While student loans paid for most of his direct academic expenses, he still had many other expenses to meet, and a schedule that made most normal jobs impractical. Having used Uber himself while at Xavier, he researched the requirements for becoming a driver for the company. He met all the requirements, with his 2004 Buick Rendezvous barely meeting the 10-year cutoff for eligible vehicles, and was accepted as a driver. During the basketball offseason, he drove for Uber anywhere from 25 to 30 hours per week, dropping his hours to 10 to 20 per week during basketball season. According to Stainbrook, [...] "It driving sort of relaxes <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> get <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> who don’t always want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> basketball all the time, so it’s a change of pace." [...] He mainly drove {{in the area of the}} Xavier campus, and he estimated that about half the people he picked up recognized him, at least by his face and size.|$|R
40|$|This {{past week}} I {{had the good}} fortune to read an {{advanced}} copy of a powerful book Fault Line by my good friend Christa Desir. Fault line tells a story about a young woman who was raped and how that act of violence shatters her and how that shattering reverberates among the people who care about her. I’m not going to give the whole story away now (it goes on sale on October 15 th (you can purchase it here), however I want to say two things about it. First this book really shook me. I want you all to get it because this is the kind of book that makes <b>you</b> want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>you</b> love after reading it. It is a difficult book to read, but then again many important things are often difficult. The second aspect of the book that struck me was that the woman who was raped went into a spiral of self-destructive behavior because she wanted to be able to feel something, even if that something was negative. She did not seek help because of multiple reasons and that ultimately lead to some difficult situations. Seeking help is important and we should be working as a society to lower barriers for victims of sexual assault to get that help...|$|R

Unfortunately, the public of most researchers is other researchers. Making a Difference to Policies and Programmes offers a way to tune research more closely to real needs. Communication is too often informal. It is nevertheless essential in relevant research and should therefore be planned throughout the research process: from the start when formulating the research questions, while developing the research proposal and conducting the study, up to the final stage, when the research results have to be explained and evaluated. The guide offers very practical {{suggestions on how to}} obtain basic information from official literature and informal writing and in what sequence <b>you</b> should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> various <b>people</b> <b>to</b> get information. The booklet is a guide for researchers who aim {{to have an impact on}} policy and programme decisions. The interpretation of information and the kind of impact aimed at still depend on the researcher, but this guide will give every researcher a useful checklist of steps and choices to be taken into consideration.

Of course, if some really good offer had been made to you even in your first season--say Lord St. Ives or Sir Montague--I don't say it might not have been prudent to accept it; but under ordinary circumstances, a girl does best to think as little as possible about such things until she is twenty at least.
