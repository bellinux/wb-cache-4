6000|$|If {{we had had}} at Toronto, when I was a student, {{the kind}} of dormitories and {{dormitory}} life that they have at Oxford, I don't think I would ever have graduated. I'd have been there still. The trouble is that the universities on our Continent are only just {{waking up to the}} idea of what a university should mean. They were, very largely, instituted and organised with the idea that a university was a place where young men were sent to absorb the contents of books and to listen to lectures in the class rooms. The student was pictured as a pallid creature, burning what was called the [...] "midnight oil," [...] his wan face bent over his desk. If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for him you gave him a book: if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something really large on his behalf you gave him a whole basketful of them. If you wanted to go still further and be a benefactor to the college at large, you endowed a competitive scholarship and set two or more pallid students working themselves to death to get it.|$|E

6000|$|The chief {{trouble with}} these poor folk {{is that they}} {{do not know how to}} commit suicide, and usually have to make two or three {{attempts}} before they succeed. This, very naturally, is a horrid nuisance to the constables and magistrates, and gives them no end of trouble. Sometimes, however, the magistrates are frankly outspoken about the matter, and censure the prisoners for the slackness of their attempts. For instance Mr. R. S---, chairman of the S--- B--- magistrates, in the case the other day of Ann Wood, who tried to make away with herself in the canal: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, why didn't you do it and get it done with?"

The man they called Ed said the muddy Mississippi water was wholesomer to drink than the clear water of the Ohio; he said if you let a pint of this yaller Mississippi water settle, you would have about a half to three-quarters of an inch of mud in the bottom, according to the stage of the river, and then it warn't no better than Ohio water--what <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to keep it stirred up--and when the river was low, keep mud on hand to put in and thicken the water up the way it ought to be.|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAREST WILMET--What I {{have heard}} to-day {{is a great}} satisfaction. I had hardly hoped {{that you could have}} been brought within the reach of any one so worthy of you. My only fear is that you are too scrupulous and self-sacrificing to {{contemplate}} fairly, and without prejudice, what is best for us all. You will imagine yourself blinded by inclination, and not attend to common sense. Harewood tells me he trusts you have no objection on personal grounds. (I hope this does not sound as if he were presuming; if so, it is my fault. Remember, I am more used to writing 'summaries for the week' than letters on delicate subjects.) But at any rate, my Mettie, I see there is much worth and weight in his affection, and that you could not manage to snub him as entirely as <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> (Didn't you?) Now, it seems to me, that if you two are really drawn to one another, both being such as you are, it is the call of a Voice that you have no right to reject or stifle. I do not mean by this that anything immediate need take place; but granting your preference, I think it would be wrong not to avow it, or to refuse, because you scruple to keep him waiting while you may be necessary at home. If you imagine that by such rejection you would be doing better for the children and me, I beg leave to tell you it is a generous blunder. Remember that, as things have turned out, I am quite as much the only dependence for the others as I was seven years ago. I felt this painfully in the spring, when I was doubtful what turn my health would take; and the comfort of knowing you would all have such a man to look to would be unspeakable--indeed, he has already lightened me of much care and anxiety. Do not take this as pressing you. Between this and the end of his leave, there will be time for consideration. Nothing need be done in haste, least of all the crushing your liking under the delusion of serving us. So do not forbid him the house; and unless your objection be on any other score, do not make up your mind till you have seen me. I should of course have been with you instead of writing, {{if it were not for}} Lance. Till I saw the dear little fellow, I had no notion how very ill he has been. The five hours' journey had quite knocked him up, and he was fit for nothing but his bed when he came; but he revived in the evening. I only hope I shall take as good care of him as the first-rate nurses he describes so enthusiastically. That month must have been worth years of common acquaintance. I wish I knew what more to say to show you how glad I am of this day's work, and to persuade you to see matters as I do.-- Ever your loving brother, [...] F. C. UNDERWOOD.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with many}} other Durutti Column LPs, Reilly dislikes the album, once telling a writer for The Quietus that he jokingly calls it [...] "Without Merit," [...] and reflecting: [...] "Without Mercy is a joke. ... It was all Tony Wilson's idea {{to make it more}} classical. He had {{aspirations}} that I should be taken more seriously. That never interested me. Everyone's obsessed with form. 'Is it avant-garde? Is it jazz?' It's just tunes." [...] He elaborated: [...] "That album was Tony Wilson saying to me, ‘You've done so many albums the way <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them, and when <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them, so just this once make this my record and do it my way.' He's one of my best friends, so of course I said yeah. And that's Without Mercy. There were all these studio classical musicians involved. For me it doesn't actually work. It was more of a learning process really." ...|$|E
