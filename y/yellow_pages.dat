5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles <b>Yellow</b> <b>Pages</b> directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

40|$|Simulation is one {{approach}} {{to analyze and}} model the real world complex problems. Multi-agent based systems provide a platform to develop simulations based {{on the concept of}} agent-oriented programming. In multi-agent systems, the local interaction between agents contributes to the emergence of the global phenomena by getting the result of the simulation runs. In MABS systems, interaction is one common aspect for all agents to perform their tasks. To interact with each other the agents require <b>yellow</b> <b>page</b> services from the platform to search for other agents. As more and more agents perform searches on this <b>yellow</b> <b>page</b> directory, there is a decrease in the performance due to a central bottleneck. In this thesis, we have investigated multiple solutions for this problem. The most promising solution is to integrate distributed shared memory with the directory systems. With our proposed solution, empirical analysis shows a statistically significant increase in performance of the directory service. We expect this result to make a considerable contribution to {{the state of the art}} in multiagent platforms...|$|R
