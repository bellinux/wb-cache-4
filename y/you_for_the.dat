5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|It {{finished}} 1994 as {{the fourth}} best-selling US Latin album and the best-selling regional Mexican album. In 1995, it ranked second to Dreaming of <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best-selling Latin album, but was the best-selling regional Mexican recording. Amor Prohibido remained the best-selling regional Mexican album in 1996, while the record became the ninth best-selling Latin album of that year. It also ranked {{as the second}} best-selling catalog Latin album of 1997, while in 1998 it placed third. Billboards revised catalog criteria made it ineligible for the Top Latin Albums chart on January 18, 1997. It {{was removed from the}} list and began charting on the newly formed Latin Catalog Albums chart positioned at number two. Since 1997, the album has spent 13 nonconsecutive weeks at number one on the Top Latin Catalog Albums chart including three weeks in 2010. Following another revision to its Top Latin Albums chart, Billboard removed its two decade-long ban of catalog albums in its chart beginning with the February 11, 2017 list; Amor Prohibido re-entered the Top Latin Albums and Regional Mexican Albums chart after 20 years. Before its revision, Nielsen SoundScan reported that Amor Prohibido was the ninth best-selling Latin record of 2016. After its revision, Amor Prohibido reclaimed the number one position on the Regional Mexican Albums chart in May 2017. In November 1994, the album had sold 200,000 units in the US. A report showed the singer was one of the top-selling acts in Mexico. It became the second Tejano album to reach year-end sales of 500,000 copies. This had only been accomplished by La Mafia previously. Despite this, Nielsen Soundscan reported that the recording actually sold 184,000 units by April 1995. According to Behar, the sales figures Nielsen SoundScan provided did not include sales in small shops specializing in Latin music. That May, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album gold, for shipments of 500,000 units. Within three weeks, it was certified platinum for increments of one million units. Amor Prohibido became the first Tejano record to receive a platinum certification. By June 1995, it had sold 1.5 million units in the US, of which 100,000 were sold in Puerto Rico alone. As of February 2010, the album has been certified double diamond (Latin), denoting shipments of two million units. It is tied at second, behind her album Dreaming of <b>You,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best-selling Latin album of all-time in the US with 2.5 million copies sold worldwide. The recording has been ranked as the best-selling Tejano album of the 1990s, and the best-selling Tejano album of all-time.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Nomura {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the main character designs and orchestration of The World Ends with <b>You</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Nintendo DS. In 2009, {{he was also the}} main character designer of Final Fantasy XIII. The graphics capabilities of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features. This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games. Nomura did not take an involved role {{in the creation of the}} non-playable characters. In 2008, he was the character designer of Dissidia Final Fantasy. The game was originally envisioned by Nomura as a Kingdom Hearts spin-off featuring a cast of Disney characters. He later felt uncomfortable with the Disney characters fighting each other and instead opted to use Final Fantasy characters. Nomura was responsible for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Amano's illustrations.|$|E

500|$|The {{voyage to}} Europe {{remained}} eventful. In the Indian Ocean Caesar caught fire and was almost destroyed, and after stopping at Cape Town, the Indiaman visited St Helena, where Amherst, Maxwell {{and the other}} officers {{were introduced to the}} former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, then a prisoner on the island. At the meeting Bonaparte recalled Maxwell's conduct in the action of November 1811 and commended him on his victory, saying [...] "Vous êtes très méchant. Eh bien! Your government must not blame <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of the Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E

[...] The requisite court martial exonerated Maxwell, his officers, and his crew {{of the loss of}} Alceste. Maxwell received much praise for his actions, and £1500 from the East India Company. He was knighted in 1818.|$|E
500|$|Having {{successfully}} completed and published the other {{books on the}} geology and zoology of the voyage, Darwin spent eight years on a major study of barnacles. Two volumes on Lepadidae (goose barnacles) were published in 1851. While he was still working on two volumes on the remaining barnacles, Darwin learnt to his delight in 1853 that the Royal Society had awarded him the Royal Medal for Natural Science. Joseph Dalton Hooker wrote telling him that [...] "Pordock proposed <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Coral Islands & Lepadidae, Bell followed seconding on the Lepadidae alone, & then followed such a shout of paeans for the Barnacles {{that you would have}} [...] to hear." ...|$|E

I called on the ghosts of Aristophanes, of Shakespeare, of Lope de Vega. I wept and swallowed my own tears... And I cursed the fate that bound me to him... Yet even as I cursed and condemned, the tears rose. For my whole life, my whole past, was before me on that stage... Poor weak first step of our Yiddish theater...

500|$|Delany {{auditioned for}} the role of Bree for the series' pilot episode in 2004. Cherry offered her the role three times, but she {{rejected}} it, and Marcia Cross was hired soon after. Delany turned down the role because she believed the Bree character was too similar to her character on Pasadena. Cherry acknowledged that while Delany captured the slyness he had originally intended for the character, Cross ultimately became the better choice: [...] "Marcia, who {{will be the first to}} tell you, 'I'm not funny, I never get the joke,' her Bree was kind of oblivious to her own Breeness. Interestingly enough, when we went forward with the show, it became a much funnier character than I envisioned." [...] While developing the Katherine character, Cherry immediately offered the role to Delany. [...] "That's unusual in Hollywood," [...] Delany commented.

500|$|In France, {{the action}} had more {{significant}} consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon {{was a serious}} blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his attention on Russia. In the French Navy, the flight of Pauline was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command. In 1817, when Murray Maxwell visited St Helena on his return from the East Indies where HMS Alceste had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words [...] "Your government must not blame <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> loss of Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E

[...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects."
