You might become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All the songs are touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like.|$|E
5|$|When {{you throw}} a {{cat in the}} oven, it's easy to have someone in the {{orchestra}} slam a hammer down on an anvil, scaring {{the hell out of}} everyone. The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you hear. <b>You</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

25|$|I {{afterwards}} travelled {{much with}} him, and have now only {{to speak of}} him with great respect, or, I ought to say, with admiration... No living person possesses a tithe of his information respecting the Hudson's Bay countries... Never mind his Bunyan-like face and cropped hair; {{he has a very}} powerful mind, and a singular faculty of picture-making. He can create a wilderness and people it with warring savages, or climb the Rocky Mountains with you in a snow-storm, so clearly and palpably, that only shut your eyes and <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> crack of the rifle, or feel the snow-flakes melt on your cheeks as he talks.|$|E
25|$|At a small café, Enjolras exhorts a {{group of}} idealistic {{students}} to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasizing about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving Grantaire ("The ABC Café—Red and Black"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realize {{that they can use}} the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come ("Do <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>the</b> People Sing?"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past ("Rue Plumet—In My Life"). Éponine leads Marius to Valjean's house (despite being heartbroken that he has fallen in love with another), and he and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love ("A Heart Full of Love"). Thénardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but Éponine stops them by screaming a warning ("The Attack on Rue Plumet"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.|$|E

500|$|In 1953, Ruth Crawford Seeger {{collected}} and transcribed the song as [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>The</b> Lambs A-Crying" [...] in her acclaimed volume American Folk Songs for Christmas.

500|$|Meanwhile, a {{recording}} of the Ruth Crawford Seeger [...] "Don't <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>The</b> Lambs A-Crying" [...] was done for the 1989 album American Folk Songs for Christmas by Peggy Seeger, Mike Seeger, and Penny Seeger.

500|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, Taborn {{continued}} playing and recording with others, but also had more solo concerts than {{earlier in his}} career. He had a solo tour of Europe in 2010, which {{may have led to}} an agreement with ECM to record his first solo piano album, Avenging Angel, which was released in 2011. In critic Nate Chinen's view, this album concentrated on [...] "pure sound", being [...] "full of moments where a note hangs sharply in the air, and <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> gathering overtones, the vibrations of the strings". The album helped Taborn get more attention as a leader.|$|E
500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] is a R-{{influenced}} pop song. Katherine St Asaph of Popdust {{noted that}} [...] "it’s the closest Kelly Clarkson’s come to R" [...] Clarkson said that Aguilera's rhythmic style heavily influenced the song. She remarked, [...] "You {{can hear a}} lot of her influence in 'Miss Independent', especially the hook. And once <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> song, it's constantly in your head. Believe me, I cannot get it out!" [...] Rachell Kipp of the Associated Press wrote that [...] "Miss Independent" [...] "sounds like a half-baked remake of Aguilera's [...] "Dirrty" [...] (2002)" [...] The song has a length of three minutes and 35 seconds and is written in the key of D major, Clarkson's vocal range spans from F3 to F5.|$|E
500|$|... "When the Truth Comes Out" [...] was {{composed}} by Fordham, Marx, and Lopez. Unlike the other {{songs in the}} episode, this song was always intended as a direct parody of a single song: [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>the</b> People Sing?" [...] from Les Misérables. It also serves the same dramatic purpose as [...] "One Day More": it is a showstopper finale to Act One that reprises all previous songs, summarizes Act One's events, and teases the events to come in Act Two. [...] Carla does not march during this song, {{except for a few}} [...] "painful steps" [...] in this sequence, due to Reyes' aforementioned fractured pelvis. When Carla is seen from the back, she is portrayed by a double.|$|E

At first I was concerned about the timing of the soundtrack, [...] my solo album was supposed to come out way before the movie. But then the solo album got delayed." [...] While later announcing the release of the soundtrack album in a press release, Beyoncé said: [...] "Once <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> song , and all the music in this film, you can't help but fall in love with it. You'll definitely get emotional. You might become happy or even sad, but your heart will get full. All the songs are touching and spiritual, and that's what the movie itself is like." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of trying}} to contact his agent, Lane asked an Australian staff member to hand-deliver the script to Geoffrey Rush's house, not far away from hers in Melbourne. Unwin reports that he {{received}} a four-page e-mail from Rush's manager admonishing them for the breach of etiquette, but ending with an invitation to discuss the project further. Iain Canning from See-Saw Films became involved and, in Gareth Unwin's words: [...] "We worked with ex-chair of BAFTA Richard Price, and started turning this story about two grumpy men sitting in a room into something bigger." [...] Hooper liked the story, but thought that the original ending needed to be changed to reflect events more closely: [...] "Originally, it had a Hollywood ending... If <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> real speech, he's clearly coping with his stammer. But it's not a perfect performance. He's managing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Series lead Noah Wyle {{emphasized}} Spielberg's {{presence on}} set by stating [...] "Anytime he gives an anointment to a project, it steps up the pedigree."

[...] "Its scope is massive. Anytime <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> word Spielberg, you know it’s {{not going to be}} crap; you know it’ll be quality and there will be some money behind it." [...] Mark Verheiden, who was the showrunner for the first season, stated [...] "It’s great to know you have a world-class filmmaker backing up what you’re trying to do who is supportive and helping design the great stuff." ...|$|E

The song was {{recorded}} at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles and FC Walvisch Recording Media Studios in Amsterdam. [...] "Bad Romance" [...] was released as the lead single from The Fame Monster (2009), Gaga's follow-up to her debut album, The Fame (2008). Before its official release, a demo version of the song was published illegally on the internet, prompting Gaga to comment via Twitter, [...] "leaked next single is makin my ears bleed. Wait till <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> real version." [...] A snippet of the song was performed on Saturday Night Live on October 3, 2009, along with [...] "Poker Face" [...] and [...] "LoveGame".

500|$|On {{the issue}} of whether {{competitive}} curlers would be offended by the episode, LaZebnik said [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>The</b> Simpsons is going to do their take on your sport, you naturally get a little alarmed, But we ended up being respectful I would say, even, surprisingly respectful. Both Homer and Marge take it seriously." [...] Some curlers, including the Clarks and Patzke, felt that the exposure the sport received was beneficial. Cristin Clark said [...] "Although Homer Simpson probably isn't the ideal athlete I would want to see representing our sport, I just think it's great exposure." [...] Canadian curler Randy Ferbey, a four-time world champion, said [...] "I'm sure they're going to somehow make a mockery of it like they do every other thing, but I think you need to take it with a grain of salt. It brings attention to our sport and I think it's wonderful. The more curling on TV, whether it's in an animated form or real form, the better." ...|$|E
500|$|The four collaborated {{to write}} {{numerous}} [...] "minutes of gameplay" [...] documents, which conveyed how the game would feel. Church later gave the example, [...] "You {{hear the sound}} of a security camera swiveling, and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target, so you duck behind the crate and then <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way". The documents would [...] "hint" [...] at the gameplay systems involved, and at the emergent possibilities in each situation. Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions, he believed that the project [...] "was always Doug Church's vision at heart". Church and Grossman refined several of the team's documents and defined the game's design and direction, and Grossman wrote the game's original design document. Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld IIs tomb dimension, which he later called a [...] "mini-prototype" [...] for System Shock. These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration. The team believed that dialogue trees [...] "broke the fiction" [...] of games; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves, disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment. There were also concerns about realism.|$|E
