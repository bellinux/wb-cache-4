6000|$|... "Well then, why shouldn't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> now he {{says that}} he and his mother are {{absolutely}} convinced that his father is innocent? I suppose they are quite as likely to know {{the truth of the matter}} as anyone in Brownsville." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By heavens I'll {{not stand}} this!" [...] exclaimed Barry.--"I'll not stand this! I didn't do it, Mr Armstrong. I didn't do it. He's a liar, Lord Ballindine: upon my sacred word and honour as a gentleman, he's a liar. Why do <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him,</b> when you won't believe me? Ain't I a Protestant, Mr Armstrong, and ain't you a Protestant clergyman? Don't {{you know that}} such men as he will tell any lie; will do any dirty job? On my sacred word of honour as a gentleman, Lord Ballindine, he offered to poison Anty, on {{condition}} he got the farm round the house for nothing!--He knows it's true, and why should <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> sooner than me, Mr Armstrong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is fortunate, señor, you {{refused the}} loan, {{because you will}} never get the concessions; Altiera's rule will be over {{in a day or}} two. But <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> when {{he said he did not}} know where your {{daughter}} is?" ...|$|R
60|$|ELLIE [flushing]. Hesione, don't {{say that}} <b>you</b> don't <b>believe</b> <b>him.</b> I couldn't bear that.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder if}} it isn't just now," [...] I said after a moment, [...] "to convict you of an attempt at duplicity that has not even had the saving grace of success! Was it for Brissenden himself that you spoke just now as if <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> to wish to cling to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have never, sir,'--she {{interposed}} with {{an altered}} manner and a firmer voice; 'I {{have never heard}} you spoken of in harsh or disrespectful terms. You do a great wrong to Edward's nature if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> capable of any mean or base proceeding.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, now, Scatcherd, you ain't; you're {{bad enough}} {{if you only}} knew it. And as for Winterbones, he has no {{business}} here up in your bedroom, which stinks of gin so, it does. Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him,</b> doctor; he ain't well, nor yet nigh well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him?</b> Don't {{you believe}} me?" [...] She was more plaintive than ever. It {{was almost as}} if she called heaven to witness what manner of husband she was forced to endure. [...] "Then you had better call Mullins and ask him. He saw Dick leave." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> in <b>Him,</b> as I tell you, {{you will}} be pardoned both by us and by God. If <b>you</b> do not <b>believe,</b> we shall kill you all, and {{you will be}} punished eternally. Now you have the choice what to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Messieurs," [...] said Montcalm, {{advancing}} {{towards them}} a step, in generous interest, [...] "you little know Louis de St. Véran, if <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> capable of profiting by this letter to humble brave men, or {{to build up}} a dishonest reputation for himself. Listen to my terms before you leave me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Sir Percy Blakeney in that optimistic, light-hearted yet supremely {{authoritative}} tone {{of which}} he held the secret, [...] "you and Rosette remain here {{and wait for the}} gendarmes. When they come, say nothing; behave with absolute meekness, and let them search your place from end to end. If they ask you about your husband say that <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be at his workshop. Is that clear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Shirley laughed; {{she laughed}} again, each {{time with a}} {{slightly}} sarcastic sound. [...] "Well, well," [...] was her comment. [...] "On the plea of the man being Cyril Hall's friend and Robert Moore's brother, we'll just tolerate his existence; won't we, Cary? <b>You</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be intelligent, do you? Not quite an idiot--eh? Something commendable in his disposition!--id est, not an absolute ruffian. Good! Your representations have weight with me; and {{to prove that they}} have, should he come this way I will speak to him." ...|$|E

6000|$|As {{this was}} said Lily turned round slowly {{and looked up}} into her mother's face. [...] "Mamma," [...] she said, [...] "that is very cruel. I did not think you could be so cruel. How can <b>you,</b> who <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be so selfish, think that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thunder and lightning!' {{said the}} German, warming, 'when a certain man {{is coming to}} see you, unexpectedly; and, without his own knowledge, sends some {{invisible}} messenger, to put the idea of him into your head all day, {{what do you call}} that? When you walk along a crowded street - at Frankfort, Milan, London, Paris - and think that a passing stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and then that another passing stranger is like your friend Heinrich, and so begin to have a strange foreknowledge that presently you'll meet your friend Heinrich - which you do, though <b>you</b> <b>believed</b> <b>him</b> at Trieste - what do you call THAT?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Vincent smiled. [...] "Well, as I {{told you}} once before, we shall see. I hope I am wrong, and that Pearson {{is all that}} <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be. I own that I may be prejudiced against him, but nothing will persuade {{me that it was}} not from him that Jackson learned that Dinah was here, and it was to that we owe the visit of the sheriff and the searching the {{plantation}} for Tony. However, whatever the man is at heart, he can, as far as I see, do you no injury as long as things go on as they are, and I sincerely trust he will never have an opportunity of doing so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, good soul," [...] he said, taking Helen's {{hand and}} kissing it, [...] "as your son has not acquainted {{you with this}} affair, think {{if you have any}} right to examine it. As <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> to be a man of honour, what right have you to doubt his honour in this instance? Who is his accuser? An {{anonymous}} scoundrel who has brought no specific charge against him. If there were any such, wouldn't the girl's parents have come forward? He is not called upon to rebut, nor you to entertain an anonymous accusation; and as for believing him guilty because a girl of that rank happened to be in his rooms acting as nurse to him, begad you might as well insist upon his marrying that dem'd old Irish gin-drinking laundress, Mrs. Flanagan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him,</b> sir; yes, it is. He {{tells me}} of {{everything}} he sees {{down at his}} work. You would be surprised what a quantity he gets together for me every day. He looks into the carriages, and tells me how the ladies are dressed--so that I know all the fashions! He looks into the carriages, and tells me what pairs of lovers he sees, and what new- married couples on their wedding trip--so that I know all about that! He collects chance newspapers and books--so that I have plenty to read! He tells me about the sick people who are travelling {{to try to get}} better--so that I know all about them! In short, as I began by saying, he tells me everything he sees and makes out down at his work, and you can't think what a quantity he does see and make out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, no!' {{said that}} gentleman, {{clapping}} his son-in-law playfully upon the shoulder. 'You must not believe all that my young relative says, Mr Montague. <b>You</b> may <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> in official business, and trust him in official business, {{but you must}} not attach importance to his flights of fancy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God send my dear, kind {{father to}} hell {{just because he}} can't talk like the gentlefolks! Don't <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> it of <b>Him,</b> Master Paul. He's got more sense." ...|$|R
50|$|As a music journalist, Gamerman {{has been}} {{published}} by Consequence Of Sound, Eleven Magazine in St. Louis (even though he has never actually visited St. Louis), and Howlround.

60|$|There is one {{essential}} point wherein {{a political}} liar differs from {{others of the}} faculty; {{that he ought to}} have but a short memory, which is necessary according to the various occasions he meets with every hour, of differing from himself, and swearing to both sides of a contradiction, as he finds the persons disposed, with whom he has to deal. In describing the virtues and vices of mankind, it is convenient upon every article, to have some eminent person in our eye, from whence we copy our description. I have strictly observed this rule; and my imagination this minute represents before me a certain great man[7] famous for this talent, to the constant practice of which he owes his twenty years' reputation of the most skilful head in England, for the management of nice affairs. The superiority of his genius consists in nothing else but an inexhaustible fund of political lies, which he plentifully distributes every minute he speaks, and by an unparalleled generosity forgets, and consequently contradicts the next half-hour. He never yet considered whether any proposition were true or false, but whether it were convenient for the present minute or company to affirm or deny it; so that if you think to refine upon him, by interpreting every thing he says, as we do dreams by the contrary, you are still to seek, and will find yourself equally deceived, whether <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him</b> or no: the only remedy is to suppose that you have heard some inarticulate sounds, without any meaning at all. And besides, that will take off the horror you might be apt to conceive at the oaths wherewith he perpetually tags both ends of every proposition: though at the same time I think he cannot with any justice be taxed for perjury, when he invokes God and Christ, because he has often fairly given public notice to the world, that he believes in neither.|$|E
60|$|The Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company started into {{existence}} one morning, not an Infant Institution, but a Grown-up Company running {{alone at a}} great pace, and doing business right and left: with a 'branch' in a first floor over a tailor's at the west-end of the town, and main offices in a new street in the City, comprising {{the upper part of}} a spacious house resplendent in stucco and plate-glass, with wire-blinds in all the windows, and 'Anglo-Bengalee' worked into the pattern of every one of them. On the doorpost was painted again in large letters, 'offices of the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company,' and on the door was a large brass plate with the same inscription; always kept very bright, as courting inquiry; staring the City out of countenance after office hours on working days, and all day long on Sundays; and looking bolder than the Bank. Within, the offices were newly plastered, newly painted, newly papered, newly countered, newly floor-clothed, newly tabled, newly chaired, newly fitted up in every way, with goods that were substantial and expensive, and designed (like the company) to last. Business! Look at the green ledgers with red backs, like strong cricket-balls beaten flat; the court-guides directories, day-books, almanacks, letter-boxes, weighing-machines for letters, rows of fire-buckets for dashing out a conflagration in its first spark, and saving the immense wealth in notes and bonds belonging to the company; look at the iron safes, the clock, the office seal--in its capacious self, security for anything. Solidity! Look at the massive blocks of marble in the chimney-pieces, and the gorgeous parapet {{on the top of the}} house! Publicity! Why, Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance company is painted on the very coal-scuttles. It is repeated at every turn until the eyes are dazzled with it, and the head is giddy. It is engraved upon the top of all the letter paper, and it makes a scroll-work round the seal, and it shines out of the porter's buttons, and it is repeated twenty times in every circular and public notice wherein one David Crimple, Esquire, Secretary and resident Director, takes the liberty of inviting your attention to the accompanying statement of the advantages offered by the Anglo-Bengalee Disinterested Loan and Life Assurance Company; and fully proves to you that any connection on your part with that establishment must result in a perpetual Christmas Box and constantly increasing Bonus to yourself, and that nobody can run any risk by the transaction except the office, which, in its great liberality is pretty sure to lose. And this, David Crimple, Esquire, submits to you (and the odds are heavy <b>you</b> <b>believe</b> <b>him),</b> is the best guarantee that can reasonably be suggested by the Board of Management for its permanence and stability.|$|E
