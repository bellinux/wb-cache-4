500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't know why I wrote that down, why Debra [...] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face".|$|E
500|$|The artwork for Follow the Leader {{was done}} by Todd McFarlane Entertainment, with McFarlane and fellow Image Comics artists Greg Capullo (penciller) and Brian Hagelin (colorist) doing the album cover, and {{designer}} Brent Ashe handling the graphics work. According to drummer David Silveria, the band got interested in McFarlane after hearing that [...] "Todd had actually referred to us as 'the Doors of the 90's'", leading to them recording a song for Spawn, a film based on a comic book by McFarlane, and eventually approaching the artist to make an album cover for them. The cover art depicts a child hopscotching off a cliff and a gathering of kids waiting to follow, a concept that begun with bassist Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu and sketched by a friend of Jonathan Davis before being submitted to McFarlane. It marked the third straight Korn cover featuring children in a disturbing context, which Davis explained by saying that [...] "Children are always scared when they're all happy and stuff. They're {{the most beautiful thing}} in the world, but when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> our artwork, the way we've placed it, it's just kinda fuckin' weird." [...] The [...] "Freak on a Leash" [...] music video features animated segments by McFarlane featuring this cover art.|$|E

An American poet, Gary Snyder, who was immersed in the Buddhist Zen tradition, explaining his meaning noted, [...] "It's a gift; it's like there's a moment in which the thing is ready to let <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> India, this is called darshan.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{published in the}} February 1999 issue of Vanity Fair, Lucas said: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> six parts, you'll understand.

[...] In 2008, after all six films had been released, Lucas said: [...] "The movies were the story of Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalker, and when Luke saves the galaxy and redeems his father, that's where that story ends." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{generally}} positive review of Now <b>You</b> <b>See</b> <b>It,</b> <b>in</b> the journal portal: Libraries and the Academy, Andrew Battista wrote [...] "As inspiring as Now You See It can be, I {{would say that}} Davidson uncritically seeks to apply the doctrines of capitalist efficiency into contemporary learning. In fact, at times her vision of education seems to verge {{on a kind of}} fluency that will prepare people to compete in a new globalized economy rather than an altruistic experience that sees learning as the preparation of any fit participant in a democracy." ...|$|E
