500|$|Kreia {{has been}} {{positively}} received. Alexander Gambotto-Burke, for Eurogamer, considered Kreia {{to be the}} greatest villain in video gaming, praising her dialogue, Kestelman's [...] "intelligent and subtle" [...] voice-acting, and the way she forced the player into making choices and considering their decisions. IGN's Hilary Goldstein offered similar praise to her dialogue. When looking at morality in games, Gamasutra's Katherine Cross noted how Kreia's comments affected her more than many of the dark-side/light-side choices in the game. Her [...] "practical" [...] philosophy was also complimented by Kotaku's Phil Owen, who noted its ties to reality over the traditional moral extremes of the Sith and the Jedi. Eurogamers Richard Cobbett considered her the most [...] "famous" [...] of The Sith Lords subversion of Star Wars and the first Knights of the Old Republic, commenting [...] "Whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> think she's crazy, she's a fresh breath of air for the series, and easily one of the best RPG characters ever." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{would have}} to pick Erica's legal {{abortion}} back in 1973. Number one, it was timely. Abortion had only recently been legalized when Erica decided not to have her baby. Secondly, it was a bold move. I can't think of a hotter political topic for the time than abortion (it still remains a subject that soaps tend to avoid as much as possible; women may contemplate abortions, but rarely go through with having them). Erica's abortion let the fans know that All My Children was going to tackle some major issues. What made it work {{was the fact that}} it was the perfect marriage of character to social issue storyline. We've all watched shows where some character develops a social issue problem that feels artificial to them as though it's been tacked onto them as some sort of glorified public service announcement. But Erica's abortion made sense. She was a rising model who didn't want a baby to derail that career. Whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>or</b> disagree with her decision, you understand her rationale. That really is important for these social issue storylines to succeed [...] that they really be paired up with the right characters.|$|E
