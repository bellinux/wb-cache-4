An advocate for animal rights, he supports Farm Sanctuary and has served as the spokesperson for the organization's Walk for Farm Animals. He also narrated the video Face <b>your</b> <b>Food,</b> a film on behalf of PETA advocating a vegan diet on ethical grounds. In 2017, Dinklage attended the Women's March demonstration in Park City, Utah, to advocate legislation and policies regarding human rights and other issues. When asked about the news that president Donald Trump is reportedly ending the funding for national arts and humanities programs, Dinklage responded: [...] "It's always the first to go, isn't it? Art, then education: the two most important things", along with [...] "climate, of course".|$|E

[...] In The Weekly Standard, John Podhoretz criticized the film's [...] "mindless worship of a nature-loving tribe and the tribe's adorable pagan rituals." [...] Christian critic David Outten disputed that [...] "the danger to moviegoers is that Avatar presents the Na'vi culture on Pandora as morally superior to life on Earth. [...] If you love the philosophy {{and culture of the}} Na'vi too much, you will be led into evil rather than away from it." [...] Outten further added: [...] "Cameron has done a masterful job in manipulating the emotions of his audience in Avatar. He created a world where it looks good and noble to live in a tree and hunt for <b>your</b> <b>food</b> daily with a bow and arrow.... Cameron said, Avatar asks us to see that everything is connected, all human beings to each other, and us to the Earth.' This is a clear statement of religious belief. This is pantheism. It is not Christianity." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Lloyd Owen {{prepared}} by watching numerous Connery films and studied his accent.

2500|$|The comedian {{has also}} {{expressed}} discomfort {{with the notion}} that success in standup comedy—or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry—should oblige him to serve as a role model. In this position, he finds himself directly at odds with one of his comic idols, Bill Cosby. Cosby has reprimanded Rock both explicitly—for his Niggas vs. Black People track—and implicitly, for heavy use of the word [...] "nigger." [...] Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 Roll With The New show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: [...] "Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better than everybody else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much." [...] Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: [...] "You can't be happy that fire cooks <b>your</b> <b>food</b> and be mad it burns your fingertips." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Celtic {{belief is}} that at the full moon any silver coins on one's person should be jingled or turned over to prevent bad luck, also the silver coins would {{increase}} as the moon grew in size.

American silver [...] "Mercury" [...] dimes, especially with a leap year date, are especially lucky. Gamblers' charms are often these dimes, Mercury being the Roman god who ruled the crossroads, games of chance, etc. Although these dimes actually figure the head of Liberty, people commonly mistake it for Mercury. A silver dime worn at the throat will supposedly turn black if someone tries to poison <b>your</b> <b>food</b> or drink. American [...] "Indian Head" [...] cents are worn as amulets to ward off evil or negative spirits. In Spain a bride places a silver coin from her father in one shoe and a gold coin from her mother in the other. This will ensure that she will never want for anything. Silver coins were placed in Christmas puddings and birthday cakes to bring good luck and wealth. A variation on this custom was that in some families each member added a coin to the pudding bowl, making a wish as they did so. If their coin turned up in their bowl it's said their wish was sure to come true. In Greece, a coin is added to vasilopita, a bread baked in honor of the feast day of St. Basil the Great. At midnight {{the sign of the cross}} is etched with a knife across the cake, to bless the house and bring good luck for the new year. A piece is sliced for each member of the family and any visitors present at the time, and the person who gets the slice with the coin will receive good luck, and often a gift.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrowing {{food for}} {{personal}} and family consumption {{is a significant}} global activity, but one that has received insufficient academic attention, particularly in developed countries. This paper uses data from the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS) to address three areas of particular concern: the prevalence of growing <b>your</b> own <b>food</b> and how this has changed over time; the individual and household context in which growing takes place; and whether those who grow their own food are happier {{than those who do}} not. Results showed that there was a marked increase in growing <b>your</b> own <b>food</b> in Europe, in the period 2003 – 2007. This increase is largely associated with poorer households and thus, possibly, economic hardship. In the UK however the increase in growing <b>your</b> own <b>food</b> is predominantly associated with older middle class households. Across Europe, whether causal or not, those who grew their own were happier than those who did not. The paper therefore concludes that claims about the gentrification of growing your own may be premature. Despite contrary evidence from the UK, the dominant motive across Europe appears to be primarily economic — to reduce household expenditure whilst ensuring a supply of fresh food...|$|R
