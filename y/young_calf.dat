5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a gregarious {{animal with}} a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly, the female herds, consisting of adult females and their young; secondly, the bachelor herds, consisting only of yearlings and older males; thirdly, the territorial bulls. The number of females per herd is variable, generally ranging from 14 to 32, but is {{highest in the}} densest populations and also increases with forage density. There is a strong attachment {{among members of the}} female herd, many of whom are related to each other. Large herds often get divided into smaller groups. While small calves stay with their mothers, the older ones form groups of their own within the herd. These herds have a social hierarchy, and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group. Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts. Separation of a <b>young</b> <b>calf</b> from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality. While some male yearlings stay within the female herd, the others join a bachelor herd. These are usually loose associations and, unlike the female herds, the individuals are not much attached to each other. Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression {{on the part of the}} males. These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls, and also as a reserve for future breeding males.|$|E

2500|$|The {{site was}} used as a [...] "buffalo jump," [...] a place where American bison could be driven up a hill and over a cliff. Prior to 1700 CE, Native Americans lacked horses. Because they {{utilized}} dogs as hunting companions and for transportation, this time period is known as the [...] "Dog Days" [...] by many tribes. Bison served as a significant food source for many Native American tribes. Killing the animals, however, was difficult, as bison are notoriously difficult to herd or capture, and can be highly aggressive. Buffalo jumps were one way to kill large numbers of the animals at once without many of the risks associated with close-proximity ambush. Once the animals were driven over the cliff and incapacitated, they would be slaughtered and their meat, hides, and bones used by the hunters to feed and clothe their families and to make various tools and weapons. Jumps were rare, as ambush was a far more common killing method. There is conflicting evidence about what time of year the jumps were used most heavily. There is some evidence that bison kills usually occurred between early fall and early spring, but evidence of unborn and <b>young</b> <b>calf</b> skeletons at the site indicate that slaughter may have occurred year-round.|$|E

50|$|When A4 pod {{was first}} encountered, it {{travelled}} as one {{group led by}} the matriarch A10. In 1983, she and her <b>youngest</b> <b>calf,</b> A47, were shot at the rubbing beaches in Robson Bight. A whale watching vessel reported A47 bleeding profusely while being supported by its mother. Both of the whales died that winter. A10's probable daughters Yakat (A11) and Kelsey (A24) were left {{with the role of}} matriarchs while still being young adults. In 1986, the pod began splitting into two subpods, A11, led by Yakat and A24, led by Kelsey, but continued to {{spend most of their time}} together. Starting in the early 2000s, Yakat’s oldest daughter Skagit (A35) and her offspring began spending time apart from the rest of the group, thus creating a third matriline, A35. After the death of Yakat, matriline A56 was formed with Nahwitti as matriarch. The A35s and the A56s are still most often seen together.|$|R

50|$|Logan's Beach on {{the eastern}} side of the city is {{recognised}} as a nursery site for the southern right whale Eubalaena australis, and many tourists have been attracted to opportunities for land-based observations. Most years one, two or three adult female whales arrive between late May and August, giving birth within days of their arrival. The <b>young</b> whale <b>calf</b> is then reared at the site, usually departing with its parent by mid to late September. Besides the southern right whale, the coastline is also visited by Australian fur seals, little penguins and common dolphins. During the winter and early spring albatross cruise along the coastline and can be sighted from Thunder Point, a popular coastal lookout in the town.|$|R

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} species of Eimeria that cause coccidiosis in cattle are E. bovis, E. zuernii, and E. auburnensis. In a <b>young,</b> susceptible <b>calf</b> {{it is estimated}} that as few as 50,000 infective oocysts can cause severe disease. Eimeria infections are particularly damaging to the poultry industry and costs the United States more than $1.5 billion in annual loses. The most economically important species among poultry are E. tenella, E. acervulina, and E. maxima. The oocysts of what was later called Eimeria steidai were first seen by the pioneering Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) in the bile of a rabbit in 1674. The genus is named after the German zoologist Theodor Eimer (1843-1898).|$|R

60|$|The {{analogy with}} the breeder of cattle {{is a very}} {{misleading}} one. He has a very simple ideal, to which he directs the entire pairing of his stock.

Towards that ideal he goes simply and directly, slaughtering and sparing, regardless entirely of any divergent variation that may arise beneath his control. A <b>young</b> <b>calf</b> with an incipient sense of humour, with a bright and inquiring disposition, with a gift for athleticism or a quaintly-marked hide, has no sort of chance with him at all on that account. He can throw these proffered gifts of nature aside without hesitation. Which is just what our theoretical breeders of humanity cannot venture to do.

Brentwood's machine was still in running order, and they were going out cow-stealing. Halstead had a long butcher knife and a cleaver. We went out to the outskirts of the city.

40|$|This {{work has}} been done to develop a plan for a future dairy barn at the Gästgivaregården and to show the space needed for cows and {{replacement}} heifers. It would also show the storage that will be needed. The design was largely based on results from studies on six different farms, but also the facts that are taken from research papers and articles in order to compare theory with practice. Because some farms only where interviewed by phone I have used a query form to obtain comparable resultes. The aim is to build a new barn with Automatic milking. I've drawn a milking stable for 120 milking cow and replacement heifers with the capability to house up to 140 milking cows if the farm would expand in the future. Calculations of feed amounts and space requirements have been made to see how many hectares are needed to supply the cows and replacement heifers with feed and to know about what size of storage space is required. The investigations made in this writing are to answer questions about the AMS-unit`s position and how to best maintain a good health status in the herd. It should also demonstrate how to plan when to have the <b>young</b> <b>calfs</b> in the same house. The drawing was designed to allow a good flow of livestock through the house without having to move animals for long distances, it should also be possible to make changes in the layout if it proves necessary in the future. The conclusion was that the position of the AMS-unit`s was not so important as long as the traffic around it was arranged. You should make sure that only those cows that have a milking permit hade access to the unit. The cows should be tempted to pass through the unit and not want to stay in the holding pen. The health status of the herd was related to how you maintain the AMS-unit. A unit that had been properly maintained should have a lower percent of interrupted milkings. Interrupted milkings leads to uneven milking intervals and that may increase the risk of milk leakage and contamination of other cows. Recruitment up to 6 months should be kept in a private area with its own ventilation to prevent air transmitted diseases to spread from the older animales. Allowing young animals go in the same system as the adults animals are preferable because they are learning how to function in that system...|$|R
