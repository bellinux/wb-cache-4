Everyone's on their phones, everyone's doing this, and it's just about <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you're {{experiencing}} in that moment." [...] During the bridge, Gomez gives [...] "a Janet Jackson-esque speaking verse.|$|E
500|$|Balzac was {{fiercely}} {{proud of}} Louis Lambert {{and believed that}} it elegantly represented his diverse interests in philosophy, mysticism, religion, and occultism. When he sent an early draft to his lover at the time, however, she predicted the negative reception it would receive. [...] "Let the whole world see you for themselves, my dearest," [...] she wrote, [...] "but do not cry out to them to admire you, because then the most powerful magnifying glasses will be directed at <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> becomes of the most exquisite object when it is put under a microscope?" [...] Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, due mostly to the book's lack of sustaining narrative. Conservative commentator Eugène Poitou, on the other hand, accused Balzac of lacking true faith and portraying the French family as a vile institution.|$|E

But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral.

500|$|The {{underlying}} {{theme of}} [...] "City of Blinding Lights," [...] {{reflected in the}} chorus, is lost innocence. The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire–Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about {{the first time the}} band arrived in New York City, calling it [...] "a song about innocence and naïvete." [...] Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife, Alison Stewart, when they were teenagers. The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of [...] "discovering what a big city could offer <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> it could take away." [...] Although the first verse is set in London, the chorus is set in New York City. The verse, [...] "I've seen you walk unafraid / I've seen you in the clothes you've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?" [...] was written as an expression of love for Alison, with a reflection on their life together as they grow older.|$|E

2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who are <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> do you want of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
