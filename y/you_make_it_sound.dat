40|$|The {{immunology}} professor {{had just}} wrapped up the day's lecture. He was particularly well liked {{because he always}} {{found a way to}} make the topics in his class relevant to his students. He was friendly, with a nice smile that spread from the edges of his mustache to the sparkle in his blue eyes whenever he talked about something that really interested him. He didn't always have traditional views on the subjects he taught and was willing to listen to the students ' views. The lecture had been on vaccines—the history of their development, how they work, a discussion of some of the more common ones. A lively discussion began, with many students raising their hands. "Dr. Jim, how come <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> like vaccines are good things? Don't they cause autism {{and a lot of other}} problems? " asked Vicky, a young student in the class. "Yeah, I heard that vaccines can cause gastrointestinal problems that can lead to autism, " said Nadine, another young student. "And I heard that the polio vaccine can cause polio! " said Thomas, an older student in the class. "Well, I read somewhere that the new Lyme vaccine might cause arthritis, " a student named Ian said. "I camp out a lot, and I've been exposed to ticks in areas where they have Lyme disease, but I would never take that vaccine!"...|$|E

60|$|There {{are many}} ways of saying 'Ah!' You can put joy, amazement, rapture into it; <b>you</b> can also <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> as if <b>it</b> were a reply to a remark on the weather. James Boyd made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> just like that. His hair was rumpled, his brow contracted, and his manner absent. The {{impression}} he gave Elizabeth {{was that he had}} barely heard her. The next moment he was deep in a recital of the misdemeanours of the actors now rehearsing for his four-act comedy. The star had done this, the leading woman that, the juvenile something else. For the first time Elizabeth listened unsympathetically.|$|R
60|$|Tom Yorkfield {{had always}} {{regarded}} his half-brother, Laurence, with a lazy instinct of dislike, toned down, as years went on, to a tolerant feeling of indifference. There was nothing very tangible to dislike him for; {{he was just}} a blood-relation, with whom Tom had no single taste or interest in common, and with whom, at the same time, he had had no occasion for quarrel. Laurence had left the farm early in life, and had lived for a few years on a small sum of money left him by his mother; he had taken up painting as a profession, and was reported to be doing fairly well at it, well enough, at any rate, to keep body and soul together. He specialised in painting animals, and he was successful in finding a certain number of people to buy his pictures. Tom felt a comforting sense of assured superiority in contrasting his position with that of his half-brother; Laurence was an artist-chap, just that and nothing more, though <b>you</b> might <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> more important by calling him an animal painter; Tom was a farmer, not in a very big way, it was true, but the Helsery farm had been in the family for some generations, and it had a good reputation for the stock raised on it. Tom had done his best, with the little capital at his command, to maintain and improve the standard of his small herd of cattle, and in Clover Fairy he had bred a bull which was something rather better than any that his immediate neighbours could show. It would not have made a sensation in the judging-ring at an important cattle show, but it was as vigorous, shapely, and healthy a young animal as any small practical farmer could wish to possess. At the King’s Head on market days Clover Fairy was very highly spoken of, and Yorkfield used to declare that he would not part with him for a hundred pounds; a hundred pounds {{is a lot of money}} in the small farming line, and probably anything over eighty would have tempted him.|$|R
