The first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> was devoted to the development of probabilistic methodology for micromechanics models.

40|$|During {{the first}} <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> work was {{completed}} to identify Iowa DOT needs for web-based project management system (WPMS) and evaluate how commercially available solutions could meet these needs. Researchers also worked to pilot test custom developed WPMS solutions on Iowa DOT bridge projects. At the end <b>of</b> the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> a Request for Proposals (RFP) {{was developed and}} issued by the Iowa DOT for {{the selection of a}} commercial WPMS to pilot test on multiple bridge projects. During the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> the responses to the RFP issued during the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> were evaluated and a solution was selected.

5|$|After he had {{completed}} his doctoral study, {{he was offered}} a job at EG Corporation Energy Measurements in Goleta, California, to work on crystal growth. EG was a defense contractor of the United States government and dealt with sensitive information and science. In 1975, this required Van den Berg to become a naturalized U.S. citizen. Van den Berg gathered <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and management experience {{in the preparation of}} crystalline materials—in particular, the growth of single crystals of chemical compounds, and the investigation of associated defect chemistry and electronic properties. He became an international authority on vapor growth techniques with an emphasis on mercuric iodide crystals and its application in the nuclear industry as gamma ray detectors. During his work at EG, Van den Berg asked NASA for permission to conduct crystal growth experiments in space, which NASA approved.|$|E
5|$|After two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> the Hrant Dink Foundation {{published}} a book, some 400 pages long, describing {{the current situation}} of seized assets and properties of the Armenian community. With the help of government deed and title records, {{the members of the}} Hrant Dink foundation have uncovered the title records of all the properties owned by various foundations and have produced the book replete with photographs, charts, maps, and other illustrations which describe the seized properties and assets and its current status. The Hrant Dink foundation states that 661 properties in Istanbul alone were confiscated by the Turkish government, leaving only 580 of the 1,328 properties owned by the 53 Armenian foundations (schools, churches, hospitals, etc.). The current circumstances of the remaining 87 could not be determined. Out of the 661 confiscated properties, 143 (21.6%) have been returned to the Armenian foundation.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the possibility to reduce the application of mineral nitrogen fertilizers through the application of beneficial microorganisms (genus Bradyrhizobium, Azotobacter, bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus spp., etc.). Research was conducted during 2013 and 2014 on Eutric brown soil. The experiment was set up in a split-block scheme with 12 different variants in 4 repetitions: two soybean cultivars were used; two different treatments of nitrogen fertilizers and three different treatments of microbiological preparation were applied. Analysed parameters were soybean grain yield (kg/ha) based on 13 % moisture, protein content (%), oil content (%) and hectolitre mass (kg). Given that the climatic conditions in the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> were more favourable than in the first <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> all the elements <b>of</b> <b>research,</b> including control variants, achieved better results in the second <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> All variants treated with microbiological preparations, either by application in soil or by application in soil combined with foliar treatments, also achieved statistically significant differences compared to the control variants...|$|R
5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E
5|$|By 1665, he was {{collecting}} information for his county history, The Antiquities of Berkshire; and in 1672 he published The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, a lavish folio with illustrations by Wenceslaus Hollar, {{for which he}} had conducted <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the King of Denmark, the Elector of Brandenburg and the Elector Palatine. Ashmole performed the heraldic and genealogical work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and ceremony.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and radioactive materials from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E

5|$|Italy was MGM's top {{choice for}} hosting the {{production}}. However, {{a number of}} countries—including France, Mexico, Spain, and the United Kingdom—were also considered. Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more than five <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> which had already been completed for the production.

5|$|On 30 September 1987, the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles {{performed}} The Rite {{based on}} a reconstruction of Nijinsky's 1913 choreography, until then thought lost beyond recall.

Hodson's version has since been performed by the Kirov Ballet, at the Mariinsky Theatre in 2003 and later that year at Covent Garden. In its 2012–13 season the Joffrey Ballet gave centennial performances at numerous venues, including the University of Texas on 5–6 March 2013, the University of Massachusetts on 14 March 2013, and with The Cleveland Orchestra on 17–18 August 2013.|$|E
