500|$|Construction {{started on}} the project in May. One lane of traffic in each {{direction}} was maintained for US41/M-28. Motorist seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard. The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened {{in the beginning of}} August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day. To address residents' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection, the mayor note that truck used the roundabout after the ribbon was cut. [...] "It just cruised right around and through. All of these people who are wondering is it big enough, can you get a firetruck on it? <b>Yes,</b> <b>you</b> can," [...] stated Mayor John Kivela.|$|E

However, he praised the final scene of glowing lanterns, naming it [...] "the most compellingly beautiful thing to appear in an Eminem video." [...] The music video was nominated for the category [...] "International Video of the Year–Group" [...] at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards.|$|E
500|$|After Bardiya was murdered, {{widespread}} revolts occurred {{throughout the}} empire, {{especially on the}} eastern side. Darius asserted his position as king by force, taking his armies throughout the empire, suppressing each revolt individually. The most notable of all these revolts was the Babylonian revolt which was led by Nebuchadnezzar III. This revolt occurred when Otanes withdrew much of the army from Babylon to aid Darius in suppressing other revolts. Darius felt that the Babylonian people had taken advantage of him and deceived him, which resulted in Darius gathering a large army and marching to Babylon. At Babylon, Darius was met with closed gates {{and a series of}} defences to keep him and his armies out. Darius encountered mockery and taunting from the rebels, including the famous saying [...] "Oh <b>yes,</b> <b>you</b> will capture our city, when mules shall have foals." [...] For a year and a half, Darius and his armies were unable to retake the city, though he attempted many tricks and strategies—even copying that which Cyrus the Great had employed when he captured Babylon. However, the situation changed in Darius's favour when, according to the story, a mule owned by Zopyrus, a high-ranking soldier, foaled. Following this, a plan was hatched for Zopyrus to pretend to be a deserter, enter the Babylonian camp, and gain the trust of the Babylonians. The plan was successful and Darius's army eventually surrounded the city and overcame the rebels.|$|E

500|$|The {{second season}} was made {{available}} {{in its entirety}} on February 14, 2014 (Valentine's Day) at 12:01a.m. PT. Prior {{to the release of}} season 1, three reviewers, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal, and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times, commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers. Stanley notes that the show [...] "is probably seen best one episode at a time. It's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast, but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderous—a romp slowed down to a dirge". Smith also notes that due to its [...] "relentless theme", [...] "House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged", deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a [...] "bag of M's". However, Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying [...] "So, on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and you simply cannot stop watching, then, <b>yes,</b> <b>you</b> may power-binge your way through all 13 hours at once". Upon viewing the four episode season 2 preview Time James Poniewozik says [...] "I could easily see powering through the season in a free weekend, precisely because no individual episode needs much time to sink in". Stanley also felt the second season was [...] "binge-worthy" [...] upon viewing the preview. However, Ellen Gray of Philly.com supports not binge-watching the season, as she believes it does not serve it well.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} used by Microsoft in its 2001 {{advertising}} campaign for Windows XP. It begins with a man leaping through a green field and then lifting off into a sunny sky—a landscape lifted from Windows XP's default [...] "bliss screen". There is also a series of images of people using Windows XP for real-time communications, to collaborate in an airy restaurant, to relay digital images of flying people, watch videos and listen to music. Then, a snippet from the song follows the phrase: [...] "Faster than the speeding light she's flying... You soar. <b>Yes</b> <b>you</b> can". The campaign was reworked after the September 11 attacks; the tag line [...] "Prepare to fly" [...] was changed to [...] "Yes you can", to sidestep new concerns about air travel, said Stephanie Ferguson, director of the company's PC Experience Solutions Marketing Group. In 2008, a Sunsilk shampoo commercial included shots of Marilyn Monroe and Shakira with songs well known by them, and ends with several video shots of Madonna {{to the sounds of}} [...] "Ray of Light". Madonna reportedly received US$10 million for the song's usage. The commercial premiered on Super Bowl XLII. In 2010, Glee tribute episode [...] "The Power of Madonna" [...] featured [...] "Ray of Light" [...] playing in the background as the school's cheerleading team performed a complicated stilts routine. In the 2011 Family Guy episode [...] "New Kidney in Town", main character Peter Griffin is seen in the [...] "Ray of Light" [...] video after drinking Red Bull.|$|E
500|$|Tatiana {{fell in love}} on {{at least}} one occasion. In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said <b>yes.</b> <b>You</b> remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that I forgot about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still. I must say a perfect son in law he w(ou)ld have been – why are foreign P(rin)ces not as nice!" [...] Malama was killed in August 1919 while commanding a unit of the White Russians fighting the civil war against the Bolsheviks in the Ukraine, according to Peter de Malama.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Madden: The Inquisition was {{not born}} out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. <b>Yes,</b> <b>you</b> read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the Code of Justinian made heresy a capital offense... In the early Middle Ages, people accused of heresy were judged by the local lord, many of whom lacked theological training.

Blethyn played a middle-aged newly widowed {{woman who is}} faced with the {{prospect}} of financial ruin and turns to growing marijuana under the tutelage of her gardener to save her home. Her performance in the film received favourable reviews; Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone: [...] "It's Blethyn's solid-gold charm [...] turns Saving Grace into a comic high." [...] The following year, Blethyn received her third Golden Globe nomination for her role in the film, which grossed an unexpected $24 million worldwide.

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with <b>Yes,</b> <b>you</b> heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK.

2500|$|Thomas F. Madden {{describes}} {{the world that}} formed medieval politics: [...] "The Inquisition was not born out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. <b>Yes,</b> <b>you</b> read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the Code of Justinian made it a capital offense. Rulers, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics". The monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to Castile to discover and punish crypto-Jews, and requested the pope's assent. Ferdinand II of Aragon pressured Pope Sixtus IV to agree to an Inquisition controlled by the monarchy by threatening to withdraw military support {{at a time when}} the Turks were a threat to Rome. The pope issued a bull to stop the Inquisition but was pressured into withdrawing it. [...] On 1 November 1478, Pope Sixtus IV published the Papal bull, Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus, through which he gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors in their kingdoms. The first two inquisitors, Miguel de Morillo and Juan de San Martín, were not named, however, until two years later, on 27 September 1480 in Medina del Campo.|$|E
