5|$|Limousins {{have become}} popular {{because of their}} low birth weights (ease of calving), higher than average {{dressing}} percentage (ratio of carcase to live weight) and <b>yield</b> (<b>ratio</b> of meat to carcase), high feed conversion efficiency, {{and their ability to}} produce lean, tender meat. A major multi-breed study reported that Limousins converted feed into saleable meat more efficiently and significantly faster than popular British breeds, and marginally faster than other popular continental European cattle breeds. Conversely, the other cattle breeds produced proportionally more low-cost by-product and waste, which resulted in their live weight growth being faster than Limousins. Limousins are especially favoured for crossbreeding with cattle such as Angus, Hereford and Shorthorn because of their ability to contribute hybrid vigour, and improve the yield and feed conversion efficiency of these British breeds, which produce higher levels of fat and marbled meat.|$|E
5|$|Investigation on this {{reaction}} was continued; {{the research was}} aimed at looking for fission fragments of isotopes of element 105. A subsequent paper was published in February 1970. Two activities were found, with half-lives of 14 ms and 2.2±0.5 s. The former activity was assigned to 242mfAm; the latter one was described as having been caused by an isotope of element 105. The possibility that the latter activity could come from a transfer reaction and thus not be from element 105 {{was said to be}} diminished {{by the fact that the}} <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> for {{this reaction}} was lower than that of the 242mfAm-producing transfer reaction. The idea that this synthesis reaction was indeed a (22Ne,xn) reaction was supported by research on reactions of the 243Am target with 18O; reactions producing 256103 and 257103 showed very little spontaneous fission (SF) activity (matching the established data), and the reaction producing heavier 258103 and 259103 produced no SF activity at all, falling in line with theoretical data.|$|E

A total of 88, 558 single test day milking weights from 15, 670 Italian Friesian cows in 610 herds in the province of Milano (Italy) were collected between September 1991 and October 1992. Ratios were computed for daily milk yield to a. m. and p. m. milking weights (direct <b>yield</b> <b>ratios)</b> and ratios of a. m. and p. m. milking weights to daily milk <b>yield</b> (inverse <b>yield</b> <b>ratios).</b> Analysis of variance indicated that the milking interval is the most important source of variation for <b>yield</b> <b>ratios.</b> Factors for estimating daily milk yield from single milking weights adjusted for milking intervals were derived through regression analysis of direct and inverse <b>yield</b> <b>ratios</b> on the length of the milking interval. Daily milk yield was estimated more precisely and accurately when adjustment factors were used than when single milking weights were doubled. The doubling of a. m. and p. m. milking weights overestimated and underestimated (5 % on average) daily milk yield, respectively. For 305 -d lactation yield, accuracies of these methods were comparable. In conclusion, alternate recording of a. m. and p. m. milking weights led to reliable estimates of milk yield.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{financial}} variables {{have been shown}} to be effective in explaining the time-series of aggregate equity returns in both the UK and the US. These include, "inter alia", the equity dividend yield, the spread between the yields on long and short government bonds, and the lagged equity return. Recently, however, the ratio between the long government bond yield and the equity dividend yield - the gilt-equity <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> - has emerged as a variable that has considerable explanatory power for UK equity returns. This paper compares the predictive ability of the gilt-equity <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> with these other variables for UK and US equity returns, providing evidence on both in-sample and out-of-sample performance. For UK monthly returns, it is shown that while the dividend yield has substantial in-sample explanatory power, this is not matched by out-of sample forecast accuracy. The gilt-equity <b>yield</b> <b>ratio,</b> in contrast, performs well both in-sample and out-of-sample. Although the predictability of US monthly equity returns is much lower than for the UK, a similar result emerges, with the gilt-equity <b>yield</b> <b>ratio</b> dominating the other variables in terms of both in-sample explanatory power and out-of-sample forecast performance.
