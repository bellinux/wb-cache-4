There are several starting points including Hin Tin Village, Sha Tin Tau Village and hung mui kuk barbecue area leading to the track of Lion Rock Mountain hiking route. It would take you 1 hour to 4 hours to complete the track depends on the starting point and ending point you choose.|$|E
25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume I took some Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
500|$|Made-up stories did not {{exclusively}} comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: [...] "We weren't really there to tell compelling stories... <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, {{or you could}} parody a commercial... <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> all these kinds of things, and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up." [...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E

500|$|For Prost, {{his debut}} victory was memorable mostly {{for the change}} it made in his mindset. [...] "Before, you thought <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] he said. [...] "Now you know you can." [...] Prost led from the start the next 5 races, and won two more races during the season, took his first pole {{position}} in Germany and finished on the podium every time he completed a race distance. He won again in Holland and Italy, and finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship, seven points behind champion Nelson Piquet.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska {{died at the}} age of 29 in 1975. She {{was buried}} on the Garretts' ranch outside Pawhuska. Garrett's {{grandson}} said of her that [...] "She was very gentle, the kind of mare <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything with." [...] He also said of her [...] "I guess you could say she was a family pet. I used to rider her out to the pastures to round up other mares, things like that." [...] She was on the leading dams of Race ROM earners from 1959 through 1969.|$|E
500|$|The smoking lamp was re-lit on 18 April, {{with the}} three days of {{prohibition}} having taken a noticeable toll on crew morale. Rather than passing the word in a traditional manner, Captain Beach demonstrated {{the lifting of the}} ban by walking though the ship smoking a cigar, blowing smoke in people's faces, and asking, [...] "Don't you wish <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> this?" [...] He recorded in his log that [...] "it took some 37seconds for the word to get around." [...] On 20 April 1960, the Triton crossed the Prime Meridian, and on 24 April, the sealed atmosphere experiment was terminated.|$|E

500|$|Alternative rock singer-songwriter Courtney Love of Hole heavily {{credited}} Smith {{as being}} a huge influence on her; Love received Smith's album Horses in juvenile hall as a teenager, and [...] "realized that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something that was completely subversive that didn't involve violence [...] felonies. I stopped making trouble," [...] said Love. [...] "I stopped." [...] Hole's classic track [...] "Violet" [...] features the lyrics [...] "And the sky was all violet / I want it again, but violent, more violent", alluding to lyrics from Smith's [...] "Kimberly". Love later stated that she considered [...] "Rock n Roll Nigger" [...] the greatest rock song of all time.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Benn reiterated his {{opposition}} to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution, saying: [...] "Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government, but we shall get it from Jacques Delors. They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament. I have never taken that view." [...] This argument has also been used by many on the right-wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party, such as Daniel Hannan MEP. Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that [...] "For , even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king's whim could change and there'd be nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The film also {{features}} minor roles {{for many of}} The Next Generations recurring characters; Dwight Schultz reprised his role of Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, while Patti Yasutake briefly appeared as Nurse [...] Whoopi Goldberg was not asked to return as , a wise bartender whose homeworld was destroyed by the Borg. Goldberg only learned about the decision through the newspapers. [...] "What can I say?

500|$|... was ported to the Game Boy Advance by Graphics State and {{distributed}} by THQ, and released on April 8, 2003. This version is fundamentally {{the same as}} the Crazy Taxi console versions, featuring the San Francisco and Los Angeles-themed maps but with a smaller selection of mini-games, adapted to play on the portable device using the Graphics State [...] "Rush" [...] engine. Specifically, while the city and streets are rendered using 3D graphics, the taxi, passengers, and other traffic are represented by sprites in order to work on the limited GBA hardware. Richard Whittall, creative director for Graphics State, noted that Catch A Ride was [...] "about the most technically challenging game <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> on a handheld machine" [...] {{at the time of its}} release.|$|E
500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were {{subsequently}} charged with drug offences. Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize {{that this was a}} whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> anything you wanted."

500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, the best thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors. Now, I'm afraid Iâ€™m going to have to show you the real thing.'" ...|$|E

500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tankâ€¦ What I think is <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mindâ€”honestlyâ€”this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost {{a lot more in}} terms of processing power. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If I needed a bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to writing a weekly column for The Dallas Morning News for 15years, Marcus {{was the author}} of multiple retailing-oriented books, including Minding the Store: A Memoir (1974), the sequel Quest for the Best (1979), and His & Hers: The Fantasy World of the Neiman Marcus Catalogue (1982) He was a close friend of other writers, including Jane Trahey, an author and longtime advertising copywriter who at one time worked for Neiman Marcus, and historian David McCullough. A television presenter for the public broadcasting program American Experience, McCullough said he once asked Stanley Marcusâ€“ [...] "one of the wisest men I know"â€“ what single problem or aspect of American life, if given a magic wand, he would change, to which Marcus replied, [...] "I'd try to do something about television." [...] When asked why, he explained, [...] "Because", he said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something about television, think how far you could go to solve all the other problems." ...|$|E

500|$|Another {{incentive}} for the show was to get more people to use the Internet. Sathe stated {{that it was an}} opportunity for younger people to bring the older members of their families onto the internet, and Yorke hoped that it would bring people onto the internet who had not used it before. Simon Nelson, BBC Vision controller of multiplatform and portfolio, said that this was an opportunity for the BBC to develop its expertise in drama production by exploiting the creative potential of the Internet to create a new online drama where few have succeeded. EastEnders: E20 primarily operates as a standalone series but also cross-references storylines of the main soap. According to Santer, the series also explores the stories of the soap's anonymous bystanders. He said, [...] "There are always other people [...] milling round the market and houses that we never go into. There are four or five parallels <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> It will be nice to see well-known characters through strangers' eyes. Ian Beale may show up and he is just a strange, irritating man. Or they might ask: 'Who is that moody girl in the market?' And it will be Stacey Slater." ...|$|E
500|$|The group's {{solution}} was to fly {{back and forth between}} Dublin and their concert destinations for about ten days to finish recording and mixing at night and during their off-days. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The group simultaneously used three separate rooms at Windmill Lane to mix, overdub, and edit. Adams said the hectic approach meant [...] "there was never anybody sitting around waiting or doing nothing". Flood called the period one of [...] "absolute lunacy". Eschewing console automation, the engineers adopted a [...] "live performance" [...] attitude to mixing, based on past experiences with Lanois. The band and production crew sat in on the mixing and offered encouragement, creating, as Adams put it, [...] "a kind of cheerleader thing. It all induces a nervous energy in you and creates a lot of pressure, and gives the whole thing a performance feel." [...] Recording concluded on 14 May 1993.|$|E
500|$|U2 {{recorded}} {{their next}} album, Zooropa, from February to May 1993 during an extended break between {{the third and}} fourth legs of the tour. The album was intended as a companion EP to Achtung Baby, but soon expanded into a full LP. Recording could not be completed before the tour restarted, and for the first month of the [...] "Zooropa" [...] leg, the band flew home after shows, recording until the early morning and working on their off-days, before travelling to their next destination. Clayton called the process [...] "about the craziest thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to yourself", while Mullen said of it, [...] "It was mad, but it was mad good, as opposed to mad bad." [...] McGuinness later said the band had nearly wrecked themselves in the process. The album was released on 5 July 1993. Influenced by the tour's themes of technology and mass media, Zooropa was an even greater departure in style from their earlier recordings than Achtung Baby was, incorporating further dance music influences and electronic effects into their sound. A number of songs from the album were incorporated into the subsequent [...] "Zooropa" [...] and [...] "Zoomerang" [...] legs, most frequently [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)". For the [...] "Zoomerang" [...] leg, [...] "Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car" [...] and [...] "Lemon" [...] were added to the encore and [...] "Dirty Day" [...] to the main set.|$|E
