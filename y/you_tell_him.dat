500|$|Playing {{opposite}} Cagney in Maggie the Magnificent was Joan Blondell, {{who starred}} again {{with him a}} few months later in Marie Baumer's new play Penny Arcade. While the critics panned Penny Arcade, they praised Cagney and Blondell. Al Jolson, sensing film potential, bought the rights for $20,000. He then sold the play to Warner Bros., with the stipulation that they cast Cagney and Blondell in the film version. Retitled Sinners' Holiday, the film was released in 1930. Cagney was given a $500-a-week, three-week contract. In the film, he portrays Harry Delano, a tough guy who becomes a killer, but generates sympathy because of his unfortunate upbringing. This role of the sympathetic [...] "bad" [...] guy was a recurring character type for Cagney throughout his career. During filming of Sinners' Holiday, he also demonstrated the stubbornness that characterized his work attitude. He later recalled an argument he had with director John Adolfi about a line: [...] "There was a line in the show where I was supposed to be crying on my mother's breast... was 'I'm your baby, ain't I?' I refused to say it. Adolfi said 'I'm going to tell Zanuck.' I said 'I don't give a shit what <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> I'm not going to say that line.'" [...] They took the line out.|$|E
500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, {{did you ever think}} that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him?</b> No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying a different approach to getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2001 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Ali again apologized to Frazier for calling him names which, Ali claimed, {{was done to}} promote their fights. Frazier initially accepted the apology saying {{it was time to}} put this issue behind them. However, subsequently Frazier commented that Ali should apologize directly to him instead of apologizing through a newspaper. Reacting to this, Ali stated: [...] "If you see Frazier, <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; any {{message that}} I can that shall {{go along with}} my sincere {{attachment}} to Colonel Stubbs. <b>You</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs. <b>You</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> Aunt Emmeline?" ...|$|R

2500|$|For years afterwards, Frazier {{retained}} his bitterness towards Ali {{and suggested}} that Ali's battle with Parkinson's syndrome {{was a form of}} divine retribution for his earlier behavior. In 2001, Ali apologized to Frazier via a New York Times article, saying [...] "In a way, Joe's right. I said {{a lot of things in}} the heat of the moment that I shouldn't have said. Called him names I shouldn't have called him. I apologize for that. I'm sorry. It was all meant to promote the fight". Frazier reportedly [...] "embraced it", though he later retorted that Ali only apologized to a newspaper, not to him. He said: [...] "I'm still waiting [...] to say it to me." [...] To this Ali responded: [...] "If you see Frazier, <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> he's still a gorilla." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{tell him}} I ain't. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I've a bad bilious headache, {{and that the}} air in the garden does it good. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I mean to have {{something}} to eat up-stairs when my head is better; and do you mind and let me have it, and a bottle of claret." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you kindly. I {{must get}} out. I won't stand long of it--not much longer. I'm {{not used to}} it--always been {{accustomed}} to the air, an' bein' about, that's where 'tis. But don't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> miss. You say I'm goin' along all right. Don't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> what I said. 'Tis no use him frettin' over me. 'Twon' do me no good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right. I'll {{hunt for}} him. If <b>you</b> see <b>him</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> to hole up, {{and then you}} come after me. <b>Tell</b> <b>him</b> I've got our men spotted." ...|$|R
60|$|Hect. Go <b>you</b> before. <b>Tell</b> <b>him</b> of our approach, Which will, I fear, be much unwelcome to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Right along," [...] {{answered}} the young lady, [...] "I'm with you, but as to writing Mr. Trent, <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> from me, Mr. Da Souza, {{that we want}} to have nothing more to do with him. A fellow that can treat ladies as he has treated us is no gentleman. <b>You</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that. He's an ignorant, common fellow, and for my part I despise him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know he did," [...] said Stoker with a blaze {{as from a}} long-smouldering fury, [...] "and damn him, I'm {{not going}} to have it. I'm not going to, plead the baby act with him, or with any man. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so, when you get the chance. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I don't hold him {{accountable}} for anything I made him do. That ain't business; I don't want him around me, any more; but if he wants {{to go back to the}} paper he can have his place. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> I stand by what I done; and it's all right between him and me. I hain't done anything about it, the way I wanted him to help me to; I've let it lay, and I'm a-going to. I guess it ain't going to do me any harm, after all; our people hain't got very long memories; but if it is, let it. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And here am I starving," [...] {{burst out}} the horrible {{woman with a}} flood of drunken tears. [...] "Starving without a {{shilling}} {{to pay for a}} cab or a drink while my wedded husband lives in luxury with another woman. <b>You</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I won't stand it; <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that if he don't find a 'thou.' pretty quick I'll let him know the reason why." ...|$|E

'That drunkard,' said Beckwith, 'who had {{free access}} to your rooms at all times, that he might drink the strong drinks that you left in his way and be the sooner ended, holding no more terms with you than he would hold with a tiger, has had his master-key for all your locks, his test for all your poisons, his clue to your cipher- writing.

He can <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> as well as <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> that all this was recorded day by day, as a lesson of experience for future service.
