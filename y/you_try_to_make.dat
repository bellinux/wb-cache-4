500|$|At 08:24:38, Atta {{tried to}} make an {{announcement}} to the passengers, but pressed the wrong button and sent the message to Boston ARTCC. Air traffic controllers heard Atta announce, [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you'll be O.K. We are returning to the airport." [...] At 08:24:56, he announced [...] "Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] As before, Atta thought he was speaking to only the passengers, but his voice was picked up and recorded by air traffic controllers. After the transmissions by Atta and the inability to contact the airliner, air traffic controllers at Boston ARTCC realized the flight had been hijacked. At 08:26, the plane turned south. At 08:32, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, notified FAA headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the 2015 San Bernardino shooting, Hirsi Ali commented {{on the nature of}} radicalization within {{communities}} of Islamic believers saying, [...] "If we talk about the process of what we now call radicalization, that you see a process where individuals are putting on a religious identity. It's all about being a Muslim, you shed the rest of it or you downplay the rest of it and <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> everyone else as pious as yourself. And this would be, looking back at San Bernardino, the telltale signs. These changes that the family, the friends, the close circle of relatives should have observed." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hijacking}} {{began at}} 8:14am—15 {{minutes after the}} flight departed—when beverage service would be starting. At this time, the pilots stopped responding to air traffic control, and the aircraft began deviating from the planned route. At 8:18am, flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney began making phone calls to American Airlines to report what was happening. Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, {{lack of access to}} the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38am, a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: [...] "We have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will be OK. We are returning to the airport." [...] "Nobody move, everything will be OK. If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any moves you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet." [...] "Nobody move, please. We are going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid moves." [...] The plane's transponder was turned off at 8:28am. At 8:46:40am, Atta flew the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, Die Antwoord left Interscope Records over {{a dispute}} {{concerning}} their upcoming album and its lead single, [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers". Visser explained that Interscope [...] "kept pushing {{us to be}} more generic" [...] {{in order to make}} more money: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> songs that other people like, your band will always be shit. You always gotta do what you like. If it connects, it's a miracle, but it happened with Die Antwoord." [...] Die Antwoord formed their own independent label, Zef Recordz, and released their new album Ten$Ion through it. The release was in association with the Good Smile Company (a Japanese company that is also making Die Antwoord toys) and Downtown Records, which is handling the marketing and distribution for the record worldwide. Ten$Ion included three more singles following [...] "Fok Julle Naaiers": [...] "I Fink U Freeky", [...] "Baby's on Fire", and [...] "Fatty Boom Boom". The singles included on Ten$Ion began to bring Die Antwoord more into the global spotlight as they were invited to perform on American talk shows and featured in an Alexander Wang advertisement. However the album was met with average to poor reviews by many critics. Ten$Ion was followed up with a non-album single, [...] "XP€N$IV $H1T".|$|E
