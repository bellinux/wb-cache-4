[...] "I don't want to reveal too much, but it's me. It'll be dark." [...] When speaking with Shock 'Till <b>You</b> <b>Drop,</b> he revealed [...] "I have a take on it you're not going to expect. I'm taking it in a different direction, let's put it that way." [...] However, this version of the remake seems to be shelved.|$|E
500|$|John Kosik of the Associated Press criticized its price, stating: [...] "For $200, casual fans {{may want}} to steer clear." [...] Kosik also said that what it [...] "offers the hard-core {{listener}} goes beyond the distinct romance of vinyl's warm, earthy sound." [...] Bob Gendron of TONEAudio wrote that the box set was a [...] "godsend" [...] and also {{said that they were}} [...] "amazingly produced LPs that bring to life several of the greatest metal records ever made…" [...] Guitar World praised the box set for its mastering, saying the benefits of the treatment [...] "are immediately clear when <b>you</b> <b>drop</b> the needle onto one of these babies. Basically all the songs Slayer fans lose their mind over are here, sounding heavier, livelier and more brutal than ever." [...] He also said that the remastering made a listener want to thoroughly listen to the music.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Annie held a monthly DJ night called Pop Till <b>You</b> <b>Drop</b> with friend Frøken Blytt in her {{hometown}} of Bergen, Norway. There she met producer Tore Kroknes, and the two began dating. Annie and Kroknes borrowed a small studio from downtempo duo Röyksopp to record her debut single [...] "The Greatest Hit". The song, which uses a sample of Madonna's 1982 dance-pop single [...] "Everybody", had a limited edition release in 1999. It became an underground hit at clubs in Norway and Britain, resulting in offers for record deals. The two recorded Annie's second single, titled [...] "I Will Get On". She focused on vocals and melodies in music, and Kroknes concentrated on production, influenced by techno, disco and house music. As she began to work on her debut album, Kroknes became ill due to a heart defect. He died eighteen months later, in April 2001. Because of their plan to make the album together, Annie struggled with the idea of collaborating with anyone else and stopped work on it entirely.|$|E

500|$|David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound {{commented that}} [...] "Till the World Ends", [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and [...] "Inside Out" [...] "simultaneously send Spears {{back to basics}} vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] Rudy Klapper of Sputnikmusic said that the song [...] "throbs with trance-y synths, a thumping electro beat that is pure sex and a chorus that goes and goes as only the best club hits can do, {{sensible}} lyrics be damned." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said that [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] sets the pace of Femme Fatale, while calling it [...] "a stadium-rocking pop anthem." [...] Keith Caulfield from Billboard said that the song has a [...] "roof-shaking chant-chorus", but criticized the lyrics, saying that they have [...] "been echoed incessantly {{over the past year}} in countless Hot 100 top ten hits: dance until <b>you</b> <b>drop</b> from exhaustion." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine compared it to Kesha's [...] "Blow", saying that the tracks [...] " [...] so similar [...] that I can't decide which one I like more—or if I even like them at all." [...] A reviewer from Popjustice also compared it to [...] "Blow", but said [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was not as good.|$|E
500|$|Some {{reception}} of the film, however, was much more positive, in particular by reviewers for horror outlets. Michael Gingold of Fangoria gave it two-and-half out of four skulls, while Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting gave it {{four out of five}} skulls, stating it [...] "isn’t a movie meant to scare or make you think but {{it is one of the}} most entertaining and enjoyable movies of its kind that I’ve seen in years." [...] Scott Weinberg of FEARnet wrote that [...] "aside from some very clunky editorial missteps in the film's second half, there's a good deal of wit, enthusiasm, energy, and amusing attitude to be found in the dumb-yet-self-aware Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," [...] all while noting that he is [...] "not the type to act snobbish around a ridiculous film that obviously knows it's ridiculous." [...] According to Ryan Larson of Shock Till <b>You</b> <b>Drop,</b> the film [...] "is a mixed bag" [...] but [...] "fortunately, the lows don’t appear as often as you would think," [...] and, [...] "if taken at face value, Hansel & Gretel is well worth the view." [...] William Bibbiani of CraveOnline, who criticized the film's inadequately [...] "limp" [...] marketing campaign, found the movie itself [...] "inherently stupid" [...] but in a good way, [...] "played with humor, ultraviolence and anachronistic fetish." [...] Cinema Blend's Sean O'Connell stated that the film is [...] "often mean and nasty, but that's really its saving grace." [...] Peter Paras of E! recommended this [...] "super violent, pretty funny flick" [...] for how it [...] "revels in the mayhem". Tom Russo of The Boston Globe, giving the film three out of five stars, called it a [...] "splattery fanboy fun. Preposterous, clearly, but fun." [...] Jonathon Natsis of Filmink wrote: [...] "Hansel and Gretel is not a 'film'. It's a 'movie', in all its unabashed, excitable glory...big on blood-soaked entertainment and low on pretension." [...] Rick Florino of Artistdirect gave it four out of five stars, stating: [...] "This has all the elements of a classic action flick, and it's destined for cult status. Welcome to the most fun movie of 2013." [...] DVD Talk's Jamie S. Rich summed up: [...] "Is Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters a good movie? Probably not. At least not in any way that is defensible by regular critical standards. Is it a hell of a good time? Absolutely so. Unabashedly so. That's all it wants to be." ...|$|E
