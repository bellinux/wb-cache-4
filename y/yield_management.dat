With the new system, Greyhound is now able to more closely manage the number of tickets sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> {{has become}} part of {{mainstream}} business theory and practice over the last fifteen to twenty years. Whether an emerging discipline or a new management science (it has been called both), <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> is a set of yield maximization strategies and tactics to improve the profitability of certain businesses. It is complex because it involves several aspects of management control, including rate management, revenue streams management, and distribution channel management. <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> is multidisciplinary because it blends elements of marketing, operations, and financial management into a highly successful new approach. <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> strategists must frequently work with one or more other departments when designing and implementing <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> strategies.|$|E
25|$|Firms {{that engage}} in <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> usually use {{computer}} <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> systems to do so. The Internet has greatly facilitated this process.|$|E
25|$|In this way, <b>yield</b> <b>management's</b> overall aim is {{to provide}} an optimal mix of goods {{at a variety of}} price points at {{different}} points in time or for different baskets of features.

5000|$|Cecil and Clayton <b>yielded</b> <b>management</b> of {{the theatre}} to Mrs. John Wood and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, {{although}} Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895. The first {{production in the}} new building was a play by Sydney Grundy titled Mamma, starring Mrs. John Wood and John Hare, with Arthur Cecil and Eric Lewis.|$|R
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>Management</b> also {{includes}} many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices {{over time to}} reflect demand. This level of <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> makes {{up the majority of}} <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> in the airline industry. For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday after Thanksgiving at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply.|$|E
25|$|When <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> was {{introduced}} in the early 1990s, primarily in the airline industry, many suggested that despite the obvious immediate increase in revenues, it might harm customer satisfaction and loyalty, interfere with relationship marketing, and drive customers from firms that used <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> to firms that do not. Frequent flier programs were developed as a response to regain customer loyalty and reward frequent and high yield passengers.

25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> {{spread to}} other travel and {{transportation}} companies in the early 1990s. Notable was implementation of <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> at National Car Rental. In 1993, General Motors was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental. In response, National's program expanded the definition of <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> to include capacity management, pricing and reservations control. As {{a result of this}} program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> refers specifically to maximizing revenue through inventory control. Some notable revenue management implementations include the NBC which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at UPS, and revenue management at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and dynamic packaging that underlie ecommerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rental}} car industry, <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> deals with the sale of {{optional}} insurance, damage waivers and vehicle upgrades.

50|$|Beginning in 1881, Cecil {{joined the}} company at the Royal Court Theatre. From 1883, he was co-manager, with John Clayton, of that theatre. There, he played {{in a number of}} farces by A. W.

25|$|Hotels {{use this}} system in largely the same way, to {{calculate}} the rates, rooms and restrictions on sales in order to best maximize their return. These systems measure constrained and unconstrained demand along with pace to gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival. <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> teams in the hotel industry have evolved tremendously over the last 10 years and in this global economy targeting the right distribution channels, controlling costs, and having the right market mix {{plays an important role}} in <b>yield</b> <b>management.</b> <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> in hotels is selling rooms and services at the right price, at the right time, to the right people.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{optimising}} {{revenue in}} theory, introduction of <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> {{does not always}} achieve this in practice because of corporate image problems. In 2002, Deutsche Bahn, the German national railway company, experimented with <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> for frequent loyalty card passengers. The fixed pricing model that had existed for decades was replaced with a more demand-responsive pricing model, but this reform proved highly unpopular with passengers, leading to widespread protests {{and a decline in}} passenger numbers.|$|E
25|$|Firms {{faced with}} lack of pricing power {{sometimes}} turn to <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> {{as a last}} resort. After {{a year or two}} using <b>yield</b> <b>management,</b> many of them are surprised to discover they have actually lowered prices for the majority of their opera seats or hotel rooms or other products. That is, they offer far higher discounts more frequently for off-peak times, while raising prices only marginally for peak times, resulting in higher revenue overall.|$|E

25|$|Good <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> maximizes (or {{at least}} {{significantly}} increases) revenue production {{for the same}} number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings. While <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> systems tend to generate higher revenues, the revenue streams tends to arrive later in the booking horizon as more capacity is held for late sale at premium prices.|$|E
25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> is of {{especially}} high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less variable cost there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. <b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E

Included are studies of bird, mammal, and insect use of woody and herbaceous corridors and adjacent cropfields in east-central Nebraska. Uncultivated areas needed to sustain natural enemies of crop pests also provide other benefits.

25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>management</b> is {{particularly}} suitable when selling perishable products, i.e. goods that become unsellable {{at a point}} in time (for example air tickets just after a flight takes off). Industries that use <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> include airlines, hotels, stadiums and other venues with a fixed number of seats, and advertising. With an advance forecast of demand and pricing flexibility, buyers will self-sort based on their price sensitivity (using more power in off-peak hours or going to the theater mid-week), their demand sensitivity (must have the higher cost early morning flight or must go to the Saturday night opera) or their time of purchase (usually paying a premium for booking late).|$|E
25|$|Some {{consumers}} {{are concerned that}} <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> could penalize them for conditions which cannot be helped and are unethical to penalize. For example, the formulas, algorithms, and neural networks that determine airline ticket prices could feasibly consider frequent flyer information, which includes a wealth of socio-economic information such as age and home address. The airline then could charge higher prices to consumers who are between certain ages or who live in neighborhoods with higher average wealth, even if those neighborhoods also include poor households. Very few (if any) airlines using <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> are able to employ this level of price discrimination because prices are not set based on characteristics of the purchaser, which are in any case often not known {{at the time of}} purchase.|$|E
25|$|While {{railways}} traditionally sold fully flexible tickets {{that were}} valid on all trains {{on a given}} day or even trains on several days, deregulation and (partial) privatization introduced <b>yield</b> <b>management</b> in the United Kingdom as well as for high speed services in Germany or France.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a range of pasture {{management}} options (introduced legumes and grasses, super-phosphate, timber treatment, cultivation before sowing and stocking rate) on the amounts of ground cover {{at the end of the}} dry season were measured from 1985 – 1991 at two sites, Hillgrove and Cardigan, near Charters Towers, north-east Queensland. Ground cover levels varied signifi-cantly between years and were significantly affected by pasture management.
