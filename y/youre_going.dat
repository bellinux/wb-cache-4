60|$|TROTTER. If it {{were not}} so {{obviously}} a stage cliche, I should say Damn Cambridge. As it is, I blame my kittens. And now let me warn you. If <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to be a charming healthy young English girl, you may coax me. If <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to be an unsexed Cambridge Fabian virago, I'll treat you as my intellectual equal, as I would treat a man.|$|E

6000|$|REGINALD. <b>Youre</b> not <b>going</b> {{to speak}} to me again, anyhow, are you? Do you suppose I'm going to visit you when you marry him? ...|$|R
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. Stuff, Sinjon! Of course {{people must}} get married. [Uneasily] Alfred: why dont you say something? Surely <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> {{to let this}} go on.|$|R
60|$|MRS KNOX. Margaret: if <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to be {{hardened}} about it, {{theres no}} use my saying anything.|$|E

60|$|HOTCHKISS. I hope so. Surely <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to be vindictive, Rejjy. Besides, youll {{have all}} the {{advantages}} I formerly enjoyed. Youll be the visitor, the relief, the new face, the fresh news, the hopeless attachment: I shall only be the husband.|$|R
60|$|SIR PATRICK. No: {{about your}} behavior. Theres {{nothing wrong with}} your spine; and theres nothing wrong with your heart; but theres {{something}} wrong with your common sense. <b>Youre</b> not <b>going</b> to die; but you may be {{going to make a}} fool of yourself. So be careful.|$|R
5000|$|Jordan Devore of Destructoid quoted [...] "A {{satisfying}} run-and-gun game {{made even}} {{better with a}} fun (and funny!) take on time travel." [...] He continued, [...] "Youll likely be able to burn through the game {{in a few hours}} if <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> for full completion, but it has such a winning personality that youll find yourself coming back for more." ...|$|R
6000|$|SIR PATRICK. Put {{down your}} foolish pencil, man; {{and think of}} your position. You can defy the laws made by men; {{but there are other}} laws to reckon with. Do you know that <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to die? ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. They shouldnt {{happen to}} anybody, I suppose. But they do. [Rising impatiently] And really I'd rather {{go out and}} assault another {{policeman}} {{and go back to}} Holloway than keep talking round and round it like this. If <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to turn me out of the house, turn me out: the sooner I go the better.|$|E
60|$|GUNN [interrupting him] I {{know what}} <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to say, Count. <b>Youre</b> <b>going</b> {{to say that}} the whole thing seems to you to be quite new and unusual and original. The naval {{lieutenant}} is a Frenchman who cracks up the English and runs down the French: the hackneyed old Shaw touch. The characters are second-rate middle class, instead of being dukes and millionaires. The heroine gets kicked through the mud: real mud. Theres no plot. All the old stage conventions and puppets without the old ingenuity and the old enjoyment. And a feeble air of intellectual pretentiousness kept up all through to persuade you that if the author hasnt written a good play it's because hes too clever to stoop to anything so commonplace. And you three experienced men have sat through all this, and cant tell me who wrote it! Why, the play bears the author's signature in every line.|$|E
50|$|The Times reviewer, Michael Billington, was not impressed: Inspired by Jules Verne", {{the credits}} for this film rather cryptically announce. One cant {{argue with the}} credits, of course; but a more {{instantly}} recognizable inspiration is that brand of screen comedy that assumes that a large gathering of well-known names plus some vintage piece of machinery (a car for preference, but a plane or rocket will do) adds up to irresistible mirth. But, as this film takes nearly two hours to demonstrate, its no use cramming the cast with comedy actors if <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to give them anything very funny to do.|$|R
6000|$|TARLETON. Good. Well, do {{you like}} me? Dont {{misunderstand}} me: I'm perfectly aware that <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> {{to fall in love}} at first sight with a ridiculous old shopkeeper. I cant help that ridiculous old shopkeeper. I have to carry him about with me whether I like it or not. I have to pay for his clothes, though I hate the cut of them: especially the waistcoat. I have to look at him in the glass while I'm shaving. I loathe him because hes a living lie. My soul's not like that: it's like yours. I want to make a fool of myself. About you. Will you let me? ...|$|R
5000|$|Barrymore {{repeatedly}} {{called to}} plea that she {{play the role}} of Anita. Davis later said, [...] "I saw her and knew she was perfect. You could see shes been through a lot, and the world has not been easy to her. And yet she has this incredible vulnerability. Shes so determined to prove that shes worthy of the Barrymore name." [...] Barrymore said, [...] "Anita was very close to home for me. Not that I was so much like her. Im not. But I had the best understanding of her than any character Ive ever played in my life." [...] Barrymore declined to have a chauffeur drive her to the filming locations, which is commonly done for actors. According to Davis: [...] "She said, No, <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to treat me like a baby. She said, I can get to work on time on my own." ...|$|R
60|$|BLENKINSOP [putting {{his fingers}} in his ears] No, no: it's no use. I know what <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to say: Ive said it often to others. I cant afford {{to take care of}} myself; and theres an end of it. If a fortnight's holiday would save my life, I'd have to die. I shall get on as others have to get on. We cant all go to St Moritz or to Egypt, you know, Sir Ralph. Dont talk about it.|$|E
60|$|BLENKINSOP [stopping him resolutely] No: I {{know what}} <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to say; but I wont take it. Ive never {{borrowed}} a penny; and I never will. Ive nothing left but my friends; and I wont sell them. If {{none of you}} were {{to be able to}} meet me without being afraid that my civility was leading up to the loan of five shillings, there would be an end of everything for me. I'll take your old clothes, Colly, sooner than disgrace you by talking to you in the street in my own; but I wont borrow money. I'll train it as far as the twopence will take me; and I'll tramp the rest.|$|E
60|$|Come! you wouldn't {{refuse the}} {{acquaintance}} of my mother's cousin the Duke of Belgravia {{because some of}} the rents he gets are earned in queer ways. You wouldn't cut the Archbishop of Canterbury, I suppose, because the Ecclesiastical Commissioners have a few publicans and sinners among their tenants. Do you remember your Crofts scholarship at Newnham? Well, that was founded by my brother the M.P. He gets his 22 per cent out of a factory with 600 girls in it, and not one of them getting wages enough to live on. How d'ye suppose they manage when they have no family to fall back on? Ask your mother. And {{do you expect me to}} turn my back on 35 per cent when all the rest are pocketing what they can, like sensible men? No such fool! If <b>youre</b> <b>going</b> to pick and choose your acquaintances on moral principles, youd better clear out of this country, unless you want to cut yourself out of all decent society.|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{showed it}} to Al Feldstein, {{and the first thing}} I said was, Al, Ive got this crazy idea, and <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to buy it, because it mutilates the magazine. So I put it in front of him, and the thing about Al was, he liked things that {{intrigued}} him. The mechanics of it intrigued him. He said, You mean, you fold it, like this [...] [...] [...] ? And then [...] [...] [...] ? He folded it, he unfolded it, he folded it, and then he said, I like this! But I said, Al, it mutilates the magazine. And he said, Well, Ill have to check it with Bill. He takes it, runs it to Bills office, and he was there a little while, and he comes back and he says, Were going to do it! You know what Bill said? Bill said, [...] "So they mutilate the magazine, and then theyll buy another one to save!" ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{was told}} that at Disney the actor was told to play it like a cartoon with all that exaggeration. In Lord of the Rings, I had the actors play it straight. The {{rotoscope}} {{in the past has}} been used in scenes and then exaggerated. The action becomes cartoony. The question then comes up that if <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to be cartoony, why animate? ...It is the traditional method of rotoscoping but the approach is untraditional. Its a rotoscope realism unlike anything thats been seen. It really is a unique thing for animation. The number of characters moving in a scene is staggering. In The Lord of the Rings, you have hundreds of people in the scene. We have cels with a thousand people on them. It was so complex sometimes wed only get one cel a week from an artist. It turned out that the simple shots were the ones that only had four people in them. Ralph Bakshi ...|$|R
5000|$|Giddish {{made her}} debut as Detective Amanda Rollins in the 13th season premiere, [...] "Scorched Earth", {{in which the}} {{character}} first works alongside Detective Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay). In an interview with TV Guide, Giddish said about her character, [...] "My character is in complete awe of Olivia, Amandas really eager {{to get in there}} because she knows her stuff and really eager to learn. She has come from Atlanta and there was a ceiling there, so shes come up to New York." [...] Giddish felt great about joining the series in its 13th season, [...] "I couldnt feel better about it. ... Theres no intimidation, what attracted me was the prospect of re-invigorating a franchise thats been so well-known and so well-liked, and then to be the shaker and mover." [...] Giddish expressed confidence that viewers would warm up to Rollins and another new character, Nick Amaro (Pino), with time. [...] "Theyre going to love us because its not being forced in their faces," [...] she says. [...] "The more you know about us and the more you see us in your living room, the more <b>youre</b> hopefully <b>going</b> to love us." ...|$|R

5000|$|PPO: [...] "You seem so {{positive}} {{to me and}} so gung ho. What drives you? Is it just in you?"Tara: [...] "I think it just all {{has to do with}} me wanting to walk again. When this happened I was completely devastated. I mean, this has been my life since I was 11-years-old. This is what I know and its what I love. Its what I absolutely, without a doubt love. I mean, not being able to ride my bike again {{for the rest of my}} life... It would crush me. And so for me, I cant have a negative thought in my mind. I cant because you know doctors can come in, and they can walk in... and say, [...] "youre never going to walk again." [...] But, you know what, to me so much of it is mind over matter. They do a test the first week that youre here in Craig and in the test they deemed me [...] "complete". What complete means is that basically <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to walk again. You know what? My legs have started to move again, especially my left leg. One of my doctors was like, [...] "holy shit!". I said, [...] "you can take your complete and shove it!" [...] Not to her of course..." ...|$|R
5000|$|This open {{promotion}} of certain viewpoints resulted in criticism from journalism professors and other newspaper editors, who worried that negative news about {{topics such as}} the military and business might not be covered. Dean Nelson, director of the journalism program at Point Loma Nazarene University, argued, [...] "Now if <b>youre</b> saying were <b>going</b> to be the cheerleaders of the military, why would you report on this guy thats taking bribes?... Wheres the cheerleading there?" [...] {{a reference to the}} Union-Tribunes Pulitzer Prize winning coverage of the Duke Cunningham bribery scandal. A New York Times writer added, [...] "There is a growing worry that the falling value and failing business models of many American newspapers could lead to a situation where moneyed interests buy papers and use them to prosecute a political and commercial agenda. That future appears to have arrived in San Diego." ...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with Democracy Now!, Suskind {{states that he}} confirmed the claims of Richer and Maguire in several interviews: [...] "The fact is, is it’s {{not a matter of}} a passing conversation. We had many conversations on this specific issue, on the Habbush matter, with all of the key sources. There was never any mystery about what it was, what the Habbush letter was, what the Habbush mission entailed, in terms of the setup with the Iraq intelligence chief. I mean, exhaustive, hour after hour. And the way I do it as an investigative reporter, is you go back again and again and again." [...] And in the NPR interview, he claims that both Richer and Maguire had indicated a willingness to testify against the Administration about these allegations: [...] "both of them, frankly, are big believers in the truth process. And Ive talked to both of them about, Hey, <b>youre</b> never <b>going</b> to feel heat quite like this. And they said, both of them, Richer and Maguire, Im ready to go in front of Senate committees and House committees. Im ready to have my moment. They knew everything that was in the book. You know, once they get there and the moment arrives, sometimes their knees buckle. And then you kind of say, All right, lets take a deep breath. And you get them upright, and they tend to often then walk forward." ...|$|R

5000|$|When Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{began to}} lose ground in the polls, Chrétien was the major beneficiary. In {{preparation}} for the 1993 election, Chrétien {{won the right to}} have the final say over riding nominations and to veto any candidate that displeased him. Chrétiens use of this power caused some protests within the Liberal Party with John Nunziata publicly complaining that [...] "The backroom guys have taken control of the party. I guess they think they can muzzle us all". Chrétien told one prospective Liberal candidate Hec Clouthier, who informed Chrétien that was probably going to win the nomination to be the Liberal candidate for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, defeating the incumbent Len Hopkins that: [...] "Well, you might the nomination. But <b>youre</b> not <b>going</b> to get the chance...I am the boss. I have the right to make this decision. I have an agenda for this country. I want to be prime minister and do great things, and Ive got to put people in place who I can know can win". Chrétien added that he knew Hopkins could win because he won his seat eight times in a row while Clouthier had no equivalent record. When Clouthier refused to withdraw his candidacy as ordered and looked certain to win the Liberal nomination for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, he was expelled from the Liberal Party. Chrétien was so confident {{that he was going to}} win the 1993 election that he formed his transition team in October 1992 to prepare for the hand-over of power 13 months before it actually happened.|$|R
