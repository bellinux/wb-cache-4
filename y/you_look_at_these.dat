I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there." ...|$|E

60|$|The harper thrummed with rapid fingers; {{the violin}} player flashed his bow {{back and forth}} across the strings; the flautist poured his breath in quick puffs of jollity, while Donatello shook the {{tambourine}} above his head, and led the merry throng with unweariable steps. As they followed one another in a wild ring of mirth, it seemed the realization of one of those bas-reliefs where a dance of nymphs, satyrs, or bacchanals is twined around the circle of an antique vase; or it was like the sculptured scene on the front and sides of a sarcophagus, where, as often as any other device, a festive procession mocks the ashes and white bones that are treasured up within. You might take it for a marriage pageant; but after a while, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> merry-makers, following them from end to end of the marble coffin, you doubt whether their gay movement is leading them to a happy close. A youth has suddenly fallen in the dance; a chariot is overturned and broken, flinging the charioteer headlong to the ground; a maiden seems to have grown faint or weary, and is drooping on the bosom of a friend. Always some tragic incident is shadowed forth or thrust sidelong into the spectacle; and when once it has caught your eye you can look no more at the festal portions of the scene, except with reference to this one slightly suggested doom and sorrow.|$|E

[...] "In the first place there's the wind; it most always blows here, and one only has to keep that in a certain quarter. If there ain't no wind, there's the grass and the bushes; if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> bushes you will see that they most all turn a little from the {{direction}} in which the wind generally blows, and this grass, which is in seed, droops over the same way. Then, in course, there is {{the general direction of the}} valleys, and of any little streams. All of these are things one goes by at first, but it gets to come natural, what they call by instinct; one knows, somehow, which is the way to go without looking for signs. You will get to it in time, if you are long enough on the plains; but at present you watch the forms of all the bushes and the lay of the grass, 'cause you see in hunting we might get separated, and you might miss your way. If you should do so, and ain't sure of your direction, fire your gun three times, as quick as you can load it, and if we are in hearing we will fire a gun in reply and come to you; but you will soon get to know the signs of the country if you will pay attention and keep your eyes skinned." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} to the nature versus nurture and learned versus innate debate, proponents of cultural evolution argue that cognitive psychology {{must take into account}} historical processes when studying and discussion cognition (Tomasello, 1999). For example, the similarities between languages have led many researchers to decry that language or aspects of language must be innate. The extreme variability in math and counting systems across cultures has prevented similar conclusions for math. However, Tomasello argues that if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> concepts with historical processes in mind, another plausible explanation could be that language, but not math, developed before people split into different populations. Math developed only after such split, and because the cultural needs of these people differed, differential counting and mathematical systems resulted. The critique is that categorizing concepts as innate or learned does not tell us anything about the process by which they originally developed.|$|E
5000|$|Jawaharlal Nehru's {{tribute to}} Roerich, When I think of Nicholas Roerich I am astounded at {{the scope and}} {{abundance}} of his activities and creative genius. A great artist, a great scholar and writer, archaeologist and explorer, he touched and lighted up so many aspects of human endeavour. The very quantity is stupendous - thousands of paintings and {{each one of them}} a great work of art. When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> paintings, so many of them of the Himalayas, you seem to catch the spirit of those great mountains which have towered over the Indian plain and been our sentinels for ages past. They remind us of so much in our history, our thought, our cultural and spiritual heritage so much not merely of the India of the past but of something that is permanent and eternal about India, that we cannot help feeling a great sense of indebtedness to Nicholas Roerich who has enshrined that spirit in these magnificent canvases.|$|E

40|$|New {{research}} by The Australia Institute suggests {{more than a}} million young Australians feel no political party best represents the needs of young people. Summary:The new survey of more than 800 respondents aged 17 - 25 found 47 per cent believe no party best represents them. “This should act as a warning to our politicians that it’s time to release some policy that’s directed at young people because there are clearly plenty of votes to be won,” Executive Director of The Australia Institute Dr Richard Denniss said. “When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>these</b> figures it’s not surprising that we also found a high level of disinterest among younger Australians,” Dr Denniss said. 15 per cent of respondents said they were ‘disinterested’ in the upcoming election, while 30 per cent said they were ‘not really interested. ’ The survey also found that 68 per cent of young Australians don’t know who their local Member of Parliament is and 59 per cent of those who are not enrolled to vote, don’t intend to. “The confusion and disinterest among our future leaders is baffling, but I think for the most part it’s not their fault. It’s up to the politicians to engage them and win them over with policy,” Dr Denniss said. The Australia Institute also asked what factors would change how young people intended to vote. Just 18 per cent of respondents believe a positive meeting with their local member would influence their vote, while 34 per cent said media stories would have an impact. 22 per cent nominated political advertising as a factor which could sway their vote.
