50|$|Dubois {{mentioned}} {{three kinds}} of birds of prey extant on Réunion in the early 1670s: in order of decreasing size, papangues (the local marsh harrier which still exists), pieds jaunes ("yellow-feet") and émerillons (a term for small falcons like the merlin). It is not quite clear what name refers to the Réunion kestrel. From reviewing the evidence, the bird was most probably the émerillon, with the pieds jaunes being either migrant falcons (the only species that might occur in the area, the sooty falcon, Eleonora's falcon and the peregrine falcon, are larger than F. duboisi was, if not in overall length, then at least in wingspan) or the juveniles of the marsh harrier, which are distinctly colored and also have yellow feet. The latter explanation seems more likely as the name was unequivocally applied to <b>young</b> <b>marsh</b> harriers in the late 19th century. Nonetheless, it seems remotely possible that the Réunion falcon's sexes were not only of different size, but also differently colored. In this case, the males would be the émerillons and the females the pieds jaunes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{sequestration}} {{and recycling}} of biogenic silica (BSi) in freshwater tidal marshes was modelled through {{the combination of}} short-term year round sediment trap data with a long-term sedimentation model, MARSED. The modelling was implemented through the com-plete evolution from a young rapidly rising marsh to a marsh with an elevation close to mean high water. BSi in imported suspended matter was higher in summer (10. 9 mg BSi g– 1 sediment) than winter (7. 6 mg BSi g– 1 sediment). However, the deposition of BSi on the marsh surface was higher in winter compared to summer, due to the higher sedimentation rates. Deposition of BSi was correlated to the suspended matter deposition. In the old marsh, yearly about 40 g BSi m– 2 was deposited, while in the <b>young</b> <b>marsh</b> deposition could rise up to 300 g m– 2. Young marshes re-tained up to 85 % of the imported biogenic silica. Recycling efficiency (60 %) increased drastically for older marshes. The study shows that marshes act as important sinks for BSi along estuaries. The recycling of the imported BSi to DSi in summer and spring is most likely an essential factor in the buffering role of tidal marshes for estuarine DSi concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Two {{facets of}} the {{putative}} power of herbivores to manipulate their food supply according to the ideas of McNaughton are reviewed with special reference to a young salt marsh in the Dutch Wadden Sea. A general feature of vegetations described as 'grazing lawns' {{seems to be that}} return visits by the herbivore enhance the quality of food on offer. In the salt marsh we studied, intensive and repeated grazing by staging geese in spring protracted the period of high nutritive status of the food plants, effectively extending the exploitation window for the herbivores by 7 weeks. Detailed quantification of the visit interval in relation to regrowth of previously grazed ramets indicate that the geese time their grazing cycle in order to maximize the intake of nutritious regrowth. However, the observed visit interval tends to fall on the early side of the model outcome for intake maximization, suggesting that the competitive interaction between flocks on the marsh needs further attention. In the longer term, vertebrate herbivory on the marsh extends the period of persistence of the younger successional stages of the vegetation supporting the heaviest level of exploitation. In our island study, the year-round presence of the brown hare, Lepus europaeus, retarded establishment of the dwarf shrub Atriplex on the <b>young</b> <b>marsh,</b> and thus facilitated access by the geese to the palatable species otherwise screened by the bushy Atriplex. Exclosures placed on the marsh at sites of different age up to 40 years, combined with experimental removal or addition of Atriplex plants, allow the conclusion that hares facilitate grazing by geese and extend the goose exploitation period by 25 years. Why the herbivores fail to arrest the onward march of plant succession on the marsh is unresolved but may be caused by ongoing changes in the nutrient status of the soil. The grazing lawns are thus not permanent in our system, but the general features of the plant-herbivore interaction agree with the framework hypothesized by McNaughton...|$|E
40|$|The upper {{intertidal}} zone, {{and salt}} marshes in particular, {{have been shown}} by numerous authors to be effective medium to long-term storage areas {{for a range of}} contaminants discharged or transported into the estuarine environment. A detailed understanding of the specific controls on the trapping and storage of contaminants, however, is absent for many estuarine systems. This paper examines heavy metal distribution and accumulation in two contrasting Spartina sp. -dominated macrotidal salt marsh systems – a rapidly prograding, relatively <b>young</b> <b>marsh</b> system at the Vasiere Nord, near the mouth of the Seine estuary, France, and a more mature, less extensive marsh system in the Medway estuary, UK. The spatial distribution of the heavy metals Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Co is assessed and compared in both systems via detailed surface sampling and analysis, while the longer-term accumulation of these metals and its temporal variability is compared via analysis of dated sediment cores. Of the two sites studied, the more extensive marsh system at the Vasiere Nord in the Seine estuary shows a clear differentiation of heavy metals across the marsh and fronting mudflat, with highest metal concentrations found in surface sediments from the more elevated, interior marsh areas. At Horrid Hill in the Medway estuary, the spatial distribution of heavy metals in surface sediments is more irregular, and there is no clear relationship between heavy metal concentration and site elevation, with average concentrations similar in the marsh and fronting mudflats. Sediment core data indicate that the more recent near-surface sediments at Horrid Hill are clearly more contaminated than those at greater depth, with most heavy metal contamination confined to the upper 20 cm of the sediment column (with peak metal input in the late 1960 s/early 1970 s). In contrast, due to extremely rapid sediment accretion {{at the mouth of the}} Seine, heavy metal distribution with depth at the Vasiere Nord site is relatively erratic, with metal concentrations showing a general increase with depth. These sediments provide little information on temporal trends in heavy metal loading to the Seine estuary. Overall, heavy metal concentrations at both sites are within typical ranges reported for other industrialised estuaries in NW Europe...|$|E

40|$|Grazers {{can have}} a large impact on {{ecosystem}} processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated total accumulated organic carbon in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In <b>young</b> <b>marshes,</b> where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on total accumulated organic carbon. In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for organic carbon decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process {{should be taken into}} account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition...|$|R

These marshes may not function similarly to their natural counterparts in supporting infaunal populations used as food by estuarine animals. Newly created marshes often have relatively low levels of organic matter in the sediments and low infaunal abundance. However, organic matter and infaunal populations in created marshes may develop over time. To examine the relationships between infaunal abundance and sediment parameters, two created marshes (ages 5 and 9 years) were compared with a newly created marsh in the same location. over a two-year period, core samples were taken quarterly to measure infaunal density, live root and detritus biomass, and sediment organic content and grain size, at different elevations in each of the marshes. Samples were collected at and between culms of Spartina alterniflora. The vertical distribution of the infauna was also examined. overall infaunal densities and species richness in the <b>youngest</b> <b>marsh</b> were comparable to those in the other marshes within the first year. However, the newest marsh was dominated by the subsurface deposit feeding polychaete, Capitella capitata, while the two older marshes were dominated by the surface deposit feeding polychaete, Streblospio benedicti. In general, low elevation was correlated with high infaunal abundances, more animals were collected in cores at culms of Spartina alterniflora, and most of the infauna were found in the upper 2. 5 cm of sediment. There was evidence of accumulation of organic matter over the two-year study period, and organic matter levels were lowest in the newest marsh. There was no general relationship between concentrations of sediment organic matter and detritus and infaunal abundance. However, there was a positive relationship between infaunal abundance and the amount of live roots and rhizomes present, and this relationship appeared strongest during spring and summer.
