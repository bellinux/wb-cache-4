500|$|Fey {{is known}} for her deadpan humor and delivery; her [...] "sardonic wit" [...] has become a {{trademark}} of hers, upon which several critics have commented in their reviews of Fey's work. According to Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara, Fey [...] "project both oblivious security and hyper-alert insecurity with the same expression" [...] in her performances, while The Chronicles Dillon Fernando wrote that the actress specializes in [...] "delectable, situational and ironic comedy". On Fey's comedic prowess, Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels enthused that his former employee [...] "has a very clear take on things ... It always comes from a place of intelligence and there is just an edge to it." [...] Michaels concluded, [...] "It's not fearful. It's strong and confident and you recognise the voice {{and most of the}} time <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Christopher Goodwin believes that Fey [...] "fashioned her comic persona around her glasses", which she has worn since 1995; Fey joked that [...] "Glasses make anyone look smarter".|$|E
500|$|Fiasco {{is noted}} for his anti-establishment views. In an {{interview}} with Stephen Colbert on the satirical news show The Colbert Report, Fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: [...] "You should criticize power even if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> it." [...] In another interview in June 2011 on the CBS program What's Trending, Fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, [...] "My fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is Obama and the United States of America. I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism. You know, {{the root cause of}} terrorism is the stuff the U.S. government allows to happen. The foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists." [...] He additionally criticized Obama for his stance on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. [...] In keeping with his anti-establishment views, Fiasco does not vote in U.S. elections. On January 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of [...] "Words I Never Said", which contains anti-Obama lyrics, in Washington D.C., during Obama's second presidential inauguration. In June 2015, Lupe Fiasco wrote an open letter about white supremacy.|$|E

2500|$|According to Jesús Delgado, his biographer and Postulator of the Cause for his canonization, Romero {{agreed with}} the Catholic vision of Liberation Theology and not with the materialist vision: [...] "A {{journalist}} once asked him: ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Liberation Theology’ And Romero answered: [...] "Yes, of course. However, there are two theologies of liberation. One is that which sees liberation only as material liberation. The other is that of Paul VI. I am with Paul VI." [...] Delgado said that Romero did not read the books on Liberation Theology which he received, and he gave the lowest priority to Liberation Theology among the topics that he studied.|$|E
2500|$|As of September, Governor Palin had {{submitted}} to two media interviews, the first with ABC's Charles Gibson, {{and the second}} with Fox News's Sean Hannity. Gibson asked Palin, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Bush doctrine?," [...] to which Palin responded, [...] "In what respect, Charlie?" [...] After asking Palin for her definition, Gibson defined the concept {{to be for the}} United States to [...] "have the right of anticipatory self-defense." [...] Gibson also asked Palin about a prayer she had offered with regard to soldiers in Iraq. Commentators' reactions varied. Those generally critical of Palin's candidacy applauded Gibson's penetrating questions and thought aspects of Palin's responses showed that she was not ready to serve as Vice President, whereas those generally supportive of her candidacy took a more positive view of her performance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} bans in Boston and Chicago drew {{criticism from}} some liberal pundits, legal experts, and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine said [...] "here's really {{no excuse for}} Emanuel's and Menino's actions... you don't hand out business licenses based on whether <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the political views of the executives. Not in America, anyway ... what makes this whole situation so weird is that Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy has always opposed gay marriage. He's a devout Southern Baptist, just like his father, who founded the company. The place is closed on Sundays, for crying out loud. There's just nothing new here." [...] UCLA law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh observed, [...] "enying a private business permits because of such speech by its owner is a blatant First Amendment violation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis Maltby, {{founder of}} the National Work Rights Institute, is highly {{critical}} of the decision. He castigated the public-concern requirement as [...] " [...] the Court just made up" [...] in his book Can They Do That?. [...] "Justice White seems to have missed the Catch-22 quality of his rule", he wrote. [...] "You don't need to question management when <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> them, and you can't question management when you disagree with them because the very act of questioning them could hurt your working relationship." [...] With exceptions like McPherson, he believes this rule has cost too many public employees their jobs. [...] "The sad reality is that freedom of speech is a myth where your employment is concerned, whether you work in the private or the public sector." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} August 2006, Central America Report stated that [...] "liberal sectors" [...] were proposing to reform [...] "obsolete articles" [...] in the constitution, {{including}} one against presidential re-election. The Report {{said that this}} was causing controversy. [...] Debate regarding the convening of a constituent assembly took place in Honduras, with support from many groups. [...] "The constitution has since 1980 been tweaked in other areas around thirty times, to the point where politicians of all camps are convinced that the document in no longer adequate. This is where the formal change proposed by Manuel Zelaya comes in: that in the November 2009 election-round, the voters will be presented with four ballot-boxes – the fourth one being used for a referendum on the question: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> convening a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelley responded, {{in a paper}} titled [...] "A Question of Sanction", by disputing Schwartz's {{interpretation}} of the sanction principle in particular and his {{interpretation of}} moral principles in general. Subsequently, in an essay appearing in The Intellectual Activist, Peikoff endorsed Schwartz's view and claimed that Kelley's arguments contradicted the fundamental principles of Objectivism. Peikoff maintained that many non-Objectivist systems of thought, such as Marxism, are based on [...] "inherently dishonest ideas" [...] whose advocacy must never be sanctioned. He attributed the fall of NBI and subsequent schisms not to [...] "differences in regard to love affairs or political strategy or proselytizing techniques or anybody's personality," [...] but to a [...] "fundamental and philosophical" [...] cause: [...] "if you grasp and accept the concept of 'objectivity,' in all its implications, then you accept Objectivism, you live by it and you revere Ayn Rand for defining it. If you fail fully to grasp and accept the concept, whether your failure is deliberate or otherwise, you eventually drift away from Ayn Rand's orbit, or rewrite her viewpoint or turn openly into her enemy." [...] Those who criticized his position were to make their exit: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Branden or Kelley viewpoint or anything resembling it—please drop out of our movement: drop Ayn Rand, leave Objectivism alone. We do not want you and Ayn Rand would not have wanted you [...] " ...|$|E
