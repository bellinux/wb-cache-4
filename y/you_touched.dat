2500|$|Judging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two {{men were}} very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an {{impeccable}} literary taste. In An Uncommon Story he wrote: [...] "Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, Oblomov will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom.

6000|$|As I {{came into}} the coffee-room at the 'No Surrender,' old Jawkins was holding out to a knot of men, who were yawning, as usual. There he stood, waving the STANDARD, and swaggering before the fire. 'What,' says he, 'did I tell Peel last year? If <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the Corn Laws, <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the Sugar Question; if <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the Sugar, <b>you</b> <b>touch</b> the Tea. I am no monopolist.
