I am not unscrupulous {{enough to be a}} match for you in the use of intelligence; but I assure you, Mr. Heyst, that in the other way you are no match for me.

6000|$|There, now {{you know}} all about it: now you can go home and paint just such another. If you do, do pray {{remember}} to paint {{the hands of the}} figures as they are here depicted; they are as wonderful portraits as the faces.

Why is that knuckle of pork not painted out? at any rate, why is not a little fringe of lace painted round it? or a cut pink paper? or couldn't a smelling-bottle be painted in instead, with a crest and a gold top, or a cambric pocket-handkerchief, in lieu of the horrid pig, with a pink coronet in the corner? or suppose <b>you</b> <b>covered</b> the man's hand (which is very coarse and strong), and gave him the decency of a kid glove? But a piece of pork in a naked hand? O nerves and eau de Cologne, hide it, hide it! ...|$|E
