500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave <b>your</b> <b>big</b> cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E
2500|$|Led by Perry's late-season scoring surge, the Ducks {{finished}} with 99 points, {{good for the}} fourth seed in the West, setting up a series with the Nashville Predators in the 2011 Western Conference Quarterfinals. After being held to zero points in Game 1, Perry scored the Ducks' first goal on a power play in Game 2 against Pekka Rinne, later assisting on Ryan Getzlaf's goal that gave the Ducks a 3–1 lead. Near {{the end of the}} game, Perry then assisted on Bobby Ryan's empty-netter as the Ducks won 5–3. In Game 3, Perry recorded another two assists, but the Ducks fell 4–3. In Game 4, he set up Cam Fowler's power play goal early in the first period, and early in the third, Perry scored a short-handed goal to give Anaheim the lead in an eventual 6–3 victory. [...] "He's always scored big goals for us at big times, and <b>your</b> <b>big</b> guys got to be <b>your</b> <b>big</b> guys in big games," [...] Ryan Getzlaf said. [...] "There’s no doubt about it. He’s been doing it … all year, and we expect nothing less come playoff time." [...] However, Perry recorded no points in the last two games, both of which the Ducks lost, eliminating them from the playoffs. Perry finished the series with two goals and six assists.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{his biggest}} hits was [...] "Caldonia", with its {{energetic}} screaming punchline, banged out by the whole band, [...] "Caldonia! Caldonia! What makes <b>your</b> <b>big</b> head so hard?" [...] After Jordan's success with it, the song was also recorded by Woody Herman in a famous modern arrangement, including a unison chorus by five trumpets. Muddy Waters also recorded a version. However, many of Jordan's biggest R hits were inimitable, and no hit cover versions of them were recorded, a rarity {{in an era when}} black pop music was often rerecorded by white artists, and many popular songs were released in multiple competing versions.|$|E

2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And I remember when I finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you <b>your</b> <b>big</b> break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
