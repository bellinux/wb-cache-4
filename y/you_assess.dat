5000|$|Taleb said [...] "I don't {{particularly}} {{care about}} the usual. If {{you want to get}} an idea of a friend's temperament, ethics, and personal elegance, you need to look at him under the tests of severe circumstances, not under the regular rosy glow of daily life. Can <b>you</b> <b>assess</b> the danger a criminal poses by examining only what he does on an ordinary day? Can we understand health without considering wild diseases and epidemics? Indeed the normal is often irrelevant. Almost everything in social life is produced by rare but consequential shocks and jumps; all the while almost everything studied about social life focuses on the 'normal,' particularly with 'bell curve' methods of inference that tell you close to nothing. Why? Because the bell curve ignores large deviations, cannot handle them, yet makes us confident that we have tamed uncertainty. Its nickname in this book is GIF, Great Intellectual Fraud." ...|$|E
5000|$|In February 2007, {{the website}} of the French {{organization}} Observatoire International des Crises was {{banned in the}} PRC after it posted {{an article on the}} risks of trading with China. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>assess</b> an investment opportunity if no reliable information about social tension, corruption or local trade unions is available? This case of censorship, affecting a very specialised site with solely French-language content, shows the Chinese government attaches as much importance to the censorship of economic data as political content," [...] the organization was quoted as saying. In 2016, after a series of policy mishaps in the backdrop of severe economic downturn in the country, regulators, censors and government officials have increased censorship.

5000|$|... "I {{really liked}} the title {{because it was}} two-edged. It had a duality to it. “Workin’ on our night moves”—our moves with girls—and “Ain’t it funny how the night moves”—what you {{remember}} as you’re getting older." [...] —Seger in 2015 reflecting on the song [...] "Night Moves" [...] is a mid-tempo number that starts quietly with acoustic guitar. Bass guitar and drums are introduced as the song's setting is described: 1962, cornfields, '60 Chevy. While Seger actually owned a 1962 Chevy, he felt [...] "'60s" [...] flowed better in the song. Seger uses the word [...] "points" [...] in verse one to reference his pointed boots and his love interests' breasts. An intense summertime teenage affair is described, knowingly more sexual than romantic, with short instrumental lines breaking the evocative imagery, sometimes in mid-sentence. Piano, female backing vocals, electric guitar and organ are added as the song's emotional nostalgia builds momentum. Then suddenly it stops, as the narrative flashes forward to some period in the future, where he hums a song from 1962. Seger has claimed in interviews that he was referencing the song [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by the Ronettes, though that song was actually released one year later. To a quiet acoustic guitar, the narrator, awakened by a clap of thunder and unable to fall back asleep, ponders a different sense of the title phrase. Seger said this passage was inspired by late-night self-analysis and [...] "the uncertainty night represents": [...] "I {{was thinking about the}} whole aura of nighttime, the four o'clock in the morning moment when <b>you</b> <b>assess</b> yourself, check your weaknesses." [...] Then the rest of the instruments fall back in, for an extended coda vamp of the chorus.|$|E

40|$|The I-Tracker Cape York Rapid Wetland Assessment was {{designed}} to assist Indigenous land and sea managers to monitor the ecological condition of freshwater habitats on their country by undertaking regular wetland assessments. The rapid assessment method is based largely on an existing method, the Cape York Freshwater Wetland Assessment developed by the Cape York Marine Advisory Group Environmental Inc. (CYMAG) in 2009. The CYMAG method is an in-depth process that provides detailed data on wetland condition. The I-Tracker rapid assessment provides a method for groups to independently carry out a robust, scientific wetland assessment {{within a few hours}} using digital data collection tools and an accompanying scoring system modelled on the CYMAG method. This booklet will help you complete the Waterplants section of the I-Tracker Cape York Rapid Wetland Assessment. The assessment asks you to count the different types of waterplants (also known as macrophytes) at the wetland <b>you</b> are <b>assessing.</b> <b>You</b> don’t have to know all the names of all the species, just recognise the different plants. The waterplants are divided into four different groups, based on how they grow. These groupings also {{give you an idea of}} the habitat they are creating underwater...|$|R
