5|$|King Stephen {{refused to}} accept William's {{deposition}} and the appointment of Murdac, and prevented Murdac from taking up residence in York. Stephen probably wished to trade recognition of Murdac for support for his son Eustace. Stephen was trying to secure the coronation of Eustace as his successor during his own lifetime, to defeat the rival claims to the throne of Henry of Anjou. Within a few years, however, both Murdac and the pope had died, so William travelled to Rome to plead with the new pope, Anastasius IV, for restoration to office. The pope concurred, and William's reappointment was confirmed on 20 December 1153. On his return to York, while crossing the Ouse Bridge in York in triumphal procession, the bridge collapsed, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was killed.|$|E
5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was visible on board. The enemy thought that they were made of paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} most agunah cases {{were due to}} a husband dying without leaving clear {{evidence}} of his demise, or becoming mentally ill (insane). Nowadays many agunah cases arise {{as a result of}} a husband withholding a get, perhaps seeking a more favorable divorce settlement, or out of vindictiveness. In response agunah groups have organized to support these women and try to find a solution to this problem. Various remedies have been proposed, but as <b>yet,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> solution has common acceptance. Nevertheless, the Prenuptial Agreement for the Prevention of Get-Refusal is one remedy which is in use in Modern Orthodox Jewish communities worldwide and is accepted by moderate halakhic authorities.|$|E

25|$|A. L. Goodhart, Professor at Oxford, {{opposed the}} view that, because the judges were {{appointed}} by the victors, the Tribunal was not impartial {{and could not be}} regarded as a court in the true sense. He wrote: Attractive as this argument may sound in theory, it ignores the fact that it runs counter to the administration of law in every country. If it were true then no spy could be given a legal trial, because his case is always heard by judges representing the enemy country. <b>Yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> has ever argued that in such cases it was necessary to call on neutral judges. The prisoner has the right to demand that his judges shall be fair, but not that they shall be neutral. As Lord Writ has pointed out, the same principle is applicable to ordinary criminal law because 'a burglar cannot complain that he is being tried by a jury of honest citizens'.|$|E
25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their best not to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E
500|$|Early in his incarceration, Berkman {{questioned}} whether two men could love one another. He was aware, as he later wrote, that incidents of rape or attempted rape took place [...] "almost every week, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> {{has ever been}} taken to court ... on such charges". Some of Berkman's own friendships within the prison became physical. He became intimate with one prisoner, [...] "Johnny", when the two were confined to the dungeon. He discussed homosexuality with another prisoner, [...] "George", a formerly married physician who told Berkman about his own homosexual prison affair.|$|E

500|$|Writing about Cher's musical output {{during the}} 1960s, Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times stated that [...] "Rock was {{subsequently}} {{blessed with the}} staggering blues exclamations of Janis Joplin in the late '60s and the raw poetic force of Patti Smith in the mid-'70s. <b>Yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> matched the pure, seductive wallop of Cher". By contrast, her vocal performances during the 1970s were described by Eder as [...] "dramatic, highly intense... almost as much 'acted' as sung". First heard in the 1980 record Black Rose, Cher employed sharper, more aggressive vocals in her hard rock-oriented albums, establishing her sexually confident image. For the 1995 album It's a Man's World, she restrained her vocals, singing in higher registers and without vibrato.|$|E
500|$|Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs {{superior}} to Donald Bradman, often {{regarded as the}} greatest batsman {{in the history of}} cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: [...] "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores." [...] Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in Wisden in 2000 stated: [...] "He was never as dominant as Bradman; he never wanted to be. But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1981 Daniel Dennett had {{formulated}} another {{argument against}} the LOT. Dennett suggested that it would seem, {{on the basis of}} the evidence of our behavior toward computers but also with regard to some of our own unconscious behavior, that explicit representation is not necessary for the explanation of propositional attitudes. During a game of chess with a computer program, we often attribute such attitudes to the computer, saying such things as [...] "It thinks that the queen should be moved to the left." [...] We attribute propositional attitudes to the computer and this helps us to explain and predict its behavior in various contexts. <b>Yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would suggest that the computer is actually thinking or believing somewhere inside its circuits the equivalent of the propositional attitude [...] "I believe I can kick this guy's butt" [...] in Mentalese. The same is obviously true, suggests Dennett, of many of our everyday automatic behaviors such as [...] "desiring to breathe clear air" [...] in a stuffy environment.|$|E

500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} buzz of {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As <b>yet,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> at the convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel {{in his study of}} the 1896 Democratic convention, [...] "Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver {{at the heart of the}} platform." [...] Bensel noted, [...] "The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode." [...] Bryan would say little that he had not said before—the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete, Nebraska—but he would give the convention its voice.|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post disliked Stevens' wig, writing: [...] "Izzie's wig looked horrible. She {{looked exactly}} like her mother Robbie and that's not a compliment. I loved Cristina's Stepford wife joke and how everyone, {{including}} Derek, couldn't help but stare at her hair. <b>Yet,</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> had the balls to tell her it was bad." [...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't {{know what she was}} doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people that they were being cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1939, Prokofiev {{composed}} his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, {{widely known}} today as the [...] "War Sonatas." [...] Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, [...] "having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created" [...] (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, [...] "expressed his true feelings". As evidence, Jaffé {{has pointed out that}} the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, [...] "I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song." [...] Ironically (it appears no one noticed his allusion), Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class), and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).|$|E

500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and <b>yet</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> seems to care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be {{at a point where}} we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. He wondered how superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Lilly's performance, {{saying that}} it was almost worthy of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.
