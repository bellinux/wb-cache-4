500|$|As of 2014, Henderson ranks fourth all-time {{in career}} games played (3,081), tenth in at bats (10,961), twenty-second in hits (3,055), and first in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406). His {{record for most}} career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second. He also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81; Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees is tied for the second-most ever with Craig Biggio, with 53. During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in {{secondary}} bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At {{the time of his}} last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, [...] "Without exaggerating one inch, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, in {{an attempt}} to {{maintain}} secrecy over the impending release of the fifth Harry Potter book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against [...] "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants". The ruling obtained, {{for the first time in}} British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, [...] "The new Harry Potter style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'". The [...] "Potter injunction" [...] was later used against a camp of Roma travellers. In 2006, pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.|$|E

500|$|U2 {{returned}} to Dublin for Christmas, where they discussed their future together and all recommitted to the group. Listening to the tapes, they agreed their material sounded {{better than they}} originally thought. They briefly {{returned to}} Berlin in January 1991 to finish their work at Hansa. Reflecting on their time in Berlin, Clayton called the sessions a [...] "baptism of fire" [...] and said, [...] "It was something {{we had to go}} through to realize {{what we were trying to}} get to was not something <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> physically, outside of ourselves, in some other city—that there was not magic to it and that we actually had to put the work in and figure out the ideas and hone those ideas down." [...] Although just two songs were delivered during their two months in Berlin, the Edge said that in retrospect, working there had been more productive and inspirational than the output had suggested. The band had been removed from a familiar environment, providing what they described as a certain [...] "texture and cinematic location", and many of their incomplete ideas would be revisited in the subsequent Dublin sessions with success.|$|E
500|$|Close to the Edge, the group's second album, was {{released}} in 1992. Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, the album produced the Top 5 country hits [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby", the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album Beyond the Blue Neon. The next singles, [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", both failed to reach top 10. Roe considered Close to the Edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it; in a 1994 interview with New Country magazine, he stated: [...] "There aren't ten great songs out there for everybody, certainly not that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> in a 30-day period of time." [...] Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet", which he co-wrote, {{saying that it was}} [...] "by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that's at the time when I'm thinkin', 'Oh, this is easy, let's write this. It's kinda cute." [...] Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song, but described the rest of the album with favor, saying that its [...] "strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God, family and honest living – traditional stuff, no doubt influenced by the members' bluegrass background", while Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune thought that [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", [...] "which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood", were the strongest tracks.|$|E

2500|$|Wallace {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian. In college, however, he became {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with organized religion after reading William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Around 1919 he stopped attending the Presbyterian church {{and spent the}} next ten years exploring other religious faiths and traditions, including spiritualism and esoteric religion. He later said, [...] "I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church I was probably a practical mystic ... I'd say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and therefore, if you went to God, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the answers." [...] Wallace joined the Theosophical Society on June 6, 1925, and that same year helped organize a Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church, a denomination with ties to theosophy, but which had no ties to the Roman Catholic Church. He resigned from the Theosophical Society on or before November 23, 1935, and in 1939 formally joined the Episcopal Church.|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo {{followed}} White Noise with Libra (1988), a speculative fictionalized take on {{the life}} of Lee Harvey Oswald up to the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. For this novel DeLillo undertook a vast research project, which included [...] reading {{at least half of the}} Warren Commission report (subsequently DeLillo described it as [...] "the Oxford English Dictionary of the assassination and also the Joycean novel. This is the one document that captures the full richness and madness and meaning of the event, despite the fact that it omits about a ton and a half of material.") Originally written with the working title of either [...] "American Blood" [...] or [...] "Texas School Book", Libra became an international bestseller, one of five finalists for the National Book Award, and winner of the next year's Irish Times Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize. The novel also elicited fierce critical division, with some critics praising DeLillo's {{take on the}} Kennedy assassination while others decried it. George Will, in a Washington Post article, declared the book to be an affront to America and [...] "an act of literary vandalism and bad citizenship". DeLillo has frequently reflected on the significance of the Kennedy assassination to not only his own work but American culture and history as a whole, remarking in one 2005 interview [...] "November 22nd 1963 marked the real beginning of the 1960s. It was the beginning of a series of catastrophes: political assassinations, the war in Vietnam, the denial of Civil Rights and the revolts that occasioned, youth revolt in American cities, right up to Watergate. When I was starting out as a writer it seemed to me that a large part of the material <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> in my novels – this sense of fatality, of widespread suspicion, of mistrust – came from the assassination of JFK." ...|$|E
2500|$|In mid June 1885, the Western League disbanded, and a mad rush {{developed}} {{to sign the}} players on the Indianapolis roster, a line-up that included McGuire, Sam Thompson, Sam Crane, Chub Collins, Jim Donnelly, Mox McQuery, Gene Moriarty, and Dan Casey. [...] Sam Thompson later told the colorful story of the Detroit Wolverines' acquisition of the Indianapolis players. [...] Detroit sent two representatives (Marsh and Maloney) to Indianapolis, principally to sign the Hoosiers' battery of Larry McKeon and Jim Keenan. [...] The Wolverines were outbid by the Cincinnati Reds for McKeon and Keenan but wound up with the Hoosiers' manager (Bill Watkins) {{and the rest of the}} team's starting lineup. [...] The only catch was that a 10-day waiting period would allow other teams to outbid Detroit. Marsh and Maloney promptly sent the players to Detroit and quartered them in a hotel there. [...] The next morning, the players were told that the team had arranged a fishing trip for them. [...] The players boarded the steamship Annette and enjoyed the first day and night of successful fishing. After three days, the players became suspicious, but the ship captain laughed when asked when they would return to Detroit. [...] As the players became mutinous on the sixth day, the captain admitted he had been ordered to keep them [...] "out at sea" [...] for 10 days. [...] In another account, Thompson described his 10 days aboard the Annette as follows: [...] "We were prisoners, but well cared-for prisoners. Anything in the line of creature comforts <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> packed away on ice. [...] We lived on the best in the market, and spent the rest of the time in fishing and playing poker, chips having very thoughtfully been provided. On the night of the tenth day, at midnight, we were all taken ashore where Watkins met us and signed us to our contracts." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, Crabapple {{was living}} in a studio near Zuccotti Park. [...] Occupy Wall Street protesters had begun to use the Park as a camp to stage their movement, artists began {{creating}} posters and Crabapple decided to contribute work and engage in the movement. [...] "Before Occupy I felt like using my art for activist causes was exploitive of activist causes," [...] she told the Village Voice. [...] "I think what Occupy let me do was it allowed me to instead of just donating money to politics or just going to marches, it allowed me to engage my art in politics." [...] Artists and journalists who had {{come from all over the}} world to report on the protests were using Crabapple's apartment as an [...] "impromptu salon" [...] for the Occupy movement. In Discordia (2012), British journalist Laurie Penny remembered how [...] "Occupy Wall Street had set up camp two streets away from Crabapple's apartment in Manhattan and we'd just spent a sleepless week documenting arrests. [...] Molly perched at her desk churning out protest posters and handing them to activists to copy and wheat-paste all over the financial district...After three days, the word went out that there was an apartment near the protest camp where <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> hot drinks, basic medical attention and a place to charge your gadgets and file copy. The flat became a temporary sanctuary for stray activists and journalists" [...] "I started doing protest posters," [...] Crabapple recalled. [...] "And in doing these, I found my voice." [...] Author Matt Taibbi called Crabapple [...] "Occupy's greatest artist", [...] noting the use of the [...] "vampire squid" [...] theme in her Occupy artwork. [...] Crabapple, a fan of Taibbi's writing, had read his 2009 Rolling Stone article, [...] "The Great American Bubble Machine". [...] In the article, Taibbi referred to Goldman Sachs as [...] "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money." [...] When Crabapple used Taibbi's metaphor as a stencil depicting a vampire squid and released it for anyone to use, it went viral throughout the Occupy movement.|$|E
2500|$|Mulford was a {{prolific}} story teller {{in addition to}} his other talents. [...] He lectured on garden and natural history subjects to colleges, universities, schools and garden clubs throughout the United States as well as in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Canada. [...] He wrote quite a bit as well. His earliest writings {{came in the form of}} letters which were abundant even at an early age. Some were simple postcards, acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a road map to his outward activities. His letters were often either quite humorous or poetic prose although he also wrote poetry which he would use occasionally to adorn Christmas cards and the like. In the later years, after his move to Florida it was typical that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> them scribbled on his Tropical Arts letterhead paper. Beginning in the 1940s Mulford along with Racine began publishing their ever-expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications. These ranged from well-known venues such as The Smithsonian, The New York Times, and House Beautiful to trade journals such as the National Horticultural Magazine and Cactus and Succulent Journal to name just a few. A special article called [...] "Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor" [...] was published in the October 1950 National Geographic Magazine along with color photos. It was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to South America including Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook and Air Gardens of Brazil Mulford also became the founder and President of the Bromeliad Society in 1950 through 1959 and became its editor from 1951 through 1958 [...] and with his editorship of the Bulletin his audience became worldwide. He wrote numerous pieces for the Bromeliad Journal International which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today. He maintained this responsibility for over a decade with Racine acting a copy editor for years. Both were heavily committed to this publication at the beginning, often using their own monies to help publish the journal in the early years.|$|E
