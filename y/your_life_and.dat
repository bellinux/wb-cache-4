5|$|In {{the journal}} Critical Research on Religion, Courtney Ann Irby of Loyola University Chicago {{writes that the}} Ludys disparage secular American culture as overtly sexual and thus an {{obstacle}} to Christians. According to Irby, secular beliefs about dating are negatively presented in When God Writes Your Love Story and hookup culture is consistently discussed, although Irby indicates that, {{since the publication of}} the Ludys' book, some scholars have disputed the prevalence of casual sex in the United States. Irby suggests that the Ludys have no discernible qualifications to speak on the issues they discuss, but rather justify their message by emphasising their own personal experience as the reason for their authority. She writes that the Ludys recognize their lack of expertise and therefore emphasize trusting God as being more important than learning from the specific stories in the book. Irby suggests that the Ludys' book is, in these respects, similar to many other Evangelical books about premarital romantic relationships, such as Dannah Gresh's And the Bride Wore White, Elisabeth Elliot's Passion and Purity and Quest for Love, Don Raunikar's Choosing God's Best, Ben Young's and Sam Adams' The Ten Commandments of Dating, Henry Cloud's and John Townsend's Boundaries in Dating, Alex Chediak's 5 Paths to the Love of <b>Your</b> <b>Life,</b> <b>and</b> Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and Boy Meets Girl.|$|E

500|$|... "The Bells of Saint John" [...] was {{designed}} to be an [...] "urban thriller", in that it is taking [...] "something omnipresent in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> making it sinister". It was watched by 8.44million viewers in the UK. The episode received generally positive reviews, although several critics felt that the plot and threat were lacking.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] {{speaks of}} a love that never dies. According to Lopez, it is about when you are at a bad bad point in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> {{somebody}} comes in and makes you believe in love again. She cited her then-husband Marc Anthony as being that person for her. Monica Herrera of Billboard picked up on this, with the lyrics: [...] "I feel the beat again, stronger than before". Scott Shetler of PopCrush pointed out the song's optimistic viewpoint, with the lyrics: [...] "I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Love Like This" [...] {{is a song}} {{performed}} by British singer Natasha Bedingfield. It was included on Bedingfield's second North American album, Pocketful of Sunshine, and features vocals from reggae singer Sean Kingston. The song was written by Bedingfield, Kingston, Louis Biancaniello, Rico Love, Ryan Tedder, Sam Watters, and Wayne Wilkins, while production was handled by Biancaniello, Love, Tedder, and Watters under their production group, The Runawayz. Its lyrics discuss finding love with {{a person who has}} [...] "been there all <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> has always loved you, but you've never noticed it until now". The official remix features vocals from rapper Lil Wayne and a slightly different beat, produced by Jim Jonsin.|$|E

'Judas' is {{a metaphor}} and an analogy about {{forgiveness}} and betrayal and things that haunt you in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> how I believe that it's the darkness {{in your life that}} ultimately shines and illuminates the greater light that you have upon you. Someone once said to me, 'If you have no shadows then you're not standing in the light.' So the song is about washing the feet of both good and evil and understanding and forgiving the demons from your past in order to move into the greatness of your future. I just like really aggressive metaphors—harder, thicker, darker—and my fans do as well. So it is a very challenging and aggressive metaphor, but it {{is a metaphor}}.|$|E
500|$|After {{they began}} working on the song, Carey began to {{incorporate}} other lyrics into the chorus, {{trying to make the}} song relatable to the AIDS epidemic that was in full force in the mid-1990s. Additionally, Mariah's sister Alison Carey had been diagnosed with HIV in 1988 when she was 27, an event that ruined their relationship and tore them apart. Carey has stated that she wrote the song hoping that all her fans that have lost someone could relate to [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] and maybe help ease the pain of the loss. Carey described the song as [...] " [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> changes our perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{changed her}} {{direction}} of study {{when she became}} a municipal inspector for orphans in 1905. She maintained the position from 1905 to 1909. This endeavor attributes largely to part of her own goal to improve the social sphere. However, her home's [...] "Jewish atmosphere" [...] widely influenced her as she was taught to [...] "pay it forward." [...] Including and prior to this job, all of her endeavors were based on her own emotions and goals without Albert's influence. In one of his letters, he notes [...] "it is you who have won, happy {{to have found a}} task that will fill <b>your</b> <b>life,</b> <b>and</b> you’ve done it ahead of me", addressing her social work in Strasbourg's City Orphan Administration.|$|E

500|$|The series {{sought out}} {{a bowling alley}} for the opening scenes, but many were {{reluctant}} to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen. The series was allowed to film at the location {{under the condition that}} the bowling surfaces were preserved. Due to this, the production staff was forced to either wear bowling shoes or wear makeshift [...] "paper booties" [...] on their feet. In between camera set ups, Duchovny and director Charleston bowled several games. Duchovny later joked that after the episode, he [...] "realized how old" [...] he was because he felt sore from all the bowling. He joked, [...] "when you get sore from bowling, it's time to start thinking about <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> where it's going." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{described}} the premise as the traditional 'Doctor Who' thing of taking something omnipresent in <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> making it sinister, if something did {{get in the}} Wi-Fi, we'd be kind of screwed. Nobody had really done it before, so I thought, 'It's time to get kids frightened of Wi-Fi!' [...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather tell an adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Iconic" [...] {{talks about}} {{taking control of}} <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> letting your inner fire burn and {{encourages}} listeners to pursue their dreams. During the song, she urges the listeners to [...] "making [...] voices heard before someone does it for [...] " [...] with her voice [...] "echoing like the announcer in the ring." [...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again and if I did, I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E

500|$|Milian {{received}} writing {{credit for}} nine {{songs on the}} album. Milian {{did not try to}} write mainstream records for the radio; rather, she wrote about [...] "everything, about <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> concentrate on you doing you." [...] For previous albums, Milian wrote about things that had happened in the past, whereas for So Amazin, she focused on the present. She compared the writing process to writing a diary; whenever she would experience something that she thought would be important, she would write it down for future reference. Milian felt that by writing down true experiences, her songs were like [...] "captured emotion". When writing songs, Milian said that the amount of time it took to write varied. It would depend on what she was writing about, {{what was going on in}} her life, and if it pertained to that exact moment. Sometimes the process was quick, but other times it could take several hours to write an entire song.|$|E
500|$|... "Unreachable" [...] {{combines}} a piano line and vintage Chamberlin sounds with lyrics dealing with regrets about rushing into a relationship. Simpson has described [...] "Nothing New" [...] as being about her frustration with an ex-boyfriend's [...] "dramas", until she is ultimately [...] "finished with him", while [...] "Giving It All Away" [...] encourages the listener {{to stand on}} one's own feet: [...] "hold on to <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> don't give that away", Simpson said of the song. The album's closing track, [...] "Undiscovered" [...] (which Simpson has described as a favorite of hers), was written after her breakup with Josh, and is described by epinions.com as a song with [...] "haunting strings" [...] and [...] "mellow guitars"; in the song, Simpson ponders {{what might have been}} in a lost pairing. Non-U.S. pressings follow with [...] "Harder Everyday", and the United Kingdom edition adds [...] "Sorry", while the Japanese edition closes with [...] "Endless Summer". The U.S. Wal-Mart edition of the album also included an access code to download a reduced-quality version of [...] "Sorry" [...] on the internet.|$|E
500|$|...

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes <b>your</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
