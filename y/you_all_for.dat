500|$|On 24 September 2014, the band's website was updated {{to include}} a {{countdown}} timer accompanied by text reading [...] "News...". The timer ended on 13 October with the announcement of a ten-year anniversary show at the Forum in London. A statement from the band followed: [...] "It has been 10 years {{since the inception of}} this band and we wanted to celebrate it with a bang. We want to thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> your love and support {{over the past ten years}} and we can't wait to commemorate this milestone with you guys." [...] The concert sold out in minutes; due to demand a second concert was scheduled at O2 Academy Brixton for December, which was later postponed until February 2015. With news of the postponement came an announcement of additional dates in Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester. On 25 February, it was confirmed that the band would be third-stage headliners at the 2015 Download Festival.|$|E
500|$|On 15 October 2014, {{the former}} co-admin of the sister page Responsabilidad for Tamaulipas, María del Rosario Fuentes Rubio (also known by her Twitter account @Miut3 and Felina), was kidnapped, tortured, {{and killed by}} alleged {{organized}} crime members. She had a strong follower-base on Twitter and was known for posting about risk situations, shootouts, and information about criminal groups from Tamaulipas. Her captors allegedly posted several tweets on her profile, prompting shocking reactions on social media. The first tweet revealed her identity and profession as a doctor, and ended by saying that her [...] "life {{had come to an}} end". Two minutes later, another tweet asked others to not make the mistakes she did (of posting about organized crime). The third tweet warned Valor por Tamaulipas and two other Twitter users, @Bandolera7 and @civilarmado_mx, of posting about risk situations. The fourth and final tweet said the following: [...] "Close your accounts, don't risk your families the way I did, I ask <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> forgiveness," [...] and included two photos of her. One of them showed her alive, and the second one showed her corpse splattered in blood. Twitter later deactivated the account but the photos had already leaked across social media.|$|E

2500|$|On September 17, 2011, {{the band}} {{clarified}} that their forthcoming 11-track LP would be mixed by October 17, while another 12 songs would be finalized {{by the end}} of the year and see release as [...] "b-sides, extra tracks and maybe one might even come your way simply as a Christmas present from Garbage as a thank you to <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> sticking around," [...] though this did not materialize.|$|E

2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I believe if I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives. I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established. My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people.

[...] He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest.

2500|$|With the {{publication}} of his eighth novel White Noise in 1985, DeLillo began a rapid ascendancy to being a noted and respected novelist. White Noise was arguably a major breakthrough both commercially and artistically for DeLillo, earning him a National Book Award for Fiction and a place among the academic canon of contemporary postmodern novelists. DeLillo remained as detached as ever from his growing reputation: when called upon to give an acceptance speech for the Award, he simply said, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't be here tonight, but I thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> coming," [...] and then sat down. The influence and impact of White Noise {{can be seen in the}} writing of such authors as David Foster Wallace, Jonathan Lethem, Jonathan Franzen, Dave Eggers, Martin Amis, Zadie Smith and Richard Powers (who provides an introduction to the 25th anniversary edition of the novel). Among the 39 proposed titles for the novel were [...] "All Souls", [...] "Ultrasonic", [...] "The American Book of the Dead", [...] "Psychic Data" [...] and [...] "Mein Kampf"; however, DeLillo acknowledged in a 2005 interview that White Noise was a fine choice, remarking [...] "Once a title is affixed to a book, it becomes as indelible as a sentence or a paragraph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yoshinori Natsume's art was {{commended for}} {{featuring}} [...] "heavy inks, lots of crosshatching, and copious amounts of shading". Mania.com's Patricia Beard {{feels that the}} manga makes a [...] "compelling read" [...] by [...] "laying out its premise and conditions by the mid-point of the first volume". Manga Life's Michael Aronson comments that the manga simply rearranges the [...] "premise of every other pop manga series. We have an anachronistic protagonist (InuYasha) who’s rather impure at heart (Death Note) hunting spirits {{that no one else}} can see (Bleach)". Ed Sizemore from Comics Worth Reading criticises the series for ending its unfinished story with volume 8. As well as [...] "putting salt in the wound" [...] by advertising for [...] "Togari: The Perfect Edition" [...] in the last four pages, with the last sentence of the ad reading: [...] "Sorry, this was all a joke! Thank <b>you</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> reading." [...] Jason Thompson's online appendix to [...] compares Togari to InuYasha in their shared theme of [...] "a villain gradually [...] into a good guy" [...] commenting that [...] "Togari makes a stronger than usual effort to show Tobe’s gradual socialization process." [...] Thompson also comments on the art [...] "while not nearly as scary as the premise suggests, is clean and chiseled, similar to Ryōji Minagawa." [...] In a series of reviews on Manga News, the manga's graphics is commended for its [...] "pure style with panels that are not overdone", commendation on the level of precision through explanation, with discrete action and advancing the plot through the use of intrigue.|$|E
