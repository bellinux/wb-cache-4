Experiment 2 was conducted using a 2 × 2 factorial design to examine whether supplementation of an enzyme preparation (VegPro) either in a soybean meal-based diet (0 g/kg <b>yellow</b> <b>lupins)</b> or in a yellow lupin-based diet (150 g/kg) improved performance of piglets (6. 17 kg ± 0. 317).

40|$|RONO: 00 Narrow {{leaf and}} <b>yellow</b> <b>lupins</b> have {{significant}} potential {{with respect to}} ruminant, poultry and aquaculture supply chains in the UK. Their protein and oil content is such that they have considerable promise as part of livestock diets together with other advantages as arable break crops. However, the current area of these lupins grown in the UK is very small with major problems of low and very variable yields, late maturity and intolerance of alkaline soils. This in turn {{means that there is}} little supply of lupins into feed formulations. We have shown that improvements in these traits is possible, after only two generations of selection, although further germplasm improvement is required before these species can {{play a major role in}} UK agriculture. Similarly, the potential for lupins to replace soya in ruminant diets has been shown in short term studies. There is a need to extend these studies and to focus on the effects of using lupins in ruminant diets over longer time periods and the use of new technologies, such as crimping to allow for earlier harvesting dates, and the use of new technologies, - to enhance palatability and inclusion rates not only for ruminants but also poultry and fish.

40|$|Abstract: Salinity has {{adverse effects}} on plants {{and is one of}} the causes of {{environment}} degradation. Plants have developed many defensive mechanisms, protecting them from sodium chloride (NaCl), including accumulation of osmoprotective compounds, which maintain osmotic balance, protect cell structure and enzymes. In the current study, we investigated the effects of salinity resulting from a range of sodium chloride concentrations (from 0 to 400 mM) on the growth of common duckweed (Lemna minor L.) and <b>yellow</b> <b>lupin</b> (Lupinus luteus L.). Increasing concentration of sodium chloride decreased the area of common duckweed leaves. At the highest applied salt concentration, the decrease of leaf area was associated with leaf chlorosis. In <b>yellow</b> <b>lupin,</b> the increasing sodium chloride concentration inhibited root and stem elongation. The highest tested NaCl concentration of 400 mM completely stopped elongation of <b>yellow</b> <b>lupin</b> shoots. The content of cyclitols and soluble carbohydrates in plant tissues was evaluated as well. Cyclitols (D-chiro-inositol and D-pinitol), as well as soluble carbohydrates (glucose, fructose and sucrose) were detected in common duckweed tissues. <b>Yellow</b> <b>lupin</b> seedlings also contained cyclitols – D-pinitol, myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol – and soluble carbohydrates – glucose, galactose and sucrose. The content of osmoprotectants in plant tissues, especially sucrose and cyclitols, increased with increasing concentration of sodium chloride in the soil. The results indicate that the content of cyclitols and soluble carbohydrates in plant tissues can be an indicator of plant response to salinity stress...|$|E

Twice during the growing season and at harvest, the aboveground biomass, separated by lupin, partners and weeds, were recorded. The results of the first project year show that all the partner plants which should serve as artificial weeds were successfully established. False flax leads to the strongest effect on the development of lupins, which showed the lowest biomass production in these variants. In comparison to the sown partners, the false flax variants also showed the highest biomass production, while the lowest biomass production was recorded for the natural weeds occurring at the site.
