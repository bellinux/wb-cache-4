These colonnades lead down to near the Maqsurah (enclosure).|$|E

And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>on.</b>|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were more}} critical of the song's production and Fantasia's vocals. On the nationally syndicated Rickey Smiley Morning Show, Rickey Smiley criticized it as [...] "more of a filler record that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> while you're cleaning the house or washing dishes". He said that the singer lacked the vocal acrobatics of her performance of [...] "Superwoman" [...] (1989) at the 2015 Soul Train Music Awards. According to Mike Wass, [...] "No Time for It" [...] did not command attention {{on the first hearing}} and lacked the pop hooks of the album track [...] "Ugly". Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics criticized the song as safe and predictable, called its production dated, and felt that Fantasia was [...] "sleeping on her laurels". Apaza suggested that Fantasia or RCA release a remix with Kelly Rowland or another female R singer to [...] "prevent this single [...] fall quick into oblivion". In Entertainment Weekly, Chuck Arnold criticized [...] "No Time for It" [...] for [...] "gloss over the grit of Fantasia's voice" [...] and cited it {{as an example of the}} album's uneven sound.|$|E
2500|$|During bidding, a team may declare either Big Mo or Little Mo, {{meaning they}} intend {{to take the first}} several tricks. [...] This is the only time that {{cross-talk}} during the bidding is allowed. [...] A player considering a Mo may ask his teammate [...] "How many do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> the Mo?" [...] or some similar question to determine how many tricks the teammate can contribute to the Mo without revealing any details as to which tricks they'll take. [...] The only detail that can be discussed is which teammate will be leading the first trick but not how they will be leading. [...] If a team declares Little Mo, they must take the first 7 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Little Mo earns the team 150 points. [...] If a team declares Big Mo, they must take the first 10 tricks of the hand. [...] Accomplishing the Big Mo earns the team 250 points. [...] Taking more consecutive tricks than needed does not earn the team more points. [...] For instance, taking the first 10 tricks when a Little Mo had been declared still only earns the team 150 points. [...] The team that declares either Mo is immune to bags for that hand and will lead the first trick, regardless of whose turn it was to lead. [...] Failure to accomplish the declared Mo (the opposing team took a trick before the goal was met) will cause the team to lose the points they would have earned had they been successful. [...] This is true regardless of how many tricks they took before or after the opposing team took a trick. [...] The other team bids and must match their bid, as usual. [...] It's not unusual for a team that could do a Big Mo to declare a Little Mo to play it safe and then take the extra tricks to try to set their opponents.|$|E
