"I think 'Don't Bother' {{has a lot}} of pain in it as a song, {{but also}} a lot of humour and sarcasm. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a way of exorcising all of these feelings, a form of catharsis, getting rid of all of those {{emotions}} that torture us women at some point in our lives" ...|$|E

500|$|Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle {{wrote that}} he was [...] "only so-so" [...] about the episode, which he deemed [...] "uneven", but was still pleased that the series was back. Vanity Fair Brett Berk called the episode [...] "a bit haphazard", and commented: [...] "this kind of {{spiraling}} frenzy is not only unsustainable, but ultimately dizzying and, dare I say it, a little boring." [...] Randee Dawn of The Hollywood Reporter reported that [...] "Hell-O" [...] had a [...] "stagy quality", and was [...] "not an episode that would have sold the series early on". Dawn felt that {{there were too many}} musical performances, commenting: [...] "They might be fun performances, but they're not all necessary, and <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> possible to have too much music even on a successful narrative musical TV series." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Metcalfe, Mercedes did {{not want}} to have an affair and was not [...] "looking for someone else", stating, [...] "Malachy's been working hard to provide for them and he hasn’t {{had a lot of time}} for her". Turning to Calvin, she confided in him and they kiss. Whittle added that the affair had become more serious and their {{chemistry}} was [...] "more than just physical". Also according to Metcalfe, [...] "Every three months Mercedes has to have an HIV test and, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> making her resent Malachy a bit. She can’t help wondering what it would be like to be with someone like Calvin who isn't HIV positive", even though she felt [...] "guilty". When Mercedes learned that she has to be retested for HIV, she feared that the test would be positive. Initially, she did not tell Malachy about it, but eventually [...] "snaps" [...] at him, telling him she [...] "won't forgive him" [...] if she has contracted HIV. The test was negative which was a [...] "huge relief" [...] for them.|$|E
500|$|Mayor Richard M. Daley {{criticized the}} Park Grill deal, blaming Chicago's Corporation Counsel Mara Georges, saying that {{lawyers for the}} city and the Chicago Park District erred and that the city wanted to renegotiate the pact. [...] "Lawyers do make mistakes," [...] Daley said. [...] "That's what it was. ... It's {{embarrassing}} to them. <b>Yes</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> - the corporation counsel and the Park District counsel." [...] Chicago Park District Superintendent Tim Mitchell said the Park District also wanted to renegotiate the contract. In a February 9, 2005 letter to O'Malley and Horan, Georges warned that the concession agreement [...] "does not authorize your occupation of the Park Grill facilities" [...] because the city owns the land, and City Hall should have been party to the original agreement when it was not. On February 11, 2005, Daley asked state lawmakers to impose tougher penalties for defrauding tax payers, and was questioned by reporters about why the Park Grill had not paid any property taxes and gets free gas, water and garbage pick-up. Erma Tranter, president of the Friends of the Parks watchdog group, speaking at a Park District Board of Commissioners meeting, questioned why the Park Grill contract had yet to be renegotiated 11 months after Mayor Daley vowed to do so. The Chicago Sun-Times dubbed the Park Grill the [...] "Clout Cafe" [...] and included the contract award process in a year-end review of 2005 Daley administration scandals.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} first film, {{merchandising}} accompanied Gremlins 2. This may have been integral to the film's purpose. As one critic wrote, [...] "it's a savvy, off-the-wall comedy that acknowledges, <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> just one more silly rip-off sequel, produced to sell off the merchandise inspired by the first film." [...] One reference the film makes to the original, an allusion to the merchandising surrounding Gizmo, drew criticism. Some critics saw the mention of merchandise as tasteless. This type of product placement has since become more common.|$|E

[...] On March 2, 2009 Limbaugh said on his radio show that Steele is not fit to lead the Republican Party, asking of him [...] "Why do you claim to lead the Republican Party when you seem obsessed with seeing to it President Obama succeeds?" [...] After the show Steele called Limbaugh to apologize, saying [...] "I have {{enormous}} respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was {{maybe a little bit}} inarticulate. There was no attempt on my part to diminish his voice or his leadership. I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said weren't what I was thinking. It {{was one of those things}} where I thinking I was saying one thing, and it came out differently. What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not." [...] Steele later issued another statement to say that Limbaugh [...] "is a national conservative leader, and in no way do I want to diminish his voice. I truly apologize." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the fraud of the Holocaust.... Many French studies have proven that this {{is no more than}} a fabrication, a lie, and a fraud!! That is, it is a 'scenario' the plot of which was {{carefully}} tailored, using several faked photos completely unconnected to the truth. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a film, no more and no less. Hitler himself, whom they accuse of Nazism, is in my eyes no more than a modest 'pupil' in the world of murder and bloodshed.

Both Jim Prior and Keith Joseph know that George Ward and Grunwick are not perfect, nor was Czechoslovakia perfect in 1938. But if Ward and Grunwick are destroyed by the red fascists, then, as in 1938, we will have to ask, whose turn is it next? <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> like 1938.

2500|$|Fulbeck {{states that}} despite its {{utilization}} of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity {{rather than a}} project about race: [...] "It's about identity using race as a starting point." [...] He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: [...] "For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and cultural construct ... The U.S. is {{a country with a}} long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{departure}} from their previous four studio albums, Yes recorded Going for the One with new engineering personnel. Since 1970, they had worked with audio engineer and producer Eddy Offord, who also mixed the band's live sound in concert. After their Relayer tour, however, Offord thought the band's style had become [...] "a bit stale", and thought {{a break from the}} band to pursue other projects was needed. Offord was replaced by recording engineer John Timperley, who was assisted by David Richards. In a first for the band, the album was produced entirely by <b>Yes.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> also the first engineering job for Yes's future sound mixer Nigel Luby, who [...] "did little more than watch and acquaint myself with the equipment." [...] Squire recalled numerous heated arguments over the use of echo on the album, as some members liked it and others did not.|$|E
2500|$|MG Siegler of TechCrunch {{said that}} the {{difference}} between Lion and Mountain Lion was not comparable to the difference between Leopard and Snow Leopard because Mountain Lion adds many new features that were not available in Lion. He also praised the application compatibility and {{said that the}} only updates needed were to add Notification Center features to applications. Jim Dalrymple of The Loop commented [...] "there will be tens of thousands of words published on Wednesday when Mountain Lion hits the Mac App Store, but let's face it, what {{you really want to know}} is whether Mountain Lion is worth the upgrade. Let's get that out of the way now — <b>yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> definitely worth it," [...] and said that at $19.99, Mountain Lion was a [...] "bargain". David Pogue of The New York Times said [...] "Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you'll use every day? For $20? Yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2014, The Guardian {{published}} evidence implicating Jan van Risseghem, {{a military}} pilot who {{served with the}} RAF during World War II, later with the Belgian Air Force and became famous as the pilot of Moise Tshombe in Katanga. [...] The article claims that an American NSA employee, former naval pilot Commander Charles Southall, working at the NSA listening station in Cyprus in 1961 shortly after midnight {{on the night of}} the crash, heard an intercept of a pilot's commentary in the air over Ndola – 3,000 miles away. Southall recalled the pilot saying: [...] "I see a transport plane coming low. All the lights are on. I'm going down to make a run on it. <b>Yes,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the Transair DC-6. It's the plane," [...] adding that his voice was [...] "cool and professional". Then he heard the sound of gunfire and the pilot exclaiming: [...] "I've hit it. There are flames! It's going down. It's crashing!" [...] Based on aircraft registration and availability with the Katangese Air Force, registration KAT-93, a Fouga CM.170 Magister would be the most likely aircraft used and the website http://www.belgian-wings.be/ claims that van Risseghem piloted the Magisters for the KAF in 1961.|$|E
