5|$|About half {{of those}} {{who lost their lives}} on the Wall were killed in the first five <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} installed. Death rates fell from then on, and took a particularly dramatic downturn after 1976. Nearly 86% of the Wall's victims, 120 people, died between 1961 and 1975; between 1976 and 1989 only 19 died. Several factors account for this reduction. The Wall became even more impregnable owing to technical improvements carried out in the mid-1970s and more restrictions were put on the area adjoining the Wall, making it more difficult to reach in the first place. The signing of the Helsinki Accords in 1975 led to new opportunities to cross the border legally, resulting in a rise in emigration applications and a corresponding fall in escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, just sixteen <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> built, {{the church}} was {{destroyed}} by fire. This was not uncommon, however, as devastating fires frequently plagued the developing colony, and a new cathedral was quickly built on the same site. It featured iconic twin steeples at its facade. However, the Victoria Harbour waterfront district where {{the church was}} situated became more overcrowded with {{the rapid growth of}} Hong Kong at the time, and it became apparent that a permanent and larger cathedral was necessary. As a result, plans were made for a new church on a more elevated ground in Mid-Levels, located close to the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 the Armenian Academy of Sciences began major {{excavations}} of the Garni fortress site led by Babken Arakelyan. Architectural historian Alexander Sahinian {{focused on}} the temple itself. It was not until almost twenty years later, on December 10, 1968, that the Soviet Armenian government approved the reconstruction plan of the temple. A group led by Sahinian began reconstruction works in January 1969. It was completed by 1975, almost 300 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> destroyed in an earthquake. The temple was almost entirely rebuilt using its original stones, except the missing pieces which were filled with blank stones intended to be easily recognisable. In 1978 a monument dedicated to Sahinian was erected {{not far from the}} temple.|$|E
5|$|Mathias briefly {{served as}} {{assistant}} Attorney General of Maryland from 1953 to 1954. From 1954 to 1959, {{he worked as}} the City Attorney of Frederick, where he supported civil rights for African Americans. He {{played a role in}} desegregating the local Opera House movie theater, which restricted African American seating {{to the back of the}} theater. Mathias also worked to relocate the Frederick post office and helped protect a park in the city. In 1958, he was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates, serving from 1959 to 1960. As a delegate, he voted in favor of Maryland ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which secured African American rights following the American Civil War. With his support, the legislature ratified the amendment in 1959, nearly 100 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> first introduced.|$|E
5|$|The 61st Division {{retained}} its three infantry brigades, {{although there were}} changes to the divisional troops along the above lines. It was intended that the division {{would be able to}} be transferred by air to any theatre of war, and its personnel trained to fight in any terrain encountered. Once on the ground, the entire division would be mobile utilizing only jeeps. To help adapt to this new role, training exercises were carried out. The initial destination for the division was the Far East to support the fight against Imperial Japan. However, the Japanese surrender resulted in the move being cancelled, and the division never left the United Kingdom. In November, the division, over six <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> formed, was disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The Zephyrs power (leading) car was {{numbered}} 9900, the baggage-coach {{combine car}} 505, and the coach-observation 570. The train {{was placed in}} regular service between Kansas City, Missouri, Omaha and Lincoln, Nebraska, on November 11, 1934, replacing a pair of steam locomotives and six heavyweight passenger cars, weighing up to eight {{times as much as}} the Zephyr. By June 1935, it proved popular enough to add a fourth car, providing additional coach seating. The fourth car was originally a 40-seat coach number 525, but the following June it was switched to Twin Cities service, then back to the Pioneer Zephyr in December. Car 525 remained on the train until June 1938. Just over five <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> introduced, the Pioneer Zephyr crossed the one million mile mark in regular service on December 29, 1939, near Council Bluffs, Iowa.|$|E
5|$|US113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware {{state line}} in three {{sections}} starting in 1998. The first section was constructed {{on a new}} alignment from north of MD818 to south of MD589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD90 interchange 24 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US113 reconstruction, from south of MD589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special Recognition of a Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce {{the time needed to}} complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Night Trap {{was ready}} for the launch of the NEMO in 1989 {{alongside}} another interactive movie, Sewer Shark. Both games had a combined budget of about $4.5 million USD ($1.5 for Night Trap, and $3 million for Sewer Shark) making them two of the most expensive video games of the era. However, just before the launch of the NEMO in early 1989, which was now called the Control-Vision, Hasbro canceled the system release. The company cited high hardware costs as the reason. The system was originally intended to sell for $199, but the high manufacturing costs of the system's DRAM drove it to $299. In contrast, the market-leading Nintendo Entertainment System sold for around $100 in 1989. Riley also cited the high cost of filmmaking for giving Hasbro cold feet. Disappointed by the whole affair, Fulop went on to form PF Magic, which later created the Petz virtual pet simulation series. Zito purchased the rights to the abandoned Control-Vision games, and after learning that Sony was considering Sewer Shark for a release on their forthcoming Super NES CD-ROM, he founded his own company to bring them to the system, Digital Pictures. When the Super NES CD-ROM failed to materialize, Zito began working with Sega for a release on the Sega CD. Night Trap transitioned from VHS to CD-ROM and was released in 1992 for the Sega CD, five <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> originally filmed.|$|E
