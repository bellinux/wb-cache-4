5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom <b>you</b> <b>most</b> love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask <b>you</b> <b>most</b> urgently to let me know if Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E

500|$|Australian {{teammate}} Clarrie Grimmett, {{regarded as}} one of the greatest spinners of all time, regarded McCabe as technically superior to Bradman, feeling that the latter's success was largely due to his extreme concentration and determination. Fellow state and Australian batsman Bill Brown described McCabe as the [...] "finest strokeplayer I ever saw", further adding [...] "When Stan was in command, he was so magnificent to watch, and he left everyone, including Bradman, for dead. Certainly Bradman scored more runs, but Stan was the batsman <b>you</b> <b>most</b> wanted to be." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{development}} of the song, during a track-by-track reveal, Martin said: [...] "That's just about girls. It's weird that whatever else is on your mind, whether it's the downfall of global economics or terrible environmental troubles, the thing that always gets <b>you</b> <b>most</b> is when you fancy someone."

500|$|Throughout the album's development, Carey worked {{extensively}} with Walter Afanasieff, {{with whom}} she collaborated extensively on Emotions (1991) and Music Box (1993). Together, they wrote {{all three of the}} album's original songs, as well as producing most of the traditional tracks. [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", the album's debut single, was written by Carey and Afanasieff, which was sent to top-forty and adult contemporary stations, with the video having been filmed the year before. Another track they wrote, [...] "Miss <b>You</b> <b>Most</b> (At Christmas Time)", was sent to R stations, with [...] "Jesus Born on This Day", another original song, being sent to Christian and gospel radio stations around the world.|$|E
500|$|The album's lead track, [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", was {{described}} as an [...] "up-tempo love song, one that could have easily been written for Tommy Mottola." [...] Another one of the album's original tracks was, [...] "Miss <b>You</b> <b>Most</b> (At Christmas Time)", which {{was very different from}} its whimsical predecessor. The song {{was described}} as a [...] "sad ballad", in line with many of Carey's previous hit singles. The song featured a synthesized orchestra, including keyboard notes courtesy of Afanasieff, during which Carey would sing to her [...] "long-gone lover, crystallizing the way that Christmas brought memories of the past into focus." [...] According to Nickson, it was [...] "Jesus Born on This Day", that was the most impressive original track on the album. It {{was described as}} a [...] "full-blown production number", which again featured synthesized orchestra, as well as a live children's choir. The song's tune was described as [...] "solemn and hymn-like, but the arrangement, oddly, made it less religious and rather more glitzy, behind the lyrics that overtly praised Jesus." ...|$|E
500|$|November {{began with}} a home match against Manchester United. Going into the match, both clubs were level on points and goal difference, {{at the top of}} the league. In the 45th minute, Gallas {{inadvertently}} scored an own goal to give United the lead, before Fábregas equalised early in the second half. Cristiano Ronaldo scored what was thought to be the winning goal, eight minutes from the end, but Arsenal equalised for the second time in the match via Gallas. The draw pleased Wenger, who after the game noted his team were [...] "...still charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand". A win against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 12 November 2007 brought about Arsenal's 1,000th Premier League goal, scored by Adebayor. Reading striker Dave Kitson afterwards praised Arsenal's performance and asserted they were [...] "the best team on the planet": [...] "The thing that amazes <b>you</b> <b>most</b> is they are not just passing to each other – they are passing so that person can run on to the ball and then his mind is already made up what he is going to do next. It is just magic, it is unbelievable." ...|$|E

500|$|Patton {{views on}} race were {{complicated}} and often negative. This {{may have been}} cultivated from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the southern United States. Privately he wrote of black soldiers: [...] "Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor." [...] He also stated that performance {{was more important than}} race or religious affiliation: [...] "I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him." [...] Addressing 761st Tank Battalion Patton also said, [...] "Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from <b>you.</b> <b>Most</b> of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!" [...] Likewise, Patton called heavily on the black troops under his command. Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into rifle companies.|$|E
500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] is an uptempo song, {{composed}} with pop, soul, R, gospel, dance-pop and rhythmic adult contemporary influences and stylings. By early August, Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff; the [...] "sad and balld-y" [...] "Miss <b>You</b> <b>Most</b> (At Christmas Time)" [...] and the [...] "Gospel-tinged and religious" [...] "Jesus Born on This Day". The {{third and final}} original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a [...] "Phil Spector, old rock 'n roll, sixties-sounding Christmas song". Critics have noted the song's 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s influences which, in conjunction with Carey's voice and its simple melody, heralded its recipe for success. In discussing the song's chord progression and stylistic approaches, Slates Adam Ragusea hailed the song as [...] "the only Christmas song written in the last half-century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook." [...] The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski attributes the song's enduring appeal to its ambiguity {{in being able to}} pin it down as belonging to a specific era. The song begins with a [...] "sparking" [...] bit of percussion [...] "that resembles an antique music box or a whimsical snow globe." [...] After Carey's a cappella style vocal introduction, the song introduces other seasonal percussive signifiers including; celebratory church-like bells, cheerful sleigh bells, and [...] "an underlying rhythmic beat that sounds like the loping pace of a horse or reindeer. These sounds echo religious and secular musical touchstones, without veering blatantly too much in either direction, and give the song an upbeat, joyous tone." [...] In an interview in 1994, Carey described the song as [...] "fun", and continued: [...] "It's very traditional, old-fashioned Christmas. It's very retro, kind of '60s." [...] Afanasieff went further in breaking down the song's musical elements: [...] "A lush bed of keyboards, reminiscent of a small-scale Wall of Sound, cushions the song's cheery rhythms, while a soulful vocal chorus adds robust oohs, tension-creating counter-melodies, and festive harmonies. Most notably, however, the song's jaunty piano chords and melody keep the song merrily bouncing along." [...] Critics noted the song a tad reminiscent of the works of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole, while also describing it as hearkening back to [...] "'60s and '70s Motown covers of prewar Christmas classics, such as The Jackson 5's [...] Stevie Wonder". Slates Ragusea conceded that [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You" [...] "sounds like it could have been written in the '40s and locked in a Brill Building safe." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gregory {{began by}} aggressively {{requiring}} his churchmen {{to seek out}} and relieve needy persons and reprimanded them if they did not.

[...] Soon he was replacing administrators who would not cooperate with those who would and at the same time adding more in a build-up to a great plan that he had in mind. He understood that expenses must be matched by income. To pay for his increased expenses he liquidated the investment property and paid the expenses in cash according to a budget recorded in the polyptici. The churchmen were paid four times a year and also personally given a golden coin for their trouble.|$|E
