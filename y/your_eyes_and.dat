Amelita's signature dish was an organic rib fillet with shaved ham, banana, and hollandaise sauce. Ben's comments were 'You eat with <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> that is beating me to death!' Amelita fired back saying 'Your shoes are beating me to death.' It did her no favours. David cooked up a delightful black sesame seed-crusted tuna which was favoured among the judges. Hayley's simple salmon on potato rösti was elegant and delighted the judges who commented on her presentation in particular the height. Despite her good looks and clever articulation it was David who was chosen to go through to the semi finals.|$|E

Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern described the clip as [...] "a strangely trippy, kaleidoscopic affair with lots of weird camera tricks" [...] and {{said that it was}} a [...] "simple, yet effective treatment". However, Mark Savage of Discopop gave the video a negative review, writing, [...] " [...] It's a crying shame that the video for [...] Not on Drugs, is so undercooked. The weird editing, the weirder haircuts, the cheap effects and cheaper locations are a woeful disservice to the song's gutsy declaration of love".

With a worldwide gross of over , Veer-Zaara emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year; it was screened at the Berlin Film Festival and met with critical acclaim. Mukerji's role was praised by the critics; BBC noted, [...] "ts Rani Mukerjee who deserves praise for her acting. To act through <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> not using dialogue is an art.

500|$|The {{video was}} heavily derided by critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard panned it as [...] "even more {{abhorrent}} than the song." [...] While acknowledging that the album's previous videos were [...] "excellent", {{he pointed out}} that the [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] video [...] "tries to do nothing. Its laziness is demonstrated in the first 21 seconds, during which Lavigne holds a plush stack of cupcakes, shakes her hips, stares at the cupcakes, bounces her shoulders, and then, when she sings the line 'Someone chuck a cupcake at me'... tosses the fake cupcakes at the camera, her lip movement not matching up to the backing track whatsoever." [...] Alexa Camp of Slant Magazine called it [...] "truly eyebrow-raising, taking cultural mis-appropriation to cringe-inducing levels." [...] The Independent suggested that [...] "'Hello Kitty' will make <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears bleed", while Jezebel wrote: [...] "It looks like what would happen if someone scraped off the diseased underbelly of American pop culture from 2004-2010 and sprinkled it generously over a festering pile of garbage." ...|$|E

[...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to you to have a successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything."

500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself. Despite this, Minogue found it [...] "difficult" [...] to write the song so Bradfield had taken pieces of the original demo lyrics and mixed them with other lyrics she had written to create the finishing product of [...] "I Don't Need Anyone". She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided to do this with [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together. Lyrically, the song is about her being happy and said [...] "To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Playa Playa" [...] {{features}} basketball metaphors and gospel overtones, which accompany the track's slow funk and jazz vibe. On his bass {{playing in the}} song, Pino Palladino recalled [...] "I was thinking about Stevie Wonder in the choruses and P-Funk in the verses". Rob Evanoff of All About Jazz called the song [...] "an uplifting soul ride", and stated that it evokes an image of [...] "a musical train seen far off in the distance, slowly getting bigger as it gets closer". Evanoff also compared the track's style to the jam-sound of Pink Floyd, and wrote [...] "it surrounds you with a deep thick infectious groove that, at first, shadows and then envelopes your senses {{in such a way}} that is equal bits liberating, intoxicating and hypnotic…you close <b>your</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> are transported into another dimension". On the song's lyrics, one critic wrote that [...] "D'Angelo disses all neo-soul wannabes by calmly singing 'Bring the drama playa/Give me all U got'". [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] is a funk and hip hop diatribe with a lyrical theme concerning hip hop excess, and it is accompanied by P-Funk style harmonies and low-key singing by D'Angelo. It is a bass-driven track produced by DJ Premier, who contributes to its hip hop texture. The song's theme also incorporates religious imagery into its message of social strife. Questlove has stated that [...] "Devil's Pie" [...] was written to address the issues of [...] "the money hungry jiggafied state of the world we're in".|$|E
