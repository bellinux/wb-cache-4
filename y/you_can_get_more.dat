In this case, one player becomes the protector, {{while the other}} becomes the attacker, you can specify a maximum duration of the battle. Objectives: players are different, the attacker must defeat the enemy and stay within a specified time, and defender - hold on and not give himself into the enemys hands. First, before the battle, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> gold, but the defender can spend the points of construction to strengthen its position: to cut down trees, to build a low wall, oil traps, or Trebuchet.|$|E

If you care to see {{something}} pretty, it's the prettiest thing in the world. The students' sisters and mothers come from everywhere; and there's fashion and feasting and flirting, from ten in the morning till ten at night. I'm not sure there's so much happiness; but I can't tell. The young people know about that. I fancy there's a good deal of defeat and disappointment in it all. But if you like beautiful dresses, and music and dancing, and a great flutter of gayety, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> of it at Class Day than you can in any other way. The good time depends a great deal upon the acquaintance a student has, and whether he is popular in college." [...] Westover found this road a little impassable, and he faltered.|$|E
6000|$|... 115. Your hasty {{study of}} effect {{may be made}} most easily and quickly with a soft pencil, dashed over when done with one tolerably deep tone of gray, which will fix the pencil. While this fixing color is wet, take out the higher lights with the dry brush; and, when it is quite dry, scratch out the highest lights with the penknife. Five minutes, {{carefully}} applied, will do much by these means. Of course the paper is to be white. I do not like studies on gray paper so well; for <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> gradation by the taking off your wet tint, and laying it on cunningly a little darker here and there, than you can with body-color white, unless you are consummately skillful. There is no objection to your making your Düreresque memoranda on gray or yellow paper, and touching or relieving them with white; only, do not depend much on your white touches, nor make the sketch for their sake.|$|E
6000|$|On the whole, my {{respect for}} my fellow-men, except as one may {{outweigh}} a million, {{is not being}} increased these days. I have noticed the cold-blooded way in which newspaper writers and men generally speak of this event, as if an ordinary malefactor, though one of unusual [...] "pluck,"--as the Governor of Virginia {{is reported to have}} said, using the language of the cock-pit, [...] "the gamest man he ever saw,"--had been caught, and were about to be hung. He was not dreaming of his foes when the governor thought he looked so brave. It turns what sweetness I have to gall, to hear, or hear of, the remarks of some of my neighbors. When we heard at first that he was dead, one of my townsmen observed that [...] "he died as the fool dieth"; which, pardon me, for an instant suggested a likeness in him dying to my neighbor living. Others, craven-hearted, said disparagingly, that [...] "he threw his life away," [...] because he resisted the government. Which way have they thrown their lives, pray?--such as would praise a man for attacking singly an ordinary band of thieves or murderers. I hear another ask, Yankee-like, [...] "What will he gain by it?" [...] as if he expected to fill his pockets by this enterprise. Such a one has no idea of gain but in this worldly sense. If it does not lead to a [...] "surprise" [...] party, if he does not get a new pair of boots, or a vote of thanks, it must be a failure. [...] "But he won't gain anything by it." [...] Well, no, I don't suppose he could get four-and-sixpence a day for being hung, take the year round; but then he stands a chance to save a considerable part of his soul,--and such a soul!--when you do not.

6000|$|There {{is a sort}} of homely {{truth and}} naturalness in some books which is very rare to find, and yet looks cheap enough. There may be nothing lofty in the sentiment, or fine in the expression, but it is {{careless}} country talk. Homeliness is almost as great a merit in a book as in a house, if the reader would abide there. It is next to beauty, and a very high art. Some have this merit only. The scholar is not apt to make his most familiar experience come gracefully to the aid of his expression. Very few men can speak of Nature, for instance, with any truth. They overstep her modesty, somehow or other, and confer no favor. They do not speak a good word for her. Most cry better than they speak, and <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>more</b> nature out of them by pinching than by addressing them. The surliness with which the woodchopper speaks of his woods, handling them as indifferently as his axe, is better than the mealy-mouthed enthusiasm of the lover of nature. Better that the primrose by the river's brim be a yellow primrose, and nothing more, than that it be something less. Aubrey relates of Thomas Fuller that his was [...] "a very working head, insomuch that, walking and meditating before dinner, he would eat up a penny loaf, not knowing that he did it. His natural memory was very great, to which he added the art of memory. He would repeat to you forwards and backwards all the signs from Ludgate to Charing Cross." [...] He says of Mr. John Hales, that, [...] "He loved Canarie," [...] and was buried [...] "under an altar monument of black marble--------with a too long epitaph"; of Edmund Halley, that he [...] "at sixteen could make a dial, and then, he said, he thought himself a brave fellow"; of William Holder, who wrote a book upon his curing one Popham who was deaf and dumb, [...] "he was beholding to no author; did only consult with nature." [...] For the most part, an author consults only with all who have written before him upon a subject, and his book is but the advice of so many. But a good book will never have been forestalled, but the topic itself will in one sense be new, and its author, by consulting with nature, will consult not only with those who have gone before, but with those who may come after. There is always room and occasion enough for a true book on any subject; as there is room for more light the brightest day and more rays will not interfere with the first.|$|E
