500|$|Instead of a media server, the GrandMA console {{was used}} for MA Lighting. Vachon {{explained}} that the GrandMA console was [...] "the desk <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> most with LEDs; {{if you want to}} go further, you need a media serverCTB." [...] The assistant lighting designer used a full-sized GrandMA console. Two NSPs provided the necessary extra channels. The show's color palette was somewhat restricted. There was mostly white lights, but Upton used lighter colors to get the most light output. The original palette was also based on colors like amber, steel blue, sea green, and orange. Late in the tour Vachon would add additional bursts of color, which included intense oranges, reds, and violets.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{doing well}} in his A-level examinations, because of his report from Harrow {{he was unable to}} obtain a place at any university. After working as a {{gardener}} for two years, and a stint as an office worker which he loathed, he discovered that he enjoyed acting and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). During his time there he appeared in numerous theatre productions, including the lead roles of Gregers Werle in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, Marcus Andronicus in Titus Andronicus, and Stephen Daedalus in an adaptation of James Joyce's novel Ulysses. However, he was disappointed to find that he was treated [...] "like a nonce" [...] for being an Old Harrovian. He also made himself more unpopular by being outspoken and taking on roles in his second and third years despite the practice being forbidden by school policy. One of these was his first break into film – the 2001 horror-thriller The Hole. Fox feels that in landing the role his name [...] "probably helped – it's a combination of timing, luck and contacts". Nonetheless, [...] "the name opens some doors, but then you have to show <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job".|$|E

500|$|... "Hannah Banana" [...] {{was written}} by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and {{directed}} by John Holmquist, before {{the conclusion of the}} eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, [...] " [...] was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. [...] We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way." [...] Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and [...] "was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode," [...] and thought it was [...] "a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the [...] "perfect popstar."" [...] After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg's friend Beth for [...] "several upcoming episodes." [...] Marie described Beth as a girl that is [...] "rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can." [...] The song in the episode sung by Cyrus {{was written by}} Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy.|$|E
500|$|As a visibly distraught Rick hesitates {{to shoot}} Dale, Daryl takes {{the gun and}} inevitably shoots Dale in the head. Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that producers were subtly building up prior to the moment. Kirkman felt this marked Daryl's place in the group and was closure for the deceased Sophia Peletier, whose death caused Daryl {{to pull away from}} interacting with the group. Kirkman iterated that such actions were the testaments of his [...] "putting everything on the line and opening himself up in a way he had never done before because his childhood was so messed up."; [...] "So when he found out she was dead and in the barn all the time, that's why he retreated and separated himself from the group. It was because he allowed himself to care and it just backfired on him in a big way. He didn't {{want to be a part}} of the group and have those emotions and care about these people. So he's been distancing himself from them up until this point, and now he's seeing that these people need him and that he can fill a role and in being that harsh distant guy, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> things that no one else wants to do. He wants to step in and take that burden away from Rick for a moment. Rick is the one who stepped up and shot Sophia. Daryl saw that and because of his pain over the loss of Sophia he couldn't do that. But when he sees Rick hesitate to do the same thing with Dale he knows: this is my moment, this is where I can prove my worth, and he steps in and does what he needs to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{most people}} could only solve {{one or two}} sides, {{numerous}} books were published including David Singmaster's Notes on Rubik's [...] "Magic Cube" [...] (1980) and Patrick Bossert's <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do</b> <b>the</b> Cube (1981). At one stage in 1981 three of the top ten best selling books in the US were books on solving the Rubik's Cube, and the best-selling book of 1981 was James G. Nourse's The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube which sold over 6 million copies. In 1981 the Museum of Modern Art in New York exhibited a Rubik's Cube, and at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville, Tennessee a six-foot Cube was put on display. ABC Television even developed a cartoon show called Rubik, the Amazing Cube. In June 1982 the First Rubik's Cube World Championship took place in Budapest, and would become the only competition recognized as official until the championship was revived in 2003.|$|E
