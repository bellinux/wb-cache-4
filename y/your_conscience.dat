500|$|Marley {{considered}} cannabis {{a healing}} herb, a [...] "sacrament", and an [...] "aid to medication"; {{he supported the}} legalisation of the drug. He thought that marijuana use was prevalent in the Bible, reading passages such as [...] as showing approval of its usage. Marley began to use cannabis when he converted to the Rastafari faith from Catholicism in 1966. He was arrested in 1968 after being caught with cannabis, but continued to use marijuana in accordance with his religious beliefs. Of his marijuana usage, he said, [...] "When you smoke herb, herb reveal yourself to you. All the wickedness you do, the herb reveal itself to yourself, <b>your</b> <b>conscience,</b> show up yourself clear, because herb make you meditate. Is only a natural t'ing and it grow like a tree." [...] Marley saw marijuana usage as a vital factor in religious growth and connection with Jah, and {{as a way to}} philosophise and become wiser.|$|E

500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking <b>your</b> <b>conscience</b> round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E

2500|$|Gaye {{released}} his first single, [...] "Let <b>Your</b> <b>Conscience</b> Be Your Guide", in May 1961, with the album The Soulful Moods of Marvin Gaye, following a month later. Gaye's initial recordings failed commercially {{and he spent}} most of 1961 performing session work as a drummer for artists such as The Miracles, The Marvelettes and blues artist Jimmy Reed for $5 (US$ in [...] dollars) a week. While Gaye took some advice on performing with his eyes open (having been accused of appearing as though he were sleeping), he refused to attend grooming school courses at the John Roberts Powers School for Social Grace in Detroit because of his unwillingness to comply with its orders, something he later regretted.|$|E

2500|$|In the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington {{declared}} the film a masterpiece, lauding it as [...] "provocatively conceived, gorgeously shot and masterfully executed [...] Kubrick's brilliantly choreographed one-take scenes create a near-hypnotic atmosphere of commingled desire and dread." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club was also highly positive, arguing that [...] "the film's primal, almost religious intensity and power is primarily derived from its multifaceted realization that disobeying {{the dictates of}} society and <b>your</b> <b>conscience</b> can be both terrifying and exhilarating. [...] The film's depiction of sexual depravity and amorality could easily venture {{into the realm of}} camp {{in the hands of a}} lesser filmmaker, but Kubrick depicts primal evil in a way that somehow makes it seem both new and deeply terrifying." ...|$|E

The speech was met with boos and a negative reception among the crowd. The following day at the Texas Republican delegation breakfast, Cruz defended his choice to not endorse Trump: [...] "I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father. That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi, that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'" [...] Two months later, on September 23, 2016, Cruz publicly endorsed Trump for president.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, Spivak further {{cautioned against}} {{ignoring}} subaltern peoples as [...] "cultural Others", {{and said that}} the West could progress—beyond the colonial perspective—by means of introspective self-criticism of the basic ideals and investigative methods that establish a culturally superior West studying the culturally inferior non–Western peoples. Hence, the integration of the subaltern voice to the intellectual spaces of social studies is problematic, because of the unrealistic opposition to the idea of studying [...] "Others"; Spivak rejected such an anti-intellectual stance by social scientists, and about them said that [...] "to refuse to represent a cultural Other is salving <b>your</b> <b>conscience</b> [...] allowing you not to do any homework." [...] Moreover, postcolonial studies also reject the colonial cultural depiction of subaltern peoples as hollow mimics of the European colonists and their Western ways; and rejects the depiction of subaltern peoples as the passive recipient-vessels of the imperial and colonial power of the Mother Country. Consequent to Foucault’s philosophic model of the binary relationship of power and knowledge, scholars from the Subaltern Studies Collective, proposed that anti-colonial resistance always counters every exercise of colonial power.|$|E
