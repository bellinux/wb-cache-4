He underwent therapy for his parents' divorce, but called it a [...] "waste of time" [...] explaining that his parents could not [...] "accept the fact that I might have been OK with it.

500|$|The novelization {{was written}} by Hank Searls, who also adapted Jaws 2. While Searls' Jaws 2 novelization {{was based on an}} earlier draft of that film and was {{significantly}} different from the finished film, his Jaws: The Revenge novelization sticks fairly close to the final film, although it does contain some extra subplots. The novel contains a subplot in which Hoagie is a government agent and he transports laundered money. The only reference to this in the film is when Michael Brody asks [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you’re not flying people?" [...] to which Hoagie replies, [...] "I deliver laundry." [...] In Searls' novel, the character of Jake is ultimately killed by the shark; Jake was originally supposed to die in the film, but the script was changed to allow him to survive.|$|E

[...] "There are a lot of special effects. I talked to things that weren't there – which is what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you're doing green-screen or blue-screen stuff. There's {{going to be a lot}} of fairies dancing around me. Isn't that exciting? I always have a lot of fairies dancing around me", Madonna commented about the music video. The video premiered in the US on February 11, 2004 on AOL's First View. After the premiere, it was streamed on Yahoo!, MSN, Windows Media, Apple, MTV, VH1, iFilm and Madonna.com.|$|E

What's on TV {{announced}} the storyline in June 2009. About {{the beginning of the}} storyline, [...] "Hannah has gone off the rails of late, but even she manages to outdo herself when she and Darren tie the knot after a particularly boozy night in Denmark". Holy Soap said the wedding will leave fans [...] "stunned" [...] and described the pair as [...] "odd". Dawson said, regarding the sudden marriage, that [...] "Darren doesn’t suddenly fall in love with Hannah or vice-versa. It's just one of those mad, crazy things <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you’ve had far too many drinks and your life is {{in a bit of a}} mess. They both regret it. They get home and their friends and families are horrified – especially Hannah's family".|$|E

500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> you know something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E

2500|$|.....We {{had to do}} {{the whole}} movie in 16 weeks. It was a massive undertaking. That was not fair to the movie. I would redo the entire third act if I could. But the studio {{literally}} took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so I had {{to be in charge of}} that.

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>When</b> you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E

2500|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} research emphasizes fieldwork, {{and this}} emphasis {{has been offered}} as a distinguishing mark. Qualitative psychological research is also described as holistic. That is, qualitative researchers believe in studying phenomena in its context rather than concentrating on narrow aspects of the phenomena. This means that they either observe or participate in the phenomena they are studying, e.g. attending a football game to understand the behaviours of fan, and/or they ask open-ended questions about the behaviour of fans at football games. These questions are holistic because {{they are designed to}} understand the context of behaviour—they will usually follow a pattern that replicates the experience, e.g. [...] "What did <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you arrived? Who did you come with? What did you do then?" [...] However, similar methods are used by quantitative researchers.|$|E
2500|$|Adam Ant {{approached}} Malcolm McLaren (the {{manager of}} The Sex Pistols) {{and asked him}} to manage the band. McLaren subsequently took the rest of the Ants from the original group when he introduced the singer Annabella Lwin and began the process of honing Bow Wow Wow for chart success. Later Adam seemed to have reconciled with the fact. [...] "I like to use the word 'mutiny'. My band was happy to go. Malcolm tried to see if I could fit into Bow Wow Wow, but I never could've or would've. I might have had a broken heart at the time, but Malcolm didn't leave me with nothing. [...] He mentored me. He said: 'Look, what do you want?' I said: 'I wanna sell millions of records', and he said, 'Well, you're going the wrong way about it. This [...] is the kind of esoteric stuff <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you've done eight albums, you're living on a yacht, and you can do what you want'," [...] he remembered later.|$|E
2500|$|Alistair Lawrence from BBC Music {{criticized the}} album saying that [...] "once {{the novelty of}} the squelching, space-aged din they’ve birthed fades, what’s {{apparent}} is how little Korn have to say for themselves these days". Sputnikmusic strongly criticized the album giving it a score of 0.5/5 stating that [...] "The Path Of Totality is a truly horrible album, built on a foundation of tired and overwrought stereotypes put together not by just a clueless band, but a bunch of equally confused artists who truly have no proper understanding of the genre they {{claim to be a}} part of". No Ripcord gave the album a 1/10 stating that [...] "it is samey, ugly and spectacularly stupid at the same time". Jason Heller from The A.V. Club gave the album an 'F' stating: [...] "To Korn’s credit, The Path Of Totality is its most radical reinvention to date. It’s also the worst slab of sludge it ever shat."NME gave the album a 6/10 saying that it's [...] "not quite a car crash, but a near miss" [...] and jokingly asking: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> you’re 10 albums into your career, sliding down festival bills and trying to bury the tag of creators of a genre you now despise? If you’re Korn, you Google ‘2011 music’ and rope in a bunch of DJs for a ‘dubstep’ album, of course".|$|E
