2500|$|My {{feeling was}} one of {{confidence}} when Spruance was there. When you moved into Admiral Halsey's command from Admiral Spruance's … you moved [...] {{an area in which}} you never knew what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in the next five minutes or how <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, because the printed instructions were never up to date.... He never did things the same way twice. When you moved into Admiral Spruance's command, the printed instructions were up to date, and you did things in accordance with them.|$|E
2500|$|Flynn {{admits to}} putting some {{of herself in}} the {{character}} of Nick Dunne. Like Dunne, she was a popular culture writer. Also, like Dunne, she was laid off after many years at the same job. Flynn said, [...] "I certainly wove that experience, that sense of having something that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{for the rest of your}} life and seeing that possibility taken away... I definitely wove that sense of unrest and nervousness into Nick's character." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Bernard, laughing, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coarse and flattering, I collapse. If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> titillate my vanity, I succumb." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do afterwards. Do <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite well off?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have a new}} sensation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Splendidly done, Meinik! It {{was like}} the note of an organ. Although I knew what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> I felt almost startled, myself, when that deep note rose. No wonder they were frightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Mr. Marx," [...] I said, {{looking at him}} steadily, [...] "but {{it seems to me}} that you are not a fit person to be trusted with firearms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't help it! We can't help it!" [...] they murmured in reply. [...] "We're put here to hold you, and we're {{going to}} do it; you never pull us twice in the same direction. If you'd say what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> next, we'd try to meet your views.|$|E
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} you are {{thinking}} of doing? I told the general what service you had rendered me, and he asked me what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I told him that, as yet, I did not know whether you were going to stay here, or go back again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Take her in your arms, sir." [...] You are too crushed {{to offer}} any {{resistance}} and so meekly accept the burden. [...] "Put your arm more down her middle, sir," [...] says the high-priestess, {{and then all}} step back and watch you intently as though <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a trick with it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is all settled, then, {{that you}} go on with us! Not that I ever thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} so absurd as to set up for yourself, you silly little woman: {{but it seems to}} be considered right to come to a formal settlement about such a grand personage as my Lady Morville.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good evening, Sir Gervaise," [...] {{called out}} the earl, as usual taking the {{initiative}} in the discourse; [...] "I was in hopes when I saw your flag in the boat, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> me the favour to open a bottle of claret, and to taste some fruit, I have still standing on the table." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{him last}} evening {{and talked with}} him. He talked like a fool, it is true, but {{that has nothing to}} do with it. Afterwards I thought of him again; {{wondered}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with him; remembered--pardon me!--that you must be poor; and remembered, also, that you have suffered through a servant of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{ahead with}} your story," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "We left you some months {{ago at the}} harbor of Los Angeles, {{wondering}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with that big ship of yours that lay anchored in the Pacific. If I remember aright, you were considering whether you dared board it to return to that mysterious island home of yours at--at--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
50|$|Groucho: <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{convicted of}} murder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not now," [...] she {{interrupted}} hastily. [...] "Do you know, I fancy {{that we must}} {{be getting}} too confidential. That odious man with the eyeglass keeps staring at us. Tell me what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do when <b>you</b> leave here. You can ask me--what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to,</b> afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not rubbish," [...] he answered, [...] "but I {{will admit}} that I should not have said {{anything}} about it yet, {{if it had not}} been for your vague threats of what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Virginia," [...] he added, dropping his voice almost to a whisper, [...] "you know that I am fond of you. I have been fond of you ever since I first saw you here." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> wonders, what? Missionary to Europe after fiery Columbanus. Fiacre and Scotus {{on their}} creepystools in heaven spilt from their pintpots, loudlatinlaughing: Euge! Euge! Pretending to speak broken English as you dragged your valise, porter threepence, across the slimy pier at Newhaven. Comment? Rich booty you brought back; Le Tutu, five tattered numbers of Pantalon Blanc et Culotte Rouge; a blue French telegram, curiosity to show: ...|$|E
60|$|WILLIE. And now you're out on strike--now you've {{been out}} for a week pretty nearly, what further are you? I heard {{a great deal of}} talk about what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Well, what ARE you going to do? You don't know. You've not the {{smallest}} idea. You haven't any idea whatsoever. You've got your leaders. Now then, Job Arthur, throw a little light on the way in front, will you: for it seems to me we're lost in a bog. Which way are we to steer? Come--give the word, and let's gee-up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have them at once. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bought with your brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luke, old friend," [...] Ned said earnestly, {{putting his}} hand on the cropper's shoulder, [...] "don't be angry with Polly, she has done me a great service. I have learned the truth, and know what you meant now by a life for a life. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{sacrifice}} yourself for me. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take upon yourself a crime which you never committed to clear me. You went to York to declare yourself the murderer of Mulready, in case I had <b>been</b> found guilty. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> emigrate to America to send home a written confession." ...|$|R
60|$|HARRY. I thought <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{play tennis}} this afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|THE ORDERLY. My mother's {{second cousin}} {{was one of}} the Parkinsons of Stepney. (Almost in tears.) What do you know of the {{feelings}} of a respectable family in the middle station of life? I cant bear to be looked down on as a common soldier. Why cant my father be let buy my discharge? Youve done away with the soldier's right to have his discharge bought for him by his relations. The country didnt know <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that or it would never have stood it. Is an Englishman to be made a mockery like this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You men," [...] she continued, looking him {{squarely}} in the face, [...] "think a lot too much of yourselves. You think so much of yourselves that {{as often as not}} you've no time to think of other folk. A month or so ago who were you? You were hiding in a cheap tenement house, scared out of your wits, dressed pretty near as shabbily as I was, with a detective on your track, and with no idea of what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for a living. And now look at you. Who's done it all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hated to}} go and leave you there," [...] she said. [...] "I waited about behind those thick {{blackthorn}} trees, hoping that you might come my way. I saw you creep up to the gun. I saw you raise it to your shoulder. Even then I {{had no idea what}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Afterwards I saw the smoke and the flash. I heard the report, and Mr. Rochester's cry as he fell. I saw you slip a fresh cartridge into the gun, and go stealing away. Bertrand, I have not slept since. Tell me, was it a nightmare?" ...|$|E
3000|$|... “Now {{that you}} know how to {{accelerate}} and brake, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try to imagine that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in traffic!” (Trainer 8) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know exactly}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, Fan," [...] she spoke, [...] "for <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{perfectly}} transparent, and I can read you like a book. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write one of your very simple candid letters {{to tell him what}} I have said, and then finish by asking him to come down with Mr. Eden." ...|$|R
