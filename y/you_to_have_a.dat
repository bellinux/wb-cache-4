500|$|Michael Caine as John Cutter, {{the stage}} {{engineer}} (ingenieur) {{who works with}} Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan said that even though {{it felt like the}} character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, a father and a guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He has a wonderful warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with author Cicily Janus, Joseph commented that his perspective has changed {{a great deal from}} when he was younger. [...] He said, [...] "Everything I did was focused on making good music and being a great musician, not running a business. Yet it takes a businessperson to bring music to the masses." [...] But some artists just want to [...] be involved in the music and do not like the added problems or have the personality to work with both. [...] Joseph suggests newer artists read and study both courses and pick one that best suits their needs and wants. [...] He advises, [...] "...to keep your eyes and ears open all the time. [...] All the information you need is available to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> successful career in music, if you're paying attention, and not closed off to anything." [...] He explains, [...] "Time and persistence has shown me that I can succeed at sharing my art with others as a musician while running my own music business. [...] And that kind of success is as good as I could have ever wished for." ...|$|E
500|$|Mileena {{was one of}} the {{characters}} cited by Guy Aoki as allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts. In the 1996 moral panic themed book Interacting With Video, which condemned violence of video games as supposedly affecting social behaviour and causing real-life violence, Patricia Marks Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking used the [...] "two Asian twin sisters, Mileena and Kitana," [...] {{as an example of a}} [...] "highly eroticized dragon lady" [...] trope, with Mileena's [...] "Man-Eater" [...] Fatality described as [...] "a high-powered kiss that evokes vagina dentata." [...] The authors wrote that despite the inclusion of [...] "characters of color" [...] such as the two and Jax, [...] "we cannot assume that this greater diversity represents a more progressive identity politics, for one could argue that it merely increases the racist and sexist potential of individual fights." [...] Critical studies professor Marsha Kinder similarly accused Mortal Kombat II of [...] "allowing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> misogynistic aspect of combat," [...] alleging that [...] "some of the most violent possibilities are against women," [...] whose own [...] "fatality moves are highly eroticised." [...] Kinder singled out Mileena to describe how the character can kill her opponent [...] "by sucking him in and spitting out his bones. Talk about Spider Woman!" ...|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able}} to get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
2500|$|I {{have had}} a most happy life and I want each one of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> happy life too. I believe that God put us in this jolly world {{to be happy and}} enjoy life. Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E

There'd have to be an inquest and I should be blamed for not calling a doctor in." ...|$|E
