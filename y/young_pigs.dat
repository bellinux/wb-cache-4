40|$|Antibody-dependent {{cellular}} cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity against pseudorabies virus-infected target cells {{has been}} found to be lower in <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL 5) than in adults. Experiments were designed to investigate the reason(s) for low activity in the young, which are more at risk of fatal infection than adults. The percentage of polymorphonuclean leukocytes (PMN 5), the major ADCC effector cell, In the whole leukocyte population did not have a bearing on the deficiency. Enrichment for PMNs did not alleviate differences in activity between <b>young</b> and adult <b>pigs.</b> Additionally, no suppressor cell(s) or factor(s) could be demonstrated to account for the ADCC deficiency. The source of the ADCC deficiency in the young was found to be related to the decreased ability of <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> effector cells to bind antibody-sensitized targets. This deficiency relative to adults was associated with decreased antibody binding to high affinity Fc receptors on <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> neutrophils. Key words: polymorphonuclean leukocytes, pseudorabies virus, peripheral blood leuko-cyte...|$|R

40|$|Coronavirus titers were {{compared}} in various tissues of three-day old and 21 -day old pigs after {{exposure to the}} virus of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). Pigs in both groups that did not die from TGE were necropsied at intervals from one to 15 days post-exposure, and their tissues assayed for viral content. Viral titers were much higher in the small intestines of the <b>younger</b> <b>pigs.</b> Viral isolations were obtained from several tissues of the <b>younger</b> <b>pigs</b> but only from the small intestines of pigs infected at 21 days of age. Levels of viral neutralizing antibodies in the serums of both age groups were comparable at similar post-exposure intervals...|$|R
60|$|A {{smile of}} {{satisfaction}} {{lit up the}} lad's countenance as he beheld a big sow and six <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> busily engaged in digging up roots directly below him. To seize a large stone and drop it into {{the centre of the}} group was the work of a moment. The result was in truth deadly, for the heavy stone hit one of the little pigs on the nape of the neck, and it sank to the ground with a melancholy squeak which proved to be its last.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} Patience spent {{in trying to}} get things into {{somewhat}} better order, and Steadfast in trying to gather together his live stock, which he had been forced to leave to take care of themselves. Horse, donkey, and cows were all safe round their hut; but he could find only three of the <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> and the old sow at the farmyard, and it plainly was not safe to leave them there, though how to pen them up in their new quarters he did not know.|$|E
60|$|That {{afternoon}} the whole Vicarage party {{walked up to}} the farm to inspect another litter of <b>young</b> <b>pigs.</b> It struck Geoffrey, remembering former editions, that the reproductive powers of Mr. Granger's old sow were something little short of marvellous, and he dreamily worked out a calculation of {{how long it would take}} her and her progeny to produce a pig to every square yard of the area of plucky little Wales. It seemed that the thing could be done in six years, which was absurd, so he gave up calculating.|$|E
40|$|Supplemental fat is {{routinely}} included in <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> diets but often removed with increasing weight {{to match the}} perceived declining need for high energy as pigs grow and thus to prevent excessive fat deposition during finishing. However, recent results suggest that early positive effects on growth may be lost if fat is removed from subsequent diets and that, for reasons yet to be established, older pigs may be more responsive to supplemental fat than <b>younger</b> <b>pigs</b> (Campbell, 2005). This project was designed to characterize the effects of added fat on performance, carcass quality and the possible mechanisms of why the pig responds like it does to added fat...|$|R
60|$|The hamper {{containing}} six fowls and a <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> was {{no light}} weight; {{it was taken}} down hill, unsteadily, with jerks. Pigling, although nearly scratched to pieces, contrived to hide the papers and peppermints inside his clothes.|$|R
5000|$|The plot {{revolves}} around a <b>young</b> <b>pig,</b> won at a fair {{by a local}} sheep farmer named Farmer Hogget. He has no use for pigs, so his wife intends to fatten up the [...] "little porker" [...] for Christmas dinner.|$|R
60|$|The {{young of}} even the most horrible beasts have {{something}} piquant and engaging about them, and so I suppose it is in the way of things that the land ironclad which opens a new and more dreadful and destructive phase in the human folly of warfare, should appear first {{as if it were a}} joke. Never has any such thing so completely masked its wickedness under an appearance of genial silliness. The Tank is a creature to which one naturally flings a pet name; the five or six I was shown wandering, rooting and climbing over obstacles, round a large field near X, were as amusing and disarming as a little of lively <b>young</b> <b>pigs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{horsemen}} took {{up their}} position {{on either side of}} the patch in readiness to start as soon as the animals were fairly off. A number of villagers, in whose fields of young rice the family had done much damage during the few days that they had taken up their abode in their present quarters, were assembled on such little rises of ground as were likely to give a good view of the proceedings. There were about a dozen horsemen with spears; of these, three or four were novices, and these intended to try their skill for the first time upon the [...] "squeakers," [...] as the <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> are called, while the others prepared for a race after the old ones.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{the lord}} of the rocks and caves, was the cave bear, as his slighter brother, the grizzly, was lord of the thick woods below, and as the dappled lion--the lion of those days was dappled--was lord of the thorn-thickets, reed-beds, and open plains. He was the {{greatest}} of all meat-eaters; he knew no fear, none preyed on him, and none gave him battle; only the rhinoceros was beyond his strength. Even the mammoth shunned his country. This invasion perplexed him. He noticed these new beasts were shaped like monkeys, and sparsely hairy like <b>young</b> <b>pigs.</b> [...] "Monkey and young pig," [...] said the cave bear. [...] "It might not be so bad. But that red thing that jumps, and the black thing jumping with it yonder! Never in my life have I seen such things before!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The term Boneen is Newfoundland Gaelic dialect for a <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> (derived from Dineen > Irish Gaelic). The slang {{probably}} {{indicates that}} the unit is either from Newfoundland or the Maritimes region of Canada or served there during its history.|$|R
50|$|The {{meat from}} {{suckling}} pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp {{and can be}} used for pork rinds. The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of collagen in a <b>young</b> <b>pig.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, boy, {{your mind}} hasn't got quite {{on the balance}} yet. It ain't {{possible}} {{that you could be}} as fat as a <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> after bein' three or four months at sea in an open boat. What was the name of your ship?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{they became}} a little more sane, and a waltz, or {{something}} like it, was got up. It was quite pretty, {{and some of the}} movements graceful; but the wild spirit of the glens seemed to re-enter them again rather suddenly. The females were expelled from the ring altogether, and the young men braced themselves for a little really heavy work; they dashed, flung, and hurled themselves about like maniacs, stood on their heads and walked on their hands; in short, became a company of acrobats, yet always kept up a sort of sympathetic attempt at time with the fiddler, who went on pounding his wooden board with his left heel and murdering an inconceivable multitude of <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> with a degree of energy that was only equalled by that of those to whom he fiddled.|$|E
60|$|During Leslie's illness I strolled down to {{the mill}} one Saturday evening. I met George {{tramping}} across the yard {{with a couple of}} buckets of swill, and eleven <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> rushing squealing about his legs, shrieking in an agony of suspense. He poured the stuff into a trough with luscious gurgle, and instantly ten noses were dipped in, and ten little mouths began to slobber. Though there was plenty of room for ten, yet they shouldered and shoved and struggled to capture a larger space, and many little trotters dabbled and spilled the stuff, and the ten sucking, clapping snouts twitched fiercely, and twenty little eyes glared askance, like so many points of wrath. They gave uneasy, gasping grunts in their haste. The unhappy eleventh rushed from point to point trying to push in his snout, but for his pains he got rough squeezing, and sharp grabs on his ears. Then he lifted up his face and screamed screams of grief and wrath unto the evening sky.|$|E
6000|$|Pigs also possessed attractions for me, {{never having}} had an {{opportunity}} of observing their graces of mind and manner, till I came to Washington, whose porcine citizens appeared to enjoy a larger liberty than many of its human ones. Stout, sedate looking pigs, hurried by each morning to their places of business, with a preoccupied air, and sonorous greeting to their friends. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to their tails, promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like gentlemen of leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off the side walk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of [...] "We wont go home till morning," [...] from the gutter; and delicate <b>young</b> <b>pigs</b> tripped daintily through the mud, as if, like [...] "Mrs. Peerybingle," [...] they plumed themselves upon their ankles, and kept themselves particularly neat in point of stockings. Maternal pigs, with their interesting families, strolled by in the sun; and often the pink, baby-like squealers lay down for a nap, with a trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.|$|E
40|$|The {{variation}} in serum levels of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA and IgM {{has been studied}} during the early development of the <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> using radial immunodiffusion assays with specific rabbit antisera.

6000|$|... "And for reason enough," [...] the old chief retorted. [...] "Never {{before has}} a man been fool {{enough to give}} a pig for a dog. It is a <b>young</b> <b>pig,</b> and it is fat and tender. Take the dog, Nalasu. Take the dog now." ...|$|R
60|$|Upon examination, {{that part}} of the brain proving as much injured as the cranium itself, a <b>young</b> <b>pig</b> was obtained; and {{preliminaries}} being over, part of its live brain was placed in the cavity, the trepan accomplished with cocoanut shell, and the scalp drawn over and secured.|$|R
