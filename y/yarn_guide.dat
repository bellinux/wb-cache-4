40|$|In this paper, Ribboning, one of {{the common}} faults in yarn packages, is mathematically analysed. If yarn is repeatly laid on top of or along the same path as the {{previously}} wound yarn, this duplication of yarn path on the package creates a defect known as ribboning. The number of turns of package (n) per double traverse of <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> is calculated in two different way One is calculated the length of a coil on the package and total length of yarn in a double traverse; the other is considered transmission rate between drum and conical yarn package The result of two different approach is similar and the probable diameter of conical yarn package which ribboning is occurred is calculated and used on Schalafhorst-Autocore OE spinning machines...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{prototype}} yarn traversing {{mechanism that}} includes three yarn guides mounted on an endless chain passing over six sprockets with {{an arrangement of}} relieving yarn from one guide to the other at traverse extremes to wind 762 mm (30 inches) long filter cartridges has been already developed by the author[1].

40|$|DE 10021341 A UPAB: 20020213 NOVELTY - The {{assembly}} to lay weft yarns, preferably in a multi-layer structure of multi-axial yarns, has a controlled yarn layer (30) {{to guide the}} wefts (20). It is moved together with rows of moving hooks on chains at the edges to hold the yarns in place and move the laid yarn layer(s) in a forward direction while retaining their orientation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - In a laying cycle of the weft yarn band laying system, the yarn layer carries a number of wefts, to lay them at the moving edge hooks {{in at least two}} laying stages for different yarn orientations and at least two laying stages on the reverse movements. The width of the laid weft yarns is controlled at the side edges of the yarn layer(s) or outside the laying stages. The start position of the forward and backward layer laying stage is set according to an actual position of an oriented weft yarn band already laid in place, which is the actual growth position in relation to the hook chains. The advance movement of the hook carrier chains is controlled according to the duration of a yarn laying cycle. The hook carrier chains have a synchronized forward movement, according to the yarn laying cycle. The yarn laying cycle has a laying stage for the oriented yarns, a deflection stage around the edge hooks, and a return stage with a different yarn orientation. The gaps between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings (33) at the yarn layer are altered according to changes in the yarn laying orientation. Before adjustment, the yarn layer is rotated into a different angular alignment. The control sets the number of yarn laying stages at the edge hooks for different laying cycles and/or an advance of the laid and oriented wefts in each laying cycle, according to the advance movement of the hook chains on each laying cycle. The yarn laying movement extends as far as behind the needles of a side edge fixing system. After laying a band of wefts, the orientation is set by the yarn layer at an entry point for the next laying stage. A laying stage is extended after the side edge, by the length of a racking path, while the yarn layer is lowered. As the yarn layer is lowered, an edge fixing system grips the band of wefts from above to apply a grip to fix a section of the laid yarn band. The yarn layer and edge fixing system move on a swing path to the hook laying point of the next laying stage, and the yarn is transferred at the hook laying point. As the laid yarn is moved upwards in a curved yarn laying action around the hook laying point, the next laying stage starts to apply tension to the yarn. The fixing unit has a comb structure to grip the tensed yarns to give a new hook laying width between the fixing system and the yarn layer. The laid yarns can be tensed by lowering the yarn layer to a transfer comb, to tense the yarns at it by an angled rear movement and a following upwards movement and release them from the fixing system. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a system to lay bands of weft yarns at given orientations, by a controlled yarn layer which carries a number of weft yarns, to be caught at the edges by hooks on moving chains. Preferred Features: An additional yarn layer is used when laying more than three layers of weft yarns. The interval can be adjusted between the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> openings at the layer, and the yarn guides (32, 34) can be in a number of parts. The yarn layer has a slitted plate with diverging yarn channels, especially as slits. The plate can have a lateral sliding movement to set the <b>yarn</b> <b>guide</b> slits according to the width of the laid band of wefts. The yarn layer can be rotated to alter the gaps between the weft yarns. The yarn layer can have a grid bar with holes to guide the weft yarns, to be rotated into different angular alignments for a laying stage. The weft layer, to lay a number of weft yarn band layers, gives layers in mirror image alignments against each other. USE - The assembly is for laying bands of weft yarns to be held at the edges by hooks on moving chains. ADVANTAGE - The operation gives a smooth transfer of weft direction around the edge hooks. Weft yarn losses at the edges are reduced, with an increased number of weft yarns. The productivity is increased without increasing the yarn laying speed...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when <b>yarns</b> pass over <b>guides</b> or other surfaces. The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with doubled yarn in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} guide surface and blocked twist builds up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the guide surface. In the second mechanism blocking torque is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn surface and the guide surface or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of <b>yarn</b> to <b>guide.</b> The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a singles yarn (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces. The main circumstances under which these different mechanisms may operate, have been identified and suggestions made for minimising the blockage of twist...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A monitored thread guiding device in a knitting machine, in which at least one thread is guided under predetermined tension along a free thread transport zone, has unit(s) for supplying the thread along the zone and a unit for receiving and/or further guiding the tensioned thread. An optical sensor unit, for contact-free detection of thread in the transport zone, generates a control or regulation signal for the thread supply and/or receiving unit(s). The novel feature is that a device for causing sideways oscillation of the thread from its path is provided along the transport zone. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a corresponding monitored thread guiding process, in which controlled transverse oscillations are induced in the thread in the transport zone, optical detection of a consequent dynamic sensor signal is used to indicate an undamaged thread and lack of detection of such a signal is used to detect a broken thread, in which case operation of the knitting machine is halted. USE - For monitored guiding of thread in a knitting machine, especially a circular knitting machine. ADVANTAGE - Guiding of the threads is effectively monitored (especially as regards thread tension) while avoiding additional wear on the knitting machine side components (including the thread itself), so {{that the need for}} expensive and time-consuming maintenance operations is eliminated.

40|$|Circular overbraiding of {{composite}} preforms on complex mandrels currently lacks automatic {{generation of}} machine control data. To solve this limitation, an inverse kinematics-based procedure {{was designed and}} implemented for circular braiding machines with optional guide rings, resulting in a take-up speed profile for a given braid angle distribution on mandrels with complex 3 D shapes including non-axisymmetric, optionally eccentric cross-sections that can vary in shape and size along an optionally curved mandrel centerline, allowing a curved machine movement. This procedure reduces the problem size, resulting in a short computation time, fit for CAE process chain integration. Numerical control data was generated for a complex mandrel with a specified braid angle and a triaxial braid. A simulation using this control data yields a braid angle that deviates a few degrees from the specified braid angle. The simulation was validated experimentally, using the generated instructions to control the braiding machine. This showed a deviation from the simulated braid angle of 3 degrees in the centered, non-tapered mandrel regions, up to 10 degrees in tapered regions and an experimental scatter of 7 degrees. The deviation is mainly attributed {{to the neglect of}} <b>yarn</b> interaction and <b>guide</b> ring contact friction in the model, leading to an incorrectly modeled convergence zone length...|$|R
40|$|Gillespie, John, Jr. Keefe, MichaelBallistic impact onto {{flexible}} {{textile fabrics}} {{is a complicated}} multi-scale problem owing to the structural hierarchy of the materials, anisotropic material behavior, projectile geometry, impact velocity and boundary conditions. While this subject has been an active area of research for decades, the fundamental mechanisms such as material failure, dynamic response and multi-axial loading occurring at lower length scales during impact are not well understood. This work provides {{new insights into the}} fundamental deformation and failure mechanisms during ballistic impact onto textile fabrics at the micron length scale. In this research, a hybrid computational-experimental systematic approach is adopted to understand the mechanisms and deformation modes of high performance polymer fibers, specifically Kevlar KM 2, that is widely used in ballistic impact applications. Fiber length-scale 3 D finite element (FE) models are developed to better understand and complement the complicated transverse impact experiments. The fiber length-scale study suggests that fibers are subjected to multiaxial stress states including transverse compression, axial tension, axial compression and transverse shear significant enough to cause fibrillation in the fiber during impact. A dispersive flexural wave mode is predicted by the model due to the finite longitudinal shear modulus of the fiber. The flexural wave induces curvature in the fiber significant enough to cause compressive kinking and, in turn, local fibrillation in the fiber. A fiber length-scale yarn model is developed by explicitly modeling all the 400 fibers in a KM 2 600 denier yarn. The yarn transverse compression results show that fiber-fiber contact plays {{a significant role in the}} spreading and deformation of individual fibers that is consistent with experimental results. When subjected to transverse impact, the model indicates significant transverse compressive strains in the fiber that increase with impact velocity and a flexural wave that induces curvatures in the fibers significant enough to induce compressive kinking and fibrillation. In addition to the transverse wave, a spreading wave develops due to fiber-fiber contact interaction that spreads the fibers to a large extent resulting in non-uniform loading and progressive failure of fibers within the <b>yarn.</b> <b>Guided</b> by the computational models, single-fiber micromechanical experiments for axial compressive kinking and transverse compression deformation modes are developed. The average tensile strength of the kinked fibers is found to be reduced by 7 % compared to the virgin fibers. An experimental methodology is developed to determine the single fiber constitutive behavior in quasi-static transverse compression by removing the geometric nonlinearity due to the growing contact area. The fibers exhibit nonlinear inelastic behavior under large compressive strains. The fibers subjected to 60 % nominal strains (80 % true strains) showed a 20 % reduction in average tensile strength compared to the virgin fibers. A nonlinear inelastic constitutive model is implemented as a user defined material (UMAT) suitable for the commercial FE code LS-DYNA explicit analysis. During impact, the inelastic behavior results in a significant reduction in the fiber bounce velocity and a reduction in the projectile-fiber contact forces by 40 % compared to an elastic constitutive behavior. The inelastic dissipation and reduced bounce leads to an inelastic collision rather than an elastic collision. The longitudinal shear modulus and the inelastic behavior are found to govern the failure response of the fibers during impact. Modeling the single fiber quasi-static multiaxial loading experiments indicate fiber failure may be initiated based on a gage length dependent maximum axial tensile strain in the fiber. Regardless of the material behavior (elastic or inelastic), fiber length-scale impact models show a gradient in the axial tensile strain (stress) in the fiber cross section at the location of failure consistent with multiaxial loading experimental observations. Fiber-level yarn breaking speed predictions based on a maximum axial tensile strain (stress) criterion are much lower than the breaking speed based on classical theory and they are consistent with experimental measurements. Therefore, the reduction in experimental yarn breaking speed compared to theoretical Smith solution is attributed to the stress concentration and property degradation mechanisms due to multiaxial stress states at the location of failure.
