Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep going with the previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'"

The first step will be to apparently humanize Kratos, who will begin as a mortal and still have his family, with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack. Melton added, [...] "We're going to learn about [...] and understand how he operates.

[...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?'

The team was named after an unarmed New York native who was shot 50 times by three police officers on November 25, 2006. The Sean Bell All-Stars won the Trayvon Martin Invitational in August 2013, with a team that featured Clinkscales and Tobias Harris, in Harlem, New York. The event raised over $5,000 for the Trayvon Martin Foundation and was attended by NBA players Kyrie Irving, Tyreke Evans, and future NBA commissioner Adam Silver. At the invitational, Clinkscales spoke out against police brutality, saying, [...] "Kids everywhere are getting shot and murdered, whether it's in Jamaica, the Bronx, Chicago.

500|$|Thief began {{development}} in April 1996. For the game's original designer and writer Ken Levine, credited by The Telegraph as [...] "a {{key figure in}} the creation" [...] of Thief, inspirations came from two of his favourite games, Castle Wolfenstein and Diablo. The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project, included School of Wizards, Dark Elves Must Die and Better Red Than Undead, the latter of which was [...] "a campy story" [...] about communist zombies. The game {{was supposed to be}} a first-person sword fighting simulator, but [...] "the marketing [...] killed the idea," [...] to his disappointment. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, [...] "The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead, a '50s Cold War game where the Soviet Union is overrun with zombies and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don't work on the undead." [...] Doug Church said the game's design was built around the idea [...] "of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or do things for or not." ...|$|E

However, Gomez insisted that the song wasn't about [...] "one specific person".

You have to feel it. You gotta get through the other side as best as you can, and everyone has been in that situation where you can't help it. Even if it's not even that, it's like love drunk in a way." [...] In her analysis of the song, Alexis Rhiannon of Bustle wrote that [...] "as soon as [...] heard those lyrics, my brain started racing through the options of who this could be? Could it be about Justin Bieber, like I'm almost sure [...] "Camouflage" [...] is?" [...] Richard Braxter of Popology Now expressed doubt over Gomez's claims that the song wasn't about someone specific, saying: [...] "We’re sure there’s some weight to that, but we can’t help but think there’s some hints of Justin Bieber in this track." ...|$|E

In another scene, Ben tells Leslie the song he played after getting sworn in as an 18-year-old mayor was [...] "Whoomp! (There It Is)", a 1993 hip hop song by the duo Tag Team. The episode features several quotes from author and outdoorsman Jack London. Among them, which Leslie reads from her master plan proposal, is, [...] "You can't wait for inspiration. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after it with a club," [...] and [...] "So I say the function of man is to live, not to exist. I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot." [...] The original script included about one dozen different London quotes, but most were cut from the final draft. [...] Schur said he used London quotes because he believed the author was one both Leslie and Ron would admire. At {{one point in the}} episode, while discussing April's birthday, Leslie says, [...] "Damn the wheel of the world! Why must it continually turn over?"

A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is going to lead to interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set.
