500|$|Sinatra did {{not serve}} in the {{military}} during World War II. On December 11, 1943, he was officially classified 4-F ("Registrant not acceptable for military service") by his draft board because of a perforated eardrum.

During one trip to Rome he met the Pope, who asked him if he was an operatic tenor. [...] Sinatra worked frequently with the popular Andrews Sisters in radio the 1940s, and many USO shows were broadcast to troops via the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS).
