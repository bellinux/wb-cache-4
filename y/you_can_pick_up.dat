500|$|This episode {{featured}} guest appearances by actors Paul Reubens and Isabella Rossellini. Fey {{wrote the}} role of Prince Gerhardt Hapsburg specifically for Reubens, {{and he did not}} have to audition. Fey, in regard to Reubens, said: [...] "We were thrilled beyond belief to get him to do [...]" [...] Kevin Lasit, the show's prop master, built Gerhardt's wheelchair and puppet legs. Fey said that Lasit [...] "really outdid himself", and noted that Reubens was kneeling in the wheelchair in the seat built over the top of him. In addition, Reubens wore prosthetic teeth and a wig to accommodate his character's look. According to Fey, in the DVD commentary for this episode, the show shot an alternate endingat Reubens's requestin which Gerhardt does not die, [...] "but ultimately it felt better stakes for the story if he'd die", in which Will Forte's character says, [...] "The Habsburg line has ended. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> your gift bags at the coat check." [...] In [...] "Black Tie", Rosellini played Bianca, the ex-wife of Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Rosellini would make a second appearance in the February 8, 2007, episode [...] "Up All Night". Comedian actor Will Forte, who played Tomas, the messenger of Prince Gerhardt, has appeared in the main cast of Saturday Night Live (SNL), a weekly sketch comedy series which airs on NBC in the United States. Fey was the head writer on SNL from 1999 until 2006.|$|E
2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Liu {{awarded the}} game a B, praising the {{graphics}} {{and variety of}} gameplay, but finding the game became somewhat repetitive towards the end; [...] "Dark Cloud 2 is very serial in nature. It's a game <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> and play for a few hours, stomping though a few dungeon floors, trying {{to solve a problem}} or two, but after a while it meanders towards repetition. In truth, the game is filled with innumerable challenges, likable characters and a high production value. But beneath the surface, the lightweight story and characters combined with the almost rigidly episodic game flow still hold it back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 5 out of 10, arguing of the trust/fear system [...] "it {{is nowhere near}} {{as much of a}} neat {{gameplay}} innovation as the hype had some people believe [...] As a squad based game it would work far better if you ever had to care a great deal for anyone's survival. As it is, most of the team seem to split off once a level's over (or turn into aliens at pre-determined moments during it), so you're left merely using each NPC as a means of progression." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, which he argued [...] "look old school, with bad texturing, uninteresting particle effects, and vanilla architecture." [...] He concluded [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> The Thing cheap you won't be too disappointed; it's by no means a bad game, but it's all the more disappointing thanks {{to the fact that it}} could and should have been brilliant." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} officer, [...] "it {{seems to me}} I had better get you sent back to your old station, where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> quietly <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> the threads again. Would the trooper you {{mentioned}} be fit {{to keep an eye}} on things at Silverdale?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Jacinta, sweetly, [...] "will be your business. You are {{a friend}} of Don Fernando, and he has really a {{comfortable}} house.

5000|$|And {{perhaps even}} more interesting, there are fake Keatings. The 2005 Guardian article states, [...] "Dodgy {{paintings}} in Keating's original style, proudly bearing what-looks-like his signature, are finding {{their way into the}} market. If they manage to fool, they can claim £5,000 to £10,000. But if uncovered they are virtually worthless, much like Keating's 20 years ago. If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> them <b>up</b> for next to nothing, they may be a better investment than an original Keating counterfeit." ...|$|R

5000|$|... 1UP.com's Chris Pereira stated [...] "the music does become grating as {{you play}} (if you play {{for long enough}} in one sitting), and the {{standard}} levels can be too easy and ask too little of you at times. But the game is made so well for the platform -- <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up,</b> play a level, {{and go back to}} what you were doing 30 seconds later, or sit there for an hour -- that it's not difficult to look past those issues." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zach for Alpha Omega News {{told that}} [...] "Scarecrow, while not perfect, shows the band {{sticking}} to their guns and delivering another high-energy rock album {{as well as}} taking {{a step or two}} into new directions. Although it may suffer for some in the area of replayability (due to the simplicity of some of its tracks), there are also moments where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on the improvements they’ve made since the last record." [...] At Alt Rock Live, Jonathan Faulkner felt that [...] "All in all Scarecrow could have been a lot better considering the bands track record." ...|$|R

Mitchell reveals her purpose on lines such as, [...] "And I'm sending you out this signal here, I hope <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> it <b>up</b> loud and clear". She believed that including words in the song about radio themes would convince stations to play the recording. The song was recorded in preparation for Mitchell's upcoming fifth studio album in Hollywood, California, United States at A&M Studios. Although Graham Nash, David Crosby, and Neil Young all contributed to the recording session for the song, only the harmonica piece performed by Graham Nash was included on the official release.|$|R

Now do you hasten home; get what <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> in the way of an outfit; borrow your father's gun, and kind of mention the fact to your mother that the more she gives in the way of provisions the better you'll be fed, for you an' me are likely to mess together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I said I'd do," [...] responded Dunn savagely. [...] "I don't want {{five minutes}} to do it in, either; we'll be half an hour ahead of that d----d fool, whoever he is.
