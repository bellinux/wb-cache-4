40|$|This {{graduation}} {{project is}} a design for an Islamic community centre and prayerspace in New York City, called Park 51. The design is an 80 meter high complex surrounded by buildings on three sides. The front facade is situated at a small street in downtown Manhattan (Park Place 51), two blocks remote from Ground Zero. It houses various rooms for lectures, performances, exhibitions, sports, a library and a restaurant that are elevated above the open-air ground floor. The prayerspace is situated sub-level below the entrance with a lighttower that bursts {{up out of the}} ground to get light insight and makes the prayerspace visible from the street. Besides the design project, research into Ornamentum (ornamentation and decoration) has been done as part of the graduation. This has resulted in a categorization and a thesis as uploaded in this repository. ========== Unless otherwise indicated, all materials on these pages are copyrighted by Friso Gouwetor.

40|$|Dear reader, My {{thesis is}} a {{reflection}} of my internship from August until the end of December 2007 at EDU-ART, an organisation for culture education (office: Arnhem). This internship was my Final Project for my Master Renaissance Studies. What did I do at EDU-ART? A castle, called Kasteel Huis Bergh, asked EDU-ART to help developing an educational programme for children {{in the first two years}} of secondary school. The programme should be about the portrait collection of Huis Bergh. So I was asked to develop this programme from the orientation phase until the production and test phase. I talked with the personnel of Huis Bergh, with teachers and with my colleagues. In this way I could develop a programme that satisfied Huis Bergh, EDU-ART ánd the children! My reflection contains several documents. The description of every file explains which part of the reflection this file contains. I couldn't publish the programme itself here. So if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> you can always send an e-mail to info@edu-art. eu and ask your question. You may mention my name. Succes with your thesis or final project!

Thus {{you could say that}} the translation industry in Denmark - and consequently also in Norway - began with the “Sound Dues”, a special toll levied on alle ships passing through the Sound between Denmark and Sweden (then Denmark), with Hamlet’s Elsinore being a major easy-to-guard traffic junction for international shipping at that time. The “Translation Office” associated with the “Sound Dues” continued to exist until 1857. Today certification – or authorization – as a translator and interpreter is administered by the Danish government and is granted to persons who have successfully completed in-depth translation studies at either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business. Studies in English, French, German, Spanish and, to a limited extent, Italian and Russian are offered by the two business schools as full-time programs. The present training structure for these languages is three years for the bachelor’s degree and another two years for the master’s degree – the last two years being devoted to specialization in core subjects such as legal language, technical language, economics, accounting, banking and finance and interpretation skills both into and from Danish. Authorization is granted to these candidates after they have obtained the degree of cand. ling. merc. (MA) in translation and interpretation from either the Copenhagen Business School (CBS) or the Århus School of Business. In languages other than those mentioned above, the candidates may register for a special translator’s examination, which is administered by CBS. This is an option used by foreigners in Denmark who want to perform certified translations into and from their mother tongue, but also by Danes who want to obtain authorization to perform certified translations into and from these languages. The requirements of this special examination do not differ much from the requirements applying to the main languages mentioned above, a major difference, however, being the fact that no structured training is available, i. e. the candidates are more or less left to study on their own. Dictionaries and other aids are allowed, and so is the use of computer.

The notion of price is ill-defined: the website www. bestbookbuys. com gives a range of prices from place to puchase books on the web. (amazon. com is usually not the cheapest, and its usually not even close.). Providing ISBN numbers is also not needed in this electronic age where such information {{is available at the}} touch of a button. If the price is notable – either rather high or rather low, this might be mentioned in the review. Welcome to the Book Reviews Column. We hope to bring you at least two reviews of books every month. In this column four books are reviewed. 1. Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (2 nd ed) by Michael T Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia. Review by Hassan Masum. This is a textbook for a sophmore course on data structures and algorithms using Java as its base language.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore—from a {{managerial}} perspective—how IT-enabled change is designed, led, and sustained from-within an organisation. This {{is an issue of}} central concern because there is a considerable lack of research that directly incorporates IT in management and organisational change studies. In addition, earlier research has recurrently focused on abstract theorising, aggregated perspectives, and exploring organisational change from the outside, from-without. Consequently, the present body of research provides limited knowledge of how organisations in practice lead large-scale IT-enabled transformations. The thesis herein sets out to explore this question, and does so by following the change designers and agents of the telecommunications company Ericsson, that transformed its finance and accounting unit from a highly decentralised structure into a shared service centre structure (SSC) entitled: “The Global F&A Transformation Programme”. The formal transformation lasted three years, was enabled by an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and was driven in the majority of Ericsson’s sub-units situated in more than 140 countries. Theoretically, this thesis addresses the research question: how do actors and structures influence large-scale IT-enabled change? The principal finding of the thesis is a four-stage analytical framework built on the concepts of common ground, common meaning, common interest, and common behaviour: The Commonality Framework for IT-enabled Change. The value of the framework is that it depicts the interplay between actors and structures on a micro-level. In doing so, the framework explains the different levels of complexity in a transformation and how they require different structures to be used, different activities to be performed, different skills to be applied, and different roles to be played. The framework can be used by both academics and practitioners to develop, assess, and improve IT-enabled change projects. In a broader perspective, the findings further suggest that change comes about as an upward spiral, within which the moving targets of IT and organisation are intimately interconnected. This reciprocal interconnectedness between IT and organisation across time implies that if changes are done to technological properties, this necessitates changes to the organisational properties, and vice versa. Organisations at the hands-on-level more or less have to change {{to make use of the}} IT-enabled advantages. Thus, successful IT-enabled change is more than the technology artefact per se, and requires thoughtful attentiveness not only to the technological and material side, but also to the organisational, social and human side of change. The theoretical contribution of this thesis is the in-depth exposition of different aspects and interplays between the properties of actors and structures from-within the organisation. The empirical contribution is the description of how contemporary multinational organisations initiate, lead, and sustain large-scale IT-enabled change. The provided document is only the summary and introductory chapter of the thesis (i. e. excluding the five papers).
