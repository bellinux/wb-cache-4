5|$|Usually males, {{mainly in}} {{polygynous}} species, have shorter lifespans than females. This {{can be attributed}} to several reasons: early dispersal of <b>young</b> <b>males,</b> aggressive male-male fights, vulnerability to predation (particularly when males are less agile, as in kudu), and malnutrition (being large in size, the male body has high nutritional requirements which may not be satisfied). Richard Despard Estes suggested that females mimic male secondary sexual characteristics like horns to protect their male offspring from dominant males. This feature seems to have been strongly selected to prevent male mortality and imbalanced sex ratios due to attacks by aggressive males and forced dispersal of <b>young</b> <b>males</b> during adolescence.|$|E
5|$|For males, social {{structure}} {{changes can be}} seasonal. During the six-month period between December and May a few males immigrate between groups. Established males transfer on average every 3.5years, although <b>young</b> <b>males</b> may transfer approximately every 1.4 years. Group fission occurs when groups get too large and resources become scarce.|$|E
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and <b>young</b> <b>males</b> are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E

40|$|A {{preoperative}} {{diagnosis of}} solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPNs) in <b>young</b> <b>male</b> patients {{is difficult to}} achieve using radiological images. We herein present three cases of <b>young</b> <b>male</b> patients with relatively small SPNs. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed well-encapsulated, smooth-surfaced, heterogeneous solid lesions in all patients, and all preoperative diagnoses were achieved by EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA).

5|$|In both equine social systems, excess males {{gather in}} {{bachelor}} groups. These are typically <b>young</b> <b>males</b> {{who are not}} yet ready to establish a harem or territory. With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrus females and involve biting and kicking.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in the middle-aged or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in <b>young</b> <b>males</b> is second only to accidental death. In <b>young</b> <b>males</b> in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E

5|$|By 1954, the Comics Code Authority {{had been}} {{established}} in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) {{was responsible for the}} rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in <b>young</b> <b>males.</b> Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; <b>young</b> <b>males,</b> forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|Nestlings, fledglings, and juveniles have brown plumage and pink-brown {{bills with}} shorter tails than adults. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> develop blue tail {{feathers}} and darker bills by late summer or autumn (following a spring or summer breeding season), while young females develop light blue tails. By the subsequent spring, all males are fertile and have developed cloacal protuberances, which store sperm. In contrast, during the breeding season, fertile females develop oedematous brood patches, which are bare areas on their bellies.|$|E

5|$|The {{young are}} born blind, gaining sight after two weeks. Cubs are weaned at three months, but {{remain in the}} birth den for six months before leaving to {{accompany}} their mother on hunts. They will continue in their mother's company for {{one to two years}} before leaving to establish a territory for themselves. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> are at first nomadic, jostling with their older counterparts until they succeed in claiming a territory. Typical lifespan in the wild is estimated at around 12–15 years; in captivity, the jaguar lives up to 23 years, placing it among the longest-lived cats.|$|E
5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} to mark out their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{eight to}} nine months, {{following}} which a single calf or twins (even triplets at times) are born. In a 2004 {{study in the}} Sariska reserve, twins accounted for as high as 80 {{percent of the total}} calf population. Births peak from June to October in the Bharatpur National Park, and from April to August in southern Texas. Calves are precocial; they are able to stand within 40 minutes of birth, and forage by the fourth week. Pregnant females isolate themselves before giving birth. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves are kept in hiding for the first few weeks of their lives. This period of concealment can last as long as a month in Texas. Calves, mainly males, bicker playfully by neck-fighting. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> would leave their mothers at ten months to join bachelor groups. The lifespan of the nilgai is typically ten years in Texas.|$|E

5|$|The {{probability}} of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34%, with 69% of adults surviving {{from one year to}} the next. Mortality in <b>young</b> <b>males</b> is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years. This species {{is now one of the}} most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{secondary}} motive for men, especially <b>young</b> <b>males,</b> for learning the agung: the ability to interact with young, unmarried women. Both Maranao and Maguindanao cultures traditionally adhere to Islamic customs which prohibit dating or causal conversation between the opposite sexes (unless married to or related to by blood) and therefore performances such as kulintang music provided the opportunity for such a connection. Among the Maguindanao, the rhythmic modes of duyog and sinulog a kamamatuan allowed agung players to serenade the young, unmarried women on the kulintang. Tidto, the other rhythmic mode, {{could also be used}} but players rarely use this for serenading since the kulintang player is usually an older woman.|$|E
5|$|This gender {{discrepancy}} {{is often}} distorted in specific populations where rates of self-harm are inordinately high, {{which may have}} implications on the significance and interpretation of psychosocial factors other than gender. A study in 2003 found an extremely high prevalence of self-harm among 428 homeless and runaway youths (aged 1619) with 72% of males and 66% of females reporting a history of self-harm. However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of <b>young</b> <b>males</b> admitting to self-harm. Studies also indicate that males who self-harm may also be at {{a greater risk of}} completing suicide.|$|E

5|$|Troops are {{classified}} as multi-male groups, with a matriline as the core group. As with most lemurs, females socially dominate males in all circumstances, including feeding priority. Dominance is enforced by lunging, chasing, cuffing, grabbing and biting. Young females do not always inherit their mother's rank and <b>young</b> <b>males</b> leave the troop between three and five years of age. Both sexes have separate dominance hierarchies; females have a distinct hierarchy while male rank is correlated with age. Each troop has one to three central, high-ranking adult males who interact with females more than other group males and lead the troop procession with high-ranking females. Recently transferred males, old males or young adult males {{that have not yet}} left their natal group are often lower ranking. Staying at the periphery of the group they tend to be marginalized from group activity.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{previous}} taxation code, farmers {{were required to}} pay a tenth of their seasonal agricultural output, 1 ducat and 4 groshe (two-ninths of a ducat) to their lords. The Ottoman system aimed towards revenue increase to support military expenses, thus new taxes were imposed and existing ones were altered. In addition to 1/10 of agrarian production Muslim convert families were required to pay 22 akçe (~0.6 ducats) to the timar holders, while non-Muslim families had to pay 25 akçe (~0.7 ducats). Both groups were subject to additional taxes including the avarız, an annual cash tax that affected households registered to the cadasters. Non-Muslims were also required to pay 45 akçe (~1.3 ducats) {{as part of the}} jizya and had to supply regularly the Ottoman state with young recruits in accordance with the devşirme, which required the enlistment of <b>young</b> <b>males</b> in the Ottoman army and their conversion to Islam.|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} King Solomon's Ring, Konrad Lorenz {{described}} and analysed the complex social interactions {{in a western}} jackdaw flock that lived around his house in Altenberg, Austria. He ringed them for identification and caged them in the winter to prevent their annual migration. He found that the birds have a linear hierarchical group structure, with higher-ranked individuals dominating lower-ranked birds, and pair-bonded birds sharing the same rank. <b>Young</b> <b>males</b> establish their individual status before pairing with females. Upon pairing, the female assumes the same social position as her partner. Unmated females are the lowest members in the pecking order, and are the last {{to have access to}} food and shelter. Lorenz noted one case in which a male, absent during the dominance struggles and pair bondings, returned to the flock, became the dominant male, and chose one of two unpaired females for a mate. This female immediately assumed a dominant position in the social hierarchy and demonstrated this by pecking others. According to Lorenz, the most significant factor in social behaviour was the immediate and intuitive grasp of the new hierarchy by each of the western jackdaws in the flock.|$|E

40|$|The {{habit of}} smoking white {{cigarettes}} and clove cigarettes {{may affect the}} gustatory function, that is, it will cause damage to taste buds, resulting {{in an increase in}} gustatory threshold. This research used the descriptive comparative method and had the purpose of obtaining an illustration of gustatory threshold and compare gustatory threshold in white cigarette smokers and clove cigarette smokers in <b>young,</b> <b>male</b> adults. For gustatory threshold evaluation, the Murphy method was used to obtain a value for perception threshold and taste identification threshold using sucrose solution of 0. 0006 M- 0. 06 M concentration. Research results indicate that the perception threshold and identification threshold of <b>young,</b> <b>male</b> adult smokers are 0. 0119 M and 0. 0292 M. <b>Young,</b> <b>male</b> adult clove cigarette smokers have a perception threshold and identification threshold of 0. 0151 M and 0. 0348 M. The conclusion of this research is that the perception threshold of <b>young,</b> <b>male</b> adult white cigarette smokers and clove cigarette smokers are the same, whereas the identification threshold of <b>young,</b> <b>male</b> adult white cigarette smokers and clove cigarette smokers are different, that is, the identification threshold of clove cigarette smokers is higher than that of white cigarette smokers...|$|R
