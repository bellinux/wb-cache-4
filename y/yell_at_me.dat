500|$|During {{the height}} of the Daddies' popularity, Perry found the band's {{mainstream}} notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public.

During her time as a principal she produced the blog 100 School Demons: All the Things that Fascinate and Vex the Principal. On this blog Neville adapts an ancient Japanese drawing exercise in which an artist attempts to illustrate 100 demons.

5000|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "its not our mission to be a swing band. Im not a guy from the 40s. Thats why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I cant fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that were contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows whod like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. Were trying to find the audience wholl let us write songs and just be who we are". [...] "I figured the swing scene would be a hybrid of The Clash and The Cotton Club...but then when other bands did swing music, they did a kind of 50s version. They kept it very clean and vanilla. Most {{of it has to do}} with nice people having manners and dressing up. Thats not what we wanted. We wanted to be The Rolling Stones of swing, not The Beatlesof swing". 2016 During the height of the Daddies popularity, Perry found the bands mainstream notoriety was causing an alienating effect on his personal life, claiming it to have negatively changed his relationships with friends and even subjected him to occasional heckling from strangers who recognized him in public. He would later recall, [...] "Its a total cliché, but fame doesnt make you happy. Theres a lot missing. Success has given people the right to <b>yell</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> on the street, but I dont really feel like its given me any dignity". Already feeling burnt out from the Daddies constant touring, Perrys frustration was only exacerbated by the medias persistent dismissal of the Daddies as a retro novelty act, though he later claimed to have felt pressured to maintain the image due to audience and media expectations. When the band began to face criticism and accusations of selling out from their Northwest fanbase, the Daddies fought to further push themselves away from their mainstream typecasting: in a 1999 interview, responding to their place in the swing scene, Perry retorted [...] "well unapologetically play ska right in the face of people who want to hear swing".|$|E

We have long understood the transition to adulthood in terms of adolescents undergoing a set of adulthood “events".
