25|$|To me {{the ideal}} film— which I've never succeeded in making— {{would be as}} though the reel were behind one's eyes and you were {{projecting}} it yourself, seeing what <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see. This {{has a great deal}} in common with thought processes... That's why I think the camera is an eye as well as a mind. Everything we do with the camera has physiological and mental significance.|$|E
25|$|From Gimingham {{the path}} heads towards Southrepps via a lane known as Jack o' Lantern’s Lane. The lane is {{reputed to be}} the {{territory}} of the Lantern man who lure’s all travellers to their doom. The parish church of Southrepps is called St James. Note the corbel’s and gargoyle’s high up on this church. At this point if <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> visit the church and village you must walk south into the village and then retrace your footsteps back to rejoin the Paston Way.|$|E
25|$|Students {{can also}} enter the school at sixth form level, {{though they do}} not have to take a test for this. Instead, places are awarded based on GCSE grades, {{requiring}} at least an A in any subject <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take, A* in Maths to take Further Maths, and a B in English and Maths if they do not already form part of your offer. Again, at this level places are highly competitive with students applying from all over Birmingham and the surrounding areas. There are approximately 50 external candidates in each year.|$|E

25|$|Two images Henri Bergson gave in {{his essay}} An Introduction to Metaphysics may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the {{absolute}} and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The {{same goes for the}} experience of reading a single line of Homer. If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.|$|E
500|$|The tenor recitative, [...] "" [...] (If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> {{be called}} God's child and Christ's brother), {{contains}} extended arioso passages, to stress [...] "" [...] (the Christians' crown and glory) [...] and [...] "" [...] (back the heavy stones of sin). The {{voice and the}} continuo are at times set in imitation, an image for the [...] (following), as they go together to express the unity achieved, on the words [...] "" [...] (so that He may unite Himself to you in faith).|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Why do <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> trouble yourself), is a chorale fantasia, {{with the}} vocal part {{embedded}} {{in an independent}} concerto of the instruments. The cantus firmus on the melody of [...] "" [...] is in long notes, partly embellished, in the soprano and horn; the lower voices are mostly set in homophony. The lines of the chorale are not rendered separately, but accenting the bar form (Stollen–Stollen–Abgesang) of the text, 1 and 2 are combined, 3 and 4 are combined, 5 is single and 6 to 8 are combined. The scoring is relatively rich in woodwinds.|$|E

500|$|In late 1898 Karim's {{purchase}} of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised; {{he had become a}} wealthy man. Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings: [...] "You have told the Queen that in India no receipts are given for money, and therefore you ought not to give any to Sir F Edwards [...] This is a lie and means that <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> cheat the Queen." [...] The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations, and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations, calling them [...] "shameful".|$|E
500|$|The cabinet {{clashed with}} Brătianu {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that it had been negotiating in secret with the disinherited Prince Carol (a traditional adversary of the PNL) as Ferdinand's health was taking {{a turn for the worse}} (Averescu later claimed that he had been asked by Brătianu: [...] "So, after I have brought you to power, <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> rise and dominate?"). The PNL withdrew its support, and, through an order signed by Constantin Hiott, Averescu's was replaced by the broad coalition government of Barbu Știrbey, Brătianu's brother-in-law. The general's deposition, confirmed by King Ferdinand on his deathbed, created a vacuum on the Right, soon filled by the Iron Guard, a fascist movement formed by Corneliu Zelea Codreanu (formerly an associate of Cuza's).|$|E
500|$|While Eddy {{argued that}} reality was entirely spiritual (and {{therefore}} entirely good), it remained true {{that human beings}} were affected by their belief in evil, which meant it had power, even if the power was an illusion. Evil was [...] "like a bankrupt to whom credit is still granted," [...] writes Wilson. To defend herself against it, Eddy organized [...] "watches," [...] during which students (known as mental or metaphysical workers) would give [...] "adverse treatment" [...] to her enemies. This was called [...] "taking up the enemy in thought." [...] According to former students, Eddy would tell them to say (often with Richard Kennedy in mind): [...] "You are affected as <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> affect me. Your evil thought reacts upon you," [...] then call Kennedy bilious, consumptive or poisoned by arsenic.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me. When {{you were}} a workman among workmen, did <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be their leader? When you were {{foremost}} among them, did <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be their master? If {{you were a}} master tradesman, would <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> lead and guide your brother tradesmen? Would you not desire wealth in order {{that you might be}} assisted by it in your views of ambition? If you were an alderman in your borough, would <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be the mayor? If mayor, would <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be its representative in Parliament? If in Parliament, would <b>you</b> not <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be heard there? Would you not then clothe yourself as those among whom you lived, eat as they ate, drink as they drank, keep their hours, fall into their habits, and be one of them? The theory of equality is very grand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I see!" [...] she cried. [...] "You are a man! But I can't forgive it,--no, I can't forgive it! <b>You</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> deceive her if <b>you</b> did n't <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> deceive me. How can you excuse {{yourself}} for repeating {{what you did}} n't believe?" ...|$|R

500|$|Since 533, the new {{pope has}} also decided on his regnal name. Pope John II {{was the first}} to adopt a new papal name; he felt that his {{original}} name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a Roman god. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: [...] "Quo nomine vis vocari? (By what name do <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be called?)" [...] After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.|$|E
500|$|John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at St. Mary, Whitechapel, {{the second}} son of Francis Cooke, an Admiralty clerk, {{and his wife}} Margaret. John Cooke first went to sea {{at the age of}} eleven aboard the cutter [...] under Lieutenant John Bazely, before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at Greenwich. He was entered onto the books of one of the royal yachts by Sir Alexander Hood, who would become an {{enduring}} patron of Cooke's. In 1776 he obtained a position as a midshipman on the ship of the line , aged thirteen. Cooke served aboard Eagle, the flagship of the North American Station, during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the Battle of Rhode Island in 1778, when Eagle was closely engaged with American units ashore. He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral Lord Howe to remark [...] "Why, young man, <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age." [...] On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to lieutenant and joined [...] in the East Indies under Sir Edward Hughes, but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.|$|E

2500|$|Baldric of Dol (c.1050 - 1130) abbot of Bourgueil and {{subsequently}} Bishop of Dol-en-Bretagne in France, wrote passionate letters {{to a man}} simply called [...] "Walter": [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> take up lodging with me, I will divide my hert and breast with you.
