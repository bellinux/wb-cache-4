5000|$|The {{musical score}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Chaz Kangas of City Pages wrote, [...] "Seemingly {{with a much}} bigger orchestra and undoubtedly more resources to play with, one cant help but marvel at Mad Max 2s music.

5000|$|The {{show has}} been criticised for its {{negative}} and stereotypical representation of Essex, {{and there have}} been a number of complaints to ITV2. Some Essex residents felt it was not a true representation of the area and the people who live there. Kirk Norcross responded to this criticism by saying, [...] "We are all from Essex, so this is Essex. Its not acting. Its not like theyve got people from America and said Right, act like you think you know where Essex is. We are Essex people so what <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> is Essex." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Lauria {{appeared}} as Vince Lombardi in the Broadway play Lombardi. The play received positive reviews, with sports writer Jim Hague commenting, [...] "Lauria truly becomes Vince Lombardi. You almost forget <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> an actor. Hes Lombardi through and through, {{down to the}} wire-framed glasses and intimidating scowl." [...] North Bergen football coach Vince Ascolese, who met Lombardi, commented [...] "I really {{felt like he was}} Lombardi. It was uncanny." [...] Laurias portrayal of Lombardi was used during the NFL on FOX introduction to Super Bowl XLV, where the Green Bay Packers, the team Lombardi coached to victories in the first two Super Bowls in 1967 and 1968, defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers.|$|R
5000|$|In the San Francisco Chronicle, Edward Guthmann commended Pfeiffer and Jackson but was {{ultimately}} unimpressed: [...] "Pfeiffer, who segued into mother roles in her past two films, One Fine Day and A Thousand Acres, brings {{heart and soul}} to this domestic melodrama, but its not enough. The Deep End of the Ocean has nothing but the noblest of intentions, and Grosbards direction is meticulous, sober and tasteful, but the movie is so deliberate, so enervated that {{you feel as if}} <b>youre</b> <b>watching</b> it through glass... In a difficult role that he doesnt quite pull off, Ryan Merriman plays Sam, the 12-year-old whose allegiance is split between two homes. As his damaged older brother, Jonathan Jackson brings such confidence, maturity and self-possession that he seems to belong in another movie. And Whoopi Goldberg - all-purpose, you-got-a-part-Ill-play-it Whoopi - shows up as a helpful detective named Candy Bliss." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{conditions}} impacting fans' preference for watching their most disliked team and their favourite team. Previous work found that National Football League fans clearly preferred <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> favourite team, but only preferred <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> disliked team when it was a threat to the favourite. Using the Psychological Commitment to Team (PCT) scale to segment National Basketball Association fans, the current study found both high and low PCT fans preferred <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> disliked team when it was a threat to the favourite team. However, only high PCT fans preferred <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> disliked team when it was likely to lose. Finally, high PCT fans were more likely to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> favourite team regardless of the conditions, while low PCT fans were significantly less likely to <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> favourite team when it was likely to lose. ...|$|R
