40|$|Chemical-physical properties, colour parame ters, {{antioxidant}} activities (AA), carotenoid and polyphenol levels (CL) {{in seven}} cultivars of yellow flesh peaches, five cultivars of <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>nectarines</b> and one cultivar of white flesh nectarines at harvest time and after 7 days of cold storage were evaluated. Peaches had major variability in flesh firmness (FF) and titratable acidity (TA) and lower soluble solid concentration (SSC) than nectarines. Evaluation of ground colour parameters, a*, b* and L*, showed that nectarines had a yellow-orange hue with high lightness, while peaches were darker, tending to red-green. Hydrophilic, lipophilic antioxidant activities of extracts (W-AA and L-AA), carotenoids and polyphenols levels (CL and PL) were evaluated and their relation with commercial maturation. The average of W-AA at harvest time was 11. 0 TEAC, while the L-AA values at harvest time was on average higher in peaches (2. 0 TEAC) than in nectarines (1. 3 TEAC). 'The yellow flesh had higher amounts of total carotenoids (182. 45 ug/l 00 g fw for peaches and 117. 37 ug/ 100 g fw for <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh</b> <b>nectarines).</b> During cold storage, W-AA increased for nectarines (+ 22. 9 % in yellow flesh and + 19. 2 % in white flesh) and peaches {{as well as}} polyphenolic compounds (+ 13. 37 %) while, contents of carotenoids decreased (- 8. 7 %) ...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{transfer}} protein (LTP, Pru p 3) is {{the major}} allergen of peach (Prunus persica), much more present in the peel than in the pulp of the fruit. Peel LTP is more allergenic than pulp LTP, {{but it is not}} clear whether this is due to its specific allergenic properties or to its higher concentration. In this study, we have used a new one-step, rapid procedure for the purification of LTP from peel and pulp of four peach varieties [Gladys (white <b>flesh),</b> California (<b>nectarine</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh),</b> Plusplus (<b>yellow</b> <b>flesh),</b> Red Fair (<b>nectarine</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>flesh)</b> ] harvested in a field grown in Southern Italy. Purification was based on miniature reversed-phase chromatography, a procedure suitable for proteomic study. Proteomic analysis of purified LTPs revealed that the amino acid sequence of LTP was identical in all peach genotypes but, for the first time, peel LTP was found to be methylated...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{in growth}} {{required}} nutrient, {{sources of energy}} and special environment conditions in growth. The media which often used in growth of bacteria was NA media. Costly NA encourage the researcher to find the media from easily material, cheap, {{and there was a}} source of nutrients for the growth of bacteria such as cassava, white and <b>yellow</b> <b>fleshed</b> sweet potatoes with high carbohydrate as a source of carbon for bacterial growth. This research was an experimental study using two factor of completely randomized design (CDR).

Inoculation used streak plate method which incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours.
