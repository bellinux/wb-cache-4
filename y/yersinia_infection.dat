40|$|Understanding of the {{aetiological}} {{basis of}} thyroid autoimmunity may {{be gained by}} studying {{the early stages of}} the disease process. We aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between thyroid antibody status and Yersinia enterocolitica (YE) infection in euthyroid subjects and (2) explore the relative importance of genetic and environmental risk factors in the acquisition of YE infection. The association between thyroid antibody status and YE infection was explored using a case–control design. Furthermore, thyroid antibody-positive twins were compared with their thyroid antibody-negative co-twin. In 468 twins, IgA and IgG antibodies to virulence-associated outer-membrane proteins (YOPs) of YE were measured. Of these, 147 were thyroid antibody-positive (cases). A total of 147 age- and gender-matched twins were chosen as controls. The prevalence of YOP antibodies was lower among thyroid antibody-positive individuals than among controls. <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection</b> was not associated with a positive thyroid antibody status: the odds ratio (with 95 % CI) for YOP IgA-ab was 0 · 66 (0 · 42 – 1 · 05), P = 0 · 078 and for YOP IgG-ab it was 0 · 95 (0 · 60 – 1 · 50), P = 0 · 816. Within discordant twin pairs, the thyroid antibody-positive twin did not have an increased risk of <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection</b> compared to the thyroid antibody-negative co-twin [odds ratio: YOP IgA-Ab: 0 · 94 (0 · 49 – 1 · 83), P = 0 · 866, and YOP IgG-Ab: 1 · 35 (0 · 72 – 2 · 53), P = 0 · 345]; 41 % (95 % CI 10 – 67 % of the liability of being YOP antibody-positive was due to genetic effects.

The recomB lot western blot assay based on five recombinantly produced Yersinia Outer Proteins (Yap) is well evaluated for human Yersiniosis and proved to be also valuable {{for the detection of}} porcine anti-Yap antibodies. 970 out of 1014 meat juice samples collected in 145 Bavarian pig farms contained anti-Yap antibodies. As other animal pathogens like Salmonella express the proteins of secretion apparatus III as well, we propose that only blots with three and more detectable signals should be considered as positive.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the method of indirect hemagglutination Yersinia and pseudotuberculosis diagnosis.

Neutralization of TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma had comparable effects, suggesting that cell-mediated host responses including activated macrophages are required for control of yersiniae in intestinal tissues. The number of Mac- 1 + cells in PP and MLN increased after <b>yersinia</b> <b>infection,</b> and recruitment of these cells was not blocked by administration of anticytokine or anti-integrin antibodies. While anti-VLA- 4, -TNF-alpha, or -IFN-gamma antibody treatment caused an increased dissemination of yersiniae from PP to the spleen systemic dissemination was reduced by anti-Mac- 1 antibodies. The results of this study suggest that the cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha as well as the integrins Mac- 1 and VLA- 4 are involved in protective cellular host defense mechanisms in PP and MLN against Y. enterocolitica, the latter probably being involved in both cell-cell and cell-pathogen interactions...|$|E

40|$|In industrialized {{countries}} bacterial intestinal infections are commonly caused by enteropathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. The {{interaction of the}} microbiota with the host immune system determines the adequacy of an appropriate response against pathogens. In this study we addressed whether the probiotic Bifidobacterium adolescentis is protective during intestinal Yersinia enterocolitica infection. Female C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed with B. adolescentis, infected with Yersinia enterocolitica, or B. adolescentis fed and subsequently infected with Yersinia enterocolitica. B. adolescentis fed and Yersinia infected mice were protected from <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection</b> as indicated by a significantly reduced weight loss and splenic Yersinia load when compared to Yersinia infected mice. Moreover, protection from infection was associated with increased intestinal plasmacytoid dendritic cell and regulatory T-cell frequencies.

The B. adolescentis-mediated protection from Yersinia dissemination to the spleen was abrogated after plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion indicating a crucial function for pDC in control of intestinal <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection.</b> We suggest that feeding of B. adolescentis modulates the intestinal immune system in terms of increased plasmacytoid dendritic cell and regulatory T-cell frequencies, which might account for the B. adolescentis-mediated protection from Yersinia enterocolitica infection...|$|E
40|$|Pathogenic organisms express {{virulence}} {{factors that}} can inhibit immune signaling pathways. Thus, the immune system is {{faced with the challenge}} of eliciting an effective inflammatory response to pathogens that actively suppress inflammation. The mechanisms that regulate this response are largely undefined. Here, I used the gram-negative extracellular bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis to investigate anti-pathogen responses, as the Yersinia virulence factor YopJ blocks NF-κB and MAPK signaling, resulting in reduced cytokine production and target cell death. I set out to first, determine the molecular mechanism of Yersinia-mediated cell death and second, examine the impact of cell death on immune responses in vivo. Multiple caspases are activated during <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection,</b> including caspase- 1, which regulates pyroptosis, and caspase- 3 and - 8, which elicit apoptosis. I found that caspase- 8 and receptor-interacting protein kinase- 3 (RIPK 3), RIPK 1 and FADD are required for Yersinia -induced cell death. My studies also showed that caspase- 8 is required for the activation of caspase- 1 and - 3 during <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection.</b> Interestingly, mice lacking caspase- 8 were severely susceptible to <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infection</b> and had defective pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These findings highlight a possible mechanism of immune defense that can overcome pathogen inhibition of cell-intrinsic pro-inflammatory immune responses. ^ Caspases are proteases that are best characterized for their abilities to regulate apoptotic or pyroptotic cell death programs, both of which are critical for the proper operation of the mammalian immune system. Within this family of proteins is caspase- 8, which is unusual as it can promote both cell death, and inflammatory gene expression induced by Toll-like Receptors. How these two dichotomous outcomes occur independently of the other, is mysterious. Using mice that specifically ablate caspase- 8 auto-processing, I have demonstrated that caspase- 8 enzymatic, but not autoprocessing activity, mediates induction of inflammatory cytokines by a wide variety of TLR stimuli. Since uncleaved caspase- 8 functions together with its homolog, cFLIP, our findings implicate the activity of a caspase- 8 /cFLIP heterodimer in control of inflammatory cytokines during microbial infection, and provide new mechanistic insight into how caspase- 8 regulates gene expression. ...|$|E
50|$|Human <b>Yersinia</b> <b>infections</b> most {{commonly}} {{result from the}} bite of an infected flea or occasionally an infected mammal, but like most bacterial systemic diseases, the disease may be transmitted through {{an opening in the}} skin or by inhaling infectious droplets of moisture from sneezes or coughs. In both cases septicemic plague need not be the result, and in particular, not the initial result, but it occasionally happens that bubonic plague for example leads to infection of the blood, and septicemic plague results. If the bacteria happen to enter the bloodstream rather than the lymph or lungs, they multiply in the blood, causing bacteremia and severe sepsis. In septicemic plague, bacterial endotoxins cause disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), where tiny blood clots form throughout the body, commonly resulting in localised ischemic necrosis, tissue death from lack of circulation and perfusion.|$|R
