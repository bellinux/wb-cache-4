500|$|Kills {{revealed}} to Elle that the songwriting process for [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was difficult, {{as she had}} to confront memories and feelings. She further explained that, to her, {{it felt like a}} [...] "confession". This song was deemed by Kills as her life's soundtrack: [...] "When I was almost 14, I left home, got a job, and thought I {{was going to be a}} big TV star. I was determined to prove myself. I kept telling myself, 'I'm going to be fine,' even when I wasn't—especially when I didn't even believe it. The song is about carrying on, even though <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> can't. It's about feeling OK when everything is not." [...] She later reiterated those sentiments with website Digital Spy, and stated that it would show people what she truly was and what she had gone through over the years.|$|E
500|$|In a {{behind the}} scenes video, Beyoncé {{revealed}} the reason behind naming the fragrance Heat. According to her, {{it was because the}} scent comes off as [...] "infectious", further elaborating: [...] "It's like something you can't get enough of. It's hot, it's sexy, it definitely makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> caught the fever." [...] She additionally stated that her favorite fragrance notes are red vanilla orchid, due to its [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "spicy" [...] smell, and honeysuckle, due to its [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] smell. She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now." [...] During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower. She further said that it was suitable for her alter ego Sasha Fierce as it was [...] "fiery".|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

2500|$|This [...] "opaque" [...] {{technique}} has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that when viewing a Godard film {{there are moments}} when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something and <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Jari Mäenpää began Wintersun in 2003 [...] "to make {{songs that}} make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are {{floating}} in space." [...] Mäenpää chose the name [...] "Wintersun" [...] {{from a list}} a friend had produced, later explaining, [...] "Winter reflects the cold and stormy side of the album and also the Finnish melancholy and magic. Sun {{is related to the}} 'universe, space and stars'-feel of the album, which is also strongly connected to the lyrics." [...] Although the songs that would appear on Wintersun had collectively been written between 1995 and 2004 (see each track's respective composition dates here), Mäenpää kept his songwriting efforts primarily focused on folk metal band Ensiferum, with whom he'd been playing since 1996.|$|E

2500|$|Jamie Todd Rubin, {{reviewing}} {{the issue of}} Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes [...] "f all the stories in the issue, de Camp’s is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are right there with the characters on their journey. Abou the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn’t think the ending {{lived up to the}} full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and just go on the wonderful journey through the African wilderness." ...|$|E

[...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "Jump Back" [...] in 1964, {{the hits}} dried up for several years, as Stax gave more {{attention}} to younger artists and musicians. [...] However, in 1970 he had another big hit with [...] "Do the Funky Chicken", which reached #5 on the R chart, #28 on the pop chart, and #18 in Britain where it was his only chart hit. [...] Thomas improvised the song while performing with Willie Mitchell's band at a club in Covington, Tennessee, including a spoken word section that he regularly used as a shtick as a radio DJ: [...] "Oh I feel so unnecessary - {{this is the kind}} of stuff that makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> wanna do something nasty, like waste some chicken gravy on your white shirt right down front." [...] The recording was produced by Al Bell and Tom Nixon, and used the Bar-Kays, featuring guitarist Michael Toles. [...] Thomas continued to work with Bell and Nixon as producers, and later in 1970 had his only [...] number 1 R hit, and his highest pop charting record, with another dance song, [...] "Do the Push and Pull". [...] A further dance-oriented release in 1971, [...] "The Breakdown", climbed to number 2 R and number 31 Pop. [...] In 1972, he featured in the Wattstax concert, and he had several further, less successful, hits before Stax collapsed in 1976.|$|E

2500|$|Ghostbusters: The Video Game was {{met with}} a {{generally}} positive reception. Greg Miller of IGN gave both the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions an 8.0 out of 10. Miller describes the game as a [...] "love letter to Ghostbusters fans", saying that it [...] "makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are really a Ghostbuster". He lauds the CGI cutscenes as a positive feature, but finds fault with stiff character animation and bad lip sync in the other cutscenes. Miller gave the Wii version a 7.8 out of 10. Unlike Miller, fellow reviewer Matt Casamassina believed that the aiming system in Ghostbusters {{was better than the}} aiming system in Resident Evil 4. PSM3 gave the game a score of 85 out of 100, stating that the game was [...] "too short, but packed with quality and imagination." [...] The A.V. Club gave the game a B-, concluding that [...] "It’s the best Ghostbusters game of all time, though that really isn’t saying much." [...] Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot rated the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions of the game a 7.5 out of 10, listing the ghost-trapping gameplay and multiplayer mode as positives and frustrating spots in the game and repetitive gameplay as negatives. He also reviewed the Wii version and gave it an 8 out of 10 stating that [...] "Ghostbusters is such riotous fun that you'll forgive its short length." ...|$|E

500|$|During casting of the film, Wong sought {{actors who}} were able to portray the main {{characters}} as heroic individuals with realistic qualities. This sentiment was also echoed by Perry, who stated that for the two lead characters, he and Wong sought actors who [...] "had the charisma of movie stars, but weren't so ridiculously rarified that <b>you</b> couldn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> might know them". The casting of the supporting characters was given equal weight, being considered of equal importance with the casting of the main characters.|$|R

They paid our check at the bank in silver--a thousand dollars in a sack. We loaded it in our wagon and drove east a hundred miles before we recovered our presence of intellect.
