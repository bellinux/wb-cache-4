5|$|Man of Iron (1981) {{is another}} Andrzej Wajda {{film about the}} Solidarity movement. The main character, a <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> Maciej Tomczyk (Jerzy Radziwiłowicz) is {{involved}} in the anti-Communist labor movement. Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wałęsa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the Palme d'Or and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the Cannes Film Festival for the film. In 1982 it was nominated for Oscar as the Best Foreign Language Film and gained seven other awards and nominations.|$|E
25|$|Rushmore {{continued}} {{as a reporter}} for the Mexico Intelligencer. On January 12, 1931, Rushmore witnessed the lynching of Raymond Gunn in Maryville, Missouri. The African American suspect was seized from the local sheriff and doused with gasoline atop a roof and set aflame, while several thousands watched. The event made an indelible mark on the 17-year-old, who, even {{at the height of his}} anti-communist career, would maintain Gunn's complete innocence. The Communist Party USA in Kansas City organized an anti-lynch committee led by Abner Berry, a party organizer in Harlem during the 1940s. Rushmore was impressed by the bravery and anti-racist stance of the communists. Through the committee, Rushmore met Jack Conroy, editor of The Anvil, a communist literary magazine. Conroy encouraged Rushmore's literary ambitions by suggesting he submit short stories. By April 1935 Rushmore had become an associate editor of the magazine. Later that year, Rushmore joined the Young Communist League USA in St Louis, despite having neither a technical knowledge of Marxist philosophy nor its history. This lifelong ignorance would hamper his authority as a professional communist and anti-communist as critics would question his qualifications on the subject. He organized farmers in the Dakotas and Iowa, then Conroy sent him to New York City in May 1935, where he attended the American Writers Congress. There he was asked to join the editorial staff of the <b>Young</b> <b>Worker,</b> the organ of the Young Communist League. Taking advantage of his perceived all-American background, the CPUSA rapidly promoted Rushmore. All staff members of the <b>Young</b> <b>Worker</b> were assigned to a political unit of the Young Communist League. Rushmore belonged to the Harlem unit, where he met Ruby Bates, a recent recruit to the League. Bates was one of the two plaintiffs of the Scottsboro Boys case, who later tried to recant her original testimony during the Patterson trial.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>young</b> <b>worker</b> {{leaves the}} nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies {{back and forth to the}} nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a model of abusive {{leadership}} as experienced by <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> Abusive leadership is understood to be subjective and as such this research seeks to explore the experience of abusive leadership through a qualitative approach. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on interviews with 30 <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> who identified themselves as having a “bad” boss, this study employs a constructivist grounded theory approach in order to identify behaviours, moderators and outcomes of abusive leadership. Findings – A definition and model of abusive leadership as experienced by <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is proposed. The model details 11 behaviours, five moderators and six individual and two organizational outcomes of abusive leadership. Originality/value – The adoption of a constructivist grounded theory approach reveals several unique factors that moderate the relationship between behaviors and outcomes of abusive leadership in <b>young</b> <b>workers.</b> By grounding the model in the actual experiences of <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> the paper offers possibilities for future research on abusive leadership and <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and across demographic groups...|$|R
2500|$|Haim Arlosoroff {{was born}} in Romny, Ukraine on February 23, 1899. In Ukraine, {{he was known as}} Vitaly, the Russian {{equivalent}} of Haim. When living in Germany, he was known as Viktor. Arlosoroff's paternal grandfather was Rabbi Eliezer Arlosoroff of Romny, an author of religious commentaries on the Talmud. At the age of six, Arlosoroff encountered anti-Semitism for the first time. In 1905, the Arlosoroff family home in Romny was attacked during a violent pogrom. The family fled across the German border to East Prussia. Seven years later the family settled in Königsberg, Germany. Arlosoroff thus became fluent in German, in addition to studying Hebrew with a tutor. When World War I began in 1914, the family did not have German citizenship and were threatened with deportation. The family eventually obtained permission to move to Berlin. When his father, Saul, returned to Ukraine on business, he was barred from returning and died there of cholera. Arlosoroff studied economics at the University of Berlin and obtained a doctorate in that subject. During his studies, he wrote articles on Zionist affairs. In Germany, he became a key leader of Ha-Po'el ha-Tza'ir, ("The <b>Young</b> <b>Worker</b> Party"), a political party which attracted many of the intellectuals of the time. As a result of his party affiliation, Arlosoroff was appointed editor of [...] "Die Arbeit", a journal in which his writings were first published.|$|E

40|$|The IMF crisis {{which started}} late in 1997 caused massive {{unemployment}} in Korea. The crisis placed a high toll on <b>young</b> <b>workers,</b> especially on those at age between 25 and 29. However, {{even after the}} crisis, the high unemployment rate of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> persisted. This study addresses the issue of high unemployment of younf workers in Kora. It argues that the Human capital theory(Becker, 1975) and Institutional Theory(Coase, 1965 North, 1996) based on the Neo-classical economic perspective can offer only limited explanations on the unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. But, the New institutionalism Analysis(Granovetter, 1985 Kim Hae-dong, 1995) perpective which focuses on the socio-cultural and institutional aspects provides a better explanation for high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in Korea. The recently observed high unemployment of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> is not a cyclical unemployment, which should wither away if the economy picks up.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, governments across Canada {{have responded to}} the {{specific}} problem of workplace injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> through an increased emphasis on consciousness raising media programs, education and training. This shift in attention was motivated by research evidence on the higher rates of injuries among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (Breslin and Smith 2005; Breslin et al, 2007; Wegman and Davis, 1999; Salminen, 2004), the higher costs associated with compensating disabled <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and the efforts of unions and other activists (often the parents of children killed on the job) to bring more attention to the issue. While compensation statistics in Ontario and elsewhere suggest a general decline in injury rates, including a decline among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> (WSIB, 2007), the evidence also indicates that the drop has been slower among <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and that they continue to have higher rates of injuries than older workers (Breslin et al., 2006 b). Although some of the existing literature indicates that <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> are more reluctant to report injuries and unsafe working conditions, relatively little research has been conducted on the reasons for under-reporting.

Aim: This research aimed to include the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> and other stakeholders in the development of a strategy for action for South Australia. Methods: engagement: hearing the voice of <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in the development of the youth work health and safety strategy. We used a mixed methods approach that included a combination of quantitative methods (online survey of young workers’ WHS knowledge) and qualitative methods (interviews, focus groups, online survey of young workers’ stories, program analysis, future inquiry workshop). We relied on snowballing and a strong social media presence to reach <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> so that we could include their voice in the research. We also heard from key stakeholders, the social partners, to canvass their opinions and ideas. We used statistics and thematic analysis to determine our findings. Results: We identified eight areas for action: the psychosocial working environment; the physical working environment; precarious work and work/life balance; fatigue; training and education of young workers; training and education of employers; the need to hear the voice of young workers; and the obstacles faced by employers. We organized these into four key strategic actions: health and well-being; education, training and skill development; engagement and participation; and better connections. Conclusion: The Strategy for Youth Work Health and Safety for South Australia was adopted by the regulator and State government and launched in November 2013. It provides a road map for collaborative change in South Australia that will potentially lead to significant improvements in youth WHS and will help achieve the goal of healthy, safe, fair and productive lives for <b>young</b> <b>workers</b> in South Australia...|$|R
