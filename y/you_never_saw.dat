[...] <b>You</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a killer. [...] And they liked that idea and they said, 'Okay. Go write it.' Once we had a basic story, I started {{cataloging}} the strange coincidences in my own life. [...] For example, I was in the Vancouver airport waiting for a flight when John Denver came on over the loudspeaker. I remember saying to myself, 'Hey, he just {{died in a plane crash}} – that's a little weird.' [...] We wrote that version of that experience into the script." ...|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about the}} scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in [...] "In the Blood", DeKnight noted that series like Spartacus and The Walking Dead would have shown the head being crushed, which he felt was [...] "the right choice" [...] for them, but for Daredevil [...] "we did very much a Psycho thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the car door {{crushing}} his head....Sound effects, absolutely. It’s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal." ...|$|E
500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as it was a few years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E

500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back home I couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E
500|$|Mike Higgins of The Independent {{deemed the}} episode [...] "a {{technical}} triumph", praising the [...] "smooth, almost flawless" [...] and [...] "fluent" [...] production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph {{also called the}} episode a [...] "triumph", opining {{that it could not}} possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders [...] "an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction". He summarised: [...] "the story gripped so well you forgot to look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement that <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> coming amid all of the hype." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable", calling the episode [...] "a triumph of logistics over logic". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the [...] "damp-squib" [...] ending, [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was [...] "surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like self." [...] She felt that transmitting live [...] "added a tangible layer of tension" [...] to proceedings, lamenting: [...] "If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time." [...] The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for [...] "tension, not clarity", commenting that bookmakers would be [...] "absolutely delighted" [...] with the outcome, but that viewers would be [...] "incredulous". [...] Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as [...] "30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint", and highlighting the [...] "ropey lighting and poor sound effects." ...|$|E

[...] Casement then added how assailants would [...] "bring down a dwarf on the way home, for the marital cooking pot... The Dwarfs, as I say, dispense with cooking pots and eat and drink their human prey fresh cut on the battlefield while the blood is still warm and running.

2500|$|Ms. Splosion Man was {{announced}} December 3, 2010 via {{a press release}} and teaser trailer. [...] "I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something {{we really wanted to}} do, and that is why <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have had the time to add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM," [...] stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. [...] The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac-Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. [...] Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. [...] He stated the goal was to ensure that the game [...] "stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail [...] "sequels" [...] can be a lot of the time." [...] The game runs on Twisted Pixel's BEARD engine, which has been used to power all of their titles.|$|E
