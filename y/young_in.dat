5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating evanescent modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and <b>Young</b> <b>in</b> 1966. Since then, evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E

5|$|Duncan's reign was not {{successful}} {{and he was}} killed by Macbeth on 15 August 1040. Although Shakespeare's Macbeth presents Malcolm as a grown man and his father as an old one, it appears that Duncan was still <b>young</b> <b>in</b> 1040, and Malcolm and his brother Donalbane were children. Malcolm's family did attempt to overthrow Macbeth in 1045, but Malcolm's grandfather Crínán of Dunkeld was killed in the attempt.|$|E

5|$|One temnospondyl, the dvinosaur Trimerorhachis, {{may have}} brooded <b>young</b> <b>in</b> an {{area between the}} gills called the {{pharyngeal}} pouch.

The living Darwin's Frog is also a mouth brooder and would be the closest modern analogue to Trimerorhachis if it cared for its <b>young</b> <b>in</b> this way. An alternative possibility is that Trimerorhachis was cannibalistic, eating its young like many amphibians do today. If this was the case, the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the pharyngeal pouch as the animal fossilized.|$|E
