500|$|Meanwhile, {{director}} Sam Mendes {{had been}} working on a film version of the story for several years, and in June 2003 Sondheim was approached to write the script. Although he turned down the offer, Mendes and producer Walter F. Parkes obtained his approval to use writer John Logan instead. Logan had previously collaborated with Parkes on Gladiator, and claimed his biggest challenge in adapting the Sondheim stage play [...] "was taking a sprawling, magnificent Broadway musical and making it cinematic, and an emotionally honest film. Onstage, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chorus sing as the people of London, but I think that would be alienating in a movie." [...] Mendes left to direct the 2005 film Jarhead, and Burton leaped at taking over the direction after his project, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, fell apart due to its excessive budget.|$|E

To Cyriaque Lamar of io9, the film's approach to technology was reminiscent of a kōan. [...] "One {{of the things that}} brought me to this film," [...] affirmed Bridges, [...] "was the idea of helping to create a modern-day myth to help us navigate through these technological waters [...] I dig immediate gratification as much as anybody, but it happens so fast that if you make a decision like that, you can go far down the wrong path. Think about those plastic single-use water bottles. Where did that come from?

500|$|Aarhus has {{a robust}} and diverse nightlife. The action tends to {{concentrate}} {{in the inner}} city, with the pedestrianised riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, but things are stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. [...] A short selection of well-established places where <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> drink and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club of Kupé at the harbour front, the relaxed Ris Ras Filliongongong offering waterpipes and an award-winning beer selection, Fatter Eskild with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the wine and book café of Løve's in Nørregade, Sherlock Holmes, a British-style pub with live music and the brew pub of Sct.

[...] There are several clubs, discos and cafés aimed at gays and lesbians, including Danish D-lite (sports), Gbar (nightclub) and Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club).|$|E
500|$|Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie, {{the second}} oldest Pevensie. Popplewell had been {{disappointed}} she barely used her {{bow and arrow}} in the first film. Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis' view of women before he met Joy Gresham. [...] "I think [...] cast women down in the earlier books, {{but when you look}} at The Horse and His Boy, it has a strong female character. Doug's mother was a strong woman." [...] Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian, because [...] "The kids are growing up. If you look at Ben and you look at Anna, it seems really implausible that they wouldn't have some feelings for each other." [...] He knew it had to be [...] "sensitively handled" [...] though, and ultimately it is not about romance, but [...] " [...] the fact that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wondrous experience, enjoy it and move on". Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan, a talented archer, in battle, and that the romance contributed to her character's reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place.|$|E

Their presence attracted crowds and Papps shouted [...] "let's have a scream from those who want Bobby and Frank to marry". The crowds went [...] "berserk" [...] and voiced their approval– which gave the go ahead for their on-screen marriage plans. The storyline played out on-screen when Frank decides that he should ask Bobby to marry him, despite still feeling hurt by Roo's actions. He picks Bobby up from school wearing a tuxedo in a Rolls-Royce and takes her to a picnic in the woods. He sets up a meal of fish and chips. Frank proposes and says; [...] "I can't offer you a Rolls-Royce lifestyle but <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> life of fish and chips with me." [...] Frank also writes a song titled [...] "When Best Friends Fall in Love" [...] and this was played during the scenes. They later face problems and Frank takes Bobby to his childhood home and he explains to her about how important marriage is to him. In the episode Frank also has flashbacks of his childhood; {{in which he was}} played by Michael Scilusa. Dickson told J Clayden that everyone wants her character to attend University and [...] "Bobby knows that getting married isn't {{the right thing to do}} [...] but she doesn't want to lose Frank." ...|$|E

He denied threatening the Earps. He testified that the Clantons and Frank McLaury raised their hands after Virgil's command, and Tom thrust open his vest to show he was unarmed.

2500|$|Video game creators have {{realized}} the asset of incorporating supercouple romances within their products by stringing together epic stories {{of love and}} intrigue. While writing epic romances into video games {{is not a new}} phenomenon, the idea of capturing a video game player through emotionally charged moments via the death of a hero's lover in order to produce feelings of attachment to the fictional environment has expanded, especially within action-adventure/role-playing games (RPGs). The goal is to make the gamer actually become emotionally invested in the characters and their actions, ultimately resulting in heightened gaming experience. Video game designer Peter Molyneux, when speaking of the main component he wanted in his game Fable 2, spoke of more than just the romantic aspect, stating, [...] "We want you to feel loved.

He went on to explain that, after a show of force and a threat to also drop a nuclear bomb on Tehran, the U.S. should then say: if [...] "You [...] want to be peaceful, just reverse it all and we will guarantee that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nuclear power plant for electricity purposes, energy purposes."
