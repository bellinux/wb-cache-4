5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message {{is going to get}} to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|I {{sent the}} {{libretto}} of Suor Angelica to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself– kind as he is– very satisfied... I have also finished a brief {{outline of a}} plot based on Gianni Schicchi. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Maestro's opinion of this subject, which is rich in possibilities and whose comic nature is quite out of the ordinary.|$|E
5|$|The {{first time}} he cheated on me, I thought there was {{something}} wrong with me or the relationship, but when someone makes a habit of it, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> problem lies with him. Yet I was foolish enough to give him a second chance because he begged and pleaded, despite the fact that everyone around me said he was still straying. I guess I really wanted to believe in him. Then I actually caught him red-handed. It took me a while to get out. But having done that, nothing can make me go back.|$|E
40|$|It {{is great}} to be here with a new {{generation}} that is advocating for reproductive rights and responding to the extraordinary anti-choice agenda we currently face. I am {{not going to talk about}} that agenda directly tonight because I <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> about <b>the</b> judicial appointments, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about <b>the</b> parental consent laws, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about <b>the</b> denial of funding for low-income women, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> about <b>the</b> global gag rule...|$|R

5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. <b>You</b> <b>know,</b> <b>the</b> important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5|$|Timmons' career {{declined}} {{quickly in}} the 1960s, {{in part because of}} drug abuse and alcoholism and {{partly as a result of}} frustration at being typecast as a composer and player of seemingly simple pieces of music. In 1968 he made his second, final, recording for Milestone, Do <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>the</b> Way? In the following year he played in a quartet led by Sonny Red, with Dexter Gordon on one of the saxophonist's temporary returns to the US from Europe, and in a trio backing vocalist Etta Jones. Timmons continued to play in the early 1970s, mostly in small groups or in combination with other pianists, and mainly in the New York area.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E

However, copyright problems caused the withdrawal of the EP and delays on the release of The Less <b>You</b> <b>Know,</b> <b>the</b> Better.|$|E
