50|$|Faced with a reinvigorated <b>Yankee</b> {{political}} <b>machine</b> {{and a loss}} {{of support}} amongst his own constituents, particularly the still powerful Irish mob, Hurley was denied reelection when former Governor Curley won the 1938 Democratic gubernatorial nomination.|$|R
50|$|The M16's Vortex Flash Hider weighs 3 ounces, is 2.25 inches long, {{and does}} not require a lock washer to attach to barrel. It was {{developed}} in 1984, {{and is one of the}} earliest privately designed muzzle devices. The U.S. military uses the Vortex Flash Hider on M4 carbines and M16 rifles. A version of the Vortex has been adopted by the Canadian Military for the Colt Canada C8 CQB rifle. Other flash suppressors developed for the M16 include the Phantom Flash Suppressor by <b>Yankee</b> Hill <b>Machine</b> (YHM) and the KX-3 by Noveske Rifleworks.|$|R
5000|$|The Vortex Flash Hider {{has been}} called the [...] "most {{effective}} flash hider available short of a (sound) suppressor" [...] by writer and gunsmith Patrick Sweeney, when used on an AR-15. In a 2005 article appearing in SWAT magazine it was deemed to be superior to the M16A2 [...] "bird cage" [...] flash suppressor and the <b>Yankee</b> Hill <b>Machine</b> Phantom Flash Suppressor. Peter G. Kokalis of Soldier of Fortune magazine and Shotgun News wrote that he installed over 300 Vortex Flash hiders while working as a military advisor with a Central American paramilitary unit in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The Lost Cause {{belief system}} {{synthesized}} numerous ideas {{into a coherent}} package. Lost Cause supporters argue that slavery was not {{the main cause of}} the Civil War, and claim that few scholars saw it as such before the 1950s. In order to reach this conclusion, they often deny or minimize the writings and speeches of Confederate leaders of the time in favor of later-written revisionist documents. [...] Supporters often stressed the idea of secession as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and say that threat violated the states' rights guaranteed by the Union. They believed any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more profoundly Christian than the greedy North. It portrayed the slavery system as more benevolent than cruel, emphasizing that it taught Christianity and civilization. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause said the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the <b>Yankee</b> industrial <b>machine.</b>|$|R
40|$|Paper {{manufacturing}} plants now use two drying technologies, impingement heating from air jets, and conduction heating from steam cylinders. Pulse air drying (PAD) improves the existing impingement system {{by increasing the}} heat transfer rate. Typical M. G. or <b>Yankee</b> style paper <b>machines</b> could see a 20 % production increase by retrofitting this technology. However, past studies and pilot plants have suffered from unpredictable performance, and two main problems still exist. First, pulse drying doesn’t have the complete theoretical foundation that steady flow drying has, and secondly, the PAD process requires a pulse burner with significantly different performance characteristics than the pulse burners now used in other industries. The author will {{provide an overview of}} existing technologies, an appraisal of the remaining technical hurtles, and estimates of technology’s economic viability, energy savings, maintenance requirements, and emissions impact. INTRODUCTION: PAPER DRYING TECHNOLOGY The head box of a typical paper forming machine lays down a water suspension that often starts with 90 % water mass content or higher. Through mechanical pressing, this fragile suspension is formed into a web which is knitted together by extensive Van der Waals bonds present where individual fibers contact. Once the paper web has reached a critical moisture level, typically 60 % water mass, further mechanical dewatering will crush individual fibers and degrade th...|$|R
