"DEAR SKENE,--If you are {{disposed}} {{for a walk}} in <b>your</b> gardens any <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I {{would gladly}} accompany you for an hour, since keeping the house so long begins rather to hurt me, and you, who supported the other day the weight of my body, are perhaps best disposed to endure the gloom of my mind.--Yours ever, W.S.|$|R
60|$|I've just done--yesterday with Scott, {{and took}} up the letters for the first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've not {{conceived}} {{a passion}} for your friend," [...] Ralph said that evening to Isabel, [...] "though we talked some <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{struggle}} was on. [...] "You must go with nurse. You {{may not have}} a good <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Another day you shall ride in the automobile if you are obedient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the joke, Peter Rabbit? That's {{the second}} <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that I've {{been told that}} I was {{screaming}} last night, when all the time I was fast asleep," [...] said Sammy Jay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've a {{shocking}} memory for names, but yours is--Mr. Horser, isn't it? I heard {{it for the}} first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and my memory will generally carry me through four-and-twenty hours." ...|$|R
5|$|There {{can be no}} more {{complaints}} of inactivity of the government. The forward march movement into Virginia, indicated in my despatches last night, {{took place at the}} precise <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> that I named, but in much more imposing and powerful numbers.|$|R
6000|$|... "She is a beauty, isn't she?" [...] Granet assented enthusiastically. [...] "What {{she could}} touch upon fourth speed I wouldn't dare to say. We were going over sixty plenty of <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and yet one {{scarcely}} noticed it. You see, she's so beautifully hung." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it the one I saw {{advertised in}} the <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> I wonder?' Mrs. Evelegh inquired in a placid voice. '"Charming {{furnished}} house on Holmesdale Common; six bedrooms, four reception-rooms; splendid views; pure air; picturesque surroundings; exceptionally situated." [...] I thought of writing about it.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have never}} seen such an {{alteration}} in a man," [...] she said, [...] "in so short a <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> he amazed me. He knew the right people and did the right things--carried himself too {{like a man who}} is sure of himself. To-night he is simply a booby." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bring suit," [...] {{answered}} the Honourable Hilary, quickly, [...] "bring suit by all means. And now's <b>your</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> {{seems to be}} a popular season for attacking the property which is the foundation of the State's prosperity." [...] ("Book of Arguments," [...] chapter 3.) ...|$|R
60|$|Mel. O, my dear, I {{was just}} going to pay my devoirs to you; I had not <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> for making my court to the king, and our new prince. Well, never nation was so happy, and all that, in a young prince; and he is the kindest person in the world to me, let me die if he is not.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had a {{very pale}} {{companion}} {{for the last four}} miles," [...] said Joseph, indulging in a shudder toned down by resignation. [...] "And to speak the truth, 'twas beginning to tell upon me. I assure ye, I ha'n't seed the colour of victuals or drink since breakfast <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and that {{was no more than a}} dew-bit afield." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She didn't say a word, {{only she}} wanted to see you alone; but I'm {{thinking}} it's something about her brother; he was with her a long long <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> and went away more like a dead man than a live one. But come, don't keep her waiting; and, whatever you do, don't stay long; every word she spakes is killing her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to me, both of you!" [...] {{she cried}} incoherently. [...] "Helen, you especially! You never heard {{anything}} so wonderful in your life! They weren't fishing excursions at all. There weren't any whiting. Henry was laying mines all the time, and he's blown up half the German fleet! It's all in the <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He's got a D.S.O.--Henry has--and he's a Rear-Admiral! Oh, Helen, I want to cry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see, I see," [...] {{said the}} President, nodding kindly as he seated {{himself at the}} top of a long table. [...] "You die for mankind first, and then you get up and smite their oppressors. So that's all right. And now may I ask you to control your {{beautiful}} sentiments, and sit down with the other gentlemen at this table. For the first <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> something intelligent is going to be said." ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Betsey--the wickedness of this world--but I haven't <b>time</b> to moralize <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{that then}} was after your aunt last spoke to me--I mean the last <b>time</b> before <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> I'm {{relieved}} to hear it. So," [...] he said, [...] "they'll do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean, you villain!" [...] roared Deleglise's {{caretaker}} at me {{one evening}} on entering the kitchen. [...] "How dare you waste <b>your</b> <b>time</b> writing <b>this</b> sort of stuff?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Dickey also {{appeared}} as {{himself in the}} film The Stratton Story in 1949. In the film, Dickey was scripted to take a called third strike from Jimmy Stewart's character. Dickey objected, stating [...] "I never took a third strike. I always swung", and asking the director, Sam Wood, {{to allow him to}} swing through the third strike; Wood insisted that Dickey take the third strike. After many takes, Dickey commented: [...] "I've struck out more <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> than I did throughout my entire baseball career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I must. I {{have some}} sewing {{to do for}} Dora this evening. Besides, Davy is {{probably}} breaking Marilla's heart with some new mischief by <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> {{the first thing he}} said was, 'Where does the dark go, Anne? I want to know.' I told him it went around {{to the other side of}} the world but after breakfast he declared it didn't [...] . that it went down the well. Marilla says she caught him hanging over the well-box four times today, trying to reach down to the dark." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Ten O'Clock News on WNEW {{followed}} {{a talk show}} hosted by Merv Griffin and {{was followed by a}} local talk show hosted by Alan Burke. Gould described the acerbic Burke as [...] "a piece of sandpaper wired for sound." [...] The Ten O'Clock News rapidly built a substantial audience. Jorgensen was succeeded at WNEW by John Roland, who had previously been a featured reporter and co-anchor. His signature signoff was [...] "I'm Bill Jorgensen, thanking you for <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> 'till next time." ...|$|R
60|$|Wood. Might not I {{ask you one}} civil question? How pass you <b>your</b> <b>time</b> in <b>this</b> noble family? For I {{find you}} are a lover of the game, and I should be loth to hunt in your purlieus.|$|R
40|$|What {{does it mean}} {{to design}} a new class in SAS/AF {{software}} so that it fully exploits the new SAS Component Object Model (SCOM) architecture? What benefits do the new features bring? How can you incorporate these new features into existing applications? Is it worth <b>your</b> <b>time?</b> <b>This</b> paper will answer these questions and more while describing the new SCOM architecture in detail. Examples will be shown to illustrate how {{it can be used to}} reduce the time it takes to develop applications as well as improve your applicationâ€™s performance...|$|R
6000|$|... "Going on well. Evidently {{no idea of}} {{the flight}} of <b>time.</b> Asked <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> how many had been saved from the Lusitania. Was it in the papers yet? That, of course, was only what was to be expected. She seems to have {{something}} on her mind, though." ...|$|R
60|$|He was shaved (by {{himself or}} more {{socially}} by Del Snafflin) only three <b>times</b> a week. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> {{had not been}} one of the three times.|$|R
60|$|October 7th.--Since Saturday last (it being now Thursday), I {{have been}} in Boston and Salem, {{and there has been}} a violent storm and rain during the whole <b>time.</b> <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> shone as bright as if it meant to make up for all the dismalness of the past days. Our brook, which in the summer was no longer a running stream, but stood in pools along its pebbly course, is now full from one grassy verge to the other, and hurries along with a murmuring rush. It will {{continue}} to swell, I suppose, and in the winter and spring it will flood all the broad meadows through which it flows.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will be so good," [...] she said, looking back, [...] "as to spare me {{half an hour of}} <b>your</b> {{valuable}} <b>time</b> <b>this</b> evening. This is a subject which I must discuss with you further at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{surprised}} a secret," [...] she said, [...] "which I had confided {{to my sister}} Mrs. Ablewhite, and to my lawyer Mr. Bruff, and to no one else. I can trust in their discretion; and I am sure, when I tell you the circumstances, I can trust in yours. Have you any pressing engagement, Drusilla? or is <b>your</b> <b>time</b> <b>your</b> own <b>this</b> afternoon?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We dont want to {{take much}} of <b>your</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>this</b> is the {{arrangement}} of the brothers. People are now supporting us more, even those ones who did not support us in the past, support us now. I did not {{want to take}} that much of your time." ...|$|R
60|$|But to resume. It is {{the first}} day of June. Ten days have passed since the pampero. When the strong back on Number Three hatch was {{repaired}} Captain West came back on the wind, hove to, and rode out the gale. Since then, in calm, and fog, and damp, and storm, we have won south until to- day we are almost abreast of the Falklands. The coast of the Argentine lies to the West, below the sea-line, and some <b>time</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> we crossed the fiftieth parallel of south latitude. Here begins the passage of Cape Horn, for so it is reckoned by the navigators--fifty south in the Atlantic to fifty south in the Pacific.|$|R

[...] "I was allowed to sit with him for a short <b>time</b> early <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> He is beginning to wander in his mind, to speak of his wife and a sum of money." [...] Jocelyn's fine eyebrows came a little closer together.|$|R
6000|$|Feb.--. Livy dear, {{last night}} I played billiards with Mr. Rogers until 11, {{then went to}} Robert Reid's studio and had a most {{delightful}} <b>time</b> until 4 <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> No ladies were invited <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> Among the people present were-- ...|$|R
5000|$|Digital Retribution {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "Boring, pretentious, pompous and featuring a disappearing clown on fire, there's {{little reason to}} watch this. Actually, the only reason to watch is that glorious quote about juice and killer clowns, and since you've already read it, there's now no reason to waste <b>your</b> <b>time</b> on <b>this</b> dreck." ...|$|R
