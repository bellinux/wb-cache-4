You never think of this, but let me go on like a simpleton. I {{wish you a merry}} Christmas, and many, many a one with poor Presto at some pretty place. I was at church to-day by eight, and {{received}} the Sacrament, and came home by ten; then went to Court at two: it was a Collar-day, that is, when the Knights of the Garter wear their collars; but the Queen stayed so late at Sacrament, that I came back, and dined with my neighbour Ford, because all people dine at home on this day. This is likewise a Collar-day all over England in every house, at least where there is BRAWN: that's very well.--I tell you a good pun; a fellow hard by pretends to cure agues, and has set out a sign, and spells it EGOES; a gentleman and I observing it, he said, [...] "How does that fellow pretend to cure AGUES?" [...] I said I did not know; but I was sure it was not by a SPELL. That is admirable. And so <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Bishop about that pun of Lord Stawel's brother. Bite! Have I caught you, young women? Must you pretend to ask after roguish puns, and Latin ones too? Oh but you smoked me, and did not ask the Bishop. Oh but you are a fool, and you did. I met Vedeau again at Court to-day, and I observed he had a sword on; I fancy he was broke, and has got a commission, but I never asked him. Vedeau I think his name is, yet Parvisol's man is Vedel, that is true. Bank Stock will fall like stock-fish by this bad news, and two days ago I could have got twelve pounds by my bargain; but I do not intend to sell, and in time it will rise. It is odd that my Lord Peterborow foretold this loss two months ago, one night at Mr. Harley's, when I was there; he bid us count upon it, that Stanhope would lose Spain before Christmas; that he would venture his head upon it, and gave us reasons; and though Mr. Harley argued the contrary, he still held to his opinion. I was telling my Lord Angelsea this at Court this morning; and a gentleman by said he had heard my Lord Peterborow affirm the same thing.

5000|$|Most of {{the other}} Zhuangzi {{passages}} portray Hui Shi (Huizi) as a friendly rival of Zhuangzi.

'Everywhere extend wild, naked hills, in many places totally un-reclaimed, in others enclosed, but exhibiting all the signs of neglected spiritless husbandry ...Over these naked and desolate hills are scattered to their very tops, in all directions, the habitations of a swarming population of weavers... In Ribchester our chaise was pursued by swarms of these wooden-shod lads like swarms of flies and were only beaten off {{for a moment to}} close in upon you again, and their sisters showed equally the extravagance of rudeness in which they were suffered to grow up, by running out of the houses as we passed and poking mops and brushes at the horses heads. No one attempted to restrain or rebuke them; yet no one of the adult population offered you the least insult; and if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> way, gave you the most ready directions, and if you went into their houses, treated you with perfect civility and showed an affection for these little brats that was honourable to their hearts and wanted only directing by a better intelligence.

5000|$|Months {{passed by}} while the GSBs waited. One day an old person arrived in Karkala {{with a bag}} on his {{shoulder}} and dressed as a hermit. He asked for a place to take rest with the Gaud Saraswat Brahmins. They gave him a small place to stay. He had some idol of Lord Vishnu which he used to take it with himself for a pilgrimage. That night when everyone was in deep sleep a strange dream appeared for the GSBs and the saint. Lord of Tirupathi was the main character in the dream. For GSBs the dream was, [...] "Devotees of mine I have already come over here as I promised. The saint who came to this place has come Tirumala and the idol which he has is mine. You take the idol from him and install it but as per my instructions. During the ceremony a cow and her calf should be left for feeding after pooja. The place where the cow drops her milk after milking the calf will be my sacred place. Do all these things first and then rest leave it to me." [...] For the saint the dream appeared as, [...] "Oh Saint you have travelled much in your life and now its time for you to take rest in your life. I like this place very much and want to stay here {{for the rest of the}} time. The people from whom <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> land are in need of me as I had promised them that I would come from Tirumala Tirupathi and stay in this place. So please hand over me to them." [...] The saint agreed to Lord's wishes and very next morning went to GSB people to hand over the idol with one condition. His condition was,"Any offerings given to Lord almighty would be taken to Tirupathi occasionally and Lord would be taken to Tirupathi once a year." [...] They agreed to hermits condition and installed the idol as per Lord's instructions. This installation was on the day 25 April 1537.|$|E
