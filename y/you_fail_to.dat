500|$|Sell said God of War {{has very}} few flaws {{and that the}} only one worth {{mentioning}} is the camera system: he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos, [...] "there are a fair few annoying moments when you're attacked by something off-screen, or <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> make a jump because you couldn't really see the jump properly". Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability, the amount of time it takes to upgrade items, and the final fight with Ares, which he said is [...] "a little disappointing". Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions, he found some of the platforming balancing acts [...] "a little bothersome". He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies, but they will eventually get their [...] "brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied".|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Declan Whitebloom in London on 28 November 2011. Whitebloom approached shooting the clip with a [...] "what you get, is what you get" [...] sentiment, which, as he noted, [...] "can create some real magic." [...] In regard to its concept, Whiteboom characterised the clip as [...] "kind of Monkees or Beatles-esque", elaborating that it revolves around [...] "five lads go crazy in London, it's like a big day out in London." [...] In a December interview with Capital FM, member Harry Styles reflected that the shoot was a fun, careless romp. Premiering on YouTube on 13 January 2012, the music video depicts the band performing in and around London. As of October 2017, the music video has garnered more than 550 million YouTube views. One Direction surged 35-10 from the previous week on Billboards Social 50 chart. Alex Hughes of The Huffington Post commented that the music video has an effortless element of happiness, proclaiming: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> crack a smile, there is a 100 percent chance {{that you are the}} devil." ...|$|E
2500|$|The triumphant {{return with}} the gems in hand greatly {{increases}} Harap Alb's prestige, and positively impresses the Green Emperor himself. Envious, the Bald Man explains to the imperial court that the feats were entirely attributable to himself, the master, {{and to his}} stern ways. While the monarch agrees with the explanation, his daughter and her sisters are yet more skeptical, and decide to investigate further. Just prior to a feast, they ask the Bald Man to allow Harap Alb the honor of serving at their table, which he agrees to only after making the servant swear {{not to engage in}} conversation with the ladies. During the celebrations, the court is unexpectedly visited by an enchanted bird-like creature, Pasărea măiastră, who announces: [...] "You are eating, drinking and enjoying yourselves, but <b>you</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> think about the Red Emperor's daughter!" [...] There follows a debate [...] concerning the tyrannical Red Emperor and his daughter, during which some of the guests claim that the latter is a malevolent witch, and some still that she is the bird itself, on a mission to propagate fear. After witnessing this, the Bald Man proposes to send Harap Alb on a quest to capture the Red Emperor's daughter and reveal the mystery, the servant being forced to leave before the feast is over. While he is gone, the Bald Man continues to undermine his reputation, but also inadvertently sparks more suspicions about his background and character.|$|E
