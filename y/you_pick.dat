5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|During a Monday Night Football {{telecast}} on September 15, 2008, Kornheiser made {{a comment}} about a clip of the ESPN Deportes crew's call of a Felix Jones touchdown, saying, “I took high-school Spanish, and that either means ‘nobody is going to touch him’ or ‘could <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up my dry cleaning in the morning.’” Later in the broadcast, Kornheiser apologized on-air for the remark.|$|E
500|$|Weird Al {{also got}} me. He made a video, did a fake {{interview}} with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, {{and put it}} up on the Internet. He's a very funny motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have to sit back and say, [...] "Oh, he got me." [...] It's something <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've {{got to be able to}} take it.|$|E

[...] In Game 5 of the {{championship}} series, Wilt Chamberlain, playing for the San Francisco Warriors, knocked out Clyde Lovellette of the Boston Celtics with a punch. [...] Celtics head coach Red Auerbach stormed onto the court and demanded that Chamberlain be {{thrown out of the}} game. [...] The latter told Auerbach if he did not [...] "shut up", he would be knocked down to the floor with Lovellette. [...] Auerbach countered the threat, [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> on somebody your own size." [...] Rudolph intervened the discussion and told Auerbach, [...] "Red, do you have any other seven-footers who'd like to volunteer?" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want to read that story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|Science Wonders {{first issue}} {{included}} {{the first part}} of a serial, The Reign of the Ray, by Fletcher Pratt and Irwin Lester, and short stories by Stanton Coblentz and David H. Keller. Air Wonder began with a reprinted serial, Victor MacClure's Ark of the Covenant. Writers who first appeared in the pages of these magazines include Neil R. Jones, Ed Earl Repp, Raymond Z. Gallun and Lloyd Eshbach. The quality of published science fiction at the time was generally low, and Lasser was keen to improve it. On 11 May 1931 he wrote to his regular contributors to tell them that their science fiction stories [...] "should deal realistically with the effect upon people, individually and in groups, of a scientific invention or discovery.... In other words, allow yourself one fundamental assumption—that a certain machine or discovery is possible—and then show what would be its logical and dramatic consequences upon the world; also what would be the effect upon the group of characters that <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> to carry your theme." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah, who {{maintained}} a perfect 4.0 {{grade point average}} when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: [...] "I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important {{to have something to}} fall back on." [...] She did this in her own life, as she planned to [...] "fall back on" [...] another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if she did not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> a career it has to be something you love".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of Revolution Muslim's statement, Seattle {{cartoonist}} Molly Norris suggested that many people draw and publish pictures of Muhammad on May 20, 2010, which she dubbed the [...] "first annual Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". However, very few cartoonists actually joined her in criticizing Islam or depicting the prophet Muhammed; instead, much like Maher and Stewart, they merely praised her for her efforts and condemned the idea of censorship. Norris herself went into hiding, shortly thereafter, {{on the advice of}} the FBI. Animated comedy series Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane voiced this ambivalence {{on the part of the}} creative community, saying [...] "No one is a bigger critic of organized religion than I am", but nevertheless added, [...] "It's tricky. <b>You</b> <b>pick</b> your battles. You have to judge how real the threat is against how funny the joke is. How much do I care about the joke?" [...] And The Simpsons also addressed the apparent hypocrisy of those who claimed to stand with South Park in a chalkboard gag during the opening sequence of the April 25, 2010 episode [...] "The Squirt and the Whale", with Bart Simpson writing [...] "South Park—We'd Stand Beside You If We Weren't So Scared".|$|E
500|$|Their feud {{was blamed}} for {{contributing}} to the low morale that precipitated the so-called [...] "Morotai Mutiny" [...] of April 1945, {{when a group of}} senior pilots in the First Tactical Air Force submitted their resignations rather than continue to attack what they believed to be worthless targets. Alerted to the issue by No.1 TAF's commander, Air Commodore Harry Cobby, Bostock appealed to the pilots to withdraw their resignations. According to historian Kristen Alexander, his methods were construed as an attempt to [...] "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up"; one of the [...] "mutineers", Squadron Leader John Waddy, quoted Bostock as saying, [...] "I will leave these applications on the table and if <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> them up, all records and all notes of any of this affair will be expunged from Air Force records and files and nothing will be heard about it". When the pilots refused to drop the matter, Bostock signalled Jones, advising that he found morale on the island to be at a [...] "dangerously low level" [...] and recommending the CAS replace Cobby with Air Commodore Scherger. Kenney concurred with Bostock, and Jones sacked Cobby. A subsequent investigation vindicated the stand taken by the pilots; one of them, Wing Commander Kenneth Ranger, told the inquiry of Jones and Bostock: [...] "I deplore the fighting and wrangling between them which is common knowledge throughout the Air Force. Every week there are instances of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} generally negative reviews {{in the mainstream}} press. However, Variety stated the film [...] "satisfies as a solidly crafted and persuasively acted thriller that relies more on dark secrets than black magic" [...] while The Hollywood Reporter commented, [...] "Not Forgotten reminds you of a paperback <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up at the airport...where the cover promises a pulp-ish combination of suspense, murder and...the story is so engrossing, you wish the flight were longer".|$|E

2500|$|Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote Slumdog Millionaire {{based on}} the Boeke Prize-winning and Commonwealth Writers' Prize-nominated novel Q & A by Vikas Swarup. To hone the script, Beaufoy made three {{research}} trips to India and interviewed street children, finding himself impressed with their attitudes. The screenwriter said of his goal for the script: [...] "I wanted to get (across) the sense of this huge amount of fun, laughter, chat, and sense of community that is in these slums. What <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> up on is this mass of energy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robinson was {{successful}} despite the obstacle of racism. A favorite Robinson anecdote {{is that he}} seated himself in a restaurant and a customer objected to his presence. When the manager suggested {{that it might be}} better if Robinson leave, he smiled and asked, [...] "Have you got a ten-dollar bill?" [...] Politely asking to borrow the manager's note for a moment, Robinson added six $10 bills from his own wallet and mixed them up, then extended the seven bills together, adding, [...] "Here, let's see <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> out the colored one". The restaurant manager served Robinson without further delay.|$|E

But you can play in the mud and the dirt, and you’re probably not going to get a disease either, because you get immune to it. <b>You</b> <b>pick</b> your poison, and I think we choose to go play in the mud.” In 2001, Dish admitted to using over 100 law firms over a ten-year period.|$|E

[...] You report us with your mouth, and we cut off your lips? [...] Who is to blame? [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says that if your hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E
2500|$|Ortmann {{was raised}} in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He turned down offers from the University of Wisconsin and nearby Marquette University, as well as coach Bear Bryant at the University of Kentucky, to attend the University of Michigan and play {{football}} for Fritz Crisler. Ortmann recalled: “My high school coach would say, ‘Chuck, if <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> Michigan, you’re picking the best. [...] After you graduate, people will know you and remember you.’ [...] I made the right decision.” He was a versatile player, starting at [...] safety on defense and halfback on offense, as well as punting, placekicking, and returning punts and kickoffs. He was a starter as a sophomore for the undefeated 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team that won the National Championship. As a senior in 1950, {{he was responsible for}} 90% of Michigan's total offense.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur I. Miller, {{author of}} Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc (2002), writes: [...] "Cubism {{directly}} helped Niels Bohr discover {{the principle of}} complementarity in quantum theory, which says that something can be a particle and a wave at the same time, but {{it will always be}} measured to be either one or the other. In analytic cubism, artists tried to represent a scene from all possible viewpoints on one canvas." [...] Miller continues: [...] "An observer picks out one particular viewpoint. How you view the painting, that’s the way it is. Bohr read the book by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes on cubist theory, Du [...] "Cubisme". It inspired him to postulate that the totality of an electron is both a particle and a wave, but when you observe it <b>you</b> <b>pick</b> out one particular viewpoint." ...|$|E
