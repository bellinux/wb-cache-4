500|$|The generally-accepted {{explanation}} of the state's name {{is that it is}} derived from the Sarawak Malay word serawak, which means antimony. A popular alternative explanation {{is that it is a}} contraction of the four Malay words purportedly uttered by Pangeran Muda Hashim (uncle to the Sultan of Brunei), [...] "Saya serah pada awak" [...] (I surrender it to <b>you),</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> gave Sarawak to James Brooke, an English explorer in 1841. James Brooke later became the first of the White Rajah dynasty to govern Sarawak. However, the latter explanation is incorrect: the territory had been named Sarawak before the arrival of James Brooke, and the word awak was not in the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the formation of Malaysia.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, his {{propensity}} for throwing strikes and avoiding walks kept his pitch counts low. On July 2, 1997 {{he won a}} game against the New York Yankees, for example, with the numbers [...] "nine innings, three hits, no walks, eight strikeouts, one pickoff, one double play, 84 pitches ... two hours and nine minutes". Dodgers general manager Fred Claire admired Maddux's pitching consistency, saying [...] "It's almost like a guy lining up a 60-foot-6-inch putt ... he is just so disciplined, so repetitive in his pitches." [...] Speaking about Maddux's accuracy, Orel Hershiser said, [...] "This guy can throw a ball in a teacup." [...] Baseball Hall of Famer Wade Boggs talked about facing Maddux: [...] "It seems like he's inside your mind with <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, Mary, thou didst but {{recently}} say thy very self that Norman of Torn was most courteous to <b>thee</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sacked this, thy father's castle. How be it thou so soon has changed thy mind?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will tell}} <b>thee</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> cometh. Listen!" [...] said he, as a {{confused}} clattering sounded in the court-yard without. [...] "Yonder are the horses now. They come presently. Busk thee with thy letter, friend Myles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good to <b>you!...</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> {{keeps you}} captive like an Indian would? When he's given me orders to watch you--keep you locked up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Next to a wariness {{respecting}} {{your interests}} is a keen regard for your honour. Have concealed {{in the privacy}} of your mind a code of what is due to you. Expand or modify it as occasion offers. Be as it were a collector of what are called [...] "slights," [...] and never let one pass you. Watch your friend in doorways, passages; when he eats by <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> drinks with <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> addresses <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> writes you letters. It will be hard if you cannot catch him smuggling some deadly insult into your presence. Tax him with it. He did not think, forsooth! Tell him no gentleman would do such a thing, thinkingly or not; that you certainly will not stand it again. Say you will show him. He will presently argue or contradict. So to your climax.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just {{before he}} comes you'd better have it, I think. One {{of the girls}} will step up and give it <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> below. He'll want to speak a word or so to Mrs Kelly before he comes up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Had <b>he</b> seen <b>thee</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> swore [...] He {{would love}} but me alone? [...] Thou wast absent, sent before [...] To our kin in Sidmouth town.

6000|$|... "We owe {{you a great}} debt. It {{might have}} been so much worse. You mustn't be disconsolate. Go to bed {{and have a good}} long rest." [...] And from the door, she murmured again: [...] "He will come and thank <b>you,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he's</b> well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is not kind of <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> lies there, and {{it hurts}} him so sadly to breathe. You should wish him to be well, Helen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! What does he know? He {{is only a}} molly-coddling parson, poor fellow. He {{will give}} them a rare account of <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> goes back." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{is a very}} queer turn of affairs, I admit. The other Mr. Rover must {{explain to}} <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> meet. <b>He</b> wishes {{you to come to}} him alone. It will not be safe for more." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{noticed it}} myself. I {{told you it}} was much the same shade as Miss Milliken's. It's rather {{fortunate}} that I happened to be here with <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{looked down}} upon her, head {{on one side and}} arms akimbo. [...] "If he can take her from me, the more easily can he take her from thee.

6000|$|... "I'll warrant he has not. But come, George, own the truth. Did he {{borrow money}} from <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> saw you? If he did not, he showed {{a very low}} opinion of your {{finances}} and my liberality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'See what <b>you</b> say <b>when</b> <b>he</b> has cased those fair {{hands in}} Spanish gloves. You ladies {{should know better}} than to fall out with a mercer.' ...|$|R
