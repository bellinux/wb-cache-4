500|$|The {{series was}} pitched to ABC Entertainment, {{who gave the}} green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season {{replacement}} for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, {{executive vice president of}} development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that [...] "edical shows are hard, and it was hard {{trying to figure out where}} ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, [...] found a way to slow it down, so <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters.

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E

IGN also listed Hermione as their second top Harry Potter character, praising her character development.|$|E

Under his father's ownership, {{it came to}} owe $2500 (...) to its {{newsprint}} supplier, the Antietam Paper Company. The company refused to ship more newsprint on credit, so Byrd cut a deal to make daily cash payments in return for ownership. As Byrd would later say, [...] "when you have to hunt for them that way, <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how many cents there really are in a dollar." [...] He eventually bought the Harrisonburg Daily News-Record and several other papers in the Shenandoah Valley; his family still owns these papers today.|$|E

[...] "I always {{wanted to live in}} New York City, so that was a dream come true!" [...] She added that [...] "New York has so much culture" [...] and she had been able to grow as a person and actor. [...] "It's good that you can be given a script and learn 40 pages and feel comfortable with that. <b>You</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> so much about the character that you don't question things, you just do it instantaneously," [...] she said.|$|E

2500|$|Theodorescu-Sion was {{probably}} the most protean Romanian oil painter. Sion's interests in trying out formulas was taken with reserve by some in the public. Writing for the Transylvanian readership of Luceafărul, in May 1909, George Murnu contended: [...] "Teodorescu Sion is a new talent that ought to work hard before reaching the profundity of observation which makes one an artist. He is altogether too preoccupied with technical matters and too superficial in his drawing." [...] Five years later, Tăslăuanu was to assess: [...] "Mr. Theodorescu-Sion's art [...] doesn't agree with all people on first impression. [...] The primitive and decorative genre, with simple lines and expressive planes, has not won [...] many adherents. His way of seeing and rendering things seen relates him to the modern art of other countries." [...] However, [...] " [...] are like those women who do not seek to please the eye and to resemble others. Once you get close to them, once <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> them and study them, you fall under the spell of their profound simplicity and beauty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The story {{received}} {{major changes}} {{over the course}} of development, with two of the most important relating to the player's character and the Big Sister. Initially there was only going to be one Big Sister who would continually hunt the player down throughout the course of the game and then retreat once she was defeated. This Big Sister was written as a Little Sister who, as she grew up on the surface, could not leave the memory of Rapture behind and eventually returned. The reason for the change, as explained by Zak McClendon, lead designer for 2K Marin, is [...] "If you have a single character that the player knows they can't kill because they're so important to the story you're completely removing the triumph of overcoming that encounter with them." [...] Jordan Thomas, the game's director, explains however, [...] "The soul of the original Big Sister character still exists, but in the form of somebody <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{over the course of}} the game." [...] The other major change was that the player's character, Subject Delta, is no longer the first Big Daddy, but rather the fourth prototype. He is, however, the first to be successfully 'pair-bonded' to a single Little Sister.|$|E

40|$|When casting, {{professional}} choreographers often prefer dancers they know, or {{ones they}} have worked with before. In universities, however, should the same situation apply?
