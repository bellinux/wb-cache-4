500|$|Mr. Brownlee, we {{have listened}} to you {{with a great deal}} of {{attention}} and the answers <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> seem pretty hard to meet. But I have one more question... I'm selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel. If I tried to sell a steer tomorrow I'd probably hardly get enough to pay the freight. I get three cents a dozen for eggs. I'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. Will you tell me what I've got to lose? ...|$|E

500|$|... "It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty / has to flourish in the light / wild horses run unbridled / or their spirit dies / <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> me the courage / to be all that I can / and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was {{going to go back to}} the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back.

500|$|After the war, Longstreet and {{his family}} settled in New Orleans, a {{location}} popular {{with a number of}} former Confederate generals. He entered into a cotton brokerage partnership there and also became the president of the newly created and prominent insurance company. He actively sought the presidency of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad but was unsuccessful, and also failed in an attempt to get investors for a proposed railroad from New Orleans around the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico south across the Rio Grande river and American-Mexican border to Monterrey, Mexico, (In 1870, he was named president of the newly organized New Orleans and Northeastern Railroad). He applied for a pardon from 17th President Andrew Johnson, endorsed by his old friend and Union Army General-in-Chief, [...] Ulysses S. Grant. Johnson refused, however, telling Longstreet in a meeting: [...] "There are three persons of the South who can never receive amnesty: Mr. Davis, General Lee, and yourself. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> the Union cause too much trouble." [...] Regardless of such opposition the Radical Republican controlled United States Congress restored his rights of American citizenship in June 1868.|$|E

2500|$|Future US Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis {{coined the}} term {{scientific}} management {{in the course of}} his argument for the Eastern Rate Case before the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1910. Brandeis argued that railroads, when governed according to Taylor's principles, did not need to raise rates to increase wages. Taylor used Brandeis's term in the title of his monograph The Principles of Scientific Management, published in 1911. The Eastern Rate Case propelled Taylor's ideas to the forefront of the management agenda. Taylor wrote to Brandeis [...] "I have rarely seen a new movement started with such great momentum as <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> this one." [...] Taylor's approach is also often referred to as Taylor's Principles, or, frequently disparagingly, as Taylorism.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, in {{the high}} priestly prayer, Jesus prays for the {{protection}} and sanctification of those who believed in him, and he explicitly excludes praying for all: [...] "I am not praying for the world but for those whom <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> me, for they are yours.". Paul instructs the elders in Ephesus [...] "to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood," [...] and {{he says in his}} letter to the same church that [...] "Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her." [...] Likewise, Jesus foreshadows that he will lay down his life [...] "for his friends," [...] and an angel tells Jesus' earthly father Joseph that he [...] "will save His people from their sins". Calvinists believe that these passages demonstrate that Jesus died for the church (that is, the elect) only.|$|E

2500|$|Ismail's {{reputation}} for fairness but uncompromising toughness – at one point, he declared he would arrest {{his own mother}} if she had broken the law – has been cited {{by a number of}} top officials as greatly contributing to stability {{in the wake of the}} riots. During this period, several Malay [...] "ultras" [...] such as Mahathir bin Mohamad and Musa Hitam called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Mahathir penned an open letter to the Tunku, accusing him of [...] "giving the Chinese what they demand ... <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> them too much face." [...] Soon, students at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations, calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore [...] "Malay sovereignty". Sporadic rioting, believed to have been instigated by the Tunku's opponents, broke out. The Tunku responded by forcing Mahathir and Musa out of UMNO, while Ismail as Home Affairs Minister issued a statement: [...] "These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution. ... Polarisation has taken place in Malaysian politics and the extreme racialists among the ruling party are making a desperate bid to topple the present leadership." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some years later, when Samuel {{has become}} an adult, the Philistines attack Eben-Ezer, {{eventually}} capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and kill Eli's sons, who accompany the Ark to battle as priests. (The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise {{that there was no}} possible way God would allow it to enter enemy hands, an assumption that proved to be incorrect.) Eli, who is nearly blind, is unaware of the event until he asks about all the commotion. Eli, sitting in a chair, is told what has happened by a soldier who has fled the battle. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God has been captured, Eli falls backwards out of the chair and dies from a broken neck, on the 10th day of Iyar. [...] He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years, and dies at the age of 98. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, is pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she hears the news that the Ark of God has been captured and that her father-in-law and husband are dead, she goes into labour and gives birth, but is overcome by labour pains. As she is dying, the women attending her say, Don't despair; <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>given</b> birth to a son. But she does not respond or pay any attention. She names the boy Ichabod, saying The Glory has departed from Israel- because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.|$|E
