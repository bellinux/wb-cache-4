6000|$|There was {{a general}} hum of {{satisfaction}} when this was said, for Carteret's Voyages, which, with the Bible and Prayer-book, formed the only class-books of that singular school, were highly appreciated by young and old alike, especially as read to them by Adams, who accompanied his reading with a free running commentary of explanation, which infused great additional interest into that old writer's book. TOC rose with alacrity, displaying in the act the immense relative difference between his very long legs and his ordinary body, in regard to which Adams used to console him by saying, [...] "Never mind, Toc, your legs'll stop growin' at last, and when they do, <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>will</b> come out like a telescope. You'll be a six-footer yet. Why, you're taller than I am already by two inches." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{very few}} of you have ever seen such an old-fashioned well as this. No pump, no windlass, no {{arrangement}} that you are apt to call at all convenient for raising the water. Nothing but that upright stake, on top of which moves a long pole, with the bucket hanging {{from one end of}} it. But the artist does not show in the picture {{the most important part of}} this arrangement. On the other end of this long pole a heavy stone is fastened, and it is easy to see that a bucket of water may be raised without much trouble, with the stone bearing down the other end of the pole. To be sure, the stone must be raised when the bucket is lowered, but that is done by pulling downward on the rope, which is not so hard as to haul a rope upward when the resistance is equal in both cases. Try it some time, and you will see that the weight of <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>will</b> count for a great deal in the operation. In old Mr. Naylor's yard--he lived in a little town in Pennsylvania--there was one of these wells. It had been dug by his father, and, as it had answered all his needs from his childhood, Mr. Naylor very justly considered it would continue to do so until his death, and he would listen to no one who proposed to put up a pump for him, or make him a windlass.|$|E

5000|$|The content of this scripture begins with the Buddha saving a Brahmana who was near death while the Buddha was in the Temple ( [...] 精舍) of Kapilavastu (迦毘羅衛). When a Bhaglaman bhikkhus who didn't believe in Buddhism came to Buddha after he listened to the coroner's statement that he will die in seven days, the Buddha said that this Brahmana would die and go to hell and continue to suffer. The Brahman repented, sincerely pleaded and begged him to rescue him from the suffering of hell. Then the Buddha said, 'If you repair an old pagoda on the three streets of Kapilavastu, make a small pagoda and put a mantra in it serve it, your life would be extended and you will receive many blessings. And {{wherever}} you reincarnate, <b>your</b> <b>body</b> <b>will</b> {{not have a}} handicap, all your sins will disappear, and you will always be always protected by the Buddha." [...] After he spoke, Brahmana went to the place where the old pagoda was and tried to repair it. At this time, Bodhisattva (除業 障菩薩) made this Dharani to wash away {{the sins of the}} sattva and the extending of life.|$|E

50|$|The {{exercise}} {{is characterized by}} the two right angles formed by the body, one at the hips and one at the knees. The person enters into the 'chair', with the pad supporting the front of the upper thighs and locking the lower leg (typically at the ankle or heel), bending forward at the waist. As you bend forward, <b>your</b> upper <b>body</b> <b>will</b> become closer to the ground. When you have bent as far as comfortable, use the muscles of your lower back to straighten <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> extending <b>your</b> upper <b>body</b> upwards.

50|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches may seem minor at first consideration. However, any student (or instructor) who has experienced both will immediately appreciate the simplicity of de la Torre's golf instruction which is unique among the leading golf instructors. De la Torre brings to light the absurdity of thinking that the cause of a poor shot is related to what <b>your</b> <b>body</b> is doing (e.g. Hips are too fast, arms are too slow, shoulder turn is off plane, etc.) He correctly observes that if the club is moving correctly, there is nothing you can do with <b>your</b> <b>body</b> that produce a poor shot. Conversely, if the club is moving incorrectly, there is nothing you can do with <b>your</b> <b>body</b> that <b>will</b> correct the problem and avoid the poor shot. By way of analogy, regardless of what he does with his body, if the marksman does the right thing with the rifle, the bullet must hit the target. If the golfer does the right thing with the golf club, the ball must go to the target.|$|R
