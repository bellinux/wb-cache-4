500|$|Oliver {{was born}} Bronwyn Gooda on 22 February 1959, in Gum Flat, west of Inverell in New South Wales. Her parents were Milton, a farmer turned greenkeeper, and Wendy, {{who worked in}} a pharmacy. Her {{creativity}} was nurtured from a young age. Aged just eight, Oliver attended weekend art classes in Inverell run by Ian Howard, {{who went on to}} become dean of the college in Sydney where she would later study. As she was dux of her school, her parents expected her to go on to university. However, Oliver wished to pursue a creative career. When she told her parents of her plans, her mother replied, [...] "Darling, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are very pleased you're going to art school, but if you'd been a son, I think we'd be a little disappointed." [...] A rift subsequently developed between her and her family that resulted in her having no contact with them for 25 years.|$|E

2500|$|In 2009 in a {{phone call}} to Gavin O'Reilly, O'Brien, by then a 26% {{shareholder}} in INM, criticized O'Reilly's stewardship of the company and issued a series of ultimatums and threatened to call an extraordinary general meeting if not implemented. O'Brien's criticisms intensified, culminating with Mr O'Brien's threat to Mr O'Reilly: [...] "I will destroy you and <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will go after everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{that you think}} that," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "If {{it was not for}} <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> you <b>I</b> wouldn't have urged the matter at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Welcome, niece,' he said, {{speaking}} through {{the sheet and}} in a thick voice; 'you find me in an evil case, for my days are numbered, the pestilence of the Teules slays those whom their swords spared. Soon another monarch must take my throne, as <b>I</b> took <b>your</b> <b>father's,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> do not altogether grieve, for on him will rest the glory and {{the burden of the}} last fight of the Aztecs. Your report, niece; let me hear it swiftly. What say the clans of the Otomie, your vassals?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't wish {{to dislike}} him, Ellen, {{goodness}} knows. But I don't {{think he would}} care much whether we disliked him or not. I am sure <b>your</b> poor <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would be only too glad to like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose she's {{somewhat}} {{anxious about}} <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> dare say is expecting me to hurry," [...] returned the master pointedly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, if {{you would}} rather remain single for another three or four months, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would not wish to press you unduly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had best go upstairs, and {{see them}} for yourself, Roger. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have weighty matters to talk over, and would fain be alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You don't {{remember}} me,' said Sir Jasper, 'but <b>I</b> was <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> colonel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> want to {{find some}} way of helping your brother. Your sister tells me she gave you a letter to carry to Mr. Stebbing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That shows you're a chip {{of the old}} block," [...] {{announced}} Dave, clapping his chum on the shoulder. [...] "You take after <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> Phil, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't {{think you}} could do better than to follow him in his shipping business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} that is quite right. I know it is like <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> indeed <b>I</b> shall be quite content however you decide. Only might it not be well {{to see how it}} strikes John, before you {{absolutely}} make it over to him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lumley, {{it is only}} {{a little}} while ago since <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told you the story of our strange meeting and marriage. You {{remember}} it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} confessing {{that they were}} right, and we will never do that. But I don't blame <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{want him to know}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{are going}} out to ride this afternoon, and I am sorry, for your sake, {{that we can not}} take you with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Brooke? That boy's tutor? Ah! I {{understand}} now. I {{know all}} about it. Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of <b>your</b> <b>Father's</b> letters, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made her tell me. You haven't gone and accepted him, child?" [...] cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} when I got that, Una?" [...] she asked with a sudden burst. [...] "Well, I'll tell you, my child.... It was the night of <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> death. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> got it {{climbing}} over the wall at The Grange, to escape detection." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have found}} you at last--why have you sought [...] to avoid me? God grant {{there is nothing}} wrong. [...] He is dead, the man I taught you to call <b>your</b> [...] <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can tell you all now. I am coming [...] to you this instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's what I mean. This is one {{of those}} things in which a man has to act on his own judgment. <b>Your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How do you do, Mr. Vane? I don't {{remember}} {{ever to have}} had the pleasure of seeing you, although <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have been intimately connected for many years." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rollo {{looked at}} it very wishfully, and the {{corporal}} {{told him that he}} might try it if he chose. “Wheel it about,” said he, “while <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are looking at the chaise.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{therefore}} you've come to {{your own}} property. You haven't to wait for <b>your</b> <b>father</b> to die, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> dare say you are indifferent about money.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! {{the truth}}, {{the truth is}} precious,' said Cadurcis, taking her hand, and {{preventing}} her from moving. 'Your mother, your devoted mother, has driven one man of genius from her bosom, and his country. Yet there is another. Deny me what <b>I</b> ask, <b>and</b> to-morrow's sun shall light me to another land; to this I will never return; I will blend my tears with <b>your</b> <b>father's,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will publish to Europe the double infamy of your mother. I swear it solemnly. Still I stand here, Venetia; prepared, if you will but smile upon me, to be her son, her dutiful son. Nay! her slave like you. She shall not murmur. I will be dutiful; she shall be devoted; {{we will all be}} happy,' he added in a softer tone. 'Now, now, Venetia, my happiness is on the stake, now, now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{know nothing}} about these things <b>and</b> <b>I</b> only ask pour me renseigner,' Mrs. Berrington's guest went on. 'And after their reverses <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> mother lived <b>I</b> think only a short time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bob, your faculties are {{wandering}} pretty wildly to-day, but you've not yet hit upon {{the cause of}} all our misfortunes. The true cause {{is that you have}} disobeyed <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> my mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear, <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will do {{our best}} for your happiness, and we would never use concealment. Whatever we do shall be as Christian people working together, not as tyrants with a silly girl.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Dick dear, and I {{have good}} news for you. Both <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> now think he was mistaken in believing the bone was {{shattered}} by the bullet. Perhaps it is splintered some, but nothing more serious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Parsons, I am {{considerably}} {{older than}} you, {{and you have}} no right to speak to me like that. You forget that I am a lady; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> didn't know <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> mother, <b>I</b> should say that you were no gentleman. And you forget also that I come here on the part of God. You are certainly no Christian. You've been very rude to me, indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, in {{the first}} place, {{do you agree with}} me that I {{have a right to be}} a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> have battled through a varied {{experience}} with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe it," [...] he declared. [...] "You {{have had}} a good training, thanks to <b>your</b> mother <b>and</b> <b>father.</b> Well, <b>I</b> have advised her to let you try your luck in the great metropolis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are old friends, Mr. Warrington. My husband, Colonel Lambert, knew <b>your</b> <b>father,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{and your}} mamma were schoolgirls {{together}} at Kensington. You were {{no stranger to}} us when your aunt and cousin told us who you were." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{so strange}} when I tell you," [...] replied Whitewing, [...] "that these are {{words from the}} Book of Manitou, and that <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> learned them {{together}} long ago from the preacher who now lies wounded in your hut." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{emotion in}} the Colonel's voice. [...] "I {{had a great}} liking for <b>your</b> <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> brought you up. Then I took a keen pride in you; there were respects in which I found you truer to our type than Bertram." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boy, beware how {{you cross}} me," [...] he hissed into Dick's ears. [...] "Beware, I say! I have known <b>your</b> <b>father</b> for years, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have the {{knowledge}} in my possession which can send <b>your</b> <b>father</b> to the gallows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear, no; it {{was made}} out of <b>your</b> dear <b>father's</b> chain. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> should prefer not selling the other things. None of them are of any great value. All my best {{ornaments}} were taken from me long ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was angry}} with her not for being a Christian, but for going out without <b>your</b> <b>father's</b> knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> told her so frankly. If it had been you I {{should not have been}} so much surprised, because you have high spirits and are fearless in disposition; but for her to do so seemed so strange <b>and</b> unnatural, that <b>I</b> deemed this {{religion}} of hers must be bad in that it taught a girl to deceive her parents." ...|$|R
