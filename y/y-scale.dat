40|$|Inclusive {{electron}} scattering from nuclei at low momentum transfer (corresponding to x≥ 1) and moderate Q 2 {{is dominated by}} quasifree scattering from nucleons. In the impulse approximation, the cross section can be directly connected to the nucleon momentum distribution via the scaling function F(y). The breakdown of the <b>y-scaling</b> assumptions in certain kinematic regions have prevented extraction of nucleon momentum distributions from such a scaling analysis. With a slight modification to the <b>y-scaling</b> assumptions, {{it is found that}} scaling functions can be extracted which are consistent with the expectations for the nucleon momentum distributions. Quasielastic (QE) {{electron scattering}} can provide important information about the distribution of nucleons in nuclei. With simple assumptions about the reaction mechanism, functions can be deduced that should scale (i. e. become independent of momentum transfer), and which are directly related to the nucleon momentum distribution. The concept of <b>y-scaling</b> of the quasielastic response was first proposed 1 in 1975. It was shown that in the plane wave impulse approximation (PWIA) a scaling function, F(y), could be extracted from the inclusive cross section which was related to the nucleon momentum distribution.

Methods: A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (<b>Y-scale),</b> visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26. 06; SD = 5. 96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS.

However, savings from reduced mechanical cooling may be offset by increased irrigation I water costs. In this study, three similar <b>y-scale</b> model buildings were constructed and surrounded with different landscapes: turf, rock mulch with a foundation planting of shrubs, and rock mulch with no plants. Irrigation water use and electricity required to power the three room-sized air conditioners and interior lights were measured for two approximately week-long periods.

30|$|The {{relationships}} between the cumulative filtration volumes and the filtration test times (filtration curves) for each 10 psi, displayed in inserts Fig.  6 a–c remain a straight line. There was {{a change in the}} <b>y-scale</b> (cumulative volume) for Fig.  6 a–d because of different permeabilities of PPG packs. The PPG of larger particle sizes has higher PPG pack permeability than PPG of smaller particle sizes. As a result, the flow rate was affected by the PPG pack permeability. The flow rate decreased with a decrease in the particle size. The flow rate was constant with time, which indicates that the swollen particle gels of 30, 50 – 60, and 80 mesh did not damage the porous media. No PPG was observed to penetrate into the cores because the particle size of PPGs was larger than the pore throat of the cores (no piston used). As a result, no cake was formed {{on the surface of the}} sandstone core. Other filtration curves in these figures remain straight lines. That means that the flow rates did not change with time and, therefore, no damage occurred at high pressures of 50, 100, 200, and 400 psi. The filtration model included a round tube withstanding a maximum pressure of 400 psi. The round tube will be broken if the pressure exceeds the limit pressure. The curve shapes of the different 10 psi pressures proved that when the injection pressure increased, no sandstone core damage occurred because all 10 psi pressure curves remain overlaid.|$|E

40|$|Structural {{walls are}} {{frequently}} used in buildings to resist earthquake lateral loads {{because of their}} effectiveness in limiting the building drifts and minimizing damage to both structural and non-structural elements. In a collaborative effort, {{as part of a}} PreNEESR project, three y -scale reinforced concrete rectangular shear walls were subjected to cyclic loading at the Multi-Axial Subassemblage Testing facility (MAST) at University of Minnesota. Also, a <b>y-scale</b> precast wall system was tested at National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE), Taiwan to validate PreWEC system concept. Overall dimensions of all four rectangular walls were identical, except that four different approaches were used to anchor the wall into the foundation. In the first wall, RWN, the longitudinal reinforcement was anchored into the foundation with adequate anchorage length without using any splices, while the second and third walls used couplers and code-based conventional lap splices to connect the wall reinforcement with the starter bars placed in the foundation. The precast wall, referred as PreWEC- 1, used unbonded post-tensioning to anchor the wall to the foundation. All three reinforced concrete walls had two different stiffness and strength in the two in-plane loading directions as they were modeled to represent the response of a T-shaped concrete wall tested as part of the same project. PreWEC- 1 was designed to replicate the response of RWN in in-plane weaker direction. The fiber-based nonlinear beam-column element available in OpenSees software was used to model all three reinforced concrete walls with adequate attention to capture the influence of different anchorage details. In addition to capturing the total global response, the accuracy of the analysis was also examined in terms of simulating the local response as well as various displacement components due to flexure, bond slip at the critical section resulting from strain penetration, and shear. A zero-length bond slip element was used to account for the strain penetration effects while a nonlinear spring element was used to account for the shear deformation. By comparing with the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} analytical models well simulated the force-displacement responses including the unloading and reloading stiffness. However, it was found that the pinching model available in OpenSEES, which has been used in the past to represent the shear deformation hysteresis, was not capable of capturing all the critical points in the shear deformation response recorded during testing. Hence, a monotonic and hysteretic cyclic shear model was proposed using the strut-and-tie modeling technique. The proposed cyclic shear model captured the observed experimental shear response adequately. As part of PreWEC- 1, testing an innovative, economical mild steel connector was developed and its behavior under cyclic shear loading was characterized using experimental and analytical means. The PreWEC system performed exceptionally well with good energy dissipation, self-centering ability and had 15 % higher capacity compared to the traditional reinforced concrete wall. Simplified analytical and design methods were proposed to characterize the behavior and designing of PreWEC systems.

Selected results from the recent experiment E 02 - 019 at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility will be shown and their relevance discussed...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of final}} state {{interactions}} in inclusive electron scattering off nuclei is investigated in the single-particle Green function formalism with a complex optical potential. In the eikonal approximation the <b>y-scaling</b> properties are discussed. It {{is suggested that}} {{the dominance of the}} contribution from the imaginary part W of the optical potential to the scaling function at large negative values of the scaling variable y found by Gurvitz and Rinat is appreciably reduced if off-shell effects are taken into account. It is shown that if a reasonable off-shell extrapolation of W is used, a satisfactory description of the observed scaling function is obtained for 4 He and nuclear matter...|$|R
40|$|The {{relativistic}} light-front dynamics (LFD) {{method has}} been shown to give a correct description of the most recent data for the deuteron monopole and quadrupole charge form factors obtained at the Jefferson Laboratory for elastic electron-deuteron scattering for six values of the squared momentum transfer between 0. 66 and 1. 7 (GeV/c) ^ 2. The good agreement with the data is in contrast with the results of the existing non-relativistic approaches. In this work we firstly make a complementary test of the LFD applying it to calculate another important characteristic, the nucleon momentum distribution n(q) of the deuteron using six invariant functions f_i (i= 1, [...] ., 6) instead of two (S- and D-waves) in the nonrelativistic case. The comparison with the <b>y-scaling</b> data shows the decisive role of the function f_ 5 which at q≥ 500 MeV/c exceeds all other f-functions (as well as the S- and D-waves) for the correct description of n(q) of the deuteron in the high-momentum region. Comparison with other calculations using S- and D-waves corresponding to various nucleon-nucleon potentials is made. Secondly, using clear indications that the high-momentum components of n(q) in heavier nuclei are related to those in the deuteron, we develop an approach within the natural orbital representation to calculate n(q) in (A,Z) -nuclei {{on the basis of the}} deuteron momentum distribution. As examples, n(q) in ^ 4 He, ^ 12 C and ^ 56 Fe are calculated and good agreement with the <b>y-scaling</b> data is obtained. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figures, corrected, to appear in Phys. Rev.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{phenomenon}} of <b>y-scaling</b> in inclusive quasielastic electron scattering. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} approach to scaling at finite four-momentum transfers, and the effects of final state interactions. Brueckner-Goldstone perturbation theory for nuclear matter is used to perform a detailed, microscopic calculation of the dynamic structure function of nuclear matter. This is compared to the naive prediction of the Impulse approximation, and we find that the approach to scaling is quite different. The Brueckner-Goldstone approach reproduces the trends seen experimentally (Impulse approximation does not); however, there is still not good quantitative agreement with the data. We take this to be a possible sign of problems in the conventional nucleon-nucleon interactions studied...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} inclusive electron-scattering {{cross sections}} for targets of ^(4) He, C, Al, Fe, and Au, for kinematics spanning the quasi-elastic peak, with squared, four­ momentum transfers (q^ 2) between 0. 23 and 2. 89 (GeV/c) ^ 2. Additional data were measured for Fe with q^ 2 's up to 3. 69 (GeV/c) ^ 2 These cross sections were analyzed for the <b>y-scaling</b> behavior expected from a simple, impulse-approximation model, and {{are found to}} approach a scaling limit at the highest q^ 2 's. The q^ 2 approach to scaling is compared with a calculation for infinite nuclear matter, and relationships between the scaling function and nucleon momentum distributions are discussed. Deviations from perfect scaling are used to set limits on possible changes {{in the size of}} nucleons inside the nucleus. ...|$|R
40|$|Standard data {{analysis}} on the VESUVIO spectrometer at ISIS is carried out within the Impulse Approximation framework, making use of the West scaling variable y. The experiments are performed using the time-of-flight technique with the detectors positioned at constant scattering angles. Line shape analysis is routinely performed in the <b>y-scaling</b> framework, using two different (and equivalent) approaches: (I) fitting {{the parameters of the}} recoil peaks directly to fixed-angle time-of-flight spectral (2) transforming the time-of-flight spectra into fixed-angle y spectra, referred to as the Neutron Compton Profiles, and then fitting the line shape parameters. The present work shows that scattering signals from different fixed-angle detectors can be collected and rebinned to obtain Neutron Compton Profiles at constant wave vector transfer, q, allowing for a suitable interpretation of data in terms of the dynamical structure factor, S(q, w). The current limits of applicability of such a procedure are discussed in terms of the available q-range and relative uncertainties for the VESUVIO experimental set up and of the main approximations involved.
