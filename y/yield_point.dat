40|$|A {{dislocation}} dynamical {{model for}} plastic deformation including increase and decrease in mobile dislocation density and increase in immobile dislocation density is proposed. The model takes account of dynamical internal stress due to mobile dislocations and statical internal stress (work hardening) due to immobile dislocations. Stress (applied stress and effective stress) -strain curves of silicon single crystals, through {{upper and lower}} <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> up to steady states of deformation, are calculated numerically by the model for various strain rates. The results of calculation agree well with the experiments by Yonenaga and Sumino [Phys. Stat. Solidi (a), 50 (1978), 685] except for upper <b>yield</b> <b>points.</b> Calculated dependence of lower yield stresses and of effective stress-strain curves after lower <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> on the initial density of dislocations also agrees with their experiments...|$|R

25|$|In {{both the}} tension and shear joint design cases, some level of tension preload in the bolt and {{resulting}} compression preload in the clamped components {{is essential to the}} joint integrity. The preload target can be achieved by a variety of methods: applying a measured torque to the bolt, measuring bolt extension, heating to expand the bolt then turning the nut down, torquing the bolt to the <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> testing ultrasonically, or by applying a certain number of degrees of relative rotation of the threaded components. Each method has a range of uncertainties associated with it, some of which are very substantial.|$|E
25|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} member {{is less than the}} elastic {{buckling strength}} of a structure if the material of the member is stressed beyond the elastic material range and into the non-linear (plastic) material behavior range. When the compression load is near the buckling load, the structure will bend significantly and the material of the column will diverge from a linear stress-strain behavior. The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the <b>yield</b> <b>point,</b> hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength. This reduced material rigidity reduces the buckling strength of the structure and results in a bucking load less than that predicted by the assumption of linear elastic behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of strain aging {{has been investigated}} in polycrystalline and single crystal NiAl alloys at temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. Static strain aging studies revealed that after annealing at 1100 K for 7200 s (i. e., 2 h) followed by furnace cooling, high purity, nitrogen-doped and titanium-doped polycrystalline alloys exhibited continuous yielding, while conventional-purity and carbon-doped alloys exhibited distinct <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> and Luders strains. Prestraining by hydrostatic pressurization removed the <b>yield</b> <b>points,</b> but they could be reintroduced by further annealing treatments. <b>Yield</b> <b>points</b> could be reintroduced more rapidly if the specimens were prestrained uniaxially rather than hydrostatically, owing to the arrangement of dislocations into cell structures during uniaxial deformation. The time dependence of the strain aging events followed at t(exp 2 / 3) relationship suggesting that the <b>yield</b> <b>points</b> observed in polycrystalline NiAl {{were the result of}} the pinning of mobile dislocations by interstitials, specifically carbon. Between 700 and 800 K, yield stress plateaus, yield stress transients upon a ten-fold increase in strain rate, work hardening peaks, and dips in the strain rate sensitivity (SRS) have been observed in conventional-purity and carbon-doped polycrystals. In single crystals, similar behavior was observed; in conventional-purity single crystals, however, the strain rate sensitivity became negative resulting in serrated yielding, whereas, the strain rate sensitivity stayed positive in high purity and in molybdenum-doped NiAl. These observations are indicative of dynamic strain aging (DSA) and are discussed in terms of conventional strain aging theories. The impact of these phenomena on the composition-structure-property relations are discerned. Finally, a good correlation has been demonstrated between the properties of NiAl alloys and a recently developed model for strain aging in metals and alloys developed by Reed-Hill et al...|$|R
