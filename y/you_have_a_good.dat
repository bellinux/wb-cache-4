500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, {{when asked about the}} radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? I call them egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Mega Man 4 has {{received}} mostly positive critical reviews. Reviews contemporary with the game's release by the United States magazine Nintendo Power and the United Kingdom publications Nintendo Magazine System and Total! all found Mega Man 4 {{to have high}} quality graphics, sound, and gameplay. However, they also noted very little improvement over previous entries in the series. GamePro was satisfied {{with the lack of}} changes. [...] "Mega Man 4 continues the tradition — crazed robot baddies, good character graphics, great background art and warped, mechanical music," [...] the reviewer said. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> game, why make radical changes? Capcom sticks to the blueprints in Mega Man 4 — guaranteeing happiness for Mega Man fans everywhere." [...] Mega Man 4 made it into IGN's [...] "Top 100 NES Games" [...] list at number 95, with staff writer Matt Casamassina praising its attempt at better narrative and an essentially similar experience to the first three Mega Man games. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that, as a stand-alone title, the game {{is one of the best}} experiences available from the NES library, although not when compared to its superior predecessors. He enjoyed the use of a second set of castle levels to significantly extend the length of the game, a tradition carried on by the next two titles in the series.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty women {{stand in}} a field and declare their {{agreement}} on a platitude or statement; for example, [...] "Thirty Helens agree: If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> idea, you should write it down." [...] One time they disagreed, but later agreed to disagree. At one point, only 29 Helens agreed that promptness was important (the thirtieth Helen was running late). The Helens appeared frequently throughout the first season, but did not appear in any subsequent seasons. According to Bruce McCulloch (in the Oral History segment of the Season 1 DVD set), 30 Helens Agree was his idea.|$|E
2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's not that hard. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> script that's what gets you involved. People say they can't find me. Well, if you can write a good script, that's a lot harder than finding someone. I don't worry about it; it's not my problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} all one {{needs to be a}} good {{photographer}} is “eyes” with the intention of seeing, the ability to see and to reflection on what is seen. “The whole world thinks that to take super photographs, one needs super knowledge, super equipment, super locations and with the humble “disposable” camera that is at home, never make anything interesting…” He stated that the technology of photography has made the basics accessible to children and knowing all of {{it is not necessary to}} know when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> picture or not. He himself often took pictures with nothing more than a Nikon snapshot camera, saying he needed nothing more. He quoted Pancho Villa who said to his troops when asked what to do “You shoot, then check what has happened.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't care, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{deal to do}} with it, nevertheless. When {{you were}} eight or nine years old, I was seven feet high, and as pretty as a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. Then we'll {{say good-bye}} now. Good-bye, Peters. Mind <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time in America. I'll tell my father you called." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Staveley began nicely; [...] "I suppose, Eunice, {{you have}} often been told that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> figure, and that you walk well?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{we want to}} {{hear what}} you've got to tell too," [...] said Dora, with a merry laugh. She was looking {{straight}} into Dick's eyes. [...] "Have <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time at the Hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Far, far away, my dear. Put my {{gardenia}} in, your buttonhole. Stop, I'll pin it in. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> rest {{all this}} week? Do {{you like my}} dress? It's new. <b>You</b> wouldn't <b>have</b> noticed it, would you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You had two nights' arrears {{to make up}} for, {{and nature}} {{is not to be}} outraged in that way with impunity. I am very thankful that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> night, for I was really anxious about you yesterday." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, but I {{observe the}} second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove. <b>You</b> must <b>have</b> started early, and yet <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> drive in <b>a</b> dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes: I {{was beating}} out some bags. And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> bonfire up there? I saw the light. Why did Miss Vye want a bonfire {{so bad that}} she should give you sixpence to keep it up?" ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{covered him}} with {{blankets}} {{and put him}} away like a child. [...] "Now <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> sleep," [...] she said, tenderly. [...] "I'll call you when daddy comes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{message for}} <b>you</b> from Gilbert about your brother Bryan,' she said, {{and he could}} not defend himself from manifesting eager interest, as she told of the tea-party; but that over, it was in stiff formal English that he said, 'I hope <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right--ALL RIGHT?" [...] Delia Dosson repeated, {{springing}} up. [...] "Yes indeed--I {{should say}} so!"

[...] And then in still another: [...] "Well, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time at Nice?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't mind me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, {{waving a}} hand in the {{direction}} of the salmon-coloured tickets; [...] "I hope <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time, General. When do you go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Michael Bloomfield, {{you know}} your business," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> character. Leave your address. When I have {{consulted}} your references, you shall hear from me." ...|$|E
