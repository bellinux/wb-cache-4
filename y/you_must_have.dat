25|$|Notice {{that this}} kinematical {{discussion}} does not {{delve into the}} mechanism by which the required forces are generated. That {{is the subject of}} kinetics. In the case of the carousel, the kinetic discussion would involve perhaps a study of the walker's shoes and the friction they need to generate against the floor of the carousel, or perhaps the dynamics of skateboarding, if the walker switched to travel by skateboard. Whatever the means of travel across the carousel, the forces calculated above must be realized. A very rough analogy is heating your house: <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> a certain temperature to be comfortable, but whether you heat by burning gas or by burning coal is another problem. Kinematics sets the thermostat, kinetics fires the furnace.|$|E
25|$|Hua Jin 化劲 ('Transforming Jin') - This is {{considered}} the highest stage of practice. <b>You</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> already grasped the stages of Ming Jin and An Jin and {{have a very strong}} foundation in them. You should {{have a lot of experience}} in fighting as you must know that this stage is 'Sheji Cong Ren' (same as in Taijiquan). Give up yourself and comply with the opponent. Use 'Zhan, Lian, Nian, and Sui' (sticky, link, adhering, and complying). Everywhere you need to be empty and not exerting strength. The whole body must be blending and smooth (hun yuan - smooth roundness) and not starting and stopping. This is the skill of 'The opponent does not know me, I alone know the opponent.' At any time, place, or moment you can emit (fa), but only emitting force at the precise moment. This is the Hua Jing stage.|$|E

500|$|... "You Must Love Me" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who had reunited for Evita after a ten-year {{creative}} separation due to their individual projects. It was written specifically for the film, {{so that it would}} contain new material and be eligible for an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. Madonna noted it as her favorite song from the film, recalling that the idea for [...] "You Must Love Me" [...] grew when Parker re-arranged the ending of the film from the original play, with the hopes of reuniting Rice and Webber to create new music. According to Webber, the purpose of the song was to showcase Perón's emotional state at the time as well as her relationship with her husband Juan Perón; [...] " [...] is dying and she knows she's dying. One reason she is saying, 'You must love me', is out of desperation. She's also saying, 'You must love me because <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> always loved me', so it's a little word play, I guess, which Tim Rice has written", he explained. It was released as the soundtrack's first official single on October 27, 1996. Since its release, the song has been included in several productions of the play, including the 2006 London production and the 2012 Broadway revival.|$|E

At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> an awful lot of free time on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale was going to be like. Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, you feel <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E

500|$|There was a Ceklin zduhać {{who was so}} {{beaten by}} other zduhaći {{that he had to}} die, and there he was, dying. Various {{remedies}} were brought to him, but he accepted none, because all was in vain. Finally he had everybody ushered out of his house, except for one of his brothers, a famous hero; all were also driven away from the door, to prevent eavesdropping. Then the dying man said to his brother: [...] "I will surely die, if I am not substituted for; and you can do it and save me, if you will have enough strength." [...] The brother, of course, promised that, and the sick man continued: [...] "You will have to go tonight to Mount So-and-so, at three to four hours' walking distance from here, most of the way lying through a dense forest. You will come beneath a stair-like cliff and stop there, and a great fear will seize you. To encourage yourself, take your two pistols and a knife with the silver sheath." [...] "I will also take a musket," [...] added the brother, and the sick man said, [...] "You may take that too, though only as an encouragement, as it will be of no use to you, but <b>you</b> <b>must</b> <b>have</b> the knife." [...] "I can go without any weapon, with a pocket knife, if it is against a single, and with a weapon I can go against a hundred," [...] interrupted the brother again. [...] "Take it easy with your boldness," [...] resumed the sick man, [...] "and by all means take the knife. When you come beneath the cliff, the sky will be cloudless, lit, {{and there will be a}} silence in the air; then you will notice a wisp of cloud coming from the direction of Mount Rumija, and the wind will start to blow. The wisp will turn into an enormous storm cloud that will cover all the sky, and there will come a darkness such as you have never seen before; the wind will blow, whistle, roar, and shriek, as you have also never heard before; the hair will rise on your head so that it will lift your cap, and I fear that you may go mad from horror. And if you persevere, you will see three bulls falling down from the cloud on the earth: a light-haired, a pied, and a dark-haired bull. The latter two will start to beat the former, which is the weakest, because it is already wounded. Make sure to strike the two bulls with the knife; but take care not to cut the light-haired bull; that would be the death of me, as it would be if the two bulls overcame the light-haired bull." ...|$|E
