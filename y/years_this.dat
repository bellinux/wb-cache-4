Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's latent phase theory.|$|E

The team set a new club record on 12 March 2011 with 14 away matches unbeaten, breaking a previous record held for over 50 <b>years.</b> <b>This</b> 17-match streak was finally broken by Bristol City {{on the last day of}} the 2010–11 season, Hull losing the match 3–0.|$|E

Director Bai Chen (白沉) chose her to play the leading role as a heroic nurse, {{a far cry from}} her traditional roles of socialites and rich wives. She adjusted to her new role well, and portrayed a wide variety of characters in many films including It's My Day Off (1959), Spring Comes to the Withered Tree (1961, director Zheng Junli), Early Spring in February (1963, director Xie Tieli), and Stage Sisters (1965, director Xie Jin).

These years {{cemented}} his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert. In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many <b>years.</b> <b>This</b> caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation. Ironically, it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure. In the United States, the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union.|$|E

On 25 February 1932, the interior minister of Brunswick, Dietrich Klagges, {{who was a member}} of the NSDAP, appointed Hitler as administrator for the state's delegation to the Reichsrat in Berlin, making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick, and thus of Germany.|$|E

5|$|At one time, stable carbenes {{were thought}} to {{reversibly}} dimerise through the so-called Wanzlick equilibrium. However, imidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-5-ylidenes are thermodynamically stable and do not dimerise, and have been stored in solution {{in the absence of}} water and air for <b>years.</b> <b>This</b> is presumably due to the aromatic nature of these carbenes, which is lost upon dimerisation. In fact imidazol-2-ylidenes are so thermodynamically stable that only in highly constrained conditions are these carbenes forced to dimerise.|$|E
