500|$|Delphine LaLaurie {{appears as}} a {{character}} in Deadtime Stories, a PC game, ( [...] ; developed by I-play and distributed by Big Fish Games), as a [...] queen named Jessie Bodeen tells <b>you</b> <b>her</b> story of her commission by Delphine LaLaurie to drive away another socialite who was new in town and already more popular than Delphine Lalaurie, only for Delphine LaLaurie to renege on the deal when Jessie Bodeen had kept up her end of it.

500|$|Many reviewers have {{commented on}} the sexiness {{displayed}} in the video. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine commented that the video was [...] "sexy" [...] and that [...] "Beyoncé pops it back for a mysterious detective." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy wrote that Beyoncé dances [...] "seductively" [...] in the office. Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine wrote: [...] "To anyone who finds Beyoncé attractive or has ever wanted her to dance for them, we bring <b>you</b> <b>her</b> latest video. The visuals for 'Dance for You' {{are more or less}} a chance for her to show off why so many of you think her husband, Jay-Z, is the luckiest man alive." [...] Leah Collins of Canadian magazine Dose wrote, [...] "It's all very sultry and intimate to a point—that point being the moment she unveils a line-up of back-up dancers." [...] Similarly, a writer of the website Idolator commented, [...] "'Dance for You' doesn't compare to the spectacle of say, the 'Run the World (Girls)' clip, but it is effective. [...] It's a mostly private dance—until all those other ladies show up." [...] The writer also called Beyoncé a femme fatale in the video. Likewise, Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post wrote that Beyoncé [...] "goes full on femme fatale" [...] and concluded that the concept of the video [...] "is about as straightforward as can be". Marc Hogan of Spin magazine noted, [...] "The video follows pretty literally from the song's theme, with Mrs. Jay-Z grinding sensuously." [...] A writer of Vibe magazine noted that Beyoncé was [...] "keeping things sexy" [...] with the video for the song.|$|E

2500|$|Subsequently, in the 2008 series, the Doctor's {{friendship}} with Donna Noble is strengthened, after the infatuations with Martha and Rose, {{by the knowledge}} that she has no romantic interest in him whatsoever. Davies' last clear allusion to the Doctor's romantic capacity occurs {{at the beginning of his}} last episode as showrunner, The End of Time. The Tenth Doctor claims to have married [...] "Good Queen Bess, and let me tell <b>you,</b> <b>her</b> nickname is no longer... (clears throat)", a reference to Elizabeth I of England's nickname [...] "The Virgin Queen". The marriage, which is referred to as [...] "a mistake", explained Queen Elizabeth's reaction to seeing the Tenth Doctor in an earlier episode, [...] "The Shakespeare Code". Subsequent episodes have alluded to this romantic, possibly sexual relationship. This relationship, including the marriage and the [...] "mistake" [...] which led to it (a case of mistaken identity involving a Zygon commander in 1562), eventually unfolds on screen in [...] "The Day of the Doctor".|$|E
