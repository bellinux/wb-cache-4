6000|$|He had {{purchased}} {{a house and}} estate at Merton, in Surrey, meaning to pass his days there in the society of Sir William and Lady Hamilton. He had indulged in pleasant dreams when looking on to this as his place of residence and rest. [...] "To be sure," [...] he says, [...] "we shall employ the tradespeople of our village in preference to any others in what we want for common use, and give them every encouragement to be kind and attentive to us." [...] "Have we a nice church at Merton? We will set an example of goodness to the under-parishioners. I admire the pigs and poultry. Sheep are certainly most beneficial to eat off the grass. Do <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> for them, and take care that they are kept on the premises all night, for that is the time they do good to the land. They should be folded. Is your head-man a good person, and true to our interest? I intend to have a farming-book. I expect that all animals will increase where you are, for I never expect that you will suffer any to be killed. No person can take amiss our not visiting. The answer from me will always be very civil thanks, but that I wish to live retired. We shall have our sea-friends; and I know Sir William thinks they are the best." [...] This place {{he had never seen}} till he was now welcomed there by the friends to whom he had so passionately devoted himself, and who were not less sincerely attached to him. The place, and everything which Lady Hamilton had done to it, delighted him; and he declared that the longest liver should possess it all. Here he amused himself with angling in the Wandle, having been a good fly-fisher in former days, and learning now to practise with his left hand what he could no longer pursue as a solitary diversion. His pensions for his victories, and for the loss of his eye and arm, amounted with his half-pay to about L3400 a-year. From this he gave L1800 to Lady Nelson, L200 to a brother's widow, and L150 for the education of his children; and he paid L500 interest for borrowed money; so that Nelson was comparatively a poor man; and though much of the pecuniary embarrassment which he endured was occasioned by the separation from his wife--even if that cause had not existed, his income would not have been sufficient for the rank which he held, and the claims which would necessarily be made upon his bounty. The depression of spirits under which he had long laboured arose partly from this state of his circumstances, and partly from the other disquietudes in which his connection with Lady Hamilton had involved him--a connection which it was not possible his father could behold without sorrow and displeasure. Mr. Nelson, however, was soon persuaded that the attachment, which Lady Nelson regarded with natural jealousy and resentment, did not in reality pass the bounds of ardent and romantic admiration: a passion which the manners and accomplishments of Lady Hamilton, fascinating as they were, {{would not have been able}} to excite, if they had not been accompanied by more uncommon intellectual endowments, and by a character which, both in its strength and in its weakness, resembled his own. It did not, therefore, require much explanation to reconcile him to his son--an event the more essential to Nelson's happiness, because, a few months afterwards, the good old man died at the age of seventy-nine.|$|E

40|$|Background: Work is {{important}} for mental health but we are only just beginning to understand why so few people with psychosis in the UK work. Aims: To identify the opinions of a purposive sample of patients with psychosis on themes related to employment. Method: A thematic analysis of 15 semi-structured interviews with people with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder. Results: Participants identified a range of advantages to working but also expressed substantial doubts. Symptoms, medication and potential damage to health are the problems that people believe affect their ability to work. Most people would not tell their employers about their illness because they feared dis-crimination during the selection process, but believed it could help their chances of retaining a job if employers knew. A number reported a lack of encouragement to work from mental health professionals and not enough helpful employment services. Conclusions: Although most people want to work, given the pressures they face some may choose not to. Barriers that people face are {{both internal and external}} and these interact. BACKGROUND Unemployment is known to be harmful {{to the health of the}} general population (Bartley, 1994) as well as being an element of the social exclusion that those with severe mental illness (SMI) face. Health and social services in the UK have a responsibility to lessen this exclusion and reduce discrimination and a requirement to consider employment in the care plans of those with SMI (Department of Health, 1999). The economic cost of unemployment among the mentally ill is high, both to the state and the individuals concerned (Boardman, 2003 a; Huxley & Thornicroft, 2003). There is a distinction between employment and work. Work is ‘essentially something you do for other people ’ whereas employment ‘is work <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> for ’ (Boardman, 2003 b). Among the long term disabled, people with SMI find it more difficult to get employment than those with physical disabilities and it is only thos...|$|E

I often {{think about it and}} the good times connected with my two years there. I was especially interested in learning the whereabouts of Ben Scuda + Johnnie Hall having been in both their classes. It looks like there won’t be any male teachers left which brings up the question what will the girls do, especially if Prof. Lambert goes? [?] la [?]. Just when I was about fed up with Africa I was sent here to Sicily which I like alot [sic] better. The cities are more modern and there is more to see and do. I only wish I could name specific places and incidents but it is impossible. There are ancient Greek ruins, Bishops’ (?) palaces, castels [sic] + etc…. There are a few automobiles but mostly carriages and 2 wheeled carts, and then there is always the head to carry bundles upon. The wine is real good – I know! Reminded me of the old Scott House days. Am having quite a little trouble learning to speak Italian. So for I have added an e or o to the French words + got along. The young girls, Seniorina’s, are very pretty, mostly being dark eyed + haired + not unlike Lana Turner. Most of them understand a little English which all helps to promote friendship. I have run across quite a few Sicilians who have been to America at some time or another + most all of them think Brooklyn is the U. S. One fellow even asked me how the Dodgers were coming along. To the [?] tobacco + cigarettes is a luxury. Little kids follow you around begging cigarettes or even butts for “Papa”. You can get hair cuts, shaves, watermelon, musk melon + all sorts of fruits for a little bag of “Bull Durham” which is rationed to us along with pipe tobacco + cigarettes. Thank goodness the money situation is simple, if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>paid</b> regular. Our penny is equal to 1 Italian lire, so we just substitute lire for dollar. They do have fractions of lires but we don’t bother with them, telling them to keep the change which they think is something big. We have been able to buy ice cream {{for a couple of hours}} a day when it usually runs out. You have to get there early to beat the officers. It is alot [sic] like sherbet but some places make ice cream. Most of the restaurants are closed but the ones that are open have the always present spaghetti + Macaroni. Guess I have about covered everything so will go to bed + prepare to fight the “dive bombing” mosquitos [sic] they have here. They just blast their way through our nets so we can’t escape.

At that time, {{when it was}} still hoped that musical standards might be preserved, it was quite permissible to ridicule the ludicrous, as Freberg had obviously thought when he parodied Presley.
