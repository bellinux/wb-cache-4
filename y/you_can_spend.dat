6000|$|A sort of propagandist enthusiasm {{grew up in}} the men. They felt it {{incumbent}} upon them to persuade the Traffords to return.

60|$|There {{is nothing}} morbid or narrow in Burns's letters. They are frank and healthy. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> a day over them, and feel {{at the end}} of it as if you had been {{wandering}} at large through the freedom of nature. They seem to have been written in the open air. The first condition necessary to an appreciative understanding of them is to concern yourself with the sentiment. And, indeed, the strength and sincerity of the sentiment by-and-by draw you away to oblivion of the style, however much it may at first strike you as redundant and affected. They are not the letters of a literary man. They have nothing suggestive of the studious chamber and the midnight lamp. There is often a narrowness of idea in the merely literary man which limits his auditory to men of his peculiar pattern. To this narrowness Burns, with all his faults of style, was a stranger. His letters are the utterances of a man who refused to be imprisoned in any single department of human thought. He was no specialist, pinned to one standpoint, and making the width of the world commensurate with the narrowness of his own horizon. He moved about, he looked abroad; he had no pet subject, no restricted field of study; nature and human nature in their multitudinous phases and many retreats were his range, and he expressed his views as freely and vigorously as he took them.|$|E

6000|$|This is the reason: That the English {{have laws}} and obey them, and the gipsies have none. This {{is the whole}} secret. This is why savages remain poor and miserable, that each man does what he likes without law. This is why civilised nations like England thrive and prosper, because they have laws and obey them, and every man does not do what he likes, but what the law likes. Laws are made not {{for the good of}} one person here, or the other person there, but for the good of all; and, therefore, the very notion of a civilised country is, a country in which people cannot do what they like with their own, as the savages do. [...] "Not do what he likes with his own?" [...] Certainly not; no one can or does. If you have property, you cannot spend it all as you like. You have to pay a part of it to the government, that is, into the common stock, for the common good, in the shape of rates and taxes, before <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> any of it on {{yourself}}. If you take wages, you cannot spend them all upon yourself and do what you like with them. If you do not support your wife and family out of them, the law will punish you. You cannot do what you like with your own gun, for you may not shoot your neighbour's cattle or game with it. You cannot do what you like with your own hands, for the law forbids you to steal with them. You cannot do what you like with your own feet, for the law will punish you for trespassing on your neighbour's ground without his leave. In short, you can only do with your own what will not hurt your neighbour, in such matters as the law can take care of. And more, in any great necessity the law may actually hurt you {{for the good of the}} nation at large. The law may compel you to sell your land, to your own injury, if it is wanted for a railroad. The law may compel you, as it did fifty years ago, to serve as a soldier in the militia, to your own injury, if there is a fear of foreign invasion; so that the law is above each and all of us. Our own wills are not our masters. No man is his own master. The law is the master of each and all of us, and if we will not obey it willingly, it can make us obey unwillingly.|$|E
60|$|If, as some think, {{it be the}} purport of Christ's {{religion}} to teach men to live after a godlike fashion rather than to worship God after a peculiar form, then may we be allowed to say that Cicero was almost a Christian, even before the coming of Christ. If, as some think, an eternity of improved existence for all is to be looked for by the disciples of Christ, rather than a heaven of glory for the few and for the many, a hell that never shall be mitigated, then had Cicero anticipated much of Christ's doctrine. That he should have approached the mystical portion of our religion it would of course be absurd to suppose. But a belief in that mystical part is not essential for forming the conduct of men. The divine birth, and {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity, and the Lord's Supper, are not necessary to teach a man to live with his brother men on terms of forbearance and brotherly love. You shall live with a man from year's end to year's end, and shall not know his creed unless he tell you, or that you see him performing the acts of his worship; but you cannot live with him, and not know whether he live in accordance with Christ's teaching. And so it was with Cicero. Read his works through from the beginning to the end, and you shall feel that you are living with a man whom you might accompany across the village green to church, should he be kind enough to stay with you over the Sunday. The urbanity, the softness, the humanity, the sweetness are all there. But you shall not find it to be so with Cæsar, or Lucretius, or with Virgil. When you read his philosophical treatises it is as though you were discussing with some latter-day scholar the theories of Plato or of Epicurus. He does not talk of them as though he believed in them for his soul's guidance, nor do you expect it. All the interest that you have in the conversation would be lost were you to find such faith as that. You would avoid the man, as a pagan. The Stoic doctrine would so shock you, when brought out for real wear, as to make you feel yourself in the company of some mad Atheist--with a man for whose welfare, early or late in life, church bells had never been rung. But with a man who has his Plato simply by heart <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>spend</b> the long summer day in sweet conversation. So it is with Cicero. You lie down with him looking out upon the sea at Comæ, or sit with him beneath the plane-tree of Crassus, and listen while he tells you of this doctrine and the other. So Arcesilas may be supposed to have said, and so Carneades laid down the law. It was that and no more. But when he tells you of the place assigned to you in heaven, and how you are to win it, then he is in earnest.|$|E

5000|$|The Asbury Park Comicon {{was founded}} by Cliff Galbraith of Crucial Entertainment, LLC. The show was {{conceived}} when Galbraith attended and observed crowds of people looking through cardboard boxes filled with albums.

[...] Comparing his convention to the enormous crowds of the much larger New York Comic-Con, which takes place in nearby Manhattan, Galbraith comments, [...] "What we offer {{is a much more}} civilized, intimate setting. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> really <b>spend</b> time with the artist.

[...] Galbraith wanted to create a convention that emphasized comics over the film and television promotions around which many of the conventions they had attended had become centered. The first show took place on May 2, 2012, at the Asbury Lanes live music and bowling venue in Asbury Park, New Jersey. The event featured guests Evan Dorkin, Sarah Dyer, Stephanie Buscema, Jamal Igle, and Steve Mannion.|$|R
