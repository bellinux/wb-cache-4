500|$|I am very {{grateful}} that my show was so well received {{all over the}} world. But {{there seems to be}} many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all. There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers 'confess' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame. My 'confession' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from. This is not a mocking of the church. It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or 'Taking Up the Cross' as it says in the Bible. My performance is neither anti-Christian, sacrilegious or blasphemous. Rather, it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole. I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing. My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day, and are living without care, without medicine and without hope.

500|$|Contrary to speculation, Henderson's {{refusal to}} officially retire {{had not been}} delaying his {{eligibility}} for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period {{has been based on}} major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, [...] "I believe today, and people say I’m crazy, but if <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Billboard, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is [...] "brimming {{with sexual}} innuendo". In the song, [...] "Madonna yearns {{for a man}} to open her lock with his key. And yes, that means exactly what you think it does." [...] The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct {{position}} expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago Fouz-Hernández in the line [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> half a chance you'd see; My desire burning inside of me." [...] According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from A3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of F–E9–E/G–Gm7–F as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Turning Tables" [...] {{is a song}} of {{domestic}} dispute, where its narrator assumes a defensive stance against a manipulative ex-lover. Reconciling herself with the termination of a contentious relationship, she vows emotional distance to shield herself from future heartbreak. Bryan Boyd of The Irish Times likened the singer to 1980s Welsh rocker Bonnie Tyler in delivering the vocals {{with a mixture of}} anger, pain and pathos. According to Paste magazine, cinematic strings [...] "serve as fitting counterpoint to [...] heartbroken, hollowed-out lyrics." [...] "Turning Tables" [...] opens with a piano sequence after which Adele sings the first lines: [...] "Close enough to start a war/All that I have is on the floor". The chorus consists of the lyrics: [...] "So I won't let you / Close enough to hurt me / No, I won't rescue / You to just desert me / I can't give you / The heart you think <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> / It's time to say goodbye / To turning tables." ...|$|E

2500|$|Note {{that the}} {{synthetic}} future and conditional have largely disappeared from Brazilian speech. [...] The synthetic future is generally replaced by ir + infinitive (e.g. vou cantar [...] "I will sing"), while the conditional is replaced {{either by the}} imperfect (especially in its modal use; se você me desse dinheiro, eu cantava [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> money, I would sing") or by the imperfect of ir + infinitive (in its non-modal, [...] "future of the past" [...] usage; ele disse que ia cantar [...] "he {{said that he would}} sing"). [...] However, the synthetic future subjunctive is still in common use (e.g. se você for [...] "if you should go"). [...] The synthetic future and conditional of verbs with one-syllable infinitives also sometimes occur (e.g. será/seria [...] "it will/would be" [...] or in the compound tenses terá/teria sido [...] "it will/would have been").|$|E
2500|$|After {{switching}} to ABC Records {{in the late}} 1960s, he found himself {{at the top of}} the charts again, beginning with the first song he recorded, [...] "I'll Take Care of Your Cares". Written as a waltz in the mid-1920s, [...] "Cares" [...] had become the unofficial theme song of the Las Vegas call girls, but was virtually unknown outside of the Strip. Laine recorded a swinging version that made it to number 39 on the national and number 2 on the adult contemporary charts. A string of hits followed including [...] "Making Memories", [...] "You Wanted Someone to Play With", [...] "Laura (What's He Got That I Ain't Got)", [...] "To Each His Own", [...] "I Found You", and [...] "Lord, <b>You</b> <b>Gave</b> <b>Me</b> A Mountain" [...] (which was written by Marty Robbins). The last song was a number one hit on the adult contemporary chart (#24 national), and proved that Laine was as big a hit-maker as ever. His last single to hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart (peaking at No.86 national) was [...] "Dammit Isn't God's Last Name".|$|E
2500|$|Following in {{the path}} of Canadian {{composer}} Colin McPhee, who had done extensive research in Indonesian music in the 1930s and wrote a number of compositions incorporating Balinese and Javanese elements, Harrison's style began to change, showing the influence of gamelan music more clearly if only in timbre: [...] "It was the sound itself that attracted me. In New York, when I changed gears out of twelve tonalism, I explored this timbre. The gamelan movements in my Suite for Violin, Piano, and Small Orchestra [...] are aural imitations of the generalized sounds of gamelan". Virgil Thomson (with whom Harrison also studied) gave him a copy of Harry Partch's book on musical tuning, Genesis of a Music, which prompted Harrison to start writing music in just intonation. He did not abandon equal temperament altogether, but often expressed a desire to do so. In an oft-quoted comment referring to the frequency ratios used in just intonation, he said, [...] "I'd long thought that I would love a time when musicians were numerate as well as literate. I'd love to be a conductor and say, 'Now, cellos, <b>you</b> <b>gave</b> <b>me</b> 10:9 there, please give me a 9:8 instead,' I'd love to get that!" ...|$|E
