Burton Folsom Jr. has noted, he sometimes gave {{tens of thousands of}} dollars to Christian groups, while, at the same time, he was trying to borrow over a million dollar to expand his business. His philosophy of giving was founded upon biblical principles. He truly believed in the biblical principle found in Luke 6:38, [...] "Give, and it will be given to you.

500|$|Critical {{response}} was almost uniformly positive. [...] The New York Daily News headline proclaimed [...] "Hair Revival's High Fun". [...] The review praised the daring direction, [...] "colorfully kinetic" [...] choreography and technical {{accomplishments of the}} show, especially the lighting, commening that [...] "as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom, [...] highly communicable"; but warning: [...] "If you're seated on the aisle, count on [...] {{to be in your}} face or <b>your</b> <b>lap</b> or ... braiding your tresses." [...] The New York Post wrote that the production [...] "has emerged triumphant.... These days, the nation is fixated less on war and more on the economy. [...] As a result, the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race." [...] Variety enthused, [...] "Director Diane Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast connect with the material in ways that cut right to the 1967 rock musical's heart, generating tremendous energy that radiates to the rafters. ... What could have been mere nostalgia instead becomes a full-immersion happening. ... If this explosive production doesn't stir something in you, {{it may be time to}} check your pulse." [...] The Boston Globe dissented, saying that the production [...] "felt canned" [...] and [...] "overblown" [...] and that the revival [...] "feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib".

6000|$|It is {{a strange}} thing this bed, this mimic grave, where we stretch our tired limbs and sink away so quietly into the silence and rest.

60|$|Palm. I {{know too}} well when, first my love began, When at our wake {{you for the}} chaplet ran: Then I was made {{the lady of the}} May, And, with the garland, at the goal did stay: Still, as you ran, I kept you full in view; I hoped, and wished, and ran, methought, for you. As you came near, I hastily did rise, And {{stretched}} my arm outright, that held the prize. The custom was to kiss whom I should crown; You kneeled, and in my <b>lap</b> <b>your</b> head laid down: I blushed, and blushed, and did the kiss delay; At last my subjects forced me to obey: But, when I gave the crown, and then the kiss, I scarce had breath to say, Take that,--and this.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} on the game include pit stops and spotters. The pit stop feature displays the pit crew changing the tires and fueling the car. Pit stops average 14 seconds. Each animation was actually photographed from real Sprint Cup Series teams. The spotter feature informs the player of the drivers in the race that assists them, such as bump drafting, blocking, and slingshot. The spotter also alerts the player of any hazards happening ahead, as well as behind. Furthermore, the spotter has calculated suggestions on pit strategy, such as fuel level, tire wear, the number of laps remaining, and the player's position in the race and in the point standings. The game has an interactive celebration mode where players can do burnouts and <b>your</b> victory <b>lap,</b> as well. The player then goes to an animation involving an out-of-car celebration, which if you're Carl Edwards, {{can result in a}} backflip off of the car. If he or she is in career mode, they will go to victory lane and pop the ceremonious bottle and pour it all on their team. In the game, players can earn NASCAR experience points to unlock rewards. Some rewards include career sponsorships and special races throughout career mode. These special races are called [...] "invitational events." [...] What these do is allow you to unlock special custom paint schemes after completing each challenge in each event.|$|R

I thought once or twice of jumping into a cab, and flying; of taking refuge in Day and Martin's Blacking Warehouse; of speaking to a policeman, but not one would come. I was this man's slave. I followed him like his dog. I COULD not get away from him. So, you see, I went on meanly conversing with him, and affecting a simpering confidence. I remember, when I was a little boy at school, going up fawning and smiling in this way to some great hulking bully of a sixth-form boy. So I said in a word, [...] "Your ordinarily handsome face wore a disagreeable expression," [...] &c.|$|R
