25|$|Takeover paper. Convertibles have a {{place as}} the {{currency}} used in takeovers. The bidder can offer a higher income on a convertible than the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> a bid victim’s shares, without having to raise the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> all the bidder’s shares. This eases the process for a bidder with low-yield shares acquiring a company with higher-yielding shares. Perversely, the lower the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> the bidder’s <b>shares,</b> {{the easier it is}} for the bidder to create a higher conversion premium on the convertible, with consequent benefits for the mathematics of the takeover. In the 1980s, UK domestic convertibles accounted for about 80pct of the European convertibles market, and over 80pct of these were issued either as takeover currency or as funding for takeovers. They had several cosmetic attractions.|$|R
40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT Research {{conducted}} {{locally and}} internationally has <b>yielded</b> mixed results <b>on</b> <b>share</b> price reaction to open market share repurchase announcements. This research report examines share price reaction to open market share repurchase announcements for securities {{listed on the}} JSE Securities Exchange for the period 01 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. The global financial crisis occurred within this period and cannot be ignored; therefore its impact <b>on</b> <b>share</b> price reaction is also examined. Historical daily returns for securities that announced open market repurchases and the all share index were collected; and the event study methodology {{was used to examine}} the share price reaction and the impact of the global financial crisis <b>on</b> open market <b>share</b> repurchase announcements for securities listed on the JSE Securities Exchange for the period 01 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. This study found the JSE Securities Exchange to be an efficient capital market in the semi-strong form, with more share repurchase announcements in the pre-financial crisis period than in the financial crisis period. The study analysed 90 open market share repurchase announcements and found positive market reaction to share repurchase announcements; however the study did not find any significant abnormal returns to open market share repurchase announcements...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Working at {{home can}} provide people with {{numerous}} benefits— flexibility in their schedules, fewer commutes, {{and opportunities to}} catch up on work. According to the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), about 12 percent of full-time workers with a single job did some work at home on an average day in 2003 – 07. (See table.) However, the ability to work at home is greatly affected by the nature of one’s work because some types of work can be more easily performed at home than others. ATUS data provide insight into which workers were the most likely to do some work at home, and also <b>yield</b> information <b>on</b> the <b>share</b> of total weekly work hours people spent at their workplace, at home, and at other locations. Data presented here are averages for people age 15 years and over and for all 7 days of the week throughout 2003 – 07. Also, data refer only to workers with a single job who were employed full time; that is, they usually worked 35 or more hours per week...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of Alcell (R) lignin in iso-propanol/formic acid mixtures (1 : 1 mass ratio) was explored in a batch set-up using Ru/C as the catalyst (673 K, 4 h, 28 % mass lignin intake on solvent). Lignin oils were obtained in good yields (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) and shown {{to consist of}} a mixture of mainly aromatics (10. 5 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), alkylphenolics (6 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), catechols (8. 7 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), guaiacols (1. 3 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), and alkanes (5. 2 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input), the remainder being soluble higher molecular weight compounds (GCxGC-FID and GPC). The results for the catalytic experiments using formic acid were {{compared with those of}} a non-catalysed experiment and a catalytic hydrotreatment with molecular hydrogen and Ru/C {{in the absence of a}} solvent. Distinct differences in product yields and compositions were observed, and highest lignin oil yields were obtained by catalytic solvolysis (71 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) versus 18 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for noncatalytic solvolysis and 63 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input for catalytic hydrotreatment. The effect of reaction time <b>on</b> oil <b>yields</b> and product composition was established and a reaction network involving depolymerisation, and hydro(-deoxy) genation pathways is proposed to explain the product yields and composition. Besides iso-isopropanol, the use of ethanol and methanol in combination with formic acid was also explored for catalytic solvolysis. Best results were obtained in methanol (4 h, 673 K) leading to a lignin oil (68 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input) containing 11 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of alkylphenolics and 19 % mass <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> lignin input of aromatics.

The {{objective of this}} thesis is to assess the effects of foliage application of magnesium sulfate and urea for potatoes, that are intended for processing into starch production. There were two sorts of potatoes with different vegetation period under study, an early variety called as Bernard and semi-late variety called as Ornella. The foliage fertilizers were applied in three different variants. In the first variant the sorts of potatoes were fertilized by solution of magnesium sulfate, in the second variant by solution of urea and in the third variant the solution of magnesium sulfate and urea was used. The assessment of the experiment consists of <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> tubers, contain of the starch, <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> starch, the average amount of tubers per tuft, the average weight of tubers and profitability of used foliage fertilizers. In the year under the study the increased <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> tubers and on starch was detected in all three used variants.

In US data there is indeed a strikingly high time series correlation between the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> nominal bonds and the dividend <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> equities. This positive correlation is often attributed to the fact that both bond and equity yields comove strongly and positively with expected inflation. Contrary to some of the extant literature, we show that this effect is consistent with modern asset pricing theory incorporating uncertainty about real growth prospects and habit-based risk aversion. In the US, high expected inflation has tended to coincide with periods of heightened uncertainty about real economic growth and unusually high risk aversion, both of which rationally raise equity yields.

For the 40 -year period 1973 - 2012, an autoregressive 2 SLS estimate finds that the ex ante real interest rate <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> ten-year U. S.

40|$|This paper shows that, {{contrary}} to the suggestion of some investment advisors, for an individual Canadian investor subject to personal income taxation, the after-tax return on a discount bond is always higher (or, at worse, equal) to the return on an otherwise identical premium bond. This follows because the tax rate on capital gains {{is lower than the}} tax rate on coupon income in Canada. It is also shown that a decline in the capital gains tax rate raises the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> discount bonds, but reduces the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds, and may even cause the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds to become negative. Further, a cut in the tax rate on interest income raises the after-tax <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> all bonds, but raises the <b>yield</b> <b>on</b> premium bonds relative to discount bonds. While the lower after-tax returns on higher coupon bonds might be expected to cause the pre-tax <b>yields</b> <b>on</b> these bonds to rise, no evidence of such tax capitalization is found using a large dataset of matched pairs of Government of Canada bonds for the period 1986 - 2006. The observed near equality of pre-tax yields since 1995 for otherwise equivalent bonds with different coupons implies that individuals in Canada earn a significantly smaller after-tax return from holding premium bonds than discount bonds. The empirical analysis suggests that the marginal investor in the bond market is an investor who pays the same rate of tax on capital gains and interest income, such as professional investors, financial institutions or pension funds, rather than an individual taxpayer...|$|R
