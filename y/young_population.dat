5|$|Life {{expectancy}} for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 {{years for}} females, and 80.2 years for males. Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality {{is expected to}} decline. New Zealand's fertility rate of 2.1 is relatively high for a developed country, and natural births account for {{a significant proportion of}} population growth. Consequently, the country has a <b>young</b> <b>population</b> compared to most industrialised nations, with 20% of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger. By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5.3 million, the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18% to 29%. In 2008, the leading cause of premature death was cancer, at 29.8%, followed by ischaemic heart disease, 19.7%, and then cerebrovascular disease, 9.2%.|$|E

5|$|Scotland has an {{extensive}} coastline and vast areas of difficult terrain and poor agricultural land. In this period, more land became marginal due to climate change, resulting in relatively light human settlement, {{particularly in the}} interior and Highlands. Northern Britain lacked urban centres and settlements were based on farmsteads and around fortified positions such as brochs, with mixed-farming primarily based on self-sufficiency. In this period, changes in settlement and colonisation meant that the Pictish and Brythonic languages began to be subsumed by Gaelic, English, and, {{at the end of}} the period, by Old Norse. Life expectancy was relatively low, leading to a <b>young</b> <b>population,</b> with a ruling aristocracy, freemen, and relatively large numbers of slaves. Kingship was multi-layered, with different kings surrounded by their war bands that made up the most important elements of armed forces, and who engaged in both low-level raiding and occasional longer-range, major campaigns.|$|E
