5|$|McGrady {{entered the}} NBA {{straight}} {{out of high school}} and was selected as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA draft. Beginning his career as a low-minute player, he gradually improved his role with the team, eventually forming an exciting duo with his cousin Vince Carter. In 2000, he left the Raptors for the Orlando Magic, where {{he became one of the}} league's most prolific scorers and a candidate for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award. In 2004, he was traded to the Houston Rockets, where he paired with center <b>Yao</b> <b>Ming</b> to help the Rockets become a perennial playoff team. His final seasons in the NBA were plagued by injuries, and he retired in 2013 following a brief stint with the Qingdao DoubleStar Eagles of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) and the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} {{advancing}} to the finals, the Rockets traded Malone and had two losing seasons, with the first having a franchise-low 14 victories. This gave Houston two straight first overall picks, used to bring future Hall of Famers Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon, who eventually got the Rockets {{all the way to}} the 1986 Finals, where they lost again to Boston. In the next seven seasons, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times. They did not win their first championship until 1994, when Olajuwon led them to a franchise-best 58 wins, and the championship. The Rockets repeated the feat in 1995, but in the following seasons, they did not advance to the finals again. They missed the playoffs from 1999 to 2003, and did not reach the playoffs again until they drafted <b>Yao</b> <b>Ming</b> in 2003. However, they would not advance past the first round of the playoffs for 13 years. In the 2007–08 NBA season, the Rockets had their most successful campaign in the 2000s, winning 55 games, with 22 of those victories in a row, but still lost in the first round. The following season, the team managed to win a playoff series for the first time since 1997, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs and pushed the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2009 Western Conference Semifinals.|$|E

40|$|Elucidating the {{structures}} of intermediates in the reduction of O 2 to water by cytochrome c oxidase is crucial to understanding both oxygen activation and proton pumping by the enzyme. In the work here, the reaction of O 2 with the mixed-valence enzyme, in which only heme a 3 and CuB in the binuclear center are reduced, has been followed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy. The results show that O=O bond cleavage occurs within the first 200 μs after reaction initiation; {{the presence of a}} uniquely stable Fe—O—O(H) peroxy species is not detected. The product of this rapid reaction is a heme a 3 oxoferryl (FeIV=O) species, which requires that an electron donor in addition to heme a 3 and CuB must be involved. The available evidence suggests that the additional donor is an amino acid side chain. Recent crystallographic data [Yoshikawa, S., Shinzawa-Itoh, K., Nakashima, R., Yaono, R., Yamashita, E., Inoue, N., <b>Yao,</b> <b>M.,</b> Fei, M. J., Libeu, C. P., Mizushima, T., et al. Science, in press; Ostermeier, C., Harrenga, A., Ermler, U. & Michel, H. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 10547 – 10553] show that one of the CuB ligands, His 240, is cross-linked to Tyr 244 and that this cross-linked tyrosyl is ideally positioned to participate in dioxygen activation. We propose a mechanism for O—O bond cleavage that proceeds by concerted hydrogen atom transfer from the cross-linked His—Tyr species to produce the product oxoferryl species, CuB 2 +—OH−, and the tyrosyl radical. This mechanism provides molecular structures for two key intermediates that drive the proton pump in oxidase; moreover, it has clear analogies to the proposed O—O bond forming chemistry that occurs during O 2 evolution in photosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|Shingles is {{a painful}} {{condition}} {{that will affect}} one in three Americans 1. Currently, there are few therapeutic options available 1. The Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), causes chickenpox in children and shingles in individuals with compromised immune systems. Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) uses high voltages to ionize gases and create reactive species. When used topically on tissue infections CAP has demonstrated its ability to stimulate an immune response and reduce healing time. It {{has also been shown}} to exhibit virucidal properties against feline calicivirus 2, MS 2 virus 3, and flu viruses 4. Moreover, during a randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial CAP demonstrated its ability to decrease healing time of Herpes Zoster lesions in hospitalized individuals 5. We hypothesize that topical application of CAP to VZV-infected cells will elicit deactivation of the virus and greatly reduce the recovery period for shingles infection. Ongoing experiments should demonstrate as CAP exposure increases viral plaque formation will decrease. These results would suggest viral inactivation was accomplished using CAP. Citations 1. Roxas M.
