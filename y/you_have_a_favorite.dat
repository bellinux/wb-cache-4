Lead designer John Edwards said that characters are differentiated by features such as power and speed. Producer Shaun Himmerick said that the internal and external character design required [...] "two months or ten weeks". Boon said that an exclusive character was planned for the Xbox 360 version, but [...] "unfortunately, the circumstances didn't allow us to make a 360 exclusive."

Our research will also help us answer fundamental questions about how the blight fungus attacks and kills chestnuts, as well as offering us a window into how blight resistance functions. Exploring the molecular genetics of the blight fungus and integrating it with similar data on the host can help us to identify the specific genes for resistance, which would represent a huge step forward in our understanding. Our needs this year include $ 107, 000 to fund ongoing research. ” – Dr. Fred Hebard Dr. Fred Hebard is TACF’s chief scientist and is responsible for the breeding and science programs carried out a...|$|E
40|$|As regular {{readers of}} this blog know, I spent late June and much of July in Shanghai, with brief trips {{to other parts of}} China. One aspect of this sojourn in the PRC that proved memorable was the {{opportunity}} it afforded me to finally meet several people whose reporting or commentaries I’ve admired, but whose paths had never crossed mine before, including Kaiser Kuo (whose Sinica podcasts we’ve talked up here before), David Barboza of the New York Times (whose day-in-the-life of a South China worker I singled out for praise in a recent commentary), freelancer Adam Minter (who has probably done more than any other single individual to help American readers understand China’s first World’s Fair, via posts like this one), and Scott Tong of Marketplace (whose excellent series on birth control was recently flagged on this blog). Scott was about to head back to the U. S. when we got a brief chance to chat, so I came {{up with a way to}} carry on our conversation via cyberspace and also make it accessible to others. I asked him if he’d be willing to take some time on the long plane ride across the Pacific ahead of him to answer several questions. He was good enough to oblige. So here, in a continuation of the Q-and-A series I’ve done in the past with the likes of Mara Hvistendahl (who put me in touch with both Adam and Scott, incidentally—thanks Mara!), are the responses he sent me once he got back to America: JW: Do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>favorite</b> story you’ve done from your time in China that we can encourage our readers to listen to online?
