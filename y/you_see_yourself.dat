You kind of watch yourself die in a wonderful way, and you experience for the briefest moment–if <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> for a moment through their eyes–everything you believed about yourself gone. In a death-and-rebirth sense.|$|E
500|$|Brosnan {{also raises}} money for {{charitable}} causes through sales of his paintings. After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> in the world…from a very hard time in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E
2500|$|Bernard {{wrote of}} Mary {{under the title}} [...] "Our Lady, Star of the Sea".When the storms to temptation burst upon you, when <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> driven upon the rocks of tribulation, look at the star, call upon Mary. When {{swallowed}} by pride or ambition, or hatred, or jealousy, look at the star, call upon Mary. Should anger, or avarice, or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of your soul, look at the star, call upon Mary. If troubled {{on account of the}} heinousness of your sins, distressed at the filthy state of your conscience, and terrified at the thought of the awful judgment to come, you are beginning to sink into the bottomless gulf of sadness and to be swallowed in the abyss of despair, then think of Mary. In dangers, in doubts, in difficulties, think of Mary, call upon Mary. Let not her name leave thy lips, never suffer it to leave your heart.|$|E
