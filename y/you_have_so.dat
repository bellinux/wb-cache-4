She started with regular training herself and stated that boxing had allowed her to forget the difficulties of her life for a short time: [...] "I could let everything out, my whole energy. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many problems like our family, you need something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try {{to tell you what}} you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E
500|$|Crile's report, {{rather than}} {{exploring}} the thesis {{laid out by}} Reasoner, instead focused in large measure on sexual activity, including men cruising in Buena Vista Park and interviews with so-called sadomasochism consultants. He reported {{that one out of}} every ten deaths in San Francisco was attributable to gay men participating in BDSM and that one gay-oriented BDSM establishment's clientele engaged in sexual activity [...] "so dangerous that they have a gynecological table there with a doctor and nurse on hand to sew people up." [...] He compared San Francisco to the Weimar Republic, asking Cleve Jones, [...] "Isn't it a sign of decadence when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many gays emerging, breaking apart all the values of a society?" [...] Crile also included footage of Feinstein, {{in the midst of a}} run-off election to retain her mayorship, appearing before the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, an LGBT Democrat organization. The program as aired showed Feinstein apologizing for remarks she had made in an earlier Ladies' Home Journal interview, followed immediately by applause.|$|E

500|$|Lead actress Anna Torv later cited two {{scenes in}} [...] "Marionette" [...] {{of which she}} was most proud of during her time on Fringe. The first was Olivia's {{discovery}} that Peter was sleeping with Fauxlivia and her reaction— going through all of her clothes in disgust; the second related to her comment to Peter that she couldn't [...] "believe that you didn't know it was me." [...] Torv explained, [...] "The reason I love those scenes is because it’s really easy to be great in your own bedroom , {{but when you get}} on set <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many different obstacles. The scene with Peter and me outside was done at like 1:30 in the morning, in the middle of town, so we had piles of drunk people screaming up and down the street, and massive fire engines and trucks coming through…. We're doing this quiet scene where I have to cry and we're on the clock, but that’s what TV teaches you -– to just go with it very quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{string of}} poorly {{received}} films ended when Chopra starred in Madhur Bhandarkar's Fashion, a drama about the Indian fashion industry which followed {{the lives and}} careers of several fashion models. She portrayed the ambitious supermodel Meghna Mathur, a role which she initially thought was out of her depth, but after six months' consideration she accepted the role, inspired by Bhandarkar's confidence in her. For the role, Chopra had to gain [...] and steadily shed the weight during the production as the character progressed in the film. Both the film and her performance received critical acclaim, becoming a major turning point in her career. Rajeev Masand wrote, [...] "Priyanka Chopra turns in a respectable performance, one that will inevitably go down as her best." [...] For her performance, she won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Actress, the Filmfare Award for Best Actress, the IIFA Award for Best Actress, the Screen Award for Best Actress, and the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. [...] With a worldwide revenue of , Fashion emerged as a commercial success, and was listed by Subhash K. Jha {{as one of the}} best films of the decade with women protagonists. It was noted for being commercially successful despite being a women-centric film with no male lead. [...] She said in retrospect, [...] "I think actually Fashion kick started... the process of female dominated films. Today <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> many other films which have done well with female leads." ...|$|E

2500|$|Edmund Burke, an English {{political}} thinker, {{was impressed}} by the work of Barruel in uncovering a connection between the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Burke wrote a letter to Barruel and expressed his admiration. He wrote, [...] "I cannot easily express to you how much I am instructed and delighted by the first volume of your History of Jacobinism." [...] He praised [...] "the whole of the wonderful narrative" [...] for being supported by documents and proofs with [...] "the most judicial regularity and exactness." [...] At the end of the letter Burke added: [...] "I forgot to say, that I have known myself, personally, five of your principal conspirators; and I can undertake to say from my own certain knowledge, that {{as far back as the}} year 1773, they were busy in the plot <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> well described, and in the manner, and on the principle <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> truly represented. To this I can speak as a witness." [...] Burkes own works were also filled with references to the philosophe sect and a dislike for their fanaticism, atheism and perversion of public morals.|$|E

2500|$|No direct {{orders to}} commit atrocities by Milošević {{have ever been}} discovered, though little or no effort was made by Milošević to punish people deemed {{responsible}} for such atrocities, including Ratko Mladić who, after being accused of allowing atrocities to occur against Croats in Vukovar, was sent to lead the Army of the Republika Srpska, in which capacity Mladić was accused of ordering atrocities, including the murder of thousands of Bosniak men and boys in Srebrenica. Even after the reports of Srebrenica were released, Milošević refused to accept that Mladić {{was responsible for the}} crimes he was accused of. Wesley Clark, {{who was a member of}} the US team that helped negotiate the 1995 peace agreement ending the Bosnian War, claimed in his testimony during the trial of Milošević that Milošević had prior knowledge of the Srebrenica massacre and knew of Mladić's plans. During the negotiations, Clark had asked Milošević: 'Mr. President, you say <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> much influence over the Bosnian Serbs, but how is it then, if you have such influence, that you allowed General Mladić to kill all those people in Srebrenica?' with Milošević answering: 'Well, General Clark... I warned Mladić not to do this, but he didn't listen to me.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. I will have to return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>so</b> shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
