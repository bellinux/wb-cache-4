500|$|After {{falling in}} love with Suzette, and finding out about her {{marriage}} in September 1993, Vela wrote down his feelings (which he had kept private) for her. The resulting song was titled [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and it was given to Selena to record for the album. When her brother asked her to do a fifth take she replied that she had enough of recording the song. She informed him that [...] "what <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. A.B. approached Pérez and asked if he would be interested in working with Vela on [...] "Ya No", a song he had written. The band was scheduled to record the album the following day. Pérez found his behavior {{nothing out of the ordinary}} and worked on the song with Vela throughout the night [...] "coming up with drum sounds and programing the pattern for it," [...] finalizing its structure before sunrise. Despite A.B.'s assistance, Pérez was dumbfounded that he was given creative control over the track. He added electric guitar riffs and complemented it with his own musical style.|$|E
500|$|Lawrence Tierney {{was cast}} as Alton Benes. He {{was known for}} his bad-guy roles in films during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Dillinger, The Hoodlum and Born to Kill. Tierney's {{appearance}} in the episode is one of his only comedic roles. Cast and crew members were very impressed with Tierney's performance, and intended to make Alton Benes a recurring character. However, they were frightened of him; during filming it was discovered that Tierney had stolen a butcher knife from the knife block in Jerry's apartment set. Various cast members remember Seinfeld encountering Tierney and stating [...] "Hey Lawrence, what do <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> in your jacket?". Tierney, realizing he had been caught, tried to make a joke about how he thought taking the knife would be funny, by reenacting a scene from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), holding the knife above his head and making threatening motions towards Seinfeld. Tom Cherones, Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus saw this happen, and, as Alexander recalled, it [...] "scared the living crap out of all of us." [...] Cherones stated that, afterwards, Larry David would jokingly threaten to have Tierney back on the show if Cherones did his work badly.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Ricky Vela joined Selena y Los Dinos {{as their}} keyboardist. Although Vela was {{attracted}} to the group's drummer, Suzette Quintanilla, he kept his feelings to himself. When he confessed his feelings to Suzette's brother, group manager Abraham Quintanilla, III, he began teasing him about it. After Suzette's September 1993 marriage, Vela wrote [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] and {{it was given to}} Selena to record for Amor Prohibido. Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla did not find the song to have any potential; he has said that he later had a change of heart. Although the song was originally intended as a mariachi track, EMI Latin president Jose Behar believed that a mariachi recording would not appeal to the popular market. The group gave it to Argentine arranger Bebu Silvetti to rework into a pop-style track, and Behar asked Silvetti to [...] "sweeten" [...] the song to boost its airplay and chart performance. The result enhanced Selena's pop-radio success. Behar said in a Billboard interview that the song was [...] "internalized" [...] without affecting the originality of its recording. In a 2002 interview, A.B. said that during a recording session he had asked Selena to record the song for a fifth time. The singer replied, [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> is what you got" [...] and left to go shopping. He mused, [...] "Now looking back, she really did a beautiful job when recording the song, she had so much passion. The song became a classic." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is a rare}} good fellow <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> {{that black}} with the curious hair," [...] the latter said. [...] "What is the man? I never saw one like him." ...|$|R
60|$|But the {{struggle}} between the Spirit and the flesh is not ended <b>there.</b> When <b>you</b> <b>got</b> excited, <b>there</b> would probably come over you the lust of fighting; you would get angry, get mad and lose your self- possession.|$|R
2500|$|An earlier {{agreement}} {{stated that}} {{each member of}} the LLC would only receive [...] "sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000." [...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re going to explain all of how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sergeant}} kept {{turning it}} over in his big fingers. [...] "What's V.V.? Somebody's initials, maybe. What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> Dr. Wood?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Beaton {{had seen}} him, and Dryfoos, with a nonchalant {{nod to the}} young man, came forward. [...] "What <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> Christine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> which <b>there</b> {{is so much}} mystery about?" [...] Mr. Vandyne asked, as {{the gentle}} splash and ripple of water which told that the sailors were {{returning}} to their craft died away in the distance.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might go}} on board some ship, if one brings up at anchor {{anywhere}} near us, Bob. If <b>you</b> <b>got</b> detected, <b>there,</b> {{we would take}} her and rescue you. But that is a different thing to letting you go ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Pearson! is that you?" [...] Mr. Welch asked. [...] "I thought I {{knew your}} long, {{sweeping}} stroke at a distance. You have been hunting, I see; {{that is a}} fine stag <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> What is the news?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have got}} a cold fillet of veal here, Sir,' replied Mr Chick, rubbing his numbed hands hard together. 'What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> Sir?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will help}} you. I'll {{help you to}} {{understand}} just {{where you are and}} how <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> I'd like you to know before you die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The next morning, at sunrise, I {{felt some}} one stooping {{over me and}} {{examining}} me closely. [...] "What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> Zinebi?" [...] said {{the voice of a}} man a little way off.|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle told me I {{should find}} you out here. What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> in <b>there,</b> Pitt? Is {{this what you}} feed them on? I say, you know, queer coves, hens! I wouldn't touch that stuff for a fortune, what? Looks to me poisonous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! I'm not a {{physician}} unattached, like him," [...] said Dr. May, laughing. [...] "Hullo! have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> up, Tom? <b>There's</b> a door up there. I'll show you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Mrs. Knifton, [...] "you {{may want}} what <b>you</b> have <b>got</b> <b>there</b> for {{necessary}} expenses. Is {{that all the}} money you have about you? What do I feel here?" [...] and she tapped her husband on the chest, just over the breast-pocket of his coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{something}} in that." [...] He {{kept looking at}} Matt, or rather, at the copy of the Abstract which Matt was hiding behind, and he said, [...] "What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> Matt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} not go home," [...] said Edna. [...] "You must not think of it. Your {{troubles}} would begin again as soon as <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> You must stay here and go when we do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I confess," [...] {{said the}} Accuser, [...] "that in {{comparison}} with the rascally way in which you have conducted yourself on the Bench, the rascally way in which <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> does seem rather a trifle." ...|$|E
6000|$|As {{he put out}} {{his head}} at the Estminster station, a {{familiar}} voice shouted, 'Hollo! Fitzjocelyn, how jolly!

6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> the Quarterly <b>there?</b> I want {{to glance}} at an article in it if you can spare it for a moment," [...] he said, leaning toward her with an inquiring glance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak for yourself," [...] {{retorted}} Pax; [...] "I {{consider myself}} an entomologist gathering specimens.

Don't you remember?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said these}} men {{belonged to a}} Pomeranian regiment. Had they left before <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there?</b> But I suppose not, or else {{you would not have}} been wounded. How was it that you heard of the attack?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Tom, why {{not return}} to Cedarville with me and Dora?" [...] asked Dick, kindly. [...] "I am sure the trip would do you good, and when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> you could take a good, long rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Clavering quietly. [...] "I'm {{afraid you}} would be frozen before <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> The homestead-boys who chop their fuel in the bluff have, however, some kind of shelter, and I'll make you a big fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; <b>you</b> <b>got</b> {{me wrong}} <b>there.</b> 'I dwell on what-is-it mountain, and {{my name is}} Truthful James,' like the poet says! Believe me, I may be a rough-neck drummer, but I notice these things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can tell}} <b>you</b> how it <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and I guess you'll find {{something}} like it on the other side," [...] answered Sam, and told {{what he had seen}} Wingate do during the night.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's <b>got</b> <b>you</b> <b>there,</b> Smoke," [...] Shorty exulted. [...] "And it's a condition, not a theory. You say {{vegetables}} cures. Here's the vegetables, and where's the cure?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{what would}} your husband say to you when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there?</b> And should not I catch it from William? Well, are you packing up the {{youthful}} family for Beechcroft, except that at Rotherwood they are shrieking for Mysie?' ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Hm! I {{think he}} had better be fascinated by me than by Ellie. [She is going into the garden when the captain comes in from it with some sticks in his hand]. What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> daddiest? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> {{under your}} apron? A bottle?" [...] demanded Lapham, who {{stood with his}} hat on and {{his hands in his}} pockets, {{indifferent}} alike to the ineffective reception of the sailor and the chair Zerrilla had set him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir, {{you need}} not be afraid of {{fighting}} a duel, for you fire so mighty quick {{that you would be}} certain of getting in the first shot, and if <b>you</b> <b>got</b> first shot <b>there</b> would be an end of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Chalk {{shook his}} head. [...] "I {{told her that}} <b>you</b> had <b>got</b> {{business}} <b>there,</b> and that I was going with you just for the outing," [...] he said. [...] "What she’ll say when she finds out—" ...|$|R
6000|$|So the man {{gave him}} a pair of snow shoes.
