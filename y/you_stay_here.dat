[...] Changing Woman said, [...] "He lives at , {{at the foot of}} the mountains. But you have done enough, my son, and the monsters are hard to kill." [...] "It was also hard for you to give birth to me," [...] said [...] [...] "Where [...] lives it is dangerous," [...] said Changing Woman.

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>stay</b> <b>here</b> much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
