25|$|In {{addition}} to the following claims, rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable a priori. Naturally, when <b>you</b> <b>claim</b> some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E

The EP showed {{a change of}} direction from The Chameleon Script, with the band dropping {{a lot of the}} predominant ska influences.

The album was hailed by critics as [...] "a masterpiece" [...] and [...] "one of the best British rock records ever made", with [...] firmly stating [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>claim</b> to love music, you owe it to yourself to own this record, simply as that".|$|E
2500|$|Both Kiem and Hong {{claimed the}} plan {{had been to}} mortar Nui Dat to draw a {{reaction}} force into an ambush, not to attack the base. They confirmed the dual military and political aim, emphasising the disruption caused by 1 ATF lodging at Nui Dat and the intention to affect Australian public opinion. The forced evacuation of Long Tan and Long Phuoc had curtailed the Viet Cong who regarded it as a liberated area, and it {{was chosen as the}} ambush site to demonstrate to the local population that they were still able to operate despite the Australian presence. Hong explained the ambush was sprung within range of the artillery at Nui Dat because they correctly assumed no reaction force would move outside the cover it provided, and instead planned on rapidly closing with and destroying it before artillery or air support could be brought in. They planned to occupy prepared positions in the rubber plantation and destroy whatever force was sent to locate the mortars following the attack on Nui Dat. A stop force had been placed to the east, while another was to the south to hold the Australians in place, reasoning that the thick undergrowth to the north would force them between the two. D445 Battalion was then to close the rear of the ambush, attacking from the north-west. A larger ambush would then have been staged outside artillery range along the withdrawal route subsequently used by the 275th Regiment. Meanwhile, the 274th Regiment was positioned north of Binh Ba astride Route 2 to ambush US forces should they try to relieve 1 ATF. Hong later asked: [...] "How can <b>you</b> <b>claim</b> a victory when you allowed yourselves to walk into a trap that we had set? Admittedly we did not finish the job, but that was only because time beat us and your reinforcements arrived. I mean you did not even attempt to follow us up. How can <b>you</b> <b>claim</b> a significant victory from that sort of behaviour?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The rain-damaged pitch helped England's two left-arm bowlers, Barlow and Peate, who {{dismissed}} Australia for 63 in two-and-a-quarter hours. England made 101 in reply, with Spofforth taking 7 for 46. After {{more rain}} on the second day, Australia lifted its score to 122, thanks to a quickfire 55 from Massie. The match was fiercely contested, as evidenced by W. G. Grace's gamesmanship in running out the naïve 21-year-old Sammy Jones, who had been batting well with his captain. Murdoch hit one into the legside, and Jones reached the other end comfortably in {{time to make the}} single. He then left his crease to go and attend to a divot on the wicket. Grace whipped off the bails and appealed. Square-leg umpire Bob Thoms delivered his verdict: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>claim</b> it, Sir! Out!" [...] Murdoch's protests fell on deaf ears; the run-out was quite legitimate, but Grace's unsporting behaviour irked the Australians, whose collective will to win was fired-up by it.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{his history}} of {{drinking}} and fighting, York attended church regularly and often led the hymn singing. A revival meeting {{at the end of}} 1914 led him to a conversion experience on January 1, 1915. His congregation was the Church of Christ in Christian Union, a Protestant denomination that shunned secular politics and disputes between Christian denominations. This church had no specific doctrine of pacifism but it had been formed in reaction to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South's support of slavery, including armed conflict during the American Civil War, and it opposed all forms of violence. In a lecture later in life, he reported his reaction to the outbreak of World War I: [...] "I was worried clean through. I didn't want to go and kill. I believed in my Bible." [...] On June 5, 1917, at the age of 29, Alvin York registered for the draft as all men between 21 and 31 years of age were required to do on that day.

What I was trying to say was a lot of people want to make Rush the scapegoat, the bogeyman, and he's not."
