500|$|The duel {{occurred}} as Goebel {{and two of}} his acquaintances went to cash a check in Covington. Goebel suggested they avoid Sanford's bank, but Sanford, standing outside the bank, engaged the trio in conversation before they could cross the street to another bank. As Sanford greeted Goebel's friends, he offered his left hand, his right remaining on a pistol in his pocket. Goebel, noticing this and being likewise armed, clutched the revolver in his own pocket. Sanford asked Goebel, [...] "I understand that <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> authorship of that article?"; [...] "I do", replied Goebel. Witnesses agree that both men fired at each other, but none was sure who fired first. Goebel was uninjured, the bullet passing through his coat and ripping his trousers; Sanford was struck in the head and died five hours later. Goebel was acquitted, pleading self-defense, but the incident would haunt his political career. The acquittal was also significant because of prohibitions against duelling in the Kentucky Constitution. If Goebel had been convicted, he would have been ineligible to hold any public office.|$|E
500|$|In May 1945, the Allied forces {{questioned}} {{banker and}} art dealer Alois Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer. Based on Miedl's confession, {{the painting was}} traced back to van Meegeren. On 29 May 1945, {{he was arrested and}} charged with fraud and aiding and abetting the enemy. He was remanded to Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty. He labored over his predicament, but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. He exclaimed, [...] "The painting in Göring’s hands is not, as <b>you</b> <b>assume,</b> a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren! I painted the picture!" [...] It took some time to verify this and he was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at Herengracht 468 in Amsterdam. He painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 in the presence of reporters and court-appointed witnesses: Jesus among the Doctors, also called Young Christ in the Temple in the style of Vermeer. After the trial painting was finished, he was transferred to the fortress prison Blauwkapel. Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.|$|E

[...] Wells has said that he does not write his music for a specific audience, but [...] " [...] to write things that I take pleasure in making – if certain groups of people like it then that's great but the audience is not the starting point".|$|E

That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing {{anything}} else and I can't imagine not doing what I do." [...] He is also often {{asked why he}} writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: [...] "Why do <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> I have a choice?" [...] King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.|$|E

2500|$|The {{result for}} the {{necessary}} zprop given by (Ret-03) depends critically on the assumptions that you make. As an example, you might assume that price inflation will be 3.5% per year forever {{and that your}} pay will increase only at that same rate of 3.5%. If <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> a 4.5% per year nominal rate of interest, then (using 1.045/1.035 in real terms [...] ) your pre-retirement and post-retirement net interest rates will remain the same, irel to pay = 0.966 percent per year and ireal = 0.966 percent per year. These assumptions may be reasonable {{in view of the}} market returns available on inflation-indexed bonds, after expenses and any tax. Equation (Ret-03) is readily coded in Excel and with these assumptions gives the required savings rates in the accompanying picture.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to read up on leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if <b>you</b> <b>assume</b> Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E
