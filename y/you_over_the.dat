Her mother had been a singer in her youth, and her father was an amateur drummer. Paige stands at just under 5feet (1.5m) tall, which she says has caused her to lose out on leading roles. Her {{original}} ambition was to become a professional tennis player, at which point her headmistress pointed out to her [...] "they'd never see <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> net", but Paige continued to play tennis and has referred to the sport as one of her passions.|$|E
500|$|The album {{continued}} to receive praise {{after the release}} of Dopesmoker. Eduardo Rivadavia of online music database AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five stating [...] "Dopesmoker is [...] an instant doom metal classic—some might even say a masterpiece". The British music magazine Mojo gave the album a rating of five out of five stars proclaiming that Dopesmoker is [...] "A benchmark by which all that dares call itself stoner rock must surely be judged." [...] Exclaim! praised Dopesmokers production value and noted that the album was [...] "ultimately better version of 1999's stoner opus Jerusalem." [...] Stylus Magazine's Stewart Voegtlin defined Dopesmoker as [...] "a 60-minute song about the spliff, a monstrous rock ode to stinky buds". Voegtlin pointed out that London Records' refusal to [...] "share Sleep's affection or vision, [...] disbanding in disgust. Matt Pike went on to form High on Fire; Al Cisneros and Chris Hakius contemplate the universe's navel with Om." [...] A New York Times critic wrote: [...] "What seems disorienting and monochromatic at first grows richer and more rewarding upon repeated exposure. It’s like a Mark Rothko painting hitting <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head with a bag of hammers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concluding his {{extensive}} reply dated 27 October 2009 to the Prime Minister, Dr Swire said: [...] "You have now received {{a much more}} comprehensive letter requesting a full inquiry from our group 'UK Families-Flight 103'. I {{am one of the}} signatories. I hope that the contents of this letter underline some of the reasons as to why I cannot possibly accept that any inquiry should be limited to Scotland, and I apologise if my previous personal letter of 24 August misled <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> main focus that the inquiry will need to address. That focus lies in London and {{at the door of the}} then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one." ...|$|E

2500|$|Guan Yu is revered as [...] "Holy Ruler Deity Guan" [...] (...) and {{a leading}} subduer of demons in Taoism. Taoist worship of Guan Yu began during the Song dynasty. Legend has it that during the second decade of the 12th century, the {{saltwater}} lake in present-day Xiezhou County gradually ceased to yield salt. Emperor Huizong then summoned Zhang Jixian (張繼先), a 30th-generation descendant of Zhang Daoling, to investigate the cause. The emperor {{was told that the}} disruption was the work of Chi You, a deity of war. Zhang Jixian then recruited the help of Guan Yu, who battled Chi <b>You</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lake and triumphed, whereupon the lake resumed salt production. Emperor Huizong then bestowed upon Guan Yu the title [...] "Immortal of Chongning" [...] (...) , formally introducing the latter as a deity into Taoism.|$|E
2500|$|AllMusic, however, gave a more lukewarm review, {{giving it}} 3/5 stars, saying: [...] "It's what Kelly wanted to do, so {{on that level}} it's a success, and one that {{listeners}} who share her viewpoint (and quite likely her age) will respond to but for everybody else, My December is a disappointment." [...] Commenting on Clarkson's feud with her record label, they also claimed: [...] "My December proves that both camps were correct: Davis is correct {{that there are no}} big crossover hits here, yet it's also true that this is an artistic move that Clarkson needed to make. If left up to Davis, she would simply be another vocalist singing professional product." [...] Rolling Stone, giving a similar lukewarm review, wrote: [...] "Clarkson clobbers <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head with her emotions and arena-ready choruses. The result is a record that's bland in some spots and annoying in others." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the recent Criterion Collection release, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk review, had the following to say about it: [...] "I wouldn't call Kon Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain – Criterion Collection an anti-war film so much as I'd call it a realist's war film. Rather than build his story around big explosions and the thrill of battle, Ichikawa instead brings the human drama front and center, directing his spotlight on a soldier who is left to his own devices when the guns stop blazing. He poses the question, 'When stranded on the bombed-out landscape after the fighting has calmed, what will those left behind do to survive?' It's bleak and it's chilling, and yet Fires on the Plain is also completely engrossing. It's the post-action picture as morality play, the journey of the individual recast with Dante-esque overtones. Ichikawa doesn't have to hit <b>you</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> head with a message because the story is so truthfully crafted, to state the message outright would be redundant. Once you've seen Fires on the Plain, the movie will get under your skin, and you'll find it impossible to forget." ...|$|E
