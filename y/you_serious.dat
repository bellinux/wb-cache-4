It became his third consecutive gold album, and he collected his third consecutive Grammy for Best Comedic Recording for the album in 1977. With every successful album Pryor recorded for Warner (or later, his concert films and his 1980 freebasing accident), Laff quickly published {{an album of}} older material to capitalize on Pryor's growing fame—a practice they continued until 1983. The covers of Laff albums tied in thematically with Pryor movies, such as Are <b>You</b> <b>Serious?</b> for Silver Streak (1976), The Wizard of Comedy for his appearance in The Wiz (1978), and Insane for Stir Crazy (1980).|$|E

Are <b>you</b> <b>serious?</b> Also, what’s dubstep?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|University of Pennsylvania {{received}} {{some of the}} greatest backlash when it announced it would not rescind Cosby's honorary degree because of university policy.

[...] summarizing, [...] "On a campus where 27 percent of women report being sexually assaulted, the hesitation is unacceptable." ...|$|E
