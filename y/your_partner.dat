25|$|Public touch {{can serve}} as a ‘tie sign’ that shows others that <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> is “taken”. When a couple is holding hands, putting their arms around each other, this is a ‘tie sign’ showing others that you are together. The use of ‘tie signs’ are used more often by couples in the dating and {{courtship}} stages than between their married counterparts according to Burgoon, Buller, and Woodall.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often. In {{the beginning of the}} popular series Grey’s Anatomy, one of TV’s most beloved couples, Derek and Meredith, began their relationship while Derek was married to Addison. Although, Derek and Meredith went on to have a strong relationship, Addison changed. She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts {{to come to grips with}} the infidelity. There are many more examples {{of infidelity}} in films and television, and real life, but the point is: if <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> cheats on you it is impossible to be completely unbothered.|$|E

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E

500|$|Varian {{preferred}} the Arabian breed because [...] "their instinctual {{interest in and}} appreciation for people runs deep in their genes. The Arabian's lightness and responsiveness are wonderful, as is their willingness to be <b>your</b> <b>partner.</b> And...they are beautiful. Arabian horses have never let me down." [...] She valued horses with good dispositions and athletic ability as well as attractive appearance. She does not breed Arabians for a specific discipline, instead describes her breeding philosophy as “consistently continuing to breed for more quality and never losing disposition or athletic ability.” Following these principles, Varian has produced {{some of the most}} influential Arabian stallions in the breed.|$|E

[...] When he answered, [...] "Yes", the callers would say, [...] "How's <b>your</b> <b>partner,</b> Shyster?" [...] and hang up the phone. The sponsors and studio executives panicked, and from episode four {{the title of the}} show was changed to [...] "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel", and Walter T. Beagle was renamed Waldorf T.

500|$|In 2006, Constantine and Woodall {{moved from}} the BBC to ITV in a deal reputedly worth £1.2 million {{to start a new}} show, Trinny & Susannah Undress..., on 3 October. The second series of Trinny & Susannah Undress... was {{transmitted}} in June 2007, and it maintained the format of series one which saw Constantine and Woodall advising couples who were finding problems within their marriage. [...] Constantine found it warming that people could open up to them as confidantes, and also said [...] "It's been fascinating to see how looking good and having faith in your appearance makes you into a sexier person, which makes you attractive to <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> again." [...] Constantine stated in an interview that filming the show was very emotionally draining, and as a result, she often went home crying. The programme did not come without its critics who questioned the depth at which Constantine and Woodall could deal with serious issues raised during the programme. On 16 October 2006, they both appeared on NBC's The Today Show and performed makeovers on three women especially for the show.|$|E

Brosnan struggled {{to cope with}} her cancer and death. [...] "When <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines {{and the way you}} view life, all this changes. Because you're dealing with death. You're dealing with the possibility of death and dying. And it was that way through the chemotherapy, through the first-look operation, the second look, the third look, the fourth look, the fifth look. Cassie was very positive about life. I mean, she had the most amazing energy and outlook on life. It was and is a terrible loss, and I see it reflected, from time to time, in my children." [...] Harris had always wanted Brosnan {{to play the role of}} James Bond, and in 1995, four years after her death, Brosnan was given the role in GoldenEye.|$|E
500|$|While much of {{the novel}} shows Henry and Clare falling in love, the end is darker and [...] "time travel becomes a means for {{representing}} arbitrariness, transience, [...] plain bad luck", according to The Boston Globes Judith Maas. As Andrew Billen argues in The Times, [...] "The book may even serve as a feminist analysis of marriage as a partnership in which only the male is conceded the privilege of absence." [...] Several reviewers noted that time travel represents relationships in which couples cannot quite communicate with each other. Natasha Walter of The Guardian describes the story's attention to [...] "the sense of slippage that you get in any relationship—that you could be living through a slightly different love story from the one <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> is experiencing." [...] She points, for example, to {{the section of the}} book which describes the first time Clare and Henry make love. She is 18 and he is 41, already married to her in his present.

500|$|... "Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform it into something different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on the idea that you have to have empathy for <b>your</b> <b>partner.</b>|$|E
500|$|When Hopkins {{began to}} {{circulate}} cassette {{copies of the}} album to the music press a few weeks later, he required that each journalist sign a contract containing a clause requiring that the cassette recipient, according to Select journalist Mark Perry, [...] "not discuss the album with anyone—including <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> at home. It basically said don't talk to your girlfriend about it when you're at home in bed." [...] The Mail on Sunday wrote of Russell [...] " [...] has a mind like a steel trap and the organisational skills of Winston Churchill." [...] Reflecting in 1999, Greengrass admitted: [...] "In retrospect {{a lot of the}} things we did were ridiculous. We sit in [...] meetings today and we're like 'It's on the Internet. It's in Camden Market. Whatever'. I think we've learned our lesson." [...] According to Perry: [...] "It seemed, particularly once you heard the album, that this was cocaine grandeur of just the most ludicrous degree. I remember listening to [...] "All Around the World" [...] and laughing—actually quite pleasurably—because it seemed so ridiculous. You just thought: Christ, there is so much coke being done here." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{awarded the}} game an Editor's Choice award, stating, [...] "This is an {{incredibly}} challenging, old-school throwback that might not set the genre afire with innovation, but in my book, it's better than the awesome game that inspired it. [...] Rare should be proud that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or you just want a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If <b>your</b> <b>partner</b> has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E
