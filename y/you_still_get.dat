She eventually came back to the Commonwealth Film Unit, and with her family in mind, she opted to work as a freelance scriptwriter rather than a full-time employee.

The consensus states: [...] "Though some characters have devolved into caricatures, watching them struggle in Girls is more fun in season five, with sharper humor and narrative consistency than prior seasons." [...] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter gave the season a positive review writing: [...] "Girls had only a niche audience. It's possible that being freed from {{the responsibility of the}} zeitgeist is what has kept Girls so watchable. The start of the fifth season won't launch an armada of think pieces, but if <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> pleasure from watching these flawed, often awful characters make flawed, often funny choices, Girls is still Girls." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sports Toto, in {{addition}} to the basic 4D played the same way as Magnum and Da Ma Cai, runs 5D and 6D games as well.

Sports Toto also offers three lottery games, similar to those seen in Western countries. These are Mega Toto 6/52, Power Toto 6/55 & Supreme Toto 6/58. The last number indicates the highest number - Mega Toto 6/52 requires the player to pick 6 numbers from 1 to 52. The Supreme Toto 6/58 has the highest prizes (first prize is a minimum of more than RM8.8 million) but the probability of winning is lower than the others games as there are more numbers.|$|E

[...] Daily Newss David Hinckley stated [...] "It takes a village to make a Camp, and watching this crew work to save Little Otter and find summer love {{is far from the}} worst thing you could do." [...] James Poniewozik from Time commented [...] "Camp itself reveals a kind of throwback charm, recalling the kind of '70s and '80s summer-movie comedies...that had pathos and real-life problems beneath their water-balloon fights." [...] The Washington Posts Hank Stuever thought the series [...] "lusts after all the pop-culture sleep-away hijinks that preceded it...then it gets hosed down with the barest minimum of network programming standards." [...] He added, [...] "It's all good, clean fun that is not quite good, not quite clean and not quite fun." [...] Linda Stasi from the New York Post stated, [...] "If you hated summer camp, may I suggest you avoid NBC's horrible new scripted summer series, Camp like a case of poison sumac." ...|$|E

5000|$|While Mac has sexual {{exploits}} {{with various}} women, including two models in immediate succession ("America's Next Top Paddy's Billboard Model Contest"), {{there have been}} throughout the series insinuations that Mac may be homosexual.

5000|$|Ryan McCombs {{explains}} {{meaning of}} the song [...] "It was written about them (the bandmates), to be honest. When I quit the band I didn’t point any fingers. I cited personal reasons. I said that {{it had nothing to}} do with anything other than the fact that I just wanted to go home and be a full-time husband and father. But there were a lot of issues. Understandably so, I was always the fifth wheel there. Those guys, they grew up in the same music scene together. They grew up playing together. Three of the guys were in a band for seven years before I even joined. So, understandably, I was always on the outside looking in. It was a lot of different personality conflicts. Over time, you’re living on a bus together, it’s almost impossible to deal with when you’re living in that close proximity. I don’t think it was anybody’s fault. We were just different people and it was time for me to go. And when I did go, I didn’t even say that, and then all of a sudden I got attacked in the press in every form that you can imagine. They pretty much made every story up about me that you can even think of saying about somebody. It got really ugly. I never retorted. Even when I joined Drowning Pool and they started attacking Drowning Pool, none of the guys in the band ever commented or replied. We just ignored it. So, this song “Enemy” is about that, it’s about taking the high road. The chorus, itself, is “I walked the high road away from you/God knows what I’ve been through.” I tried to write it in a way that works for anybody who’s been in any kind of a situation, whether it be any type of a relationship or any type of working situation, where you took the high road, you kept you’re mouth shut and you’re trying to do the right thing and <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> called out for complete bullcrap. It’s a tough thing to deal with. I just put it in a song instead of going public with it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Freud {{had been}} {{treating}} a patient, whom he called Irma, {{during the summer}} of 1895. At one point he proposed a particular treatment solution that Irma was not willing to accept. Irma’s treatment was partially successful, but it ended before it was complete. After some time had passed, Freud visited with a colleague who knew Irma and asked about her condition. Freud was informed that Irma was “better, but not quite well.” [...] That night, Freud dreamt the dream that is now known as [...] "Irma’s Injection". He described it as follows: A large hall - numerous guests, whom we were receiving. - Among them was Irma. I at once took her to one side, as though to answer her letter and to reproach her for not having accepted my 'solution' yet. I said to her: 'If <b>you</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> pains, it's really only your fault.' She replies: 'If you only knew what pains I've got now in my throat and stomach and abdomen - it's choking me.' - I was alarmed and looked at her. She looked pale and puffy. I thought to myself that after all I must be missing some organic trouble. I took her to the window and looked down her throat, and she showed signs of recalcitrance, like women with artificial dentures. I thought to myself that there was really no need for her to do that. She then opened her mouth properly and on the right I found a big white patch; at another place I saw extensive whitish grey scabs upon some remarkable curly structures which were evidently modelled on the turbinal bones of the nose. - I at once called in Dr M, and he repeated the examination and confirmed it ... Dr M looked quite different from usual; he was very pale, he walked with a limp and his chin was clean-shaven ... My friend Otto was now standing beside her as well, and my friend Leopold was percussing her through her bodice and saying: 'She has a dull area low down on the left.' He also indicated that a portion of the skin on her left shoulder was infiltrated. (I noticed this, just as he did, in spite of her dress.) ... M said: 'There's no doubt it's an infection, but no matter; dysentery will supervene and the toxin will be eliminated. ... We were directly aware, too, of the origin of the infection. Not long before, when she was feeling unwell, my friend Otto had given her an injection of a preparation of propyl, propyls ... propionic acid ... trimethylamin (and I saw before me the formula for this printed in heavy type) ... Injections of this sort ought not to be given so thoughtlessly ... And probably the syringe had not been clean.|$|E
