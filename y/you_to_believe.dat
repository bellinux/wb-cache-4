500|$|After {{returning}} to her cage, Kate and Sawyer have an argument, and she climbs out of her cage and breaks open Sawyer's, saying {{if he does not}} want Jack to save his life, he is going to save his own. Sawyer then tells her that they cannot run because they are on another island, something he did not tell her [...] "because I wanted <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that we had a damn chance." [...] Kate and Sawyer then have sex, unknowingly {{in full view of the}} cameras. At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor. Ben appears behind him, and after a brief exchange Jack decides to do the surgery, but wants Ben to keep his promise to let Jack off the island.|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that our advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

40|$|What ought <b>you</b> <b>believe?</b> According <b>to</b> a {{traditional}} view, {{it depends on}} your evidence: <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> (only) what your evidence supports. Recently, however, some have claimed that what <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> depends not on your evidence but simply on what is true: <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> (only) the truth. In this paper, we present and defend two arguments against this latter view. We also explore some of the parallels between this debate in epistemology, and the debate in ethics about whether how <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> act depends on your epistemic position, or on all the facts...|$|R

500|$|A more {{negative}} review {{said that while}} [...] "Eclipse restores some of the energy New Moon zapped out of the franchise and has enough quality performances to keep it involving", the film [...] "isn't quite the adrenaline-charged game-changer for love story haters that its marketing might lead <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> The majority of the 'action' remains protracted and not especially scintillating should-we-or-shouldn't-we conversations between the central triangle." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film a more positive review than {{for the first two}} films in the saga, but still felt the movie was a constant, unclever conversation between the three main characters. He criticized the [...] "gazes" [...] both Edward and Jacob give Bella throughout the movie, and noted that the mountain range that appears in the film looks [...] "like landscapes painted by that guy on TV who shows you how to paint stuff like that." [...] He also predicted that a lack of understanding for the film series in general would not bode well with the audience, stating, [...] "I doubt anyone not intimately familiar with the earlier installments could make head or tails of the opening scenes." [...] He gave the film 2 stars out of 4.|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|There, Ludlow again {{found himself}} in a vibrant {{literary}} community, this time centered around the Golden Era, which published Mark Twain, Joaquin Miller and Bret Harte. Twain was at the time still a virtual unknown (he had first used the pen name “Mark Twain” in a published piece a few months before). Ludlow wrote that “n funny literature, that Irresistable [...] Washoe Giant, Mark Twain, takes quite a unique position.... He imitates nobody. He is a school by himself.” Twain reciprocated by asking Ludlow to preview some of his work, and wrote to his mother, “if Fitz Hugh Ludlow, (author of ‘The Hasheesh Eater’) comes your way, treat him well.... He published a high encomium upon Mark Twain, (the same being eminently just & truthful, I beseech <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe)</b> in a San Francisco paper.

[...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

2500|$|The name [...] "Ori" [...] {{comes from}} the word [...] "Origin", as in {{the origin of the}} Ancients. When {{executive}} producer Robert C. Cooper looked at the root of [...] "origin", he retcon-invented the word [...] "Origin" [...] as the name of the Ori religion. Cooper said it was an interesting idea for him to address the philosophical arguments with various religious people, seeing the whole challenge as [...] "how do you prove whose God exists or whether God exists at all?" [...] Instead of the Goa'uld, who were proved quickly to not be gods by killing them and figuring out their technology, {{it would be hard to}} present the same argument to the Ori followers because the Ori were essentially ascended gods. Even if their gods were dead, it would not make much difference for them, as their followers would continue to believe; without the [...] "magic powers" [...] of the Ori, their followers and the Priors (the Ori's missionaries) could still use the technology and their ships. Cooper said that [...] "it's not necessarily wrong to believe in something ... what's wrong is to murder somebody because they don't believe the way you do." [...] Although Cooper was reluctant to get too serious about the meaning behind the Ori as Stargate should [...] "first and foremost [...] entertain people", he considered it representative of television and the media, [...] "mak people believe whatever the people in charge of that magic box [...] whatever they want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they can pretty much convince you, or convince the vast majority of people." [...] For Cooper, [...] "the followers of the Ori were the interesting part", and he [...] "wanted to do a story that was in some way reflective of the differences between people's beliefs that we see around us in our society, and how conflicts arise as a result of that." [...] Cooper was particularly interested in the interaction between Ori followers and other normal human beings, the resulting [...] "mysterious aspect and quality to religious belief and the passion that it invokes." [...] The producers therefore put the Ori in the story background, similar to the way there was very little direct interaction between the actual deities of the religion and mankind in real life.|$|E
