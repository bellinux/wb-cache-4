50|$|On April 26, 2004, {{as part of}} an {{undercover}} operation aimed at combating child exploitation on the Internet, Special Agent (SA) Timothy Devine, United States Secret Service, Miami Field Office, entered an Internet “chat” room using the screen name “Lisa n Miami” (LNM). SA Devine observed a public message posted by a user employing a sexually graphic screen name, which was later traced to the defendant Williams. Williams’s public message stated that “Dad of toddler has ‘good’ pics of her an sic me for swap of <b>your</b> <b>toddler</b> pics, or live cam.” SA Devine as LNM engaged Williams in a private Internet chat during which they swapped non-pornographic photographs. Williams provided a photograph of a two to three-year-old female lying on a couch in her bathing suit, and five photographs of a one to two-year-old female in various non-sexual poses, one of which depicted the child with her chest exposed and her pants down just below her waistline. LNM sent a non-sexual photo of a college-aged female digitally regressed to appear 10-12 years old, who LNM claimed was her daughter.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{commentators}} {{also criticized}} the film for being misleading or inaccurate, but nevertheless praised it for being entertaining. For example, Ben Goldacre {{the film was}} [...] "moving and convincing" [...] as a drama, but went on to criticize its factual accuracy, saying, [...] "The only things that the writers of Hear the Silence get wrong, to be fair, are the science and the story." [...] Similarly, Kathryn Flett wrote in the Guardian that the film was [...] "very well done but not, I think it's fair to say, designed to make you sleep easy if you'd just booked <b>your</b> <b>toddler</b> in for a nice big dose of the triple vaccine, a feeling {{that may have been}} compounded by the post-match heated debate which, stylistically, erred somewhat on the side of Kilroy even as it was chaired by the fragrant Kirsty Young." [...] In addition, David Aaronovitch wrote that while the film begins by saying that it is a [...] "dramatised account of the work of Dr Andrew Wakefield {{and his colleagues at the}} Royal Free Hospital in the late 1990s," [...] that is not in fact true. According to Aaronovitch, [...] "Wakefield's own history is distorted, as are the opinions of his colleagues. No scientist is permitted to put a contrary case to that of the hero, though the vast majority of them believe he is wrong..." ...|$|E

50|$|Imitation plays such a {{major role}} on how a toddler interprets the world. So much of a child's {{understanding}} is derived from imitation, {{due to lack of}} verbal skill imitation is a toddlers way of communication with the world. It is what connects them to the communicating world, as they continue to grow they begin to learn more and more. That is why it is crucial for parents to be cautious as to how they act and behave around their toddlers. Imitation is the toddlers way of confirming and dis-conforming socially acceptable actions in our society. Actions like washing dishes, cleaning up the house and doing chores are actions you want <b>your</b> <b>toddlers</b> to imitate. Imitating negative things is something that is never beyond young toddlers. If they are exposed to cursing and violence, {{it is going to be}} what the child views as the norm of his or her world, remember imitation is the 'mental activity that helps to formulate the conceptions of the world for toddlers' Hay et al. (1991), when a toddler sees something so often he or she will form his or her reality around that action. So it is important for parents to be careful what they say or do in front of their children.|$|R

40|$|My first-born, Emma, was 14 months old. I had {{enrolled}} in a course, and, with the feeling of my life opening up again, had begun to wean. It {{was at that time}} that I read a book called Mothering <b>Your</b> Nursing <b>Toddler.</b> Starting with the assumption that extended breastfeeding is satisfying for both mother and child, the author, Norma Jane Bumgarner writes of the security, confidence and self-esteem that we give our children when we allow them to nurse, and wean, according to their own schedule. She certainly convinced me, and Emma and I went on to nurse happily for three more years. Re-reading the book six years later, her message seems less radical. My three keen nurslings have, to me, well proven the benefits of an extended breastfeeding relationship, with a physical resilience and emotional independence that comes, I believe, from the access to loving arms and the secure base that breastfeeding provides. Over the years I have also learned about the more tangible advantages of extended nursing...|$|R

40|$|During {{the second}} year of development, {{toddlers}} grow and develop rapidly as they learn new things and explore their world. Learn what milestones to watch for and how you can provide a safe and supportive environment for your child’s development. Children 12 to 24 months old are learning, exploring, and communicating at a rapid rate, growing from dependent infants to more independent toddlers. They may challenge the patience, sense of humor, and even common sense of a parent or caregiver. Be prepared to “baby proof” the entire home, yard, and outside environments.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things that your child must learn is how to talk. On average, a child will say his or her first word at 12 months of age, and may start speaking anywhere from 8 – 18 months of age. Between 18 months and 2 years, <b>your</b> <b>toddler</b> will speak in two-word “sentences. ” By the time your child reaches 3 years, s/he will have a large vocabulary; and by age 6, s/he will know about 10, 000 words and be a capable conversationalist. Your child's language skills show how well his or her brain and thought processes are developing. Children also develop emotionally and build social skills through conversation. In fact, early language skills help children to adjust more easily to difficult circumstances. Toddlers with advanced languag...|$|E
40|$|This {{extraordinary}} first {{collection of}} short stories covers the landscape of dysfunctional childhood, urban angst, and human disconnection with a wit and insight that keep you riveted to the page. The characters here have rich and imaginative interior lives, but grave difficulty relating to the outside world. The beginning story, "Ducklings," introduces the over-weight and over-enthusiastic Marjorie, the last twelve-year-old you would want babysitting <b>your</b> <b>toddler.</b> In "Wanted" we meet Eleanor, a single girl living in Chicago {{who may or may not}} be dating a serial killer. "Another Cancer Story" is an unsentimental account of two sisters whose beloved mother just won't seem to die, and "The Last Dead Boyfriend" gives us a recovering addict who keeps encountering her recently deceased boyfriend, an unpleasant man she wished she'd broken up with before he died. Always funny, often dark, and wholly satisfying, these stories explore the longing for connection among characters who are frequently stricken with anxiety. Each story is rendered in a way that is surreal, vivid, and entirely convincing. "Wonderful Girl is a smart, funny collection, by turns poignant, mysterious, terrifying, sexy, often just plain nuts (in a good way!). The characters in these stories are deliciously confused but always in control, if not of their fates, at least of their pets and boyfriends. What strong voices these women have! Contemporary American life has never seemed so threatening and yet so warm, so full of possibility, yet so harrowing. Reading Wonderful Girl is like meeting a dozen new friends, people you instantly fret over, want to know better, want to call and give advice, bring home to meet your folks, people you ultimately love.
