500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world so beautifully, but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|Despite the praise, some reviewers {{criticized the}} game for its {{confusing}} level layouts and felt they have not held up very well over the years. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer stated that Perfect Dark is [...] "not afraid to throw dead ends at you seemingly {{for the hell of}} it, or repeat textures so much in its huge maps that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little dizzy." [...] GameSpot's Tom Mc Shea noted that the campaign was [...] "oddly paced", and that [...] "locked doors, unused rooms, and dead ends... can be disheartening to stumble around in a circle until you finally happen upon the correct door you just couldn't locate." [...] Nevertheless, he admitted that [...] "it's {{a lot of fun to}} replay them to try for high scores and figure out the many unique objectives." [...] He also remarked that that online play can periodically suffer from a significant amount of lag, but praised the amount of content and features.|$|E
500|$|Nickelodeon officially {{announced}} the episode on {{a press release}} on April 5, 2010. According to the network, [...] "SpongeBob and Patrick learn the 'Shelly Super Highway' is coming to Bikini Bottom - right through Jellyfish Fields! They {{must find a way}} to galvanize their neighbors, or it could be the end for Jellyfish Fields forever." [...] It was promoted as SpongeBob's campaign to save the jellyfish. Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make it funny, sometimes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> message across [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Banks, on the song, said that [...] " [...] sort of Bob Dylan meets John Lennon." ...|$|E

500|$|... "I {{covered this}} scene with {{another one of}} the key {{changing}} into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. I covered a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sense of how many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{perceived}} an anti-American {{message in}} the film, equating RDA's private security force to American soldiers. Commentator Glenn Beck on his radio show said that Avatar was [...] "an anti‑U.S. human thing". Russell D. Moore in The Christian Post stated that, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects" [...] and criticized Cameron for {{what he saw as}} an unnuanced depiction of the American military as [...] "pure evil". John Podhoretz of The Weekly Standard argued that Avatar revealed [...] "hatred of the military and American institutions and the notion that to be human is just way uncool." [...] One review called Avatar the [...] "liberal tell" [...] of [...] "a thinly disguised, heavy-handed and simplistic sci-fi fantasy/allegory critical of America from our founding straight through to the Iraq War." [...] Charles Mudede of The Stranger commented that with the release of the film [...] "the American culture industry exports an anti-American spectacle to an anti-American world." [...] Debbie Schlussel likewise dismissed [...] Avatar as [...] "cinema for the hate America crowd".|$|E
500|$|Avatars {{underlying}} {{social and}} political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the New York Press wrote that Cameron used [...] "villainous American characters" [...] to [...] "misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism". Russell D. Moore of The Christian Post concluded that [...] "propaganda exists in the film" [...] and stated [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects." [...] Some commentators sympathetic to anarcho-primitivism have even praised the film as a manifesto for their cause. Adam Cohen of The New York Times was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message [...] "a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit". Ross Douthat of The New York Times opined that the film is [...] "Cameron's long apologia for pantheism... Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now", while Saritha Prabhu of The Tennessean called the film a [...] "misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general", and Maxim Osipov of The Hindustan Times, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the Bhagavad Gita. Annalee Newitz of io9 concluded that Avatar is another film that has the recurring [...] "fantasy about race" [...] whereby [...] "some white guy" [...] becomes the [...] "most awesome" [...] member of a non-white culture. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called Avatar [...] "the season's ideological Rorschach blot", while Miranda Devine of The Sydney Morning Herald thought that [...] "It [...] impossible to watch Avatar without being banged {{over the head with}} the director's ideological hammer." [...] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to Avatars success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and [...] "the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality.".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, a Starbucks {{executive}} {{stated that}} the company supports the legalization of same-sex marriage. This resulted in a boycott by the National Organization for Marriage, a political organization that opposes same-sex marriage, who received 22,000 signatures in favor of their boycott. In response, CEO Howard Schultz had this to say: [...] "If you feel, respectfully, that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it's a free country. You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much." [...] In addition, 640,000 people also signed a petition thanking Starbucks for its support. (As of June 26, 2015, same-sex marriage in the United States is legal in all states following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, and maybe we should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E
