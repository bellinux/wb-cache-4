500|$|Gaven {{has had a}} {{prominent}} career in musical theatre and has appeared in many rock musicals. She told TheaterWeek in 1993 that she thinks those kinds of musicals are harder to sing in compared to standard musicals, and that [...] "the nature {{of rock and roll}} is that it's on the edge. It's written to be done dangerously. You can't be careful and do it at the same time. If you don't do it dangerously, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing the impact." [...] During her career, Gaven has sung in both mezzo-soprano and soprano roles, and has been cited for her belting. According to Alvin Klein, theatre critic for The New York Times, she [...] "is categorically a mezzo soprano." [...] Gaven has also been noted for her strong voice, and was once told by a sound technician at An Evening Dinner Theater in Elmsford, New York that [...] "We always turn off the mikes when you sing" [...] because she did not need amplification.|$|E

"Go Big or Go Home" [...] was {{the first}} {{original}} episode since [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] in May 2010, and executive producer Michael Schur said while he believed it was a strong episode, there were fears the hiatus would hurt {{the momentum of the}} series: [...] "Of course, any time you're not on the air, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of people forgetting about you; that's the sad thing about the mid-season show." [...] The week of the third season premiere, Amy Poehler said of the hiatus, [...] "It was an NBC decision and certainly we were confused. But I think, weirdly, there's a momentum that comes from people waiting for us, which is nice." [...] Poehler also said the long hiatus made an ironic sort of sense for the script, since at the beginning the characters have [...] "taken too much time off and we've all gone a little crazy". While Parks and Recreation previously aired on 8:30 p.m. EST on Thursdays, [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] marked the first episode in a new 9:30 p.m. Thursday time-slot between the two popular shows The Office and 30 Rock. Poehler said of the time-slot, [...] "'The Office' is such an amazing show and to be behind it is an honor." [...] In anticipation of new viewers due to the Office lead-in, [...] "Go Big and Go Home" [...] included an introductory sequence describing the previous events of the series.|$|E

Notwithstanding his father's vocation, Barry decided [...] "early on" [...] {{that he was an}} atheist. He said, [...] "The problem with writing about religion is that <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of offending sincerely religious people, and then they come after you with machetes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very well; I {{am glad to}} hear it. To {{tell the}} truth, I never thought that <b>you</b> would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> A gentleman of your sort, when {{he is looking for}} a wife with money, likes to have the money quite certain." ...|$|R
2500|$|For {{the visual}} look of Nicholas' wealthy lifestyle, Fincher and the film's cinematographer Harris Savides wanted a [...] "rich and supple" [...] feel and took {{references}} from films like The Godfather which featured visually appealing locations with ominous intentions lurking under the surface. According to Fincher, once Nicholas left his protective world, he and Savides would let fluorescents, neon signs and other {{lights in the}} background be overexposed to let [...] "things get a bit wilder out in the real world". For The Game, Fincher employed a Technicolor printing process known as ENR which lent a smoother look to the night sequences. The challenge for him was how much deception could the audience take and [...] "will they go for 45 minutes of red herrings?" [...] To this end, he tried to stage scenes as simply as possible and use a single camera because [...] "with multiple cameras, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of boring people with coverage".|$|E
6000|$|... “Certainly. You {{ought not}} to let your garden get out of order; and, if you do it, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of all {{accidents}} that may prevent your working during the three days.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, but I'd rather 'ave that {{uncertainty}} than see <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bein' drownded in a light'ouse," [...] said Mrs Potter, glancing uneasily at the window, which rattled violently as {{the fury}} of the gale increased.|$|E
5000|$|Asked if the {{experience}} affected his stand-up comedy, Lee replied: [...] "It did {{make me feel}} {{there was not much}} point ever trying to reach a mass audience with anything interesting and provocative. <b>You</b> just <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being misunderstood on a large scale".|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{put me to}} it, I {{will see}} that you are hindered. What is the man to you that <b>you</b> should <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of evil tongues, {{for the sake of}} visiting him in gaol? You cannot save his life,--though it may be that you might endanger it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Teddy and I {{will leave}} <b>you,</b> and <b>run</b> all <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> with him, which {{is nothing more}} than fair, {{considering}} {{the fact that he is}} one of our party." ...|$|R

[...] "If {{you invest in}} young lions <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of having them pass out on you. And you can go right on pulling the trick off with what you've got.

6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Thorn agreed. [...] "But the {{important}} thing is you saw this and didn't lose your nerve. Anyhow, if you had lost it, I couldn't have blamed you; I blame myself for my confounded thoughtlessness that let <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> In fact, I'm dreadfully sorry and don't mind owning that I got a fright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps,' said Mr. Tryan, feeling {{slightly}} uncomfortable, 'since you are {{not very}} strong, my dear sir, it will be well, as Mrs. Jerome suggests, that <b>you</b> should not <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of any excitement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly I {{can think}} of nothing better. But what say you, Thekla? Are <b>you</b> ready to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risks,</b> <b>the</b> danger, and the hardships of such a journey under the {{protection}} only of this brave Scottish gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear. You {{are not a}} hard {{old woman}} like me--and <b>you</b> shall not <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of {{catching}} cold. Go into my room, and keep the fire up. I shall be back in half an hour.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My love, {{that story}} won't do. If Mrs. Manston was burnt, Cytherea, whom you love better than me, {{could have been}} {{compelled}} to live with you as your lawful wife.

6000|$|So, saying, he lounged to the fire, and sat down. Catherine {{reflected}} an instant, with knitted brows--she {{found it}} needful {{to smooth the}} way for an intrusion. 'Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon,' she said, {{at the conclusion of}} a minute's silence. 'As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being scolded for no good.' ...|$|E
60|$|This {{question}} of realism, let it then be clearly understood, regards {{not in the}} least degree the fundamental truth, but only the technical method, of a work of art. Be as ideal or as abstract as you please, you will be none the less veracious; but if you be weak, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being tedious and inexpressive; and if you be very strong and honest, you may chance upon a masterpiece.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can hardly}} {{believe it to be}} true," [...] she said, in a low voice. [...] "Oh, Sahib, do you really mean what you say? And are <b>you</b> willing to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of taking me away with you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|This toy {{has been}} called [...] "the world's most {{dangerous}} toy" [...] because of the radioactive material included in the set. [...] Gilbert claimed {{that none of the}} materials could conceivably prove dangerous. However, the instructions cautioned that [...] "users should not take ore samples out of their jars, for they tend to flake and crumble and <b>you</b> would <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of having radioactive ore spread out in your laboratory.

60|$|If {{the wind}} should blow when the cold is intense, no man dare face it-- {{he would be}} certain to be frost-bitten. The {{parts of the body}} that are most easily frozen are the ears, the chin, the cheek-bones, the nose, the heels, fingers, and toes. The {{freezing}} of any part begins with a pricking sensation. When this occurs at the point of your nose, it is time to give earnest attention to that feature, else <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of having it shortened. The best way to recover it is to rub it well, and to keep carefully away from the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} need be afraid of the penitentiary. I can't see aunt Nesta prosecuting, when it would mean {{that she would have}} to charge us with having sent Ogden to a dogs' hospital. She likes publicity, but it has to be the right kind of publicity. No, we do run a risk, but it isn't that one. <b>You</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing your job here, and I should {{certainly}} be sent to my grandmother for an indefinite sentence. You've never seen my grandmother, have you, Jerry? She's the only person in the world I'm afraid of! She lives miles from anywhere and has family prayers at seven-thirty sharp every morning. Well, I'm ready to risk her, if you're ready to risk your job, in such a good cause. You know you're just as fond of uncle Peter as I am, and Ogden is worrying him into a breakdown. Surely you won't refuse to help me, Jerry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Not {{to take in}} any {{partner who}} {{should be allowed to}} carry on any {{separate}} business, in which the partnership is not concerned. Depend upon it, whatever other business your partner carries on, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of it {{as much as you do}} of your own; and <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> with this particular circumstance too, that you have the hazard without the profit or success: that is, without a share in the profit or success, which is very unequal and unfair. I know cunning men will tell you, that there may be provision made so effectually in the articles of partnership, that the stock in partnership should be concerned in no other interest or engagements but its own; but let such cunning gentlemen tell me, if the partner meets with a disappointment in his other undertakings, which wounds him so deep as to break him, will it not affect the partnership thus far? 1. That it may cause his stock to be drawn hastily out, and perhaps violently too. 2. That it touches and taints the credit of the partner to be concerned with such a man; and though a man's bottom may support him, if it be very good, yet it is a blow to him, touches his credit, and makes the world stand a little at a stay about him, if it be no more, for a while, till they see that he shows himself upon the Exchange, or at his shop-door again, in spite of all the apprehensions and doubts that have been handed about concerning him. Either of these are so essential to the tradesman, whose partner thus sinks by his own private breaches, in which the parnership is not concerned, that it is worth while to caution the tradesman against venturing. And I must add, too, that many a tradesman has fallen under the disaster by the partner's affairs thus affecting him, though the immediate losses which the partner had suffered have not been charged upon him; and yet I believe it is not so easy to avoid being fallen upon for those debts also.|$|E
6000|$|... "No harm {{will come}} to me here, I can promise you," [...] she said. [...] "It is <b>you</b> who <b>run</b> <b>the</b> most <b>risk</b> if <b>you</b> only knew it. Sir George Duncombe gave you the best advice {{when he tried to}} get you to return to England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure, to be sure--every {{mansion in}} this country of the {{slightest}} antiquity has its ghosts and its haunted chamber, and you must not suppose us worse off than our neighbours. They are going, indeed, somewhat out of fashion. I have seen the day, when if you had doubted the reality of a ghost in an old manor-house <b>you</b> <b>ran</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being made a ghost yourself, as Hamlet says.--Yes, if you had challenged the existence of Redcowl in the Castle of Glenstirym, old Sir Peter Pepperbrand would have had ye out to his court-yard, made you betake yourself to your weapon, and if your trick of fence were not the better, would have sticked you like a paddock, on his own baronial midden-stead. I once narrowly escaped such an affray--but I humbled myself, and apologised to Redcowl; for, even in my younger days, I was no friend to the monomachia, or duel, and would rather walk with Sir Priest than with Sir Knight--I care not who knows so much of my valour. Thank God, I am old now, and can indulge my irritabilities without the necessity of supporting them by cold steel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] pursued Gorman, [...] "all you've {{got to do}} is, on {{a certain}} night that I will fix, to set the shop alight, and the thing's done quite easy. But that's not all. You've got an old mother, I believe; well, {{it would be very}} unnatural in <b>you</b> to <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being burned to death, an' leaving her penniless; so you'll insure your life for five hundred pounds, and I'll pay the first premium on it, and then you'll die--" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{looked very}} {{beautiful}} indeed. I was roused from my selfish ill- humour, felt what my Clement was worth, and went {{heart and soul}} into the matter, and we all four were just as happy over these hopes {{as if we had}} not seen how things had turned out at home, and that no one, either Kings or Parliaments, or nobility either, know where to stop; but that if you do not get an absolute tyrant, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a Long Parliament, a ruling army, a 30th of January, and a Lord Protector. But we were all young and hopeful still, and that straight walk in the Cours de la Reine was a paradise to some of us, if a fool's paradise. For look you! in these great States-General, who but Clement Darpent the eloquent would make speeches, and win honours that would give him a right to rewards for higher than the hand of a poor exiled maiden, if I were still an exile? Though he declared that I had been his inspiration, and helped to brace him for the struggle, and far more truly, that my dear brother had shown him what a nobleman, bred under English law, could be, when neither ground down by the Crown, nor forced to do nothing but trample on his vassals.|$|E
60|$|John has {{frequently}} been advised {{to have the}} old edifice thoroughly overhauled, and {{to have some of}} the useless parts pulled down, and the others strengthened with their materials; but the old gentleman always grows testy on this subject. He swears the house is an excellent house; that it is tight and weather-proof, and not to be shaken by tempests; that it has stood for several hundred years, and therefore is not likely to tumble down now; that as to its being inconvenient, his family is accustomed to the inconveniences and would not be comfortable without them; that as to its unwieldy size and irregular construction, these result from its being the growth of centuries and being improved by the wisdom of every generation; that an old family, like his, requires a large house to dwell in; new, upstart families may live in modern cottages and snug boxes; but an old English family should inhabit an old English manor-house. If you point out any part of the building as superfluous, he insists that it is material to the strength or decoration of the rest and the harmony of the whole, and swears that the parts are so built into each other that if you pull down one, <b>you</b> <b>run</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of having the whole about your ears.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing of the sort! You're a foreigner, Lecount; {{you don't}} {{understand}} these people. They drink whisky from morning to night.
