It is {{not a substitute for}} use of the Thesis Manual. The Office of Graduate Studies and Research provides a template for creating your thesis, we suggest that you use it. Don’t forget to schedule a pre-submittal conference with the Thesis office. The online pre-submittal conference is available from the Office of Graduate Studies and Research website for additional help.
