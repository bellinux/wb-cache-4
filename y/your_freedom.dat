500|$|On Febaruary 25, 2016, Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Crazy for You" [...] {{during the}} Manila stop of her Rebel Heart Tour {{as a tribute}} to the 30th anniversary of the 1986 EDSA Revolution. Before the performance she said; [...] "I believe 30 years ago you fought for <b>your</b> <b>freedom,</b> am I correct? It's called People Power Freedom , did I say that right? Up with democracy and freedom! That is the revolution of love. And that's what a rebel heart fights for. So on this very special occasion, I want to sing this song".|$|E

500|$|Many {{organizations}} have been considering reducing privacy to improve security {{as a result of}} Kaspersky's arguments. In a more recent Slashdot interview Kaspersky said the Internet should be divided into three zones: a red zone for voting, online banking, and other [...] "critical transactions" [...] that would require an Internet ID; a grey zone that may only require verification of age to access the site, but not identity; and a green zone for blogs, news, and [...] "everything related to <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> of speech." [...] He proposes [...] "special proxies" [...] for red zone websites that allow disclosure of the user's identity only in the case of suspected malfeasance.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team maintained heavily enforced security around the film. Karl Urban revealed, [...] " [...] {{level of security}} and secrecy that we have all been forced to adopt. I mean, it's really kind of paranoid crazy, but sort of justified. We're not allowed to walk around in public in our costumes {{and we have to}} be herded around everywhere in these golf carts that are completely concealed and covered in black canvas. The security of it is immense. You feel <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> is a big challenge." [...] Actors like Jennifer Morrison were only given the scripts of their scenes. The film's shooting script was fiercely protected even with the main cast. Simon Pegg said, [...] "I read [...] with a security guard near me – it's that secretive." [...] The film used the fake working title of Corporate Headquarters. Some of the few outside of the production allowed to visit the set included Rod Roddenberry, Ronald D. Moore, Jonathan Frakes, Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nichols, Ben Stiller, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg (who had partially convinced Abrams to direct because he liked the script, and he even advised the action scenes during his visit).|$|E
2500|$|Berry {{was also}} {{responsible}} for toning down the lyrics of the song [...] "Welcome to the Occupation." [...] Stipe's original lyric was [...] "Hang <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> fighters" [...] which, given the Reagan administration's active support for the contra [...] "freedom fighters" [...] in Nicaragua, sounded very violent and militant, although Stipe himself countered that the line could be taken multiple ways ("hang" [...] as in either [...] "lynch" [...] or [...] "frame on a wall"). Berry's objection ultimately led the line to be changed to [...] "hang <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> higher." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard magazine, Keys stated that she [...] "eliminated all of the boundaries and all the limitations, {{so that you can}} feel <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> and express <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> in every way you possibly can". The Element of Freedom was scheduled to be released on December 1, 2009, to correspond with World AIDS Day, but was pushed back to December 15 for additional recording. According to the senior vice president of urban marketing for J Records, Keys [...] "had a couple of more things in the oven and she wants this to be right [...] So we gave her the additional time she needed." [...] Keys pointed out that she felt the album was being rushed for no reason. In {{an interview}} with Scottish newspaper The Scotsman, she stated that it [...] "seems unfair to have to rush these songs that were still coming and not allow them to be the best songs they could be. It was just two weeks' difference, but it made for an even better record".|$|E

2500|$|Barry Newman {{offered his}} {{interpretation}} of the film's ending in an interview printed in the March 1986 issue of Musclecar Review, [...] "Kowalski smiles as he rushes to his death {{at the end of}} Vanishing Point because he believes he will make it through the roadblock." [...] The August 2006 issue of Motor Trend magazine has a sidebar with Newman, in which he explains that Kowalski sees the light glinting from between the two bulldozers. [...] "To Kowalski, it was still a hole to escape through. It symbolized that no matter how far they push or chase you, no one can truly take away <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> and there is always an escape." [...] Newman also thought that the entire film was an essay on existentialism. Kowalski drives to drive, with no real purpose for doing what he's doing. He decides to give his life its definition and meaning, with complete freedom over his actions.|$|E
2500|$|O'Malley {{supported}} a bill {{considered by the}} General Assembly to legalize same-sex marriage in Maryland, even though Archbishop of Baltimore Edwin O'Brien had urged him as a Catholic not to support the bill in a private letter sent two days before O'Malley voiced his support. [...] "I am well aware that the recent events in New York have intensified pressure on you to lend your active support to legislation to redefine marriage," [...] O'Brien wrote. [...] "As advocates for the truths we are compelled to uphold, we speak with equal intensity and urgency in opposition to your promoting a goal that so deeply conflicts with your faith, {{not to mention the}} best interests of our society." [...] O'Malley responded, [...] "I do not presume, nor would I ever presume as Governor, to question or infringe upon <b>your</b> <b>freedom</b> to define, to preach about, and to administer the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. But on the public issue of granting equal civil marital rights to same-sex couples, you and I disagree." ...|$|E

Your letter reached him safely, {{in spite of its}} roundabout direction; and the Governor of Tobolsk despatched us at once upon this errand of release.
