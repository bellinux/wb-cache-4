[...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When <b>you</b> <b>suffer</b> from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{contributing}} to the outbreak of war was a religious awakening which swept through Native settlements in the early 1760s. The movement was fed by discontent with the British as well as food shortages and epidemic disease. The most influential individual in this phenomenon was Neolin, known as the [...] "Delaware Prophet", who called upon Native Americans to shun the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the whites. Merging elements from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs, Neolin told listeners that the Master of Life was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men, and that the British posed {{a threat to their}} very existence. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>suffer</b> the English among you," [...] said Neolin, [...] "you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [...] will destroy you entirely." [...] It was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if <b>you</b> <b>suffer</b> from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a family. I had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history that I probably never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if <b>you</b> <b>suffer</b> a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." [...] The comic [...] is illustrated by Christo Cassano.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{there was}} a famine, so the {{residents}} in Luo Tong's hometown and other travellers taking shelter there suffered from hunger. Luo Tong was very worried about this and his appetite decreased. His elder sister, who was widowed and had no children, was known for being very kind. She saw that her brother looked very upset, so she asked him why. Luo Tong said, [...] "I feel bad when I can fill my own stomach while those people don't have enough to eat."
