5|$|One other point, already mentioned, {{was how to}} {{deal with}} the problem of {{rendering}} the poem’s fourth line. Gray remarked to Anstey, “’That leaves the world to darkness and to me’ is good English, but has not the turn of a Latin phrase, and therefore, I believe, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the right to drop it.” In fact, all that Anstey had dropped was reproducing an example of zeugma with a respectable Classical history, but only in favour of replicating the same understated introduction of the narrator into the scene: et solus sub nocte relinqor (and I alone am left under the night). Some other translators, with other priorities, found elegant means to render the original turn of speech exactly.|$|E

25|$|Krupa {{praised the}} use of the Wii U gamepad as the Camera Obsura and enjoyed combat for most of the game, but found the latter third of the game tedious due to {{repetitive}} battles. Corriae enjoyed {{the use of}} the gamepad despite some control issues, Bates was highly positive about the thrill it brought into battles, while Turi found that the function did not bring long-term enjoyment and that backtracking through environments negatively impacted on the experience. Wilson likewise enjoyed the gamepad's role in the game, while faulting most other aspects including the high amount of health items and character controls. Orry said that the new controls made combat more claustrophobic than in previous games, while Brown enjoyed the immersion the gamepad brought. Famitsu was highly positive about {{the use of the}} gamepad, saying that it felt like <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the midst of battles. These sentiments were echoed by Dengeki, but stated that some combat situations made aiming difficult. Multiple reviewers mentioned and generally faulted the stiff controls and character movement.|$|E
25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence gives the Impression that Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

The lyrics, [...] "I've {{been in love with}} you baby / Ever since <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Sunday school" [...] lead Clinton Heylin to believe it was written about memories from Morrison's childhood when he attended Sunday school in Belfast; Planet is a California-raised Texan.|$|E

500|$|To the {{surprise}} of the Palestine Police Force, al-Qassam's funeral, which {{was held at the}} Jerini Mosque, attracted at least 3,000 mourners, mostly members of the peasant and working classes.

Al-Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, now Nesher, a Jewish suburb of Haifa.

500|$|In 1921, Coward {{made his}} first trip to America, hoping to {{interest}} producers there in his plays. Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating. He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with The Young Idea. The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles. The reviews were good: [...] "Mr Noël Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is. And youth pervaded the Savoy last night, applauding everything so boisterously that you felt, not without exhilaration, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the midst of a 'rag'." [...] One critic, who noted the influence of Bernard Shaw on Coward's writing, thought more highly of the play than of Coward's newly found fans: [...] "I was unfortunately wedged in the centre of a group of his more exuberant friends who greeted each of his sallies with 'That's a Noëlism!'" [...] The play ran in London from 1 February to 24 March 1923, after which Coward turned to revue, co-writing and performing in André Charlot's London Calling! ...|$|E
