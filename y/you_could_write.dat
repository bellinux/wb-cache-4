Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> down perfectly correctly all the things that I believe in and stand for– you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E

2500|$|From 1882 Caine was {{employed}} as a leader-writer on the Liverpool Mercury and was given free rein as to the subject and number of articles he wrote. This gave {{him the opportunity to}} attend and review numerous first nights at the London theatres. One review angered actor-playwright Wilson Barrett and he demanded a meeting with Caine. Barrett concluding his complaint added [...] "I think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> as play, and if someday you should hit on a subject suitable to me, I shall be glad if you will let me hear of it".|$|E

Rhapsodized Jean Monteaux in Arts: [...] "The play of this voice makes you think sometimes of an eel, of a storm, of a cradle, a knot of seaweed, a dagger.

2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much harder to do that now ... If I was {{going to write a}} protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit. It’s not like one song or one piece of art or one book is going to change someone’s mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Neil Gaiman and screenwriter Roger Avary wrote {{a screen}} {{adaptation}} of Beowulf in May 1997 (they had met {{while working on}} a film adaptation of Gaiman's The Sandman in 1996, before Warner Bros. canceled it). The script had been optioned by ImageMovers {{in the same year}} and set up at DreamWorks with Avary slated to direct and Robert Zemeckis producing. Avary stated he wanted to make a small-scale, gritty film, with a budget of $15–20 million, similar to Jabberwocky or Excalibur. The project eventually went into turnaround after the option expired, the rights returned to Avary, who went on to direct an adaptation of The Rules of Attraction. In January 2005, producer Steve Bing, at the behest of Zemeckis who was wanting to direct the film himself, revived the production by convincing Avary that Zemeckis' vision, supported by the strength of digitally enhanced live action, was worth relinquishing the directorial reins. Zemeckis did not like the poem, but enjoyed reading the screenplay. Because of the expanded budget, Zemeckis told the screenwriters to rewrite their script, because [...] "there is nothing that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>write</b> that would cost me {{more than a million dollars}} per minute to film. Go wild!" [...] In particular, the entire fight with the dragon was rewritten from a talky confrontation to a battle spanning the cliffs and the sea.|$|E
