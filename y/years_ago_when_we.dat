25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{archaeology}} {{is to learn}} more about past societies and the development of the human race. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find the first stone tools - The Oldowan Industry. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.|$|E

2500|$|According to Deacon, this {{occurred}} between 2 and 2.5 million <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{have the first}} fossil evidence of stone tool use {{and the beginning of}} a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends. More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that [...] "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species." [...] This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the [...] "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus Homo.|$|E

I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

Her spokesman stated that her remark had been “grossly distorted” and that she had also referenced Israeli victims in Sderot, but this fact had been omitted from the original transcript.|$|R

He leaves a tremendous legacy, in many research domains within psychology and neuroscience, including neuropsychology, cognitive psychology, computational modeling, social neuroscience, neuro-rehabilitation and cognitive screening and diagnostics. His enormous influence and standing in the field was recognized internationally by many awards and accolades, such as The Spearman Medal (1986), the British Psychological Society’s Cognitive Psychology section prize (1999 and 2012) and President’s award (1999), a Humboldt Research Fellowship (1998), the Royal Society Wolfson merit award (2007), the Donald Broadbrent Prize from the European Society for Cognitive Psychology (2013), the Leibniz Professorship and Special Professorship of the Chinese Academy of Sciences as well as the British Psychological Society Life Time Achievement Award (2015).

60|$|P.S. Well, anyway, I've cured the chronometer. After {{knocking}} {{about the}} sea for eight squally, rainy days, {{most of the}} time hove to, I succeeded in catching a partial observation of the sun at midday. From this I worked up my latitude, then headed by log to the latitude of Lord Howe, and ran both that latitude and the island down together. Here I tested the chronometer by longitude sights and found it something like three minutes out. Since each minute is equivalent to fifteen miles, the total error can be appreciated. By repeated observations at Lord Howe I rated the chronometer, finding it to have a daily losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Now it happens that a <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> sailed from Hawaii, that selfsame chronometer had that selfsame losing error of seven-tenths of a second. Since that error was faithfully added every day, and since that error, as proved by my observations at Lord Howe, has not changed, then what under the sun made that chronometer all of a sudden accelerate and catch up with itself three minutes? Can such things be? Expert watchmakers say no; but I say that they have never done any expert watch-making and watch-rating in the Solomons. That it is the climate is my only diagnosis. At any rate, I have successfully doctored the chronometer, even if I have failed with the lunacy cases and with Martin's yaws.|$|R

Very wonderful was the poise of the sacred bird, that moved nowhere but in our hearts. The lime-tree scent was just stealing out into air for some days already bereft of the scent of hay; and the sun was falling to his evening home behind our pines and beeches. It was no more than radiant warm. And, as we went, we wondered why we had not been told before that Mrs. Herd was so very ill. It was foolish to wonder--these people do not speak of suffering till it is late. To speak, when it means what this meant loss of wife and mother--was to flatter reality too much. To be healthy, or--die! That is their creed. To go on till they drop--then very soon pass away! What room for states between--on their poor wage, in their poor cottages? ...|$|R
