5|$|Cosima was 24 <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of the Countess Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E

Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after reporter Andrew Greven took a photo of them together in a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him.

5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia.

5|$|Ernst Lindemann met Charlotte Weil (née Fritsche; 1899–1979), a Berlin singer, in {{the spring}} of 1920. The couple married on 1 February 1921, and they had a daughter, Helga Maria, born on 26 February 1924. Lindemann's job as a naval officer demanded that he be away from his family for long periods of time. This proved to be too {{demanding}} on the marriage, and they were divorced in 1932. Lindemann was engaged again on 20 July 1933 to his youngest brother's sister-in-law, Hildegard Burchard. Hildegard was 14 <b>years</b> <b>younger</b> <b>than</b> Lindemann.
