However, as no documentation of Dahlan's life {{before he went to}} Mecca exists, the scenes showing Dahlan's <b>youth</b> <b>were</b> fictionalized. The script underwent 12 revisions before the film was completed. Much of the film's budget of Rp. 12 billion (US$ 1.3 million) was spent on costumes and sets to ensure accuracy.

Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E

25|$|For Innis, {{the fall}} of Athens to Sparta in 404BC and the trial and {{execution}} of Socrates for corrupting Athenian <b>youth</b> <b>were</b> symptoms {{of the collapse of}} the older oral culture.

According to Innis, Plato and Aristotle developed prose in defence of a new culture in which gods and poets were subordinated to philosophical and scientific inquiry. Innis argues that eventually, the spread of writing widened the gap between the city-states hastening the collapse of Greek civilization.|$|E
