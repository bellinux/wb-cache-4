500|$|On 19 November 1960, {{the first}} un-tethered free-flight hover of XP831 was achieved; a week later, the first {{publicity}} {{photos of the}} P.1127 were released. Prior to the first flight, Hooker is claimed to have asked of Camm [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> some conventional flying first Sydney?" [...] and Camm replied [...] "What for?" [...] Hooker said [...] "Well you know, {{just to make sure}} the aeroplane is a nice aeroplane, and everything under control." [...] Camm replied, [...] "Oh, Hawker aeroplanes are always beautiful, nothing wrong with a Hawker aeroplane, not going to bother with that. Vertical first time".|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} have said and Senator Kerry has said that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in order {{to get us out of}} the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the final}} game of the 2005 season, Kansas State offered to name the stadium Bill Snyder Stadium in honor of {{retiring}} head coach Bill Snyder. In 17 years, Snyder had turned the Wildcats, once the definition of college football futility, into a frequent championship contender in the Big 12 Conference. When he was asked about renaming the stadium, Snyder told school officials, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, name it after the people that I care about the most." [...] Hence, the Regents renamed the stadium to honor the family of the coach who had led the team for 17 years.|$|E

6000|$|... "Likely enough. 'Gad! the {{performance}} <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> commence," [...] Arthur exclaimed, quickly. [...] "Paul, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{have a new}} sensation. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see {{the most beautiful woman}} in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man {{is growing}} {{stronger}} and better every day. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make him recover, after all. I was afraid"--he corrected himself--"I thought"--the word <b>was</b> the truer--"that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> poison him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “Oh, that’s your game, is it? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{a little}} Siberian Magic {{on your own}} account. And is Mrs. Hampton willing to be a fellow-conspirator?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{quite know}} what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say," [...] {{retorted}} Peter hotly. [...] "I can see it by your chin. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take their part--and suggest their acting undutifully towards their parents." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are going," [...] Pritchard replied, [...] "on {{an errand}} of chivalry. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{save the life}} of your {{beautiful}} friend Elizabeth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> allow yourself, then, to be {{the prey}} of these morbid fancies? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> treat this {{creature}} {{as a human being}} of your own order? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let him work upon your imagination?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I don't want to pain you--you know I do not,' he {{said more}} gently. 'Only it just exasperates me--this <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I {{wish you would}} not.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a great deal. But I try to {{make enough}} {{to pay the rent}} and store bills. May I ask what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> in New York?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say. Well, {{perhaps it is}} rash. But when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> foreign courts, what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> to do? If you have got those sort of things you must wear them." ...|$|R
5000|$|The main {{character}} team are The Mates. While there are parallels with The Beatles and each {{character is a}} pastiche of a superhero, Tischman insisted the concept was much broader than that: [...] "The persona of the Mates is an iconic one for both superhero teams and rock bands. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the really cute one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the quiet one. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the spiritual one and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have the goofy one. That’s the case from every group from Justice League to 'N Sync" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{tell the}} truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> placard this town with the wickedness done <b>to</b> old Wilkins. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fill the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> denounce Verner from a public platform, naming {{him for what he}} did and naming the poacher he did it <b>to.</b> And you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poff," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, [...] "has it ever {{occurred}} to you what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> afterwards. Do {{you know you are}} going to be quite well off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'With four horses I declare!' said Kit, quite aghast at the preparations. 'Well <b>you</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, mother! Here she is, Sir. Here's my mother. She's quite ready, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{leave you}} at the next station," [...] said Songbird, to the Rovers. [...] "When you find out what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this summer, write and let me know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe it will," [...] {{retorted}} the lady, her key {{continuing to}} rise, [...] "and maybe it won't. What I {{want to know}} is what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The midsummer madness {{has broken}} out, {{and no one}} knows who will be {{stricken}} next. Well, leave Demi to his mother, and let us see what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Tom.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now, {{will you}} {{let me know what}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{thinking}} of doing?

6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} what <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{but you look}} the part well," [...] he answered shortly. And, indeed, until that moment he had never known how beautiful she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruth {{will ask}} you, of course," [...] the Marchioness said impatiently. [...] "I expect {{that she is}} waiting at your flat by now. I {{want to know whether}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
