500|$|Feminist author Naomi Wolf {{criticized the}} video as {{propaganda}} for the Marine Corps, stating [...] "I {{really want to}} find out if she was paid by them for making it ..... it is truly shameful. I would suggest a boycott of this singer whom I really liked if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> offended at this glorification of violence as I am." [...] Glenn Selig, founder of The Publicity Agency, responded to these claims on Fox News Live, stating, [...] "In her efforts to boycott the video, Naomi Wolf has brought more attention to it, without her comments, most people would clearly have seen the military simply as a metaphor and not as an attempt by Katy Perry to glamorize the military or war." [...] Perry told MTV that she chose the military plot because it represented the song, saying, [...] "It's an affirmation of strength, so I wanted to go the strongest route I ever could." ...|$|E
500|$|Brooks did not {{direct and}} write a film again for seven years until 2004's Spanglish. Filming took six months, ending in June with three days of {{additional}} filming in October; Brooks produced three endings for the film, shooting several scenes in [...] "15 to 25 takes" [...] as {{he did not feel}} the film was tonally complete, although the script did not change much during filming. He opted to cast Adam Sandler in a more dramatic role than his usual goofball comedy parts based on his performance in Punch-Drunk Love and Sandler's relationship with his family. Describing the length of production, Brooks said: [...] "It's amazing how much more perverse <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a writer than as a director. I remember just being so happy that I'd painted myself into some corners [...] I thought that would make it interesting. When I had to wrestle with that as a director, it was a different story." [...] Brooks's directing style [...] "drove [...] bats", especially Téa Leoni, with Cloris Leachman (who replaced an ill Anne Bancroft a month into filming) describing it as [...] "free-falling. You're not going for some result. It's just, throw it in the air and see where it lands." [...] The film was poorly received and was a box-office failure.|$|E

These two characters are among the foodies that Marge, Bart, and Lisa meet at the Ethiopian restaurant. In the episode, they rhyme a hip hop song that according to Selman is [...] "all bragging about how awesome and cool <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a foodie." [...] It was co-written by the duo, and {{was inspired by the}} song [...] "Empire State of Mind". [...] Selman has commented that [...] "In animated TV shows, whenever you're trying to show people having fun doing their new thing , it just kind of becomes a boring montage. And we've done so many montages on The Simpsons over 25 years, it's like, oh, God, no more montages. [...] So we were like, 'Why not do a silly rap song?' Rapping is sort of inherently boastful, and there's something about being a foodie that's inherently boastful. It's like the boastfulness links those things. So Tim and Eric perform a food rap song in the show—an extremely silly rap song, and the name is intentionally silly: 'Blogging a Food Blog.'" ...|$|E

In June 1999, she received an Essence Award, but her acceptance speech, where she {{said there was no}} contradiction in religious love and servitude and [...] " [...] who <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> fly and as hot and as whatever," [...] drew reaction from those in the public who thought she was not a good role model as a young, unwed mother of two. This was a repetition of criticism she had received after the birth of her first child, and she had said that she and Marley would soon be married. In early 2000, Hill was one of many artists and producers to share the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Santana's 1999 multi-million selling Supernatural, which she had written, produced, and rapped on the track [...] "Do You Like the Way" [...] for (a rumination on the direction the world was headed, it also featured the singing of CeeLo Green and the signature guitar runs of Carlos Santana).

The effect on fellow artists was, as Théodore de Banville stated, [...] "immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear".

2500|$|Putting {{the verses}} {{regarding}} polygyny into the broader Qur'anic context {{by examining the}} nature of marriage in Islam helps understanding them. The Quran [...] refers to marriage as a mithaq, i.e. a solemn covenant or agreement between husband and wife, and enjoins that it be put down in writing (4:21). Marriage {{is more than just}} a [...] "solemn covenant" [...] however, with Surah 30 verse 21 stating [...] "And among His Signs is this, that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in that are Signs for those who reflect." [...] Love and mercy are very much a part of marriage as described in the Qur'an. Although the Qur'an may prescribe different roles for males (husbands often seen as the provider), the equality between husband and wife is promoted when it is dictated in Surah 2 verse 187 that [...] "They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a garment to them." [...] It is thus clear that there is more to polygyny in the scriptural basis of the Qur'an then simply the citation of Verse 4:3.|$|E
2500|$|According to Theodoret, {{when the}} emperor tried {{to enter a}} Milanese church, where Ambrose was about to {{celebrate}} a mass, the bishop stopped him and rebuked {{him for what he}} had done. And because the emperor “had been brought up according to divine words and understood well that some affairs are handled by priests, others by emperors”, he could do nothing but return [...] "weeping and sighing" [...] to the palace. Eight months had passed and Theodosius still sat in the palace, moaning and sobbing. His magister officiorum Rufinus, who [...] "used great freedom of speech due to the familiarity with the emperor", noticed this behaviour, approached and asked him why he was weeping. Having been told, he volunteered to see the bishop and ask him to reconsider. Theodosius hesitantly agreed and even chose to follow Rufinus from a distance. Ambrose was not restrained at all when negotiating with Rufinus, scolding him and even accusing him of complicity in the massacre: [...] "Rufinus, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> impudent as a dog, because it was you who advised the emperor such a bloodshed." [...] When the emperor showed up, Ambrose at first remained stubborn and changed his mind only after Theodosius promised to promulgate a law, which in cases of death sentences would introduce a thirty-day lag before the execution.|$|E
