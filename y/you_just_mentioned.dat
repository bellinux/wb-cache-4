He got away, and we never heard of him for about six years. Then he was rounded up in a burglary and badly wounded. He confessed at the hospital, but he could not tell the name of the place where the child had been dropped. We made a search, but could discover nothing. Margot died, and so did his crazy wife; and there the whole matter has been resting." ...|$|E

5000|$|Several notable {{people and}} organisations criticised Owaisi for the speeches. The Andhra Pradesh Bharatiya Janata Party president, G. Kishan Reddy called for booking Owaisi, {{annulment}} of his assembly membership and de-recognition of All India Majlis-e Ittihad al-Muslimin. Reddy said that [...] "...religious bigotry, unabashed incitement of religious sentiments and contemptuous insinuation against Hindu gods and goddesses formed {{the crux of}} the speeches of a person who was sworn in as an MLA". In a statement issued by the Confederation of Voluntary Associations (COVA) on 30 December, several social activists criticised the speech saying that such [...] "obnoxious" [...] speeches will lead to division of society, violation of peace and conflicts. The social activists demanded exemplary action to prevent such [...] "intolerable" [...] acts in future. The signatories to the statement included Asghar Ali Engineer, Swami Agnivesh, Mahesh Bhatt, Hamid Mohammed Khan, Sandeep Pandey and Ram Puniyani. Journalist and BJP leader Balbir Punj said that Owaisi's speech was tantamount to inciting Muslims to revolt against the police and army and start a civil war, and he added that the silence of the media was surprising. Senior Congress Leader and National Spokesperson Raashid Alvi said, [...] "I don't know what Akbar said in his speech and i don't think he said what <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> but i am sure that Andhra Pradesh Government will do the needful". Asaduddin Owaisi, elder brother of Akbaruddin, refused to comment on the speech saying the matter is sub judice. Congress politician Digvijay Singh said that everybody should think before speaking and demanded action against people making such speeches. TV news channel Times Now reported that the speech was so inflammatory and so provocative that they had decided not to broadcast it. A CNN IBN news report said Owaisi's speech virtually called on Muslims to take arms against the Hindus, and questioned the silence of the media and politicians for 10 days. Najeeb Jung, vice-Chancellor of the Jamia Millia Islamia university, told CNN-IBN that the police was giving excuses of backroom investigation, while {{it was only a matter}} of two-minutes to investigate since the [...] "TV cutout" [...] was available for everybody to see and contents of speech were available on Wikipedia for everybody to read. Jung said that the speech incited incendiary feelings between two communities of an extremely serious nature, and refused to believe Owaisi was ill. BJP spokesperson Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said referring to Owaisi and his party that the spirit of Osama bin Laden had entered into such people and they were trying to behave like the Taliban.|$|E
40|$|Making {{the most}} from your fruits Cue: We all have our {{favourite}} wild fruit fresh from the tree. The seasons may not last long, {{but there are plenty}} of ways that farmers can preserve and add value to their indigenous tree crops by making delicious jams, jellies and juices for sale. Ismaila Senghore was lucky enough to follow the wild fruits of the Gambia to the factory just outside Banjul, the capital, where they are processed into a range of tasty juices. Gamjuice is the business. Isaac Thomas is the owner. He has been juicing fruits for more than 10 years. Having seen the squeezing, mixing and brightly-labelled bottles - and of course, enjoying a taste or two! Ismaila learns that that juices are not just good to drink. They are also good for the local economy. Can you talk with a processor or trader to find out what they do, and how they keep the fruits in good condition. IN:	?Yes, we have about ten people? OUT:	?not me alone but any juice maker. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: So when it comes to juices, the message seems to be ?Drink local!? for your own health and that of the local economy. Gambian juicer Isaac Thomas was talking with Ismaila Senghore. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Thomas	We have about ten people on our staff and we have ladies because you know ladies too they are good at mixing and preparing the juice and this juice is like home made, it is not all the chemicals been added to it so they are good in preparing. Although they are trained, but they have their female touches and the like. Senghore	You are not only producing for the local market but also for the international consumer market. Thomas	Yes that is what we are doing. We are exporting, although a bit small, but we are exporting to our neighbour countries. Senghore	Can you estimate the number of bottles that you export or consume locally here? Thomas	I can say it is a small production factory and it is home made so we take our time. Senghore	In other words they would be happy just to have a taster of what Gambian juice is like? These are the people you target? Thomas	Those people that would admire our juice: hotels and restaurants. Senghore	We see that you have a variety of juices that you make. Now can you itemise them? Thomas	Yes we do all the local juices in the Gambia like Baobab juice, we do ginger, we do tamarind, and we do mango. So all our juices are foods that are available in the Gambia. And available in large quantities ? you just go to the market. And that will help the farmers. We are showing Gambians or showing the world that we can too, we can aim to do our own bottling, everything that has been produced and preserving it. Senghore	Now as your name implies GAMJUICE, you are into the promotion of locally produced juices, as <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>mentioned,</b> by processing the raw materials to add value to them. How do you collect the baobab fruit? Thomas	The baobab fruit, we just go to the market, and sometimes the villages will bring and sell it to us so we just buy it from them. Senghore	Let us now come to the production of baobab juice. If you really want to go into baobab juice as you do it here, how do you start and how do you end. What do you do step by step to get the product that you require? Thomas	Although there are some secrets in it but you have to extract the juice and you have to soak it, leave it for a while so that the fruit will be separated from the seed. And then you have to process it, heat it, so that the germs are eradicated and the like. Senghore	To pasteurise it. When you get the pasteurised juice what do you add to it? Do you add anything to flavour it, sugar? Thomas	No we just add sugar only because these are natural juice, they all have the flavours and the colour. It is more healthy than adding all these flavours and the like. Senghore	You may also want to have labels on it for marketing purpose and so forth. Make it attractive for the market. Thomas	Yes we do have that, we do have expiry dates which you can see on the labels. Senghore	To start such a business, expense, that go into it, would it be very capital intensive? Thomas	Yes it is a bit capital intensive. I started long years ago. I started as a small scale and now I am not in the large scale but in the medium scale. Bottles, the capping machine, they are expensive, labels are. So you need small capital. Senghore	What about individuals who may want to go into such a venture. Would it be easy for them and what kind of capital would you for-see? Thomas	The individual can go in for it. The only thing is that you know then you have to buy a lot of other machineries to enable you to do that. People should keep drinking local, healthy juices. They prevent you from a lot of diseases. It is natural, so it prevents you, it is a fact. So when you drink it you are healthier. Senghore	Well I have just tasted your juice, the carbonated one and it tasted really, really nice, maybe you would want to tell people to also consume our local made products because it is a way of getting our independence from the multi-laterals that dominate the market ? isn?t it? Thomas	Yes definitely I think that people should consume our local products. Because number one, it will help farmers over there so they are able to sell their products. And that will add to their health also. It is not like buying it but it is adding to your health. So that is what I would encourage the Gambians to go in and definitely patronise us the juice makers ? not me alone but any juice maker. End of track. Adding value to indigenous fruits and how to make a profit...|$|E

Supposing, for instance, you have people coming to lunch at one-thirty; <b>you</b> <b>just</b> ring up the Association at about ten o’clock the same morning, and say ‘lunch garden’. That is all the trouble you have to take. By twelve forty-five your yard is carpeted with a strip of velvety turf, with a hedge of lilac or red may, or whatever {{happens to be in}} season, as a background, one or two cherry trees in blossom, and clumps of heavily-flowered rhododendrons filling in the odd corners; in the foreground you have a blaze of carnations or Shirley poppies, or tiger lilies in full bloom. As soon as the lunch is over and your guests have departed the garden departs also, and all the cats in Christendom can sit in council in your yard without causing you a moment’s anxiety. If you have a bishop or an antiquary or something of that sort coming to lunch <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>mention</b> the fact when you are ordering the garden, and you get an old-world pleasaunce, with clipped yew hedges and a sun-dial and hollyhocks, and perhaps a mulberry tree, and borders of sweet-williams and Canterbury bells, and an old-fashioned beehive or two tucked away in a corner.

The service was so deeply moving that I found myself with sweat running down my face and tears in my eyes, totally enveloped by everything I was seeing and hearing. There was something incredibly powerful about Al Green’s voice in that context. Even after three hours of continuous singing, his voice only got stronger and his band only got better. I sat there crying in the church, aware of the irony of how I used to cry in Synagogue in Cleveland as a kid — but because I wanted to get the heck out of there!
