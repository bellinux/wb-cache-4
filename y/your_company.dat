500|$|At Warren's first Banking Committee {{hearing in}} February 2013, she pressed several banking {{regulators}} to answer {{when they had}} last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, [...] "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial'." [...] Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the Internet, amassing {{more than one million}} views in a matter of days. At a Banking Committee hearing in March, Warren asked Treasury Department officials why criminal charges were not brought against HSBC for its money laundering practices. With her questions being continually dodged, Warren compared money laundering to drug possession, saying: [...] "If you're caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you're going to go to jail... But evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, <b>your</b> <b>company</b> pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night." ...|$|E

Cooper stated: [...] "The audience – both young and old – relate to the Kay/Jill relationship". Walton describes their relationship as [...] "incredible" [...] and said: [...] "The love and the hate is so mixed, and there is never any telling when it will bubble out now.

500|$|After {{his girlfriend}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) sues her former {{employer}} Dunder Mifflin for wrongful termination, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) finds himself forced by Jan to {{be a witness}} against his employer. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{wants to make sure}} Michael will not say anything to harm Dunder Mifflin even though Michael is Jan's boyfriend. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) comes along as the HR representative, against Michael's protests. The deposition goes well for Jan at first, as she claims that she was terminated due to discrimination over her breast augmentation. To counter evidence that she had a romantic relationship with Michael before they disclosed it to corporate, Jan submits Michael's personal diary, which she brought to the deposition without his knowledge or permission. Michael is further incensed against Jan when he learns that she gave him a scathing performance review after they had begun dating, claiming that he is unfit for his current position and should be demoted to sales. Michael learns he was never a contender when interviewing for Jan's former position at the corporate office, with the CFO insisting repeatedly that he is a nice guy, but ultimately unsuited for the position. Michael defends the company anyway, and later states that [...] "you expect to get screwed by <b>your</b> <b>company,</b> but you never expect to get screwed by your girlfriend." [...] Jan and Michael drive home, clearly angry at each other over the events of the day.|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, {{only hours}} after the Virginia Tech {{shooting}} (and before Seung-Hui Cho was actually identified), Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter-Strike. According to Thompson, the game [...] "drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [...] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower." [...] He says that Seung-Hui [...] "was in a hyper-reality situation in virtual reality." [...] Though Seung-Hui had last been known to have played Counter-Strike in high school, four {{years prior to the}} shooting, Thompson asserts that [...] "you don't drop it when you go to college, typically." [...] Thompson disputed Seung-Hui's roommate's claim that Seung-Hui only used his computer to write fiction, on the grounds that [...] "Cho was able to go room to room calmly, efficiently, coolly killing people." [...] Prior to being identified, Thompson attributed the [...] "flat effect on [...] face" [...] and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting. However, a search warrant released, listing the items found in Cho's dorm room, did not contain any video games, and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung-Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school. Despite all evidence indicating that Seung-Hui had not played Counter-Strike in years, Thompson continued to insist that [...] "this is not rocket science. When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator, he's a video gamer." [...] Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates, saying, [...] "Mr. Gates, <b>your</b> <b>company</b> is potentially legally liable (for) the harm done at Virginia Tech. Your game, a killing simulator, according to the news that {{used to be in the}} Post, trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill." [...] However, Microsoft did not create Counter-Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game. The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung-Hui [...] "played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog," [...] and that [...] "none of the video games [...] were war games or had violent themes." ...|$|E
