25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. <b>Yet</b> <b>our</b> consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

2500|$|Huxley's {{courses for}} {{students}} {{were so much}} narrower than the man himself that many were bewildered by the contrast: [...] "The teaching of zoology by use of selected animal types has come in for much criticism"; Looking back in 1914 to his time as a student, Sir Arthur Shipley said [...] "Darwin's later works all dealt with living organisms, <b>yet</b> <b>our</b> obsession was with the dead, with bodies preserved, and cut into the most refined slices". E.W MacBride said [...] "Huxley... would persist in looking at animals as material structures and not as living, active beings; in a word... he was a necrologist.

2500|$|Until January 2008, Benson's {{web site}} also stated: [...] "After serving time {{in federal prison}} for not paying his United States income taxes, Bill Benson still does not pay income taxes and <b>yet</b> <b>our</b> federal {{government}} chooses not to arrest him.

[...] Similarly, {{as late as the}} year 2007, Benson claimed, in marketing the [...] "Reliance Defense Package" [...] that included his non-ratification argument, that [...] "o date, the IRS has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense. Why do they do this? Because they know they cannot win!!" [...] The book was actually published several years before Benson's arrest and, as noted above, Benson himself actually was convicted despite using the defense.|$|E
2500|$|After that he {{realized}} {{that there is not}} much [...] "symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one. <b>Yet</b> <b>our</b> state is similar to a cancer cell – with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information." [...] Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works he declared that [...] "the principle 'what is not prohibited is allowed' should be understood literally", defying the unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist ruling elite on the society in spite of the seemingly democratic (1936) USSR Constitution.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Yet</b> <b>our</b> {{sources for}} this major reform are [...] "meagre and late", {{so that it}} [...] "is {{difficult}} to tell what Julianus in fact did." [...] A key feature of the Praetor's Edict was its organisational scheme, {{the order in which}} the various subjects of the law are presented. This sequence had obviously [...] "grown up gradually from one generation to another. How far Julian's final redaction departs from the hitherto traditional arrangement we have not the means of judging save in some exceptional cases." [...] Nonetheless, certain changes in the Edict wrought by Iulianus are well known, e.g., regarding intestate succession, that affecting shares of inheritance among children in the Bonorum possessio unde liberi. Moreover, his other alterations do not seem problematic. It was this received [...] "edictal order of topics" [...] that was already widely used in juristic works of the Principate, during the classical period of Roman Law. Among Roman jurists, [...] "Julian's work on the Edict was traditionally regarded as of great importance [...] he is repeatedly spoken of as compositor, conditor, ordinator of the Edict." ...|$|E
2500|$|Demetrius Charles de Kavanagh Boulger stated at {{the time}} that the {{strength}} of the Qing has been thoroughly demonstrated and that her prestige remained unsullied. [...] "Whatever danger there may be to the permanence of Qing's triumph lies rather from Russia than from the peoples of Tian Shan Nan Lu; nor is there much danger that the Chinese laurels will become faded even before a European foe. Zuo Zongtang and his generals such as Jin Shun and Chang Yao, accomplished a task which would reflect credit on any army and any country. They have given a luster to the modern Chinese administration which must stand it in good stead, and they have acquired a personal renown that will not easily depart. The Qing reconquest of Xinjiang is beyond doubt the most remarkable event that has occurred in Asia during the last fifty years, and it is quite the most brilliant achievement of a Chinese army, led by Chinese generals, that has taken place since the Qianlong Emperor subdued the country more than a century ago. It also proves, in a manner that is more than unpalatable to us, that the Chinese possess an adaptive faculty that must be held to be a very important fact in every-day politics in Central Asia. They reconquered Kashgaria with European weapons and by careful study of Western science and technology. Their soldiers marched in obedience to instructors trained on the Prussian principle; and their generals maneuvered their troops in accordance with the teachings of Moltke and Manteuffel. Even in such minor matters as the use of telescopes and field glasses we could find this Chinese army well supplied. Nothing was more absurd than the picture drawn by some over-wise observer of this army, as consisting of soldiers fantastically garbed in the guise of dragons and other hideous appearances. All that belonged to an old-world theory. The rebel troops were as widely different from all previous Chinese armies in Central Asia as it well could be; and in all essentials closely resembled that of a European power. Its remarkable triumphs were chiefly attributable to the thoroughness with which China had in this instance adapted herself to Western notions". [...] "But, although our hands are tied in Central Asia, they are not fettered at Pekin, and we certainly should congratulate, if we have not done so already, the Chinese on their remarkable successes in the Tian Shan regions. That step might be pregnant with beneficent results, and our desire to be on good terms with our new, <b>yet</b> <b>our</b> old, neighbour might be met in a cordial manner by the Chinese." ...|$|E
