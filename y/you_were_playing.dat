500|$|One of {{the qualities}} of The Basement Tapes that sets it apart from {{contemporaneous}} works is its simple, down-to-earth sound. The songs were recorded in mid-1967, the [...] "Summer of Love" [...] that produced The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, their most technically elaborate album. In a 1978 interview, Dylan reflected on the period: [...] "I didn't know how to record the way other people were recording, and I didn't want to. The Beatles had just released Sgt. Pepper which I didn't like at all. I {{thought that was a}} very indulgent album, though the songs on it were real good. I didn't think all that production was necessary." [...] Of the sound and atmosphere of the basement recordings, Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Big Pink itself determined the nature of this homemade brew." [...] "One of the things is that if you played loud in the basement, it was really annoying, because it was a cement-walled room", recalled Robertson. [...] "So we played in a little huddle: if you couldn't hear the singing, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> too loud." ...|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But I spent a total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, Hubbard {{identified}} the realistic expectations {{set by the}} team as a strong point in the game's development, saying that [...] "given our budget, team size, and development cycle, {{the best we could}} hope to do was to create a fun, engaging 60s espionage game that would make up in presentation what it lacked in innovation." [...] Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement, along with the flexible systems used in development, the cohesion of the team, and effective scheduling. On the other hand, Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team, as well as inefficient pre-production, delays due to waiting on technology, and the major difficulties in finding a publisher. Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic, partly because of technical difficulties, and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf, with regard to screenwriting. Regarding gameplay, he said that [...] "ne of the main failings of NOLF [...] was that it ended up feeling a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be". Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue: [...] "Unfortunately, we came up a little short on intrigue. Stealth was too unforgiving. Once you were spotted, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> an action game." [...] The team paid attention to these points while developing No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E
50|$|In Biber’s Harmonia Artificiosa no. VII, a {{different}} version of scordatura notation is used. Biber uses a nine line staff. The clefs used {{are based on}} alto clef (imagining that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> a viola). The piece is written for a six-stringed instrument. The {{upper part of the}} staff supposes that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> on the upper four strings and the lower part that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> on the lower four strings (still imagining that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> reading the four strings of a viola in alto clef). This does mean that there are two ways of notating notes on the middle two strings but it quickly becomes apparent, when playing, what the correct reading should be.|$|R

500|$|The next day, Davidson found Haywood in his office, {{playing the}} {{keyboard}} part which was later revived for the song's riff. [...] "When we got {{done with the}} other song, I kept going back, saying, 'Man, there's something about what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> earlier ... let's mess with that before we leave.' So he started playing it again," [...] Davidson recalled. After the keyboard elements were completed, Scott and Kelley finished the song's music and lyrics at the studio. They discussed ideas for the song; Kelley put forward the basic melody and Scott followed up with her own contribution. After they wrote the lyrics, Davidson proposed that the song's title be [...] "Just a Kiss Goodnight". It was later changed to [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] after Scott felt that [...] "it's cool to have 'just a kiss' goodnight rather than going all the way." [...] Kelley told Country Weekly that the song {{was inspired by the}} band members' experiences: [...] "I remembered being out the first night with Cassie and thinking, 'This is different, and I don't want to give any wrong impression. I [...] don't want to make the wrong move because this feels like something [...] special.' We started talking about that and going back and forth with [...] different experiences when we wrote the song." [...] The song was recorded and mixed by Clarke Schleicher, with assistance from Joe Martino and Andrew Bazinet. The B-side track, [...] "Bottle Up Lightning", was written by Kelley, Haywood, Tony Martin and Wendell Lee Mobley.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, {{the initial}} wave of American {{hardcore}} punk had waned and split into other subgenres. The Seattle-based grunge movement was among the many styles of music that directly evolved from hardcore. Through the mainstream success of several grunge bands, the word mosh entered the popular North American vocabulary and the dance spread to many other music genres. According to John Linnell of They Might Be Giants, [...] "it didn’t matter what kind of music <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> or what kind of band you were; everybody moshed to everything. It was just kind of the enforced rule of going to concerts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{dissolved}} after {{a show in}} Columbia, Missouri, in 1987. Hart {{was trying}} to quit heroin using a supply of methadone, but the bottle had leaked. Hart played the show, but Mould and Norton were concerned Hart would soon be suffering from withdrawal and thus {{would be unable to}} play the next few shows. While Hart insisted he could perform, Mould had already canceled the dates. Hart quit the band four days later. Hart has said his drug use was not the reason for the band's demise, rather, it was the tensions between the band members. Hart said, [...] "It just became that it was easier to be around Bob if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> a part of Bob's game," [...] and also said he felt Mould's songs had become increasingly [...] "square." ...|$|E

5000|$|When street hockey <b>is</b> <b>played</b> in rinks, whether outdoor or indoor, it {{is often}} called [...] "dek hockey" [...] or [...] "ball hockey" [...] {{depending}} on where in the U.S. and Canada it <b>is</b> being <b>played.</b> An overwhelming majority {{refer to it as}} ball hockey, with some parts of America preferring [...] "dek hockey". For clarification purposes, dek and ball hockey <b>are</b> <b>played</b> under organized rules if they are not already being played as part of an organized league which has an official set of rules (see the section Leagues and governing bodies below). In other words, if <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> dek hockey or ball hockey, both have specific meanings as to the type of rules <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>playing</b> under, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> nonetheless <b>playing</b> under rules.|$|R

2500|$|By saying Double, the {{competition}} {{will be harder}} because the round scores will be {{twice as much as}} the normal [...] round. The Three means 3 times as much as the normal [...] round and Four means four. The main purposes of saying [...] "Double or Four" [...] is to change the way of playing and increase points, since when the game is doubled (or more) points aren't divided, the team with most points takes all. If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> in [...] "locked" [...] "Double or Four", the one who says [...] "Double" [...] or [...] "Four" [...] has the option of locking or opening the Hokom. In case it's locked you can't use the Judged suit as a first card in any trick, you can only use them when you don't have the suit that the other player has played, or don't have any other suit to play as a first card in the trick. Otherwise, [...] "if its Three or Gahwa" [...] you can use any suit you want, even if it was the Judged suit.|$|E
2500|$|The Indian cricket team, humiliated in {{all forms}} {{of the game in}} the tour, was the subject of ridicule from the media and former cricketers. The Australian wrote under the {{headline}} [...] "India's pillars of strength reduced to useless rubble" [...] Dhoni is not the only shaky pillar of what only eight months ago was the number one cricket nation in the world. VVS Laxman, once the scourge of Australian bowlers, is being flayed himself at home after scores of 2,1, 2, 66, 31 and 0. Virender Sehwag, who warmed up for this series by scoring the fastest double century in One-Day International history, also is trending south faster than Scott and Amundsen, having followed up his whirlwind 67 in Melbourne with innings of 7, 30, 4, 0 and 10. Worst of all, Dhoni has failed with the bat. The Indian captain is no thunderer at the best of times – neither is coach Duncan Fletcher, which may be part of the problem – but how can he demand more of his batsmen when he has nowhere to hide behind scores of 6, 23, 57no, 2, 12 and 2? India has not had a single century-maker in the past three Tests, The Daily Telegraph said that India's performance was [...] "so bad that the first question that came Michael Clarke's way at the press conference was 'did it feel as if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>playing</b> Bangladesh?'". The newspaper also played up Dhoni's one-match ban due to the Indian team's slow over-rate in the third Test. Under the headline 'Dhoni dumped from Adelaide Test', the newspaper wrote, [...] "India's shambolic tour of Australia plunged into unprecedented disarray when their captain MS Dhoni was sensationally banned from playing in the final Test due to slow over rates". The Herald Sun wrote about how Australia built up a team after the Ashes humiliation last year while sarcastically mentioning the visiting players skipping practice sessions in the tour.As painful as it was, getting flogged in last year's Ashes may be remembered as the recession Australia had to have. Nothing is being taken for granted in Australian cricket any more. The new coaching unit is working well under head coach Mickey Arthur and Australia has worked hard to freshen up every aspect of its game. India, by contrast, just lobs along, its players pocketing millions each year and too spoilt to make major sacrifices. It's appropriate that many Indian players {{spent a lot of time}} last week sitting under trees at training, because their entire Test match game is being left in the shade.|$|E
