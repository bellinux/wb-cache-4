5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If <b>you</b> <b>act</b> in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how <b>you</b> <b>act.</b> [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, I like to think that I’m gay in my art and straight in my life".|$|E
500|$|Wenger welcomed Chelsea's emergence, {{describing}} {{them as the}} [...] "third force" [...] in English football, but {{he raised}} concerns over their conduct and what he perceived as artificial growth. Asked whether Chelsea could dominate for the foreseeable, Wenger said: [...] "I feel yes, because they are a financially doped club. [...] They have enhancement of performances through financial resources which are unlimited. For me, it's a kind of doping because it's {{not in any way}} linked to their resources." [...] Despite the absence of Thierry Henry, ruled out through injury, and Arsenal's poor recent record against Manchester United, Wenger believed his team were more than capable of winning the match: [...] "What is good in football {{is that it is not}} predictable. [...] <b>You</b> <b>act</b> now like it is a decade that we haven’t beaten Manchester United – it's not true. It's two games." [...] It was reported on the eve of the final that Philippe Senderos would start ahead of first-teamer Sol Campbell.|$|E

500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second). Instrumentation is {{provided}} by finger snapping, minor piano keys and piano riffs, a style of repeated chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] revolve around a woman in an abusive and adulterous relationship, progressing to the female protagonist leaving her boyfriend. The song begins with the line [...] "Let me tell you somethin' / Never / Have I ever / Been a size 10 in my whole life." [...] Rihanna sings the line [...] "This is stupid / I'm not stupid / Don't talk to me / Like I'm stupid" [...] during the chorus. The bridge consists of Rihanna singing [...] "Trying {{to make this work}} / but <b>you</b> <b>act</b> like a jerk." [...] As noted by Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice, the bridge represents the moment when Rihanna realizes that it is not worth her while to stay in the relationship, writing [...] "the dunce cap is off". [...] "Stupid in Love" [...] contains a lyrical metaphor, [...] "Blood on your hands." ...|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making {{a big deal out}} of nothing. [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>act</b> like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E
2500|$|Blessings and curses have no firm foundation, and {{it depends}} on how <b>you</b> <b>act</b> on them. [...] I will not ignore the signs, and I will not make you gentlemen worry. [...] Fu Gongshi is full of treachery and sins, and I {{rightfully}} attack him now in the name and spirit of the emperor. [...] The blood in my cup is sign that this thief will soon lose his head! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must try}} to forget it, Richmond," [...] she said. [...] "It's over, and it can't be helped now. <b>You</b> <b>acted</b> like a God-fearing man; your {{conscience}} is clear of evil intent. What is the judgment of man beside the judgment of God? If you have received insult and humiliation {{at the hands of}} man, God will repay you an hundredfold, for <b>you</b> <b>acted</b> as his servant. And I believe in you, Richmond; and I'm proud of what you did." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{start of}} the game was delayed by half an hour after Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost sought a ruling that Penn's “tackle back” play (in which the tackle dropped back into the backfield as a ball carrier) was illegal under the new rules. [...] The referee, Kelly, agreed with Yost and {{informed}} the Pennsylvania team. [...] The Quakers refused to take the field [...] {{in light of the}} ruling, and twenty minutes of wrangling followed. [...] Yost reported after the game that the umpire Langford finally approached Yost and said, [...] "Now, Mr. Yost, <b>you</b> <b>act</b> the gentleman and go on the field." [...] According to the Detroit Free Press, the officials ruled that the play was legal if the a guard or tackle had both feet or both hands up to the line of scrimmage and waited until the snap to receive the ball.|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, <b>you</b> <b>act</b> the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d just as soon act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “On {{the day of}} the [...] "Big Issue", when {{thousands}} of Indians were gathered at the agency, this man Little, who had been in hiding, walked boldly among them. Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered. A crowd of warriors rushed to his rescue, and there was confusion and a general shout of [...] "Hurry up with them! Kill them all!" [...] I saw American Horse walk out of the agent's office and calmly face the excited mob. [...] "What are you going to do?" [...] he asked. [...] "Stop, men, stop and think before <b>you</b> <b>act!</b> Will you murder your children, your women, yes, destroy your nation to-day?" [...] He stood before them like a statue and the men who held the two policemen helpless paused for an instant. He went on: [...] "You are brave today because you outnumber the white men, but what will you do tomorrow? There are railroads on all sides of you. The soldiers will pour in from every direction by thousands and surround you. You have little food or ammunition. It will be the end of your people. Stop, I say, stop now!" [...] Jack Red Cloud, son of the old chief rushed up to him and thrust a revolver almost in his face. [...] "It is you and men like you," [...] he shouted, [...] "who have reduced our race to slavery and starvation!" [...] American Horse did not flinch but deliberately reentered the office, followed by Jack still flourishing the pistol. But his timely appearance and eloquence had saved the day. Others of the police force had time to reach the spot, and with a large crowd of friendly Indians had taken command of the situation. When I went into the office I found him alone but apparently quite calm. [...] "Where are the agent and the clerks?" [...] I asked. [...] "They fled by the back door," [...] he replied, smiling. [...] "I think they are in the cellar. These fools outside had almost caught us asleep, but I think it is over now." ...|$|E

6000|$|Tata did not cry, but {{continued}} as if {{lost in thought}} which she could not break from, and that night, after she had said her prayers with her mother, her mother {{thought it was time}} to ask her: [...] "Tata, dear, why did <b>you</b> <b>act</b> so to that boy to-day? Why didn't you give him something of yours when he brought you all his things? Why did <b>you</b> <b>act</b> so oddly?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In good truth, <b>you</b> <b>acted</b> simply," [...] said Sir Henry, [...] "to {{attack a}} {{garrison}} without a summons. But {{all this is}} nothing to my son, Albert--where is he?--Let me see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} know, and I know, what {{that amounts to}} now. My idea is that <b>you</b> <b>acted</b> as an honest man when you were last here. You are not a rich man--" ...|$|R
