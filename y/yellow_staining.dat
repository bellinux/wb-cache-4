40|$|Flavanols and flavonols of mitotic and post-mitotic nuclei in needles of Taxus baccata L., Tsuga canadensis L., {{and slow}} growing dwarf genotypes of both genera are {{investigated}} histochemically. The flavanols of nuclear chromatins {{and in the}} vacuoles stain blue with the p-dimethylamino-cinnamaldehyde (DMACA) reagent. Flavonols do not react with the reagent but owing to their UV absorbance they {{can be seen as}} bright yellow pigments. The nuclei in the photomicrographs obtained by microscopy were measured for flavanols at 640 nm. The vigorously sprouting Taxus baccata L. displays the most rapid cell cycling of the needles and the nuclei reveal clear blue and white mosaic structures. The flavanol component of Taxus baccata nuclei remains relatively stable most of the growing season. The dwarf genotypes also display fairly blue stained meristematic nuclei during the intense spring flush. However, after the spring flush and towards mid-summer the nuclear flavanols slowly decrease in parallel with a gradual increase in <b>yellow</b> <b>staining</b> nuclear flavonols. A mixture of blue stained flavanols and yellow flavonols results in greenish coloration of the nuclei. The greenish tint becomes more pronounced when the parenchyma cells mature and age. At the same time, the cytoplasm of the dwarf genotypes also begins to attain a more yellow tint. This trend continues towards mid-summer and autumn, particularly in the nana genotypes. It would appear that the <b>yellow</b> <b>staining</b> flavonols are linked to restricted growth conditions. In the present study, it becomes evident that the species-typical endogenous growth potential is related to both flavanol and flavonol allocation into the nuclei. The vigorously growing species of Taxus and Tsuga have a higher capacity for recruitment of flavanols into the nuclei than the very slow growing dwarf species...|$|E

40|$|Much {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} the chemical composition of a fingermark, which can be helpful in crime scene investigation. Immunolabeling can be used to extract information about the donor of the fingermark and it can also act as a fingermark development tool in sequence with the standard fingermark development techniques. However, before immunolabeling can be used in forensic practice more information on the possibilities and limitations of this technique is required. In this study, our aim was to investigate if immunolabeling is compatible with standard development protocols (indanedione-zinc, indanedione-zinc followed by ninhydrin spraying, physical developer, cyanoacrylate fuming, cyanoacrylate followed by basic <b>yellow</b> <b>staining,</b> lumicyanoacrylate fuming and polycyanoacrylate fuming). Immunolabeling was carried out successfully on all developed fingermarks, whereby dermcidin was selected as antigen of interest. We can conclude that immunolabeling is compatible {{with a wide variety of}} different fingermark developers. This finding in combination with previous findings, makes immunolabeling an interesting technique, which can be of great value in the forensic field.

40|$|Bipolar-cell axon {{terminals}} receive direct {{synaptic input}} from amacrine-cell processes, suggesting a possible pathway for modulation of transmitter release. In retinal slices, bath-applied baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyrate type B (GABAB) receptor agonist, reduced a patch-clamp-recorded L-type calcium channel current {{in a population}} of bipolar cells with axon terminals that ramify along the midline of the inner plexiform layer. Lucifer <b>yellow</b> <b>staining</b> revealed that this current was found only in bipolar cells that retain axon terminals and their associated telodendria, suggesting that the current is generated at the terminal and also possibly modulated there. T-type calcium currents were found in all bipolar cells, including those without axon terminals, but were not modulated by baclofen. The baclofen-induced reduction of calcium current was enhanced by guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate and eliminated by guanosine 5 '-[beta-thio]diphosphate added to the cytoplasm by the patch recording electrode, suggesting that the GABAB receptors act through a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein). Baclofen also reduced an excitatory synaptic input to a population of amacrine cells with processes that ramify along the midline of the inner plexiform layer [...] cells probably postsynaptic to the bipolar terminals. This suggests that GABAB receptors modulate not only the calcium current but also transmitter release by a pathway involving G proteins and L-type calcium channels...|$|E
