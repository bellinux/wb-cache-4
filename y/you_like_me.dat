500|$|Keith had {{originally}} recorded the song {{near the end}} of his contract with Mercury Records Nashville in the late 1990s. According to a 2005 interview with Billboard, Keith had the album How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?! completed, but label executives rejected the entire album except for two songs: [...] "Getcha Some" [...] and [...] "If a Man Answers", both of which were put on his 1999 Greatest Hits album. After he recorded two more songs which were also rejected, he asked to terminate his contract with Mercury, and purchased the rights to the rest of the album. Upon the album's release in late 1999, both the album and its lead single, [...] "When Love Fades", were performing poorly on the charts; as a result, Keith asked that [...] "When Love Fades" [...] be withdrawn as a single in favor of [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] Keith stated that DreamWorks executives were [...] "scared to put it out", but within five days of Keith's request, [...] "When Love Fades" [...] was withdrawn and [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] was released.|$|E
500|$|... "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] {{is a song}} co-written and {{recorded}} by American country music artist Toby Keith. It released in November 1999 as the second single and title track from his album of the same name. Keith wrote it with Chuck Cannon.|$|E
6000|$|I keep living {{over again}} the lovely times we have had. But I don't think <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> quite so much towards the end, did you? <b>You</b> did not <b>like</b> <b>me</b> {{when we left}} Paris. Why didn't you? ...|$|R
6000|$|But he looked, {{in spite}} of it, {{literally}} apprehensive and consistently strenuous. [...] "Ah, I thought <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> for myself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You didn't think {{anything}} impossible of old,' Raymond rejoined, bitterly. 'I thought <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> then, and I have even thought so since.' ...|$|R
500|$|Keith {{discussed}} {{the inspiration for}} the song on his website in 2000. [...] "Initially, I said, 'Here's my title: [...] "You Never Loved Me Before, So How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?'" [...] It's one of my catch-phrases. A lot of people become successful after they've been told they won't ever be, so people can relate to this. It can be about an old flame or a boss or a teacher -whatever it means to each individual. It was a fun song to write." ...|$|E
500|$|Singer Faith Hill's song [...] "Breathe" [...] was {{at number}} {{one at the}} start of the year, having risen to the top in the issue dated December 25, 1999. [...] The song {{remained}} at number one for six consecutive weeks until it was knocked off by [...] "Cowboy Take Me Away", performed by the girl group the Dixie Chicks, in the issue dated February 5. [...] "Breathe" [...] was also named the most successful single of the year on the magazine's main singles chart, the Hot 100. [...] Hill returned to the top of the country charts with her next single, [...] "The Way You Love Me", which spent four weeks at number one in May and June. [...] Only two other acts, Lonestar and Hill's husband Tim McGraw, had more than one Hot Country Songs number one during the year. [...] Other singles with extended runs at number one include [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] by Toby Keith, [...] "I Hope You Dance" [...] by Lee Ann Womack featuring Sons of the Desert and [...] "That's the Way" [...] by Jo Dee Messina, each of which topped the chart for five weeks. [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] was ranked number one on Billboards year-end chart of the most popular country songs.|$|E
500|$|A {{great deal}} of the plot in [...] "Time Capsule" [...] {{revolves}} around the Twilight series of novels and films. The popular book series was written by Stephenie Meyer. At one point, while trying to persuade Leslie to include Twilight in the capsule, Kelly Larson begins telling the entire story of the Twilight series, including Meyer's birth and life story and shot-for-shot descriptions of the film adaptations. The stories are told from the perspective of high school student and outsider Bella Swan, who is pursued romantically by a vampire named Edward Cullen and a werewolf named Jacob Black. Elements of the story are raised in various scenes of [...] "Time Capsule", including when Tom tries to ask Lucy why she broke up with him: [...] "Is it because I'm not cool enough, like the normal kids compared to the vampires? Is it an Edward-Bella-Jacob type situation, where <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> but there's someone else you like more?" [...] Leslie claims to favor Harry Potter, the popular fantasy series by author J.K. Rowling, over Twilight. Parks department employee Donna professes an unhealthy infatuation with Robert Pattinson, the actor who played Edward Cullen in the Twilight films.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "That's one mercy. You see," [...] he {{continued}} with emotion, [...] "I'd rather <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me</b> {{than any one}} I've ever met." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{were willing}} to go away with me," [...] he {{continued}} mercilessly, [...] "partly because of the anger you felt towards him, and partly out of revenge, and just a little because <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me.</b> Is that not so?" ...|$|R
500|$|In February 1968, Starr {{became the}} first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit [...] "Act Naturally", and {{performed}} a duet with Cilla Black, [...] "Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Just a Little Bit?" [...] on her BBC One television programme, Cilla. Later that year Apple Records released The Beatles, {{commonly known as the}} [...] "White Album". Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive. As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono near-constant presence. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his Abbey Road composition, [...] "Octopus's Garden", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later, to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.|$|E

At least they’d {{serve as a}} sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts… [...] So, then! Would <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> to find some {{mechanism}} by which we could end this war? ...|$|E
2500|$|Signed to DreamWorks Records Nashville in 1998, Keith {{released}} his breakthrough single [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!" [...] that year. This song, {{the title track}} to his 1999 album of the same name, was the number one country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, Pull My Chain, Unleashed, and Shock'n Y'all, produced three more number ones each, {{and all of the}} albums were certified 4x Platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released Honkytonk University.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they would}} think the truth," [...] said he. [...] "Perhaps they would imagine that I called you so because I <b>liked</b> <b>you.</b> But perhaps they might think also that you let me do so because <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>me.</b> People do make such mistakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody does," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl coolly. [...] "I'm glad <b>you</b> <b>like</b> the way I talk. But I want <b>you</b> to <b>like</b> <b>ME,</b> too--AS WELL as <b>you</b> <b>like</b> Felicity and Cecily. Not BETTER. I wanted that once but I've got over it. I {{found out in}} Sunday School, the day the {{minister}} taught our class, that it was selfish. But I want <b>you</b> to <b>like</b> <b>me</b> AS WELL." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Keith {{moved to}} DreamWorks Records' Nashville division, of which Stroud served as president. His first release for the label was [...] "When Love Fades", which {{also failed to}} make Top 40. Upon seeing the single's poor performance, Keith {{requested}} that it be withdrawn and replaced with [...] "How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?!", a song that he wrote with Chuck Cannon, and which had previously been turned down by Mercury. It also served as the title track to his first DreamWorks album, How Do <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Now?! The song spent five weeks at number 1 on the country charts, and became his first top 40 pop hit, with a number 31 peak on the Hot 100. It was also the top country song of 2000 according to the Billboard Year-End chart. The album, which was certified platinum, produced a Top 5 hit in [...] "Country Comes to Town" [...] and another number 1 in [...] "You Shouldn't Kiss Me Like This". It was also his first album to feature songs co-written by Scotty Emerick, who would be a frequent collaborator of Keith's {{for the next several}} albums. Steve Huey wrote that this album [...] "had a rough, brash attitude that helped give Keith a stronger identity as a performer." [...] In 2001, Keith won the Academy of Country Music's Top Male Vocalist and Album of the Year awards.|$|E
2500|$|... 'To {{compel the}} people {{to give up their}} goods, (General) Zarrouk put many notables in irons and locked them up; one of them was my {{grandfather}}. Their ordeal lasted I don't know how many days. Then my family took a sheet and wrapped up all their jewels and all their land titles. [...] My father had the task of taking all this to Zarrouk to obtain my grandfather's freedom. He {{made his way to the}} encampment where a number of tents stood. [...] Above one of them flew a flag. [...] This was the tent of General Zarrouk, who took all our fortune and freed his prisoners. Ten days later, my grandfather died from the appalling treatment he had suffered. My father did not escape unscathed either. He was conscripted into Zarrouk's army where he served for nineteen years, the longest and hardest years of his life. [...] He urged me to study. [...] 'I don't want you to be brought down to the level of a beast of burden one day' he said. 'I don't want to see <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> condemned to wear a uniform all your days.' I assured him I would do my best by devoting myself completely to my studies.|$|E
2500|$|Like Easy Mo Bee, New York {{producer}} Pete Rock {{first began}} {{his association with}} the Wu-Tang before it was formally founded—by playing mentor to RZA, then under the moniker Prince Rakeem. In the book [...] "The Wu-Tang Manual," [...] RZA admits to effectively stealing equipment from the successful producer, borrowing and never returning an MPC. Pete first produced for the Wu-Tang when its members Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, Inspectah Deck and Method Man made appearances on his 1998 album Soul Survivor. The following year, the producer provided beats for Raekwon's second album Immobilarity, Inspectah Deck's debut album Uncontrolled Substance, and Wu members RZA and GZA appeared on Pete's 2004 follow-up solo album Soul Survivor II. Since then the frequency of Pete Rock's collaborations with the Wu-Tang have increased, as he provided production for Ghostface Killah's two 2006 solo albums, Fishscale and More Fish (including the unreleased song, [...] "Chunky"); Masta Killa's 2006 second album Made in Brooklyn; the Raekwon- and Masta Killa-featuring song [...] "PJ's" [...] from his own third solo album, NY's Finest; the single [...] "A Yo" [...] from Method Man & Redman's Blackout! 2; the song [...] "Sonny's Missing," [...] from Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... pt. II; and the track [...] "How <b>You</b> <b>Like</b> <b>Me</b> Baby?" [...] from Ghostface Killah's Apollo Kids.|$|E
