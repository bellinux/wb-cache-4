The rusty old gate has a bell to correspond, which you ring {{as long as you}} like, and which nobody answers, as it has no {{connection}} whatever with the house. But there is a rusty old knocker, too-- very loose, so that it slides round when you touch it--and if you learn the trick of it, and knock long enough, somebody comes.

It has five windows and five doors, and is decorated with pictures which would gladden the heart of one of those picture-cleaners in London who hang up, as a sign, a picture divided, like death and the lady, {{at the top of the}} old ballad: which always leaves you in a state of uncertainty whether the ingenious professor has cleaned one half, or dirtied the other.

50|$|Erskine, Markham, and Howie (2001) discuss script-based inferences {{and their}} effects on memory {{retrieval}} and eyewitness testimony. Scripts are schemas for specific events that are constructed from experience (Lindsay, J., 2014).

Scripts are usually beneficial in that they help organize one’s thoughts and they facilitate a better understanding of a situation (Abelson, 1981). However, these script biases can also have effects that are damaging in the retrieval of accurate memories. Scripts can lead people to report details of events that did not happen, even if those details fit with the script of the event.|$|E

Probably with a puzzled look, {{possibly}} followed by, “Fine thanks, and you? ” Much {{research has been done}} in how the human mind understands a known language. But though nonsense languages have a rich literary history, there is much less written on how we understand and process nonsense languages, those for which {{there is little or no}} existing mental framework. This thesis explores how this sort of linguistic input might be processed and understood, focusing in particular the case of Unamunda, the nonsense language created by David Ives in his short play “The Universal Language ” (1994). Unamunda consists of a combination of English words assigned new meanings, proper nouns (also assigned new meanings), plays on foreign words and phrases, and nonsense words. Its syntax is very nearly that of English, with occasional variations on word order. Though no one listening to Unamunda being spoken onstage has any prior familiarity with its lexicon or grammar, it is still possible to understand the utterances with little extra effort. After an overview of some theories and models of some various aspects of word recognition, including the effects of context on lexical decision-making, the clues to meaning supplied by syntactic structures, and phonotactic neighborhood activation, I move on to a discussion of my own experiment, in which subjects were asked to translate written, spoken, and video segments of Unamunda into English. ...|$|R
2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if <b>you</b> were to <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that there are many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|R

Speaking to Beverley Lyons of the Daily Record, she mentioned, [...] "It didn't represent me and I was cringing," [...] adding, [...] "I couldn't put it out there but I was in LA for 10 days and couldn't do anything fast." [...] While Yasmin was in Los Angeles, she called around and when she arrived back in London on 25 November 2010, she was asked to do another of the video but she still felt it was a poor representation of herself. On 26 November, she phoned everyone she knew and arranged to shoot a second video which she had to present on 29 November. She knew some good videographers and producers from her previous work with Devlin on [...] "Runaway" [...] and she managed to work within a budget of £1000. Speaking to Lyons, Yasmin said, [...] "I paid for video all myself as the budget had been used up on the official video and luckily lots of people gave me reduced rates."

Yasmin shot the new video all day long on 27 November and in the evening, Paul O'Reilly begun editing it right through to 28 November. O'Reilly then gave Yasmin a harddrive with the edited video which she presented to her label at 09:00 on 29 November and then delivered to television stations. The music video premiered on 3 December 2010. Upon the result of the newly shot video, she was pleased, saying, [...] "The setting and the sort of mood of everything was like 'Look at this.

[...] Yasmin's change of heart upset a few people in the industry but she was determined to send out the right message from the start, she added:Of course it put people's noses out of joint.

Others may be working together to draft letters to the editor of a newspaper about a community problem or to craft a petition to the local school board. The teacher may be writing alongside students, responding to their writing by asking questions and sharing experiences, or giving mini-lessons about a particular grammar point.

[...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|R
