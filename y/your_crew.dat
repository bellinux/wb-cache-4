500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about <b>your</b> <b>crew,</b> and you really {{feel like you have}} a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate the course of a linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E

500|$|Mass Effect 2 was {{developed}} by BioWare and directed by Casey Hudson, who previously led {{the production of the}} first Mass Effect game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers and internal people. The company's main goal was to [...] "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." [...] In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original Mass Effect, Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, [...] "the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering <b>your</b> <b>crew</b> and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story." ...|$|E
500|$|Paramount faced two {{obstacles}} {{in promoting the}} film: the unfamiliarity of the [...] "MySpace generation" [...] with the franchise and the relatively weak international performance of the previous films. Six months before the film's release, Abrams toured Europe and North America with 25 minutes of footage. Abrams noted the large-scale campaign started unusually early, but this was because the release delay allowed him to show more completed scenes than normal. The director preferred promoting his projects quietly, but concurred Paramount needed to remove Star Treks stigma. Abrams would exaggerate his preference for other shows to Star Trek as a child to the press, with statements like [...] "I'm not a Star Trek fan" [...] and [...] "this movie is not made for Star Trek fans necessarily". Orci compared Abrams' approach to The Next Generation episode [...] "A Matter of Honor", where William Riker is stationed aboard a Klingon vessel. [...] "On that ship when someone talks back to you, {{you would have to}} beat them down or you lose the respect of <b>your</b> <b>crew,</b> which is protocol, whereas on a Federation ship that would be a crime. So we have to give [...] a little bit of leeway, when he is traveling the 'galaxy' over there where they don't know Trek, to say the {{things that need to be}} said in order to get people onto our side." ...|$|E

5000|$|Artemis: Spaceship Bridge Simulator is a {{multiplayer}} co-operative spaceship simulation game {{created by}} Thomas Robertson for Windows, iOS, and Android devices. [...] The game {{is designed to}} be played between three and six local players, with each player using a separate computer that provides a different spaceship bridge station, such as helm control or engineering. It is possible for up to eight crews to play Artemis either cooperatively or PvP. The game contains a number of built-in missions for <b>your</b> <b>crew(s)</b> to enjoy, but there is also capabilities for mission scripting if you want something more complicated. There is a fairly large scripting and modding community who share their work with all Artemis players. While Artemis was designed to be played locally, there are multiple groups who play online using TeamSpeak 3 or Discord for communication, including Artemis: Eastern Front, the Terran Stellar Navy, and the United Stellar Navy. If you can't find enough people for <b>your</b> own <b>crew,</b> you'll be welcomed by any of these groups! ...|$|R

5000|$|Uprock {{was taken}} seriously {{by some of}} its {{participants}} and supporters as it {{was an integral part}} of socializing. Prize money, women, bragging rights were all coveted and to the better and popular dancers went the spoils. Mimicking gang mentality where a member from one gang would successfully take the [...] "colors" [...] (jacket with gang insignia) from a member of a rival gang, dancers would sometimes compete for their respective shirts, however this practice was mostly done in Brooklyn, where the dance remained a bit primitive with the mind set of burning the other dancer with disrespectful hand gestures. Similar to gang idiosyncrasy, this was considered a particularly severe humiliation, thus, it was considered one of the highest stakes in a battle. If you lost your shirt, you would sometimes lose your nickname and/or <b>your</b> <b>crew's</b> name.|$|R

You have fixed their ransom at twenty thousand pieces of eight. That sum then belongs to <b>your</b> <b>crews</b> and mine in the proportions by the articles established. You'll hardly wish to dispute it. But what is far more grave is that you have concealed from me this part of the prizes taken on your last cruise, and for such an offence as that the articles provide certain penalties that are something severe in character." ...|$|R
