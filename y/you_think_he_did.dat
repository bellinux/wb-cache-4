6000|$|... "No, I {{have felt}} {{something}} indefinable between us, though I never could bear {{to speak of}} it, ever since Bobus went. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> her any harm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not very}} well acquainted with his style. Then, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> write it? Of course, there are always various opinions. But I {{understood}} you thought he was burned in that accident last winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{ought not}} to speak so of him, Maynard,' said Caterina, passionately. 'He is not what <b>you</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>did</b> care for me; he did love me; only {{he wanted to do}} what his uncle wished.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't?' cried Miss Petowker, really showing great {{capability}} for the stage. 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Lillyvick {{will always remember}} it--always, always, always?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dick, Dick! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really <b>did</b> it? The {{horror of}} it, Dick! to be kissed by a--a--man {{who has been}} dead a hundred years!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{expected}} you {{to speak}} in this way. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not deserve to be wounded by my refusing this because it comes from him.' ...|$|R
60|$|By and by Johnny Chuck {{really did}} find some clover--just the sweetest clover that {{grew in the}} Green Meadows. Johnny Chuck ate and ate and ate and then what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Why, he curled right up in the nice sweet clover and went fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall hear then--but prepare {{yourself}} for something very dreadful. The first {{time of my}} ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball--and at this ball, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{right at}} that very instant Farmer Brown's boy did something. What {{do you think it}} was? No, he didn't shoot her. He didn't fire his dreadful gun. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> do? Why, he threw a snowball at Old Granny Fox and shouted [...] "Boo!" [...] That is what he did and all he did, except to laugh as Granny gave a great leap and then made those black legs of hers fly as never before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Harper!" [...] {{echoed the}} peddler, {{remaining}} {{with his hands}} raised, {{in the act of}} replacing the spectacles. [...] "What do you know of Harper? And why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>do</b> <b>you</b> service?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{yet another}} hope," [...] {{observed}} Kenyon; [...] "the young Count may fall in love, and bring home a fair and laughing wife to chase the gloom out of yonder old frescoed saloon. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could <b>do</b> a better thing, my good Tomaso?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{kept asking}} about you. He asked everything. You don't {{know how much}} <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> of <b>you,</b> Pen. O Pen! what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> made him come? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really <b>did</b> come to see how papa was?" [...] Irene {{buried her face in}} her sister's neck.|$|R
6000|$|Then Joey {{seemed to}} have a great idea, and his {{excitement}} was so impressive that we stood gazing at him. First, he counted the sausages, and said that they were two short, and he found the missing two up the pantaloon's sleeve. Then he ran {{out of the room and}} came back with the sausage-machine; and what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> He put all the sausages into the end of the machine that they had issued from, and turned the handle backward, and then out came the dog at the other end! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! I {{forgot that}} I {{had not been}} able to speak to you since then. Well! last night, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> When you were gone, he had the {{insolence}} to congratulate me on the opportunity then afforded of playing double dummy; and when I declined his proposition, but said that if he wished to have an hour's conversation I was at his service, he coolly told me that he never talked, and bade me good night! Did you ever know such a madman? He never goes to bed. I only had a sofa. How the deuce did you sleep?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{founder of}} the race was Hans Christof, a famous warrior and {{plunderer}} of the Thirty Years’ War. One of Hans’s sons, Otto, appeared as ambassador at the Court of Louis XIV, and {{had to make a}} Swedish speech at his reception before the Most Christian King. Otto was a famous dandy and warrior, but he forgot the speech, and what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Far from being disconcerted, he recited a portion of the Swedish Catechism to His Most Christian Majesty and his Court, not one of whom understood his lingo with the exception of his own suite, who had to keep their gravity as best they might.|$|E
6000|$|... "He doesn't either. <b>You</b> just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> because <b>he</b> {{happens to}} spend {{most of his time in}} the air the way we Swallows do," [...] {{sputtered}} Skimmer. [...] "The Swallow family never would admit such a homely looking fellow as he is as a member.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of his urging {{us to go}} to the race? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} it for an invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean about}} his letting me <b>think</b> <b>he</b> didn't ca'e for me, so long. But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> wants to <b>do</b> what is right! Mr. Gregory, I mean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And if," [...] wrote Miss Dore, justifiably annoyed, [...] "after {{saying all}} those things to the poor kid and telling her {{she was the only}} thing in sight, he thinks he can just slide off with a 'Good-bye! Good luck! and God bless you!' he's got another guess coming. And that's not all. He hasn't gone abroad! I saw him in Piccadilly this afternoon. He saw me, too, and what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Ducked down a side-street, if you please. He must have run like a rabbit, at that, because, when I got there, he was nowhere to be seen. I tell you, George, there's {{something}} funny about all this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My letter despatched," [...] Mr. Engelman continued, [...] "I begged {{both the}} doctors {{to speak with}} me before they went away, in my private room. There I told them, in the plainest words I could find, exactly what I have told you. Doctor Dormann behaved like a gentleman. He said, 'Let me see the lady, and speak to her myself, before the new remedy is tried.' As for the other, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Walked {{out of the house}} (the old brute!) and {{declined}} any further attendance on the patient. And who do you think followed him out of the house, David, when I sent for Madame Fontaine? Another old brute--Mother Barbara!" ...|$|E
60|$|This night Bobby Coon had {{overslept}} {{because he}} had not gone to bed {{until the middle of}} the day. He had been prowling about and getting into mischief all of the night before and had not started for home until jolly, round Mr. Sun was smiling down from right overhead. By this time Bobby Coon had sticks in his eyes. He was so sleepy that {{it seemed to him that}} he never, never could get home. He was stumbling along through the Green Forest when he came to a hollow log. What do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Why, he crawled in there, and in two minutes was fast asleep, just as comfortable as if he had been in his own hollow tree.|$|E
500|$|Jon's {{presence}} in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain; when asked in 2011 by Entertainment Weekly [...] "Why did you kill Jon Snow?", author Martin responded [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> dead, <b>do</b> you?" [...] Asked later whether Jon was killed or will survive, Martin responded with a laugh, [...] "I will not comment on that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'For shame,' {{the woman}} said. 'You are doubting the good God again, {{after he has}} saved your life and has sent you food and {{is now going to}} send <b>you</b> water. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> all this for nothing? There must be some way out of the {{difficulty}} if we could but think of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is hopeful? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So Mr. Snake {{found that}} lying {{helped him to}} cheat and steal, {{and all the time}} he kept {{thinking}} how smart he was. But even Mr. Snake {{had a little bit of}} conscience, and once in a while it would trouble him. So what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Why, cheating had become such a habit with him that he actually tried to cheat himself--to cheat his conscience! When he was telling a lie, he would wink one eye. 'That,' said he to himself, 'means that it isn't true, and if these folks are not smart enough to see me wink and know what it means, it is their own fault if they believe what I am telling them.' But always he took care to wink the eye that was turned away from the one he was talking to.|$|E
6000|$|But Tom {{was most}} {{astonished}} {{to see how}} he fired himself off--snap! like the leap-frogs which you make out of a goose's breast-bone. Certainly he took the most wonderful shots, and backwards, too. For, if he wanted to go into a narrow crack ten yards off, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> If he had gone in head foremost, of course he could not have turned round. So he used to turn his tail to it, and lay his long horns, which carry his sixth sense in their tips (and nobody knows what that sixth sense is), straight down his back to guide him, and twist his eyes back till they almost came out of their sockets, and then made ready, present, fire, snap!--and away he went, pop into the hole; and peeped out and twiddled his whiskers, as much as to say, [...] "You couldn't do that." ...|$|E
6000|$|The butcher {{had seen}} him further on in the journey, {{at the other end}} of the town. He had stopped--again in the pouring rain--and this time to look at nothing more {{remarkable}} than a half-starved cur, shivering on a doorstep. [...] "I had my eye on him," [...] said the butcher; [...] "and what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> He crossed the road over to my shop, and bought a bit of meat fit for a Christian. Very well. He says good-morning, and crosses back again; and, on the word of a man, down he goes on his knees on the wet doorstep, and out he takes his knife, and cuts up the meat, and gives it to the dog. Meat, I tell you again, fit for a Christian! I'm not a hard man, ma'am," [...] concluded the butcher, addressing the cook, [...] "but meat's meat; and it will serve your master's friend right if he lives to want it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Big Mike's {{a friend}} of mine. I ain't more than deuce-high in the {{district}} as far as influence goes, but Mike's as good a friend to a little man, or a poor man as he is to a big one. I met him to-day on the Bowery, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does?</b> Comes up and shakes hands. 'Andy,' says he, 'I've been keeping cases on you. You've been putting in some good licks over on {{your side of the}} street, and I'm proud of you. What'll you take to drink?" [...] He takes a cigar, and I take a highball. I told him I was going to get married in two weeks. 'Andy,' says he, 'send me an invitation, so I'll keep in mind of it, and I'll come to the wedding.' That's what Big Mike says to me; and <b>he</b> always <b>does</b> what <b>he</b> says.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> may be <b>doing</b> that {{to blind}} his {{followers}} {{as to his}} friendship?" [...] said Moses; [...] "for myself, I can't help thinkin' he must be grateful for what you did, Miles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother <b>thinks</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> {{heard the}} whole story. It was brave and noble of you, it was indeed!" [...] And Vera's face showed her earnestness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grant did {{the coolest}} thing you ever saw. He sat on his horse {{at the top of}} the bluff while the boys fell over each other trying to get on the boat. Yes, sir, he sat there, disgusted, on his horse, smoking a cigar, with the Rebs raising pandemonium all around him. And then, sir," [...] cried the General, excitedly, [...] "what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Hanged if he didn't force his horse right on to his haunches, slide down the whole length of the bank and ride him across a teetering plank on to the steamer. And the Rebs just stood on the bank and stared. They were so {{astonished}} they didn't even shoot the man. You watch Grant," [...] said the General. [...] "And now, Stephen," [...] he added, [...] "just you run off and take hold of the prettiest girl you can find. If any of my boys object, say I sent you." ...|$|E
60|$|During {{several days}} he gave {{out that he}} had bought a mine in Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the {{property}} his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take $40,000--a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> He asked for greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts in Denver.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! What was that?" [...] Reddy's sharp ears {{had caught}} a sound {{up near the}} top of the hill. He stopped short and looked up. For just a little wee minute Reddy couldn't believe that his eyes saw right. Coming down the hill {{straight}} towards him was the strangest thing he ever had seen. He couldn't see any legs. He couldn't see any head. He couldn't see any tail. It was round like a ball, but it was the strangest looking ball that ever was. It was covered with old leaves. Reddy wouldn't have believed that it was alive but for the noises it was making. For just a wee minute he stared, and then, what do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did?</b> Why, he gave a frightened yelp, put his tail between his legs, and ran just as fast as he could make his legs go. Yes, Sir, that's just what Reddy Fox did.|$|E
6000|$|... "But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> look clever?" [...] There {{could be}} no {{question}} but that Tregear, when he disliked his company, could show his dislike by his countenance; {{and it was not}} improbable that <b>he</b> had <b>done</b> so in the presence of Mr. Adolphus Longstaff. [...] "Now tell the truth, Lady Mabel; <b>does</b> <b>he</b> not look conceited sometimes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose not. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I <b>did?</b> <b>He</b> dined here, you know, and, {{before going}} down-stairs, I {{told him that}} she was coming. I thought it only fair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{watch for}} the postman any more {{if it makes you}} have bad {{thoughts}} about him. Yes, they are bad thoughts. I won't have <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> doesn't <b>do</b> everything that is right." ...|$|R
