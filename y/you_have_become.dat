Later, a heavily {{intoxicated}} Genden publicly scolded Stalin at a Mongolian Embassy reception, shouting “You bloody Georgian, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a virtual Russian Czar”. Genden then allegedly snatched Stalin’s pipe and smashed it, while hinting that Mongolia was considering an alliance with Japan.|$|E
500|$|On {{the plus}} side, the C5's {{handling}} characteristics were praised by reviewers. The Guardian called it [...] "very easy to master once <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> {{familiar with the}} under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals." [...] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as [...] "surprisingly easy" [...] to master, although it cautioned that [...] "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels." [...] The Daily Express motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 [...] "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".|$|E
500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become.</b> The great thing about us is that we have made us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E

500|$|Peale {{departed}} from New York for Le Havre on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris {{late in the}} month. [...] At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn [...] "parting," [...] a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. [...] The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the [...] "humid process" [...] (titration), and to learn everything he could of coining technology {{and how it was}} powered by steam. Moore warned, [...] "a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as unaccomplished, until <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries." [...] Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the gas illumination of cities.|$|E

2500|$|In an August 2013 {{letter to}} Alexander signed by over 20 Tennessee tea-party groups, the groups called on Alexander {{to retire from}} the Senate in 2014, or face a primary challenge. The letter stated: [...] "During your tenure in the Senate we {{have no doubt that}} you voted in a way which you felt was appropriate. Unfortunately, our great nation can no longer afford {{compromise}} and bipartisanship, two traits for which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> famous. America faces serious challenges and needs policymakers who will defend conservative values, not work with those who are actively undermining those values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Letters {{can also}} be potent {{conveyors}} of homoerotic feelings; the letters between Virginia Woolf and Vita Sackville-West, two well-known members of the Bloomsbury Group, are full of homoerotic overtones characterized by this excerpt from Vita's letter to Virginia: [...] "I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia [...] It is incredible to me how essential <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> [...] I shan't make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this --But oh my dear, I can't be clever and stand-offish with you: I love you too much for that."

[...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old friend of yours but we've not been in contact for years. When I heard <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now.

2500|$|Rabbi Judah expounded {{the words}} of [...] "Attend and hear, O Israel: This day <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> a people unto the Lord your God." [...] Rabbi Judah asked whether it was on that day that the Torah was given to Israel; was that day not {{at the end of}} the 40 years of the {{wandering}} in the Wilderness? Rabbi Judah explained that the words [...] "this day" [...] served to teach that every day the Torah is as beloved to those who study it as on the day when God gave it at Mount Sinai. The Gemara explained that the word [...] "attend" [...] ( [...] , hasket) in [...] teaches that students should form groups (aso kitot) to study the Torah, as one can acquire knowledge of the Torah only in association with others, and this is in accord with what Rabbi Jose ben Hanina said when he interpreted {{the words of}} [...] "A sword is upon the boasters ( [...] , baddim) and they shall become fools," [...] to mean that a sword is upon the scholars who sit separately (bad bebad) to study the Torah. The Gemara offered another explanation of the word [...] "attend" [...] ( [...] , hasket) in [...] to mean, [...] "be silent" [...] (has) listening to the lesson, and then [...] "analyze" [...] (katet), as Rava taught that a person should always first learn Torah, and then scrutinize it.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the midst}} of the European sovereign-debt crisis, Radek Sikorski, Poland's Foreign Minister, stated in November 2011, [...] "I will {{probably}} be the first Polish foreign minister in history to say so, but here it is: I fear German power less than I am beginning to fear German inactivity. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>become</b> Europe's indispensable nation." [...] According to Jacob Heilbrunn, a senior editor at The National Interest, such a statement is unprecedented when taking into consideration Germany's history. [...] "This was an extraordinary statement from a top official of a nation that was ravaged by Germany during World War II. And it reflects a profound shift taking place throughout Germany and Europe about Berlin's position {{at the center of the}} Continent." [...] Heilbrunn believes that the adage, [...] "what was good for Germany was bad for the European Union" [...] has been supplanted by a new mentality—what is in the interest of Germany is also in the interest of its neighbors. The evolution in Germany's national identity stems from focusing less on its Nazi past and more on its Prussian history, which many Germans believe was betrayed—and not represented—by Nazism. The evolution is further precipitated by Germany's conspicuous position as Europe's strongest economy. Indeed, this German sphere of influence has been welcomed by the countries that border it, as demonstrated by Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski's effusive praise for his country's western neighbor. This shift in thinking is boosted by a newer generation of Germans who see World War II as a distant memory.|$|E
