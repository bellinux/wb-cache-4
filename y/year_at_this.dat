5|$|Mustelids {{have never}} colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was {{apparent}} that cats killed kakapo at a rate of 56% per <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.|$|E

5|$|Beckingham at {{the time}} he was {{mentioned}} in 1258 was working, probably as chief clerk, for Gilbert of Preston, the English crown's senior royal justice. This was an itinerant position, travelling in a circuit (or eyre); Gilbert's last eyre–and therefore also Beckingham's as his chief clerk–was that of 1268–72. In 1274, Beckingham himself was named an itinerant justice for Middlesex, although as yet this was not a permanent position and he was replaced by the next <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time he seems to have held the rank of king's serjeant. He received the commission of justice of assize in 1276. From 1273 to 1278, he was a senior clerk to the Court of Common Pleas, and was then made keeper of the writs and rolls of the court (custos rotulorum et brevium de banco) until 1285. In that year, Beckingham was appointed a Justice of the Common Pleas.|$|E
5|$|Edward I knighted Guy de Beauchamp at Easter 1296. Warwick's {{career of}} public service started with the Falkirk {{campaign}} in 1298.

He continued in the king's service in Scotland and elsewhere. In 1299 he was present at the king's wedding to Margaret of France at Canterbury, and in 1300 he took part in the Siege of Caerlaverock. The next year he was a signatory to a letter to the Pope, rejecting Rome's authority over the Scottish question, and also participated in negotiations with the French over the release of the Scottish King John Balliol. He was present at the Siege of Stirling in 1304, serving under Edward, the Prince of Wales.

25|$|On March 9, 1987, LaMarche's {{father was}} murdered, {{shot to death}} by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby, in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into {{depression}} and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career. After getting sober on Inauguration Day in 1989, LaMarche embarked again into the world of his first love, standup comedy, {{in the early part of}} 1990. However, just as he was regaining lost momentum, tragedy struck once more, as his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided he just could not do standup comedy anymore.|$|E

25|$|Crisp {{worked as}} an {{assistant}} to Griffith for several years and learned much during this time from Griffith, an early master of film story telling who was influential in advancing a number of early techniques, such as cross cutting in editing his films. This experience fostered a similar passion in Crisp to become a director in his own right. His first directing credit was Little Country Mouse, made in 1914. Many directors (and actors) would find themselves turning out a dozen or more films in a single <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. Over the next fifteen years, Crisp directed some 70 films in all, most notably The Navigator (1924) with Buster Keaton and Don Q, Son of Zorro (1925) with Douglas Fairbanks.|$|E
25|$|Snow was {{observed}} {{to fall from}} cirrus clouds. The clouds formed at a level in the atmosphere that was around −65°C, so the clouds {{would have to be}} composed of water-ice, rather than carbon dioxide-ice (dry ice) because, at the low pressure of the Martian atmosphere, the temperature for forming carbon dioxide ice is much lower—less than −120°C. As a result of the mission, it is now believed that water ice (snow) would have accumulated later in the <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> location. This represents a milestone in understanding Martian weather. Wind speeds ranged from 11 to 58km per hour. The usual average speed was 36km per hour. These speeds seem high, but the atmosphere of Mars is very thin—less than 1% of the Earth's—and so did not exert much force on the spacecraft. The highest temperature measured during the mission was −19.6°C, while the coldest was −97.7°C.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, {{workshops}} {{were completed}} at the airfields at Zagreb and Mostar, allowing for repairs and modifications {{to be carried}} out without transferring aircraft to the main factories and workshops closer to the capital. In May of that year, the first aircraft of entirely Yugoslav manufacture was completed at Kraljevo, and it was estimated that factory was capable of producing 100 Breguet 19 aircraft per <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, the factory had a French workforce and was under French management, but the contract was due to expire in 1932, after which the Yugoslav government would be at liberty to produce whichever aircraft it could obtain licences to build. The privately owned Ikarus plant at Zemun continued to produce seaplanes of its own design as well as Potez 25 aircraft under licence. The strength of the air force was estimated at 26 squadrons of about twelve aircraft each, indicating a total of approximately 312 aircraft, although there were almost no reserve aircraft.|$|E

25|$|By fall 1984, The Edge of Night {{aired on}} only 106 of ABC's 213 {{affiliate}} stations. A further two dozen affiliates planned {{to drop the}} series {{in the first quarter}} of 1985, with many station managers doing so because they wanted local programming to air in the 4 o'clock hour. Although ABC intended to continue The Edge of Night, even by offering to move it to a mid-morning timeslot, Procter & Gamble could no longer afford to continue producing the show due to the constant loss of revenue from frequent pre-emptions. Thus, on October 26, 1984, ABC and Procter and Gamble made a joint announcement that the final telecast of Edge of Night (whose title had been shortened to three words) would be on December 28 of that <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point, the show's ratings were less than half of what they had been at the beginning of the decade; it finished the 1984-1985 television season last in the daytime ratings race with a 2.6 rating in only four months of episodes.|$|E
25|$|The New South Wales School of Gunnery was {{established}} at Middle Head in 1885, while full volunteers were instituted again that <b>year.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> {{time it was}} decided to raise a volunteer corps of cavalry who although they were required to supply their own horses, were to also be partially paid, and had uniforms and weapons supplied. They were eventually formed as a light horse unit and were known as the New South Wales Lancers. Another unit to be raised at this time was the Upper Clarence Light Horse, which had initially been raised by its colonel, Sir Charles Chauvel, father of Harry Chauvel, with the intention of being sent to India if the Russians became involved in Afghanistan; the offer was later rejected, however, when the men were attested they swore to volunteer for overseas service. Previous mounted rifles were merged with the Lancers. A further four batteries of reserve artillery were raised in 1885, but disbanded in 1892. The permanent forces also added units of submarine miners and mounted infantry, which were also soon disbanded.|$|E
25|$|The 1870s and 1880s in Malawi were unsettled, {{and local}} chiefs sought to gain European {{protection}} from their enemies by granting settlers what they probably considered {{was only a}} right to cultivate vacant land. Soon after the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in 1891, these Europeans secured legal ownership of this land from the protectorate administration. The new owners also claimed all rights that the traditional leaders had or were thought to possess, asserting that thangata work was an obligation that the landlord could impose on tenants. In the early colonial period, thangata took on a new meaning of performing labour in lieu of rent. In {{the early years of}} the protectorate, the estates established in under-populated areas needed workers to establish plantations. Few Africans were resident on estate lands, and some of those who remained left when labour rents were introduced. New workers, who were often migrants from Mozambique, were encouraged to move onto estates and grow their own crops, but were required to pay rent and Hut tax, usually satisfied by two months’ labour a <b>year</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. Before 1905, relatively little land on the estates was planted, as the owners were experimenting with a variety of crops. However, from 1905, cotton was successfully grown in commercial quantities. Cotton has a 5 or 6 month growing season, throughout which it needed much labour for a successful result. Between 1910 and 1925, tobacco was also grown in plantations and, like cotton it required a great deal of labour to grow successfully. As tenancies were based on verbal contracts, tenants had little or no chance to dispute the owners’ interpretations of them. On several estates, the obligations of labour tenants were extended, sometimes to a total of four or five months a year for thangata and Hut tax, much of this in the growing season leaving tenants with little time to grow food. As the Crown lands near the estates were already crowded, and as most of estate tenants were migrants from Mozambique with no claim to communal land, they had little option but to stay. In this situation thangata came to mean forced labour.|$|E
