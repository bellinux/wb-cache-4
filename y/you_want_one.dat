500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed to Syco Music. Recording for their debut studio album, Up All Night, began in January 2011. In February 2011, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. [...] "Moments" [...] was written by Ed Sheeran and Si Hulbert, and produced by Hulbert. In an April 2012 interview with news.com.au, Sheeran said that he wrote the track [...] "years ago." [...] In 2011, Sheeran met One Direction's Harry Styles at his [...] "guitarist's friend's house". The group were putting their debut studio album together at the time. Sheeran had a CD with him of 40 songs {{that he was going}} to give to publishers. As the boy band did not have enough songs for their album, Sheeran told Styles, [...] "Here's a CD. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>one</b> of these songs, have it." [...] The song ended up on the deluxe edition of the album. Sheeran acknowledged that he was happy with the outcome, [...] "It was a song I was never going to use. To have it on a multi-platinum selling album is quite nice." [...] During the album's UK launch in late 2011, member Louis Tomlinson referred to the song as his favourite track on the album. Niall Horan also commented, [...] "getting to write and record with Sheeran on our album was an honour." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before {{and during}} America's {{involvement}} in World War II, references to {{or about the}} war {{and the members of the}} Axis Powers were commonplace on the show. Just after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Jim Jordan, out of character, soberly ended the Fibber McGee show by inviting the studio audience to sing [...] "America". During the show of December 9, the Mayor is seeking a globe in order to keep up with current events. Molly asks him, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>one</b> with Japan on it?" [...] The mayor says, [...] "Why, of course." [...] "Then you better get one quick," [...] Molly says, receiving thunderous applause from the studio audience.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2010 Ras Kass {{launched}} a Kickstarter campaign {{to fund the}} manufacture of 1,000 CDs and 500 records for his A.D.I.D.A.S. (All Day I Dream About Spittin) project and a viral marketing campaign called [...] "Save The Ras Kass", which included a series of satirical web episodes {{about the plight of}} the endangered emcee. In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating [...] "we started trying different angles at solving old problems. Kickstarter was the natural evolution of trying creative new business models. When we put out The Quarterly there were people that said, ‘well how come you didn’t create a CD for this?’ and I’m like ‘well if I have to spend that $5000 and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>one,</b> I appreciate it but there’s the small problem that I spent $5000.’" [...] His webisodes document the downfall of an emcee, as he explained, [...] "You just see this downward spiral; it’s just that fall from grace and I’m kind of making fun of that and using me as the vehicle for it." [...] Finally, Ras Kass exceeded the $3,800 needed for the record in less than five days, with the project being released as a limited edition double CD and LP on July 20, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know that}} too," [...] Strether smiled. To which {{he added with}} an {{irrelevance}} that was only superficial: [...] "I come from Woollett Massachusetts." [...] It made her for some reason--the irrelevance or whatever--laugh. Balzac had described many cities, but hadn't described Woollett Massachusetts. [...] "You say that," [...] she returned, [...] "as if <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>one</b> immediately to know the worst." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By golly," [...] Babbitt droned, [...] "wouldn't {{be so bad}} {{to go over to}} the Old Country {{and take}} a squint at all these ruins, and the place where Shakespeare was born.

'Explosive clocks,' said Herr Winckelkopf, 'are {{not very}} good things for foreign exportation, as, even if they succeed in passing the Custom House, the train service is so irregular, that they usually go off before they have reached their proper destination.

6000|$|While {{the bridge}} over the Youghiogeny was {{in the course of}} construction, the Indians assured Washington he {{would never be able to}} open a waggon-road across the {{mountains}} to Redstone Creek; he embarked therefore in a canoe with a lieutenant, three soldiers, and an Indian guide, to try whether it was possible to descend the river. They had not descended above ten miles before the Indian refused to go further. Washington soon ascertained the reason. [...] "Indians," [...] said he, [...] "expect presents--nothing can be done without them. The French take this method. If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>one</b> or more to conduct a party, to discover the country, to hunt, or for any particular purpose, they must be bought; their friendship is not so warm as to prompt them to these services gratis."
