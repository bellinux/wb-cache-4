5000|$|The anthem is {{particularly}} noteworthy {{for being the}} only one that has a second verse officially consisting of incoherent muttering. Count von Überwald had also observed that any group of people singing their country's national anthem never remembers how the second verse goes anyway, so he decided to make things easier for Ankh-Morpork. The anthem's sentiments are of course summarised in the new Pax Morporkia: [...] "If you fight, we'll call in <b>your</b> <b>mortgages.</b> And incidentally that's my pike you're pointing at me.

40|$|To {{encourage}} home ownership, the United States {{tax code}} treats the financing {{and sale of}} housing differently from most other goods. For example, the interest payments on <b>your</b> home <b>mortgage</b> and <b>your</b> property taxes are deduct-ible from your federal income taxes while the interest on your credit card bill for your vacation to Paris is not. Furthermore, the profit you make {{on the sale of}} your house may be exempt from capital gains taxation, but similar profits on your mutual funds are not. These special provisions in the tax code–the deductibility of mortgage in-terest and property taxes from federal income taxes and the special treatment of capital gains on the sale of owner-occupied housing–effec-tively lower the cost of owner-occupied housing relative to other goods. Lowering the after-tax cost of owner-occupied housing favors home ownership because it gives owning a financial advantage over renting for higher income house-*Dick Voith is an economic advisor in the Researc...|$|R

You are both, I am told, thoroughly efficient civil engineers; and I have no doubt the golf links will be a triumph of your art. Mr Broadbent will get into parliament most efficiently, which is more than St Patrick could do if he were alive now. You may even build the hotel efficiently if you can find enough efficient masons, carpenters, and plumbers, which I rather doubt. [Dropping his irony, and beginning to fall into the attitude of the priest rebuking sin] When the hotel becomes insolvent [Broadbent takes his cigar out of his mouth, a little taken aback], your English business habits will secure the thorough efficiency of the liquidation. You will reorganize the scheme efficiently; you will liquidate its second bankruptcy efficiently [Broadbent and Larry look quickly at one another; for this, unless the priest is an old financial hand, must be inspiration]; you will get rid of its original shareholders efficiently after efficiently ruining them; and you will finally profit very efficiently by getting that hotel for a few shillings in the pound. [More and more sternly] Besides those efficient operations, you will foreclose <b>your</b> <b>mortgages</b> most efficiently [his rebuking forefinger goes up in spite of himself]; you will drive Haffigan to America very efficiently; you will find a use for Barney Doran's foul mouth and bullying temper by employing him to slave-drive your laborers very efficiently; and [low and bitter] when at last this poor desolate countryside becomes a busy mint in which we shall all slave to make money for you, with our Polytechnic to teach us how to do it efficiently, and our library to fuddle the few imaginations your distilleries will spare, and our repaired Round Tower with admission sixpence, and refreshments and penny-in-the-slot mutoscopes to make it interesting, then no doubt your English and American shareholders will spend all the money we make for them very efficiently in shooting and hunting, in operations for cancer and appendicitis, in gluttony and gambling; and you will devote what they save to fresh land development schemes. For four wicked centuries the world has dreamed this foolish dream of efficiency; and the end is not yet. But the end will come.|$|R

Shortly after, Martin organized her first tea party rally in Atlanta. By June 2009, Martin had formed Tea Party Patriots, along with Amy Kremer and Mark Meckler. In 2010, Martin was being paid $6,000 a month by the organization.

Why, if I {{must speak}} out--then I'll confess To have stood by, {{and seen the}} Landgravine Do most strange deeds; and in her {{generation}} Show no more wit than other babes of light. First, she has given away, to starving rascals, The stores of grain she might have sold, good lack! For any price she asked; has pawned <b>your</b> jewels, And <b>mortgaged</b> sundry farms, and all for food. Has sunk vast sums in fever-hospitals, For rogues whom famine sickened--almshouses For sluts whose husbands died--schools for their brats. Most sad vagaries! but there's worse to come. The dulness of the Court has ruined trade: The jewellers and clothiers don't come near us; The sempstresses, my lord, and pastrycooks Have quite forgot their craft; she has turned all heads And made the ladies starve, and wear old clothes, And run about with her to nurse the sick, Instead of putting gold in circulation By balls, sham-fights, and dinners; 'tis most sad, sir, But she has swept your treasury out as clean-- As was the widow's cruse, who fed Elijah.|$|R

5000|$|This is, however, not {{the case}} with the Making Home Affordable Programs through the federal government. When using the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program, short sales and Deeds in Lieu may not impact your credit report as {{negatively}} as other programs or options. From the Making Home Affordable website: [...] "Unlike conventional short sales, a HAFA short sale completely releases you from <b>your</b> <b>mortgage</b> debt after selling the property. This means you will no longer be responsible for the amount that falls [...] "short" [...] of the amount you still owe. The deficiency is guaranteed to be waived by the servicer. In a HAFA short sale, <b>your</b> <b>mortgage</b> company works with you to determine an acceptable sale price. HAFA has a less negative effect on your credit score than foreclosure or conventional short sales." [...] Homeowners can utilize specialized negotiators to ensure their rights are protected.|$|E
