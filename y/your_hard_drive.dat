40|$|Abstract- Cloud {{data storage}} refers to storing data to an {{off-site}} storage system maintained {{by a third}} party. Instead of storing information to <b>your</b> computer's <b>hard</b> <b>drive</b> or other local storage device, you save it to a remote database. The internet provides the connection between your computer and the database. Cloud storage reduces hardware and software demands on the user’s side. Accessing and storing data on cloud storage has some security risks and thus makes the cloud information inconsistent and unreliable. This paper compares the traditional data storage and cloud data storage and provides few ways to protect the data stored in the cloud. To make data in the cloud a reliable one, some auditing mechanism should be used. This auditing can be performed by a third party system which lies between cloud users and cloud data storage. Third party auditor stores the log information of all files which are accessed from cloud storage and thus assures cloud storage correctness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In the {{simplest}} terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the Internet instead of <b>your</b> computer's <b>hard</b> <b>drive.</b> The cloud {{is just a}} metaphor for the Internet. Now a days Cloud computing as an emerging technology trend is expected to reshape the advances in information technology. In a cost-efficient cloud environment, a user can tolerate a certain degree of delay while retrieving information from the cloud to reduce costs. In this paper, i am address two fundamental issues in such an environment: privacy and efficiency. My first review a private keyword-based file retrieval scheme that was originally proposed by Ostrovsky. Their scheme allows a user to retrieve files of interest from an untrusted server without leaking any information. The main drawback is that it will cause a heavy querying overhead incurred on the cloud and thus goes against the original intention of cost efficiency. In this paper, present three efficient information retrieval for ranked query (EIRQ) schemes to reduce querying overhead incurred on the cloud. In EIRQ, queries are classified into multiple ranks, where a higher ranked query can retrieve a higher percentage of matched files. A user can retrieve files on demand by choosing queries of different ranks. This feature is useful when there are a large number of matched files, but the user only needs a small subset of them. Under different parameter settings, extensive evaluations have been conducted on both analytical models and on a real cloud environment, in order to examine the effectiveness of our schemes...|$|R
40|$|In the {{simplest}} way, cloud computing means classifying and getting data and programs over the Internet instead of <b>your</b> computer's <b>hard</b> disk <b>drive.</b> It is a dissemination of computing resources—everything from applications to data centers over the Internet on a reward-for-use basis. Cloud computing is mostly {{defined as a}} type of computing that focuses on sharing computing resources rather of having the local host or personal devices to manage applications. The major issues related to the cloud are resource discovery, fault tolerance, load balancing, and security. Load balancing is the primary consideration in the cloud-computing environment. Load reconciliation is a mean for propagating workloads across various computing resources. Its main motive is to optimize the usage of resources, boost turnout, deprecation reaction time, and avoiding the needless burden of any such resources. It becomes a severe problem with the ceaseless increase in the list of users and type of applications on clouds. This paper presents a quick review of cloud computing. The main highlight of this document is on the load balancing approach in cloud computing. Keywords...|$|R

40|$|During his {{residence}} at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), Professor Winfred Emory Allen (1873 - 1947) collected, identified, and enumerated marine phytoplankton species in weekly samples taken at single North American Pacific coastal locations from 1917 - 1939. His time-series of species {{spatial and temporal}} distribution stood as probably the best {{of its kind in}} the world. Fortunately after his death, much of his original data, was placed in a chest and eventually stored in the attic of a building at SIO. It was "discovered" in the 1970 s, and Sargun Tont was the first to compile a computer database of diatom and dinoflagellate species abundances having time series data for SIO and Port Hueneme (California) piers. Those tapes were lost through time, but the time series of species abundance has again been reconstructed into a new database. This later database included not only time series data of SIO and Port Hueneme diatom and dinoflagellate species abundances, but species abundance data from Oceanside, Pacific Grove, Farallon Islands, and Scotch Cap (Alaska) piers as well (Thomas et al., 2001). The purpose of this e-book is to disseminate the historical phytoplankton data set as reconstructed by Thomas et al. in a more practical manner, as well as to incorporate available meteorological, climatic and oceanographic time-series data that pertain to the location and period of the Allen phytoplankton data. The data sets themselves are constructed as Lotus 123 _ (wk 1) or comma separated values (csv), and being unformatted worksheets, these are easily imported into various spreadsheet programs. The csv files could also be modified by a text editor to “find and replace” commas with tabs (or any other separator) if needed. All data are easily located through a menu system that is run with an internet browser. Also, historical background has been incorporated to provide context with these data. Additionally, diatom illustrations by Easter Cupp (who worked with Allen several years) and some dinoflagellate illustrations commissioned by Charles Kofoid (Allen's professor) associated with the species described by Allen have been included. This e-book is distributed as a set of three compressed and archived computer file: Allen 1. zip; Allen 2. zip; Allen 3. zip. TO ACCESS THESE, DOWNLOAD THEM TO <b>YOUR</b> <b>HARD</b> <b>DRIVE</b> AND UNZIP THEM; THEN OPEN THEM. The three ZIP files archive separate components of this e-book, and were produced using WinZIP 8. 0. Allen 1. zip contains all essential html files and time-series data. If necessary, this could be used as the only file for extraction. However some of these files contain references (links) to files contained in Allen 2. zip and Allen 3. zip and therefore it is best to download all three files to extract. 120 MB of hard disk space is required for the complete e-book. Extraction of these zip files will require WinZIP or equivalent decompression software. Extraction of the files will create a directory (folder) on the hard disk named "AllenData" and place all files and subdirectories under this. The entire directory structure could be copied to CD or DVD for practical permanent storage. TO BEGIN THE E-BOOK, open "Start" or "Start. htm" (or drag this file into a web browser) in the directory (folder) and continue. Resize the windows to optimize the configuration of the monitor used.
