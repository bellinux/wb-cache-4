These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified <b>young</b> <b>mother,</b> her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

5|$|A Bengali folk-tale about Shashthi {{tells of}} the {{youngest}} of seven daughters-in-law in a prosperous household who was a glutton that used to secretly steal food and then blame a black cat, which was thrashed as punishment. The black cat {{happened to be the}} vahana (mount) of Shashthi and complained about the mistreatment to the goddess, who pledged to avenge it. When the youngest daughter-in-law gave birth to a son, the cat stole the child in the night and gave it to the goddess, and did the same for her next six sons. The neighbours accused the <b>young</b> <b>mother</b> of carelessness and began to believe she might be a witch who ate her own children. Finally, when a daughter was born, the <b>young</b> <b>mother</b> decided to remain awake the whole night to resolve the mystery. She managed to catch the cat in the act of robbery and wounded it with her bracelet, but the cat escaped with the child, leaving a trail of blood. The mother followed this trail to the abode of Shashthi. There she saw her sons playing around Shashthi as the goddess held the mother's infant daughter in her arms. Shashthi explained the reason for the mother's ordeal and told her to ask pardon of the cat. The mother asked the cat's pardon, which was granted, and then she promised the goddess that she would offer worship in a ritual dedicated to her, which would {{come to be known as}} the Jamai-Shasthi Vrata. The mother returned home with her children and spread the worship of the goddess, who blessed her family with children, wealth and happiness.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} parenting educational strategies to support <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> is a neglected research topic. How <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> are best supported to cope as parents is not discussed in depth in the literature. Currently service provision caters {{in the main}} for 'older' mothers and the focus and methods used are not necessarily culturally relevant to teenage mothers' lifestyles or needs. A review of the current literature indicates that adequate parenting education and support is necessary to help young parents to become good parents. This thesis presents the findings from an exploratory qualitative study which examines parenting in relation to <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> The Tameside and Glossop Positive Parenting Programme' (Taylor, 1997) was chosen because it was developed for and is currently {{being used in the}} same area as the sample in this study. The intention {{of this study was to}} analyse :parenting services and the needs of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and to explore how the two relate to each other. The focus of this exploratory study was on the perceptions of the professional and non-professional people who work with <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> The aims of the study were to: (1) achieve a critical appreciation of parenting in general and the needs of young mothers; (2) elicit the opinions and experiences of facilitators regarding a parenting programme (Tameside and Glossop Positive Parenting Programme) and the needs of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and the 'daily issues' <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> face; (3) elicit the perspectives of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> on their needs and the 'issues' they face in their daily lives; (4) develop a focused understanding of how useful the Tameside and Glossop Positive Parenting Programme is for <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and how it could be further developed to provide greater support. Semi structured interviews were conducted with new (n= 9) and experienced (n= 7) facilitators of parenting education programmes and also with <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> (n= 3). The interview data were analysed using a thematic network technique. Common themes emerged which provided valuable insight into parenting in relation to <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> The key themes for new and experienced facilitators were: (1) the significance of support networks; (2) <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> expectations of what being a mother involves; (3) similarities and differences between <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and older mothers; (4) parenting support can be adapted to suit young mothers; (5) the impact of parenting education on staff; and (6) positive aspects of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and parenting The key themes for the interviews with <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> were: (1) a sense of pride in their baby; (2) having a baby encouraged maturity in the mother; (3) fitting the baby into their existing life; (4) embarrassment and negative experiences since having the baby; (5) social support since having a baby; (6) planning for the future; (7) confidence in caring for children; and (8) young mums and making services more accessible. The results highlight how currently service provision does not fully meet the needs of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in relation to parenting because parenting services are designed to meet the needs of 'older' mothers. There were distinct differences between the views of facilitators (primarily these focused on negative views of <b>young</b> <b>mothers)</b> and the views of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> (which focused onmany positive aspects of young motherhood and <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> getting on with their lives). In conclusion it can be seen that no one method of parenting education will suit all <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> Individual assessment is a key concept when addressing individual needs particularly since the <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in the study do not see themselves as the same as older mother...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Young {{motherhood}} {{is acknowledged}} {{as a challenge}} in South Africa, as {{it is characterised by}} competing responsibilities in relation to care for children, and the desire to advance into employment and education (Graham, 2012). These competing aspects could place <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> at a high risk of experiencing depressive symptoms. <b>Young</b> <b>mothers</b> are fortunate that they can access the Child Support Grant (CSG) as a source of financial support for children living in poverty in South Africa. But what other factors play a role in young mothers’ mental well-being? In this article, a secondary analysis of the National Income Dynamics Study (South African Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU), 2008) is conducted, with the aim to investigate the associations between individual factors, household factors and depressive symptomology in <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> aged 18 - 24 years. The findings revealed that there is a distal relationship between the CSG and depressive symptomology in <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> This means that while the CSG is a source of support and <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> retain the CSG when they move away from home, the grant without family support is inadequate in protecting <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> against depressive symptoms. Interventions that are aimed at building parenting and financial abilities are, therefore, crucial in protecting <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> against depressive symptoms as they age...|$|R
40|$|When <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> {{formerly}} {{associated with}} armed groups, return to communities, they are typically social isolated, stigmatised, and marginalised. This creates reintegration challenges for themselves, and their communities. Their children face child protection {{problems such as}} neglect, rejection and abuse. In this paper, the authors describe an innovative field practice - community based, participatory action research (PAR) - that meaningfully involved formerly associated <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> and other vulnerable <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> in their communities. The project took place in 20 field sites in three countries: Liberia, northern Uganda and Sierra Leone. It was implemented through an academic, nongovernmental organisation (NGO) partnership. The participants were 658 <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> both formerly associated with armed groups and other mothers seen to be vulnerable. Within the context of caring psychosocial support, these <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> organised themselves into groups, declined their problems, and developed social actions to address and change their situations. Some project outcomes included: <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and their children experiencing improved social reintegration evidenced by greater family and community acceptance; more positive coping skills; and decreased participation in sex work for economic survival...|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the <b>young</b> <b>mother</b> a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Breastfeeding {{is widely}} {{recognised}} as {{the method of}} infant feeding that provides the greatest health benefits for mother and child (World Health Organisation, 2003). Despite the benefits of breastfeeding, among <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> (under 20) the prevalence of breastfeeding remains {{significantly lower than the}} national average. 57 % of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> who elect to breastfeed discontinue during the early postpartum period (6 - 8 weeks) and by six months only 11 % of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> are breastfeeding (Office National Statistics, 2012). In the UK, young motherhood is associated with social exclusion and domestic violence (Beers and Hollo, 2009; ONS, 2012). <b>Young</b> <b>mothers</b> are {{more likely to engage in}} negative health behaviours such as smoking and are less likely to access antenatal care (Department of Health, 2008). The combined consequences of these factors increase the risk of poor maternal and infant health, notably an infant mortality rate 60 % higher than among older mothers (DH, 2008). For these reasons, current healthcare policy has identified the promotion of breastfeeding among <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> as a key strategy in reducing health inequalities (DH, 2012). Within this study, individual interviews were conducted with eight <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in order to explore the lived experience of breastfeeding. Concurrent data collection and analysis were conducted following the principle of Classic Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967). The study findings highlight the diverse experiences of <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> who elect to breastfeed and the barriers to accessing support services. The process of constant comparative analysis led to the development of three core categories: barriers to breastfeeding, overcoming barriers and the transition from breastfeeding to formula feeding. These findings are explored in light of relevant literature and the implications for nursing and midwifery practice are discussed. Recommendations for future practice include: raising the public profile of breastfeeding, promoting antenatal education and improving postnatal support for <b>young</b> <b>mothers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Early {{motherhood}} {{is a much}} debated {{and highly}} contentious topic. This research aimed to explore young Pākehā women's experiences of motherhood using a feminist qualitative framework. Twelve women, six current <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> and six former <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> were interviewed via focus groups and individual interviews. The analysis revealed that Pākehā culture constructs <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> as problematic because they challenge the 'traditional' family dominant in Pākehā culture. By having children prior to, rather than after, workforce participation and achieving economic independence, <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> challenge the prescribed life trajectory for Pākehā women. The women in this study discussed both the positive aspects and the challenges they faced as <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> In contrast to common public perceptions and media representations of early motherhood as negative, motherhood positively transformed the women's lives. This was {{discussed in terms of}} ceasing destructive activities and gaining motivation to return to education. The <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in this study had flexible parenting styles, which allowed them freedom from Pākehā cultural pressure to 'do motherhood' in a particular way. As <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> the women had high energy levels and anticipated early future freedom from childcare duties to pursue their dreams. Challenges discussed by the women included incorporating unanticipated early motherhood into long-held life goals, feeling exhausted, having a lack of time for themselves and having too little support. Financial hardship, poverty, judgment and stigma surfaced as major challenges which affected all areas of the women's lives. However, the women also resisted this discrimination by using a range of strategies, which positions them as women with agency, challenging their representation within literature as passive victims. Young women will not use services where they perceive they will be judged for being who they are. As levels of support appear to determine how young women experience motherhood, services have a vital role to play in supporting <b>young</b> <b>mothers.</b> The findings of this study highlighted the complex and contradictory nature of the young mothers' stories, presenting a challenge to simple and stereotypical negative discourses of early motherhood...|$|R

Participants: A purposive sample of seven <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> took part in audio-recorded unstructured interviews in either the <b>young</b> <b>mother’s</b> home or in a private room at their GP practice. Findings: Six themes emerged from the initial thematic analysis: (1) feeling abandoned, (2) information is vital, (3) feeling judged, (4) family and friends, (5) interference, (6) <b>younger</b> <b>mothers</b> need additional support. After ‘bracketing’ the preconceptions evident in the initial analysis, essential themes describing the young mothers’ experience of accessing healthcare were identified: (1) the need for support and information; (2) fear of stigmatisation and stigmatisation of self. Conclusions: The <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> in this study experienced a need for support and information, which reflects the findings of previous studies. This study has added to the knowledge base as it also found that these <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> were hindered from obtaining or making use of available support and information through fear or expectation of stigmatisation and self-stigmatisation. There is a need to improve availability of support and information for <b>young</b> <b>mothers,</b> who may benefit from one-to-one education to help them gain confidence to deal with pregnancy and parenthood issues.

Conducted within a feminist social constructionist framework, the study adopted an exploratory qualitative structure. Data were collected through life histories that were analysed within a thematic narrative framework. The narratives revealed that the <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> found motherhood challenging and overly disruptive of school. Although contexts of childcare emerged as pivotal in how <b>young</b> <b>mothers</b> balanced motherhood and schoolwork, these were also presented as characterised by notions of power and control.
