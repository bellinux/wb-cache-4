40|$|The {{generation}} of adhesive regions on a z-cut lithium niobate crystal without an additional voltage supply is demonstrated. We {{show that the}} origin of the attractive force in the respective solvent is electrophoresis, which can selectively trap charged particles in illuminated regions. Using digital holographic microscopy to measure the space-charge field in a <b>y-cut</b> <b>crystal,</b> we demonstrate the difference between electrophoretic and dielectrophoretic particle manipulation. The suggested method enables the creation of arbitrary two-dimensional patterns, circumventing restrictions originating from the crystal asymmetry. Furthermore, it allows the discrimination between charged particles of different signs, thus acting as a charge sensor...|$|E
40|$|A {{femtosecond}} laser at 800 nm {{was used to}} create micro-fluidic circuits on lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) substrates by means of laser ablation, using different scanning velocities (100 - 500 μm/s) and laser pulse energies (1 - 20 μJ). The T-junction geometry was exploited to create on <b>y-cut</b> LiNbO 3 <b>crystals</b> a droplet generator, whose microfluidic performance was characterized {{in a wide range}} of droplet generation frequencies, from few Hz to about 1 kHz...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the design, fabrication, and characterization of temperature sensitive quartz resonators fabricated using heterogeneous integration methods for realizing high-density, thermal conductance fluctuation limited infrared imaging arrays operating at room temperature. High frequency (241  MHz) micromachined resonators from <b>Y-cut</b> quartz <b>crystal</b> cuts were fabricated with a temperature sensitivity of 22. 16 kHz/∘C. Infrared measurements on the resonator pixel {{resulted in a}} noise equivalent power (NEP) of 3. 90 nW/Hz 1 / 2, a detectivity D∗ of 9. 17 × 107  cm Hz 1 / 2 /W, and noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 46. 6  mK in the 8. 14  m wavelength range. The thermal frequency response of the resonator {{was determined to be}} faster than 33 Hz, demonstrating its applicability as a video-rate uncooled infrared sensor...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} study of the anisotropy of the magnetoelectric (ME) response in tri-layered composites based on single-crystalline piezoelectrics has been carried out. Quasi-static and resonant direct ME measurements were performed on Metglas/Piezoelectric/Metglas tri-layered structures featuring thin foils of the magnetostrictive Metglas alloy and differently oriented piezocrystals of LiNbO 3 (LNO) and GaPO 4 (GPO). The transversal ME effects {{were found to be}} strongly dependent on the direction of the applied in-plane magnetic bias fields as well as the orientation of the crystals. Multiple peaks of the ME response were observed corresponding to different contour resonance modes of the piezocrystals. The largest ME coefficient of up to 249 V/(cm. Oe) was observed for a composite with a 41 degrees <b>Y-cut</b> LNO <b>crystal</b> at 323. 1 kHz. In summary, we have shown that crystalline lead-free LNO and GPO can exhibit relatively large anisotropic ME effects in multilayers. The relations between the directional ME coupling and the material constants of the differently oriented piezocrystals were pinpointed. The precise control of this orientation should therefore allow one to engineer almost any desired quasi-static and resonant ME anisotropic properties for any specific application.

40|$|A {{new method}} {{based on the}} {{adaptation}} of the Pulse Transient Hot Strip technique to slab sample geometry has been developed for studying thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of anisotropic thin film materials (< 50 mu m) with thermal conductivity in the 0. 01 - 100 W/mK range, deposited on thin substrates (i. e., wafers). Strength of this technique is that it provides a well-controlled thermal probing depth, {{making it possible to}} probe a predetermined depth of the sample layer and thereby avoiding the influence from material(s) deeper down in the sample. To verify the technique a series of measurements were conducted on a <b>y-cut</b> single <b>crystal</b> quartz wafer. A Hot Strip sensor (32 -mu m wide, 3. 2 -mm long) was deposited along two orthogonal crystallographic (x- and z-) directions and two independent pulse transients were recorded. Thereafter, the data was fitted to our theoretical model, and the anisotropic thermal transport properties were determined. Using a thermal probing depth of only 30 mu m, we obtained a thermal conductivity along the perpendicular (parallel) direction to the z-, i. e., optic axis of 6. 48 (11. 4) W/mK, and a thermal diffusivity of 3. 62 (6. 52) mm(2) /s. This yields a volumetric specific heat of 1. 79 MJ/mK. These values agree well with tabulated data on bulk crystalline quartz supporting the accuracy of the technique, and the obtained standard deviation of less than 2. 7 % demonstrates the precision of this new measurement technique.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an experimental}} study of a novel type of interferometry based on the generation of Second Harmonic (SH) light. In this work interferometers are described in which an interference pattern arises when two SH waves are superimposed. These waves come from doubling the fundamental frequency of a laser by means of non-linear crystals. Three interferometers are described that have different applications according to their sensitivity to detect wavefront distortions. One interferometer has low sensitivity and is useful in the contouring of refractive objects that produce large wavefront distortions {{of the order of}} hundreds of visible wavelengths. The other two interferometers have high sensitivity {{and one of them is}} capable of detecting wavefront distortions as small as 1 / 20 of wavelength. Special emphasis is placed on development of the first interferometer which is a real-time, common-path, self-referencing interferometer that yields interferograms in the visible. The interferometer is based on the fact that a SH wavefront generated under PM conditions is a faithful replica of the laser wavefront. The two interfering SH wavefronts are produced one before and the other after the object under study, and by virtue of its chromatism, they are very slightly different. Consequently, very low density fringes are produced upon their superposition. In this application, noncritically phase matched crystals perform best, and we have found that <b>Y-cut</b> LiNbO₃ <b>crystals</b> configured for surface acousto-optic applications are very convenient. The conversion efficiencies are very low (of the order of 10 ⁻⁵) consequently optical damage to the LiNbO₃ due to the SH is no problem. The crystals are phase matched by controlling their temperature and are used with a repetitively pulsed Nd:Yag laser operating at 1. 06 μm. The chief limitations of this interferometer come from practical considerations in imaging objects with high spatial frequencies that reduce the contrast of the interferograms. The high sensitivity interferometers make use of the changes of phase and amplitude induced in the SH wavefront by the phase mismatch of angle tuned crystals to provide information. The interferometers are directly sensitive to small wavefront tilts and do not require additional reference wavefronts...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} shear-horizontal vibrations of crystal plates under lateral electric field excitation (LFE) without {{and with a}} fluid layer is presented. A crystal plate with separated electrodes under thickness electric field excitation (TFE) in contact with a fluid layer is also analyzed. We have started with analyzing the coupled face-shear (FS) and thickness-twist (TT) motions of piezoelectric plates with lateral electric fields, using the Mindlin's first-order theory of piezoelectric plates. Solutions for propagating waves, and for free and electrically-forced vibrations are obtained, leading to basic vibration characteristics for resonator applications including dispersion relations, frequency spectra, and motional capacitance. Numerical results are presented for AT-cut quartz plates. We have then studied the coupled face-shear (FS) and thickness-twist (TT) motions of a piezoelectric plate with mass layers on the central parts of the plate surfaces, driven by a lateral electric field. An analytical solution is obtained. Numerical results are presented for an AT-cut quartz plate, including the motional capacitance of the plate as a resonator and vibration modes trapped under the mass layers in the central portion of the plate. The relationship between {{the dimensions of the}} mass layers and the number of trapped modes is examined. We have studied the thickness-shear vibration of a rotated <b>Y-cut</b> quartz <b>crystal</b> plate whose one surface is in contact with a fluid layer. In this study, two configurations are considered. For the first configuration, we have analyzed the plate vibrations driven by a lateral electric field, using both the theory of piezoelectricity and the theory of Newtonian fluids. The solutions for both free and forced vibrations are obtained. Approximate expressions for the frequency shifts in the crystal plate due to the fluid are presented. The admittance of the structure is also calculated. The results illustrate the impacts of the thickness, the density and the viscosity of the fluid layer on the frequency shifts in the plate. In the second configuration, the fluid is under an electrode separated from the crystal plate and the driving electric field is in the plate thickness direction. This configuration qualitatively describes the effect of the liquid permittivity on the frequency shifts in a real LFE liquid sensor. Finally, I studied the propagation of shear-horizontal waves in a piezoelectric plate in contact with a fluid layer as an acoustic wave sensor for measuring fluid viscosity or density. Mindlin's first-order theory of piezoelectric plates and the theory of Newtonian fluids are used. Two kinds of fluid layers are considered. One is with finite thickness, and the other is semi-infinite. Approximate dispersion relations for long face-shear and thickness-twist waves are given analytically. In the first one, numerical results only show the effects of the fluid on wave characteristics. In the other, numerical results showing the effects of the fluid and the piezoelectric coupling in the plate on wave characteristics are presented...|$|R
