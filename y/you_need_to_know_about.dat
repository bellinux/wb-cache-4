Polow da Don talked about working with Aguilera in a Billboard interview, stating: [...] "There's two things <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Christina Aguilera: The first is that, as far as her singing goes, she's a professionally trained animal.

500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim, with critics highlighting Ellen Pompeo's performance, Washington's {{direction and}} McKee's writing. TV Line gave Pompeo's performance the most praise, called it [...] "visceral" [...] and wrote, [...] " [...] If a picture really says a thousand words, this review is superfluous: Any image 'we publish of Pompeo’s stricken face from this week’s Grey’s {{will tell you}} all <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> her [...] " [...] Praising McKee the site called [...] the episode a [...] "stunner". The site added, [...] "We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do. But we will still say that, if there’s any justice, Pompeo’s transcendent work ought to get the leading lady at very least the nomination for which she is so long overdue." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] {{has been}} {{recognized}} by critics as Minogue's most [...] "indie"-influenced song to date {{and one of her}} least successful singles to date. Author Lee Barron, who wrote the book Social Theory in Popular Culture, discussed the Impossible Princess period and further stated that [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] {{was one of the main}} aspects for her [...] "Indie Kylie" [...] label in the media. Craig Mathieson, who wrote the book Playlisted: Everything <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>about</b> Australian Music Right Now (2009), stated about the song [...] "It was a statement of intent, but not as planned. A sense of freedom, a belief in the lure of happiness, did not suit Kylie. She's best defined by constriction ad reduction, an her music has subsequently become a soundtrack to lack of choice." ...|$|E

500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys everything <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E

2500|$|With J. H. Helderman, he edited [...] "Grand Rounds in Transplantation" [...] in 1995. In October 1999, Frist co-authored Tennessee Senators, 1911–2001: Portraits of Leadership in a Century of Change with J.

While generally well received, the book later spurred accusations of hypocrisy regarding his remarks about Richard Clarke.

[...] In December 2003, Frist and co-author Shirley Wilson released the self-promoting book, Good People Beget Good People: A Genealogy of the Frist Family.|$|E
2500|$|NME {{noted that}} the album sees Minogue [...] "dropping her {{considerable}} concern for cool and bouncing back to her disco-pop roots", adding that [...] "Light Years is all <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> Kylie {{in less than an}} hour: fun, perfectly-formed, not too taxing and occasionally annoying." [...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the feeling that if those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better." [...] Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie viewed the album as [...] "inconsequential stuff and as with all Kylie's albums the quality is disappointingly uneven. But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit." [...] Select praised the album, stating that [...] "apart from the foul Lloyd-Webber-esque ballad 'Bittersweet Goodbye', it's an unrelenting hoot" [...] and that [...] "it's all contrived to within an inch of its life, heaving with potential singles and brazenly derivative. That is her job and she does it well." ...|$|E
