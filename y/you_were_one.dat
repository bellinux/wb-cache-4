500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an index card with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents were scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of Criss Angel: Mindfreak.|$|E
500|$|In particular, the console's {{status as}} an add-on and poor timing after the {{announcement}} of the Saturn has been identified by reviewers as being responsible factors for fracturing the audience for Sega's video game consoles in terms of both developers and consumers. [...] Allgame notes that [...] "very add-on whittled away at the number of potential buyers and discouraged third-party companies from making the games necessary to boost sales." [...] GamePro criticized the concept of the add-on, noting the expenses involved in purchasing the system. [...] According to reviewer Blake Snow, [...] "Just how many 16-bit attachments did one need? All in all, if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the unlucky souls who completely bought into Sega's add-on frenzy, you would have spent a whopping $650 for something that weighed about as much as a small dog." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Reparaz noted that [...] "developers—not wanting to waste time on a technological dead-end—abandoned the 32X in droves. Gamers quickly followed suit, turning what was once a promising idea into an embarrassing footnote in console history, as well as an object lesson in why console makers shouldn't split their user base with pricey add-ons." [...] Reparaz went on to criticize Sega's decision to release the 32X, noting that [...] "(u)ltimately, the 32X was the product of boneheaded short-sightedness: its existence put Sega into competition with itself once the Saturn rolled out." [...] Writing for IGN, Buchanan also notes that [...] "Notice that we haven't seen many add-ons like the 32X since 1994? I think the 32X killed the idea of an add-on like this—a power booster—permanently. And that's a good thing. Because add-ons, if not implemented properly, just splinter an audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 2006, Gullit had a {{talk show}} on Dutch TV, where he has interviewed, amongst others, Nelson Mandela. When Gullit was named winner of the Ballon d'Or in 1987, he {{dedicated}} the award to the then imprisoned Nelson Mandela. At the time, Gullit was signed to Milan and the Italians raised their eyebrows: [...] "Nelson who?" [...] Gullit tried to explain and they said, [...] "Oh, a footballer with political beliefs." [...] Gullit has since in interviews said that he met Mandela after he was released and that Mandela had said to him, [...] "Ruud, I have lots of friends now. When I was on the inside, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the few." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 24-year-old Patrick Flynn {{was tried}} at Belfast Crown Court for double {{manslaughter}} {{and possession of}} explosives after his recovery from his injuries. Flynn was severely disfigured and badly scarred from the extensive burns the incendiary device had inflicted upon him. The judge was asked and agreed to take this into account for sentencing after reviewing the evidence and finding Flynn guilty due to his proximity to the explosion, his known IRA affiliation and the discovery of telephone numbers for The Samaritans and Belfast Central station in his jacket, {{to be used to}} telephone bomb warnings. Mr Justice Kelly sentenced Flynn to ten years prison for each manslaughter as well as seven years for the explosives offences, to be served concurrently. He concluded by summing up with the words:"I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of the bombers. I am satisfied you and your associates did not intend to kill. Nevertheless, the explosion and fire caused the death of three people in most horrific circumstances. In sentencing you I am conscious you have suffered severe burns and scars, {{for the rest of your}} life which will be a grim reminder to you of the events of that day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furtwängler's {{name was}} {{included}} on the Gottbegnadeten list ("God-gifted List") of September 1944, but was removed on December 7, 1944 because of his relationships with German resistance. Furtwängler had strong links to the German resistance which organized the 20 July plot. He stated during his denazification trial that he knew an attack was being organized against Hitler, {{although he did not}} participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well and his doctor, Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to bypass official requirements, {{was a member of the}} Kreisau Circle. Furtwängler's concerts were sometimes chosen by the members of the German resistance as a meeting point. Rudolf Pechel, a member of the resistance group which organized the 20 July plot said to Furtwängler after the war: [...] "In the circle of our resistance movement it was an accepted fact that you were the only one in the whole of our musical world who really resisted, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>one</b> of us." [...] Graf Kaunitz, also a member of that circle, stated: [...] "In Furtwängler's concerts we were one big family of the resistance." ...|$|E
