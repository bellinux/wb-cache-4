5000|$|During the group's 1983 Shea Stadium concert, Sting felt {{performing}} at the venue was [...] "Everest" [...] {{and decided to}} pursue a solo career, according to the documentary The Last Play at Shea. After the Synchronicity tour ended in March 1984, the band went on hiatus while Sting recorded and toured {{in support of his}} successful solo debut LP, the jazz-influenced The Dream of the Blue Turtles, released in June 1985; Copeland recorded and filmed The Rhythmatist (1985); and Summers recorded another album with Robert Fripp (Bewitched, 1984) and the theme song for the film 2010—which was not used in the film, but included on the soundtrack album. At the 1985 Brit Awards held at London's Grosvenor Hotel on 11 February, the band received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In July the same year, Sting and Copeland participated in Live Aid at Wembley Stadium. [...] "Even though logic would say, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> You're in the biggest band in the world—-just bite the bullet and make some money.' But there continued to be some instinct, against logic, against good advice, thattold me I should quit." [...] —Sting on quitting the band in 1986.|$|E
5000|$|In January 1977, Sting {{moved from}} Newcastle to London and joined Stewart Copeland and Henry Padovani (soon {{replaced}} by Andy Summers) to form The Police. From 1978 to 1983 they had five UK chart-topping albums, won six Grammy Awards, and two Brit Awards; for Best British Group, and for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their initial sound was punk-inspired, but they switched to reggae rock and minimalist pop. Their final album, Synchronicity, {{was nominated for}} five Grammy Awards including Album of the Year. It included their most successful song, [...] "Every Breath You Take", written by Sting, in 1983. [...] "Even though logic would say, 'Are <b>you</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>mind?</b> You're in the biggest band in the world - just bite the bullet and make some money.' But there continued to be some instinct, against logic, against good advice, thattold me I should quit." [...] —Sting on quitting the band in 1986. According to Sting, who appeared in the documentary Last Play at Shea, he decided to leave The Police while onstage during a concert of 18 August 1983 at Shea Stadium because he felt that playing that venue was [...] "Mount Everest". [...] While never formally breaking up, after Synchronicity the group agreed to concentrate on solo projects. As the years went by, the band members, particularly Sting, dismissed the possibility of reforming. In 2007, however, the band reformed and undertook a world tour.|$|E
