He {{concluded}} that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that [...] "the death of the hero [...] was shocking enough", but that no one expected [...] "Deadalive" [...] to blatantly open with a funeral. He elaborated, [...] "But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it." [...] The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, [...] "It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that." [...] Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under [...] "huge financial pressure", real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post-production. Spotnitz later called the sequence [...] "a fun scene to write and stage" [...] and [...] "a great tease".|$|E

[...] "Sometimes you're {{going to have}} to make a hard decision to keep a subtle rotation going through so you don't have mass retirements...But you've also got to pick the best cricket team <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can</b> to represent your country", he stated. [...] "If we keep producing cricketers who are 25 plus, they're mature, they're ready to play, they've still got a seven or eight-year career, then we're doing OK." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mind you now," [...] said Ham, [...] "I {{want you}} to make it just as disagreeable for that crowd as <b>you</b> <b>possibly</b> <b>can.</b> You can soak their {{firewood}} with water, hide their guns and provisions, and fix it so the snow will break in their roof--and things like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I beg you won't talk in that {{depressing}} manner, boys.
