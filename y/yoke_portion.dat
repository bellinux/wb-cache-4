They can be firmly located by the <b>yoke</b> <b>portion</b> under the rider or pillion or may simply be loose. Increasingly, the bag portion is {{attached}} to the yoke with zips, making their use as luggage more convenient.|$|E

F) is calculated from 2 dimensional magnetic field distributions, {{it can be}} largely different from actual value due to additional voltage originated from end coils. In order to calculate the excitation voltage more accurately, 3 dimensional magnetic field calculation is necessary for including the end coil effect from large air-gap structure. The excitation voltage can be calculated by stator (armature) coil linkage flux originated from rotor (field) coil excitation, {{but it is difficult}} to calculate the flux linkage exactly because of complicated structure of the stator coil. This paper shows a method to calculate the excitation voltage from 3 dimensional magnetic energy that can be calculated directly from volume integration of magnetic flux density and field intensity scalar product through FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis software. 1...|$|E

For example, when the University of Pennsylvania adopted its academic dress statute in April 1887 it abolished hoods. Instead, it assigned eight faculty colors that were shown on the gownsâ€™ <b>yokes</b> (the <b>portion</b> over the shoulders).|$|R
