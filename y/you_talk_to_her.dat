2500|$|One such theory {{concerns}} Alf Boxall, who {{was reportedly}} involved in intelligence work during {{and immediately after}} World War II. In a 1978 television interview Stuart Littlemore asks: [...] "Mr Boxall, you had been working, hadn't you, in an intelligence unit, before you met this young woman [...] Did <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about that at all?" [...] In reply, Boxall says [...] "no," [...] and when asked if Harkness could have known, Boxall replies [...] "not unless somebody else told her." [...] When Littlemore suggests in the interview {{that there may have}} been an espionage connection to the dead man in Adelaide, Boxall replies: [...] "It's quite a melodramatic thesis, isn't it?" [...] Boxall's army service record suggests that he served initially in the 4th Water Transport Company, before being seconded to the North Australia Observer Unit (NAOU) – a special operations unit – and that during his time with NAOU, Boxall rose rapidly in rank, being promoted from Lance Corporal to Lieutenant within three months.|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. [Trying to {{restrain}} a smile.] Peachey, <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [Without waiting for MISS BEECH, however, he proceeds.] What'll your aunt {{say to me}} if I don't get you down? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I {{was only}} {{speaking}} as {{she might have}} spoken had <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> of me," [...] added Christie hurriedly, slightly backing her horse away from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I guessed as {{much when}} I saw <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She {{is a true}} English lady, heaven bless her! I took the liberty of looking at her painting; and {{she stared at me}} as if I had bitten her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s no good <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> her," [...] {{said the}} mother, {{with a look}} of fat {{resignation}} on her face, [...] "we can only let her go her own way; if <b>you</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> twenty-four hours right off it wouldn’t do her any good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't bother about Mary now. Mrs. Huntingdon {{is dying}} to have <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Please do {{and if you}} like--I will give you one of my roses for your button-hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she will, Martha, if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> rightly." [...] The servant didn't reply for awhile, but {{stood looking}} out of the window. [...] "You {{might as well go}} about the lamb at once, Martha." ...|$|E
60|$|GAYNOR (puts on his hat). And do {{your best}} to cheer the patient up when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Give her {{confidence}} in her ability to get well. That's half the battle. And she'll believe it, coming from you.|$|E
50|$|However around Chapter 16 to 18 if <b>you</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{in all of}} her {{events and}} remove her silent she'll not became crazy and still alive.|$|R
6000|$|The skipper {{laid his}} finger on his nose, and winked at the mainmast. [...] "There’s few can show me the way, Jack," [...] he {{answered}} softly; [...] "very few. Now I want {{you to help me}} too; I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> a great deal." ...|$|R
60|$|TIMOTHY. I minded that <b>you</b> were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{yesterday}} in the lab'rat'ry, before the telegram came about Mr. George.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. But she's {{different}} with you. It's not that you're a Gentile, though, {{for all the}} women are crazy about you. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> You have power over her, Shefford. I feel that. She's only a kid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' {{returned}} Jonas; 'if anything can. Now, supposing I did it here, I {{should do}} it cheap, I know, and easy, without bothering her about it; which I'd much rather not do, for it's just in a woman's way to take it into her head, if <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about such things, that she's going to die directly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had known," [...] she said, [...] "your {{habits of}} ingenuousness and candor, I {{should have made}} you dictate to Sylvia through a speaking-tube. You have known me less than a day. You have known her for a month. Can it be {{possible}} that <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as freely as you talk to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then never mention <b>her</b> name <b>to</b> me again. And as <b>to</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> may <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> till you're both {{blue in the}} face, if you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah that's another matter--about which <b>you</b> must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>HER.</b> She {{wants me}} {{no longer to}} keep seeing only with her eyes. She's {{throwing}} me into the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It isn't {{patience}} I want, God knows; it's lungs {{to speak}} loud enough. But you'll {{be at home}} yourself, I suppose, this morning; and <b>you</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And you did--by thunder! Though {{it might}} have been better {{business}} for the shop if I'd found her a crumbling ruin here, than lathed and plastered in this fashion, over there! However," [...] he added, with a laugh, seeing an angry light in his junior partner's eye, [...] "SHE don't seem to mind it--the cursing all comes from THEM. SHE rather likes your style and praises it--that's what gets me! Did <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> much," [...] he added, looking critically at his partner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I did," [...] he said. [...] "You see I'm not {{a fashionable}} young spark like you. Why the devil don't {{you go and}} call on her? It's only a civil thing to do. You are {{supposed}} to be one of her uncle's greatest friends, and he's supposed to be dangerously ill. Go and call on her this afternoon. Put on your best clothes and your Paris manners. You {{ought to be able to}} get something out of a child from the backwoods. If <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> cleverly you can at least find out whether Phineas is playing the game or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Katharine Hilbery," [...] he repeated, with {{a curious}} little chuckle. [...] "No, Denham, I have {{no illusions about}} that young woman. I think I made that plain to her to-night. But don't run away with a false impression," [...] he {{continued}} eagerly, turning and linking his arm through Denham's, as though {{to prevent him from}} escaping; and, thus compelled, Denham passed the monitory lamp-post, to which, in passing, he breathed an excuse, for how could he break away when Rodney's arm was actually linked in his? [...] "You must not think that I have any bitterness against her--far from it. It's not altogether her fault, poor girl. She lives, you know, one of those odious, self-centered lives--at least, I think them odious for a woman--feeding her wits upon everything, having control of everything, getting far too much her own way at home--spoilt, in a sense, feeling that every one is at her feet, and so not realizing how she hurts--that is, how rudely she behaves to people who haven't all her advantages. Still, to do her justice, she's no fool," [...] he added, as if to warn Denham not to take any liberties. [...] "She has taste. She has sense. She can understand you when <b>you</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> But she's a woman, and there's an end of it," [...] he added, with another little chuckle, and dropped Denham's arm.|$|E
6000|$|... 'DEAR CHARLES,--Living here so {{long and}} intimately with Helena, I have [...] {{naturally}} learnt her history, especially that of it which refers to [...] you. I am sure she would accept you as a husband at the proper time, [...] and I think you ought <b>to</b> give <b>her</b> the opportunity. You inquire in an [...] old note if I am sorry that I showed temper (which it wasn't) that [...] night when I heard <b>you</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> No, Charles, I am not sorry at [...] all for what I said then.--Yours sincerely, SALLY HALL.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ada {{must not}} be frightened and {{agitated}} to-night,' said Mr. Mohun, 'but I hope <b>you</b> will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to-morrow, Eleanor. Well, Claude, have you made Phyllis understand that she is acquitted?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{appreciate}} {{the pleasure of}} variety! Besides, she really interests me, she is so full of vigorous crudities. I believe all that is unpleasing in her arises from her being considered as the clever woman of the family; having no man nearly connected enough <b>to</b> keep <b>her</b> in check, and living in society that does not fairly meet <b>her.</b> I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and take her in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stein, {{tall and}} stooping, stood {{alone in the}} middle of the room between the rows of {{butterfly}} cases. [...] "Ach! is it you, my friend?" [...] he said sadly, peering through his glasses. A drab sack-coat of alpaca hung, unbuttoned, down to his knees. He had a Panama hat on his head, and there were deep furrows on his pale cheeks. [...] "What's the matter now?" [...] I asked nervously. [...] "There's Tamb' Itam there. [...] ." [...] "Come and see the girl. Come and see the girl. She is here," [...] he said, with a half-hearted show of activity. I tried to detain him, but with gentle obstinacy he would take no notice of my eager questions. [...] "She is here, she is here," [...] he repeated, in great perturbation. [...] "They came here two days ago. An old man like me, a stranger--sehen Sie--cannot do much. [...] . Come this way. [...] . Young hearts are unforgiving. [...] ." [...] I could see he was in utmost distress. [...] "The strength of life in them, the cruel strength of life. [...] ." [...] He mumbled, leading me round the house; I followed him, lost in dismal and angry conjectures. At the door of the drawing-room he barred my way. [...] "He loved her very much," [...] he said interrogatively, and I only nodded, feeling so bitterly disappointed that I would not trust myself to speak. [...] "Very frightful," [...] he murmured. [...] "She can't understand me. I am only a strange old man. Perhaps you [...] . she knows <b>you.</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> We can't leave it like this. Tell her to forgive him. It was very frightful." [...] "No doubt," [...] I said, exasperated at being in the dark; [...] "but have you forgiven him?" [...] He looked at me queerly. [...] "You shall hear," [...] he said, and opening the door, absolutely pushed me in.|$|E
6000|$|There {{were other}} plans, of course. There was a faction against the chapel faction, which favoured the plan sketched out above. The theatre faction, {{including}} Mr. May {{and some of}} the more florid tradesmen, favoured the risking of everything in the Endeavour. Alvina was to be the proprietress of the Endeavour, she was to run it on some sort of successful lines, and abandon all other enterprise. Minor plans included the election of Alvina to the post of parish nurse, at six pounds a month: a small private school; a small haberdashery shop; and a position in the office of her cousin's Knarborough business. To one and all Alvina answered with a tantalizing: [...] "I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know. I can't say yet. I shall see. I shall see." [...] Till one and all became angry with her. They were all so benevolent, and all so sure that they were proposing the very best thing she could do. And they were all nettled, even indignant that she did not jump at their proposals. She listened to them all. She even invited their advice. Continually she said: [...] "Well, {{what do you think of}} it?" [...] And she repeated the chapel plan to the theatre group, the theatre plan to the chapel party, the nursing to the pianoforte proposers, the haberdashery shop to the private school advocates. [...] "Tell me what you think," [...] she said repeatedly. And they all told her they thought their plan was best. And bit by bit she told every advocate the proposal of every other advocate [...] "Well, Lawyer Beeby thinks--" [...] and [...] "Well now, Mr. Clay, the minister, advises--" [...] and so on and so on, till it was all buzzing through thirty benevolent and officious heads. And thirty benevolently-officious wills were striving to plant each one its own particular scheme of benevolence. And Alvina, naïve and pathetic, egged them all on in their strife, without even knowing what she was doing. One thing only was certain. Some obstinate will in her own self absolutely refused to have her mind made up. She would not have her mind made up for her, and she would not make it up for herself. And so everybody began to say [...] "I'm getting tired of her. <b>You</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and you get no forrarder. She slips off to something else. I'm not going to bother with her any more." [...] In truth, Woodhouse was in a fever, for three weeks or more, arranging Alvina's unarrangeable future for her. Offers of charity were innumerable--for three weeks.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Emma,' said Theodora, 'we {{need not}} go on as {{if we did not}} {{understand}} each other. Violet can attend to you now; I wish <b>you</b> would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> No one can comfort as she can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{but while}} <b>you</b> were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> I saw <b>you</b> put five spoonfuls of sugar in her coffee for her," [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "Maybe you didn't {{think she was}} sweet enough for you, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>you</b> might <b>talk</b> with her, Miss Trotter," [...] he said, now {{completely}} subdued. [...] "Even if {{you could}} not reason her out of it, you might find out what she expects from this marriage. If <b>you</b> would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as sensibly as you have to me"-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "In my study, I suppose. I fear {{there is}} no chance of Flora's {{changing}} her mind first.

6000|$|... "You {{might have}} left the room, when you found her here. <b>You</b> have been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> If <b>you</b> have said {{anything}} about Regina--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fancy {{that she}} said she never meant to marry, but that's all nonsense; she is the very girl that ought, and I hope <b>you</b> will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and bring <b>her</b> <b>to</b> reason.

6000|$|... "It {{may be as}} you say, Princess," [...] he said. [...] "I {{must leave}} <b>her</b> <b>to</b> you for a little time. <b>You</b> must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She is quite pretty," [...] he added with an {{involuntary}} note of condescension in his tone.
