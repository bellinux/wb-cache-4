500|$|There {{are over}} [...] of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are {{encouraged}} to wear proper footgear and {{to be prepared for}} icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, [...] "If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> hiking here means climbing". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands.|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, Anonymous {{announced}} a major, sustained operation against ISIS following the November 2015 Paris attacks, declaring, [...] "Anonymous {{from all over}} the world will hunt you down. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we will find you and we will not let you go." [...] ISIS responded on Telegram by calling them [...] "idiots", and asking [...] "What they [...] hack?" [...] By the next day, however, Anonymous claimed to have taken down 3,824 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts, and by the third, more than 5,000, and to have doxxed recruiters. A week later, Anonymous increased their claim to 20,000 accounts and released a list of the accounts. The list included the Twitter accounts of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, The New York Times and BBC News. The BBC reported that most of the accounts on the list appeared to be still active. A spokesman for Twitter told The Daily Dot that the company is not using the lists of accounts being reported by Anonymous, as they have been found to be “wildly inaccurate” and include accounts used by academics and journalists.|$|E

2500|$|The {{film was}} re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was [...] "a film of sensitivity, {{observation}} and humor – a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less {{taken by the}} maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works". Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well... If you still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre-Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this picture plays as strongly now {{as it did in}} 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I know I had a ball watching I Vitelloni again. It reminded me of the old gang." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Nazis on the {{one hand}} would jam {{transmissions}} from the Allies' stations, {{but on the other hand}} would also copy them. The band Charlie and His Orchestra is considered as a negative example, also called Mr. Goebbels Jazz Band. Several of Germany’s most talented swing musicians, such as saxophonist Lutz Templin and vocalist Karl “Charlie” Schwedler, were active in a Jazz band. Here the Nazis replaced the original texts with their own provocative propaganda texts that were pro-Nazi and anti-American/British. For example, the lyrics for “Little Sir Echo” has anti-American/British appeal with lyrics such as “German U-boats are making you sore, You’re always licked, not a victory came through…You’re nice, little fellow, but by now <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you can never win this war!” [...] Goebbels’ propaganda was broadcast over pirated short-wave frequencies into America, Britain, and Canada in order to spread fear and weaken the morale of Germany’s enemies (WFMU Staff).|$|E

2500|$|Lacking support {{within their}} {{community}} and from the Austrian government, the remaining Russophiles turned to outsiders for support and became more radical in their politics. [...] They founded the Russian National Party, called for complete identification with Russia and promoted {{the conversion of the}} western Ukrainian people to Orthodoxy. [...] The Russophiles now largely depended on financing from the Russian government and Russian private sponsors (the Galician-Russian Benevolent Society was established in Saint Petersburg in 1908) and from ultraconservative Galician Polish aristocrats. The Polish ultraconservatives had become alarmed by the social mobilization of the Ukrainian peasants and sought to use the Russophile movement as a way of dividing the Ukrainian community. They were also united with the Russophiles in opposition to a proposed alliance between Ukrainophiles and politically moderate Poles. Polish support provided the Russophiles with some advantages during elections, some advantages for Russophile priests in obtaining parishes, and tolerance towards Russophile political activities. [...] The Russophiles also attempted, with some limited success, to exploit the differences between Ukrainian petty gentry and peasants. [...] The gentry were somewhat more likely to support Russophilia than were peasants. [...] A noble candidate in the elections of 1911, Ivan Kulchytsky, declared [...] "now we have recovered our sight and shall not allow the bastards to trick us with Ukraine…. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> from now on we do not give a damn for Ukraine and have returned to the historical road. From now on we are Russians." ...|$|E
