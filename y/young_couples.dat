He plots to dye Lad's coat red to embarrass the Master for the earlier incident, but accidentally dyes Lochaber King's coat instead, after the two dogs change locations. He is left having to answer for the dog's ruined coat while Lad wins the silver trophy.|$|E
5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E

25|$|One {{thing that}} {{is clear from the}} {{statistics}} is Rathfarnham is aging, with <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> that moved into the area in the 1960s entering retirement. There is a lack of suitable and affordable homes for young people in Rathfarnham and consequently they are flocking out to neighbouring suburbs such as Templeogue, Tallaght and Firhouse.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2002, Ayat al-Akhras {{was driven}} to the Kiryat HaYovel {{supermarket}} in Jerusalem by the recently recruited Tanzim member Ibrahim Sarahne, who had once worked in the supermarket.

25|$|The tribe went on buffalo hunts {{in summer}} and winter. Upon their return, the {{inhabitants}} of a lodge would often move into another lodge, although they generally remained within the village. Men's lives were more transient than those of women. They had obligations {{of support for the}} wife (and family they married into), but could always go back to their mother and sisters for a night or two of attention. When <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> married, they lived with the woman's family in a matrilocal pattern.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 letter, Purcell {{expressed}} his gratitude to Edna Cutts for opening {{her home to}} students and voiced the desire to have a share in any attempts to restore the house or make it public. Purcell also sketched out a scheme for expanding the space {{around the house and}} setting up a trust fund for the building. He imagined reproducing the Purcell and Elmslie dining suite designed for Mrs. William H. Hanna of Chicago. The suite is now {{in the collection of the}} Minneapolis Institute of Art, renting the space to <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> at low rates, and allowing regular public entry.|$|E
25|$|In {{the midst}} of the {{powerful}} and urban changes, cultural change took root as well. Quebec was greatly affected by the baby boom; between 1960 and 1970, more than 1.2 million Quebeckers reached the age of 14. As more young Québécois rejected Catholic teachings, they made life choices that were a complete change from tradition in the province. Cohabitation rates among <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> rose, as the institution of marriage gradually lost its obligatory status. Births outside of marriage began to rise, from 3.7 percent in 1961 to 10 percent in 1976, then 22 percent by 1984. As of 2015, 62.9% of births were outside of marriage.|$|E

25|$|In November 1990, Hiroki {{directed}} a romance about modern <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> in Japan, A Love Affair With Sawako for the Shochiku company. This {{was followed by}} the erotic horror V-cinema production Sadistic City which took the Japanese Film Section Grand Prize for a video at the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival. Hiroki's breakthrough into mainstream film, however, came with his 1994 feature 800 Two Lap Runners which looked at teenage heterosexual and homosexual relationships against a track and field background. The film opened at the Berlin International Film Festival in February 1994 before being released in Japan in July 1994. It placed number 7 on the Kinema Junpo's list of the ten best Japanese movies of 1994.|$|E
25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim. It features a group of rootless and bored <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> who {{spend much of their}} time in idle chatter, empty boasting, drinking, playing cards, intriguing or simply sitting around. The arrival of Jorgos, a guest worker from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity {{on the part of the}} women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. Katzelmacher was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} music culture in Taiwan is highly developed and features {{artists such as}} violinist Cho-Liang Lin, pianist Ching-Yun Hu, and the Lincoln Center Chamber Music Society Artist Director Wu Han. Karaoke, drawn from contemporary Japanese culture, is extremely popular in Taiwan, where it is known as KTV. KTV businesses operate in a hotel-like style, renting out small rooms and ballrooms varying {{on the number of}} guests in a group. Many KTV establishments partner with restaurants and buffets to form all-encompassing elaborate evening affairs for families, friends, or businessmen. Tour buses that travel around Taiwan have several TV's, equipped not for watching movies, but primarily for singing Karaoke. The entertainment counterpart of a KTV is an MTV, being found much less frequently out of the city. There, movies out on DVD can be selected and played in a private theatre room. However, MTV, more so than KTV, has a growing reputation for being a place that <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> will go to be alone and intimate.|$|E

25|$|The {{population}} of Nantes is {{younger than the}} national average, with 44.7 percent under age 29 (France 36.5 percent). People over age 60 account for 18.7 percent of the city's population (France 24 percent). Single-person households are 51.9 percent of the total, and 16.8 percent of households are families with children. <b>Young</b> <b>couples</b> with children tend to move outside the city because of high property prices, and most newcomers are students (37 percent) and adults moving for professional reasons (49 percent). Students generally come from within the region, and working people are often from Paris. In 2013, the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent of the active population (France 10 percent, Loire-Atlantique 8.5 percent). The poorest council estates had unemployment rates of 22 to 47 percent. Of those employed, 57.8 percent are in intermediate or management positions, 24.2 percent are technicians and 13.1 percent are plant workers or similar. That year, 43.3 {{percent of the population}} over 15 had a higher-education degree and 22.3 percent had no diploma.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Jewish {{developers}} renovated old warehouses and factories, {{turning them into}} housing. More than 500 apartments were approved in the three-year period following 1997; soon afterward, an area near Williamsburg's border with Bedford–Stuyvesant was rezoned for affordable housing. By 1997, there were about 7,000 Hasidic families in Williamsburg, {{almost a third of}} whom took public assistance. The Hasidic community of Williamsburg {{has one of the highest}} birthrates in the country, with an average of eight children per family. Each year, the community celebrates between 800 and 900 weddings for <b>young</b> <b>couples,</b> who typically marry between the ages of 18 and 21. Because Hasidic men receive little secular education, and women tend to be homemakers, college degrees are rare, and economic opportunities lag far behind the rest of the population. In response to the almost 60% poverty rate in Jewish Williamsburg, the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a beneficiary agency of the UJA-Federation of New York, partnered with Masbia in the opening of a 50-seat kosher soup kitchen on Lee Avenue in November 2009.|$|E
25|$|The early {{residents}} of the modern Portela were <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> with their children, many returning from the Portuguese Colonies, others liberal professionasl such as lawyers, engineers, physicians, or judges and some older politicians, ostensibly from middle- to upper-middle class. The growth of the region {{was influenced by the}} youth culture, a bohemian collection of punk, metal, anarchist and others on the vanguard of the youth movement, who would spend time in the Bairro Alto district, ending their nights in Cais do Sodré, Jamaica, Tóquio or Shangrila. As time evolved, the Association of Portela Homeowners, the parish Church and the Junta Freguesia became more active in the activities of the residents. By the 1990s, the youth movement had moved onto to areas of Alcântara-Mar, the Kapital or the Kremlin. At this time, the Esplanada da Portela (the main strip), with its open-air green-spaces attracted more of the local residents, and slowly the tennis courts and football field were constructed to fix the local population. As the population continued to age, many married and moved away, although some remained in the region while others moved closer to the river's edge, as the Expo 98 lands were repurposed for residential living.|$|E

500|$|According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, Ashdod had a {{population}} of about [...] at the end of , making it the sixth largest city in Israel. The annual population growth rate is 2.6% and the ratio of women to men is 1,046 to 1,000. The population age distribution was recorded as 19.7% under the age of 10, 15.7% from age 10 to 19, 14.9% from 20 to 29, 19.1% from 30 to 44, 19.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.3% were 65 or older. The population of Ashdod is significantly younger than the Israeli average because of the large number of <b>young</b> <b>couples</b> living in the city. The city is ranked medium-low in socio-economic grading, with a rating of 4 out of 10. 56.1% of 12th grade students in Ashdod were eligible for matriculation certificates in 2000.
