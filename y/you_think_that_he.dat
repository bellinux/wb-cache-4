25|$|If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> who {{is called}} “the heart essence of all buddhas, the Primordial Lord, the noble Victorious One, Samantabhadra” is {{contained}} in a mindstream separate from the ocean-like realm of sentient beings, then this is a nihilistic view in which samsara and nirvana remain unconnected.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only the Endicotts," [...] she explained. [...] "But do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will play?" [...] she added, casting {{an anxious}} {{look on her}} brother-in-law's face.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{expected}} you {{to speak}} in this way. <b>You</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not deserve to be wounded by my refusing this because it comes from him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Annie {{broke into}} a laugh at herself: [...] "Of course. But don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{a man who is}} able to put things as he does--who can make you see, for example, the stupidity and cruelty of things that always seemed right and proper before--don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> guilty of a kind of {{hypocrisy}} if he doesn't feel as well as see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Suzette drew {{away from}} her in stern offence. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> were alive he would leave us without a word--a sign?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bobby {{contrived}} to smile: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if I promised {{never to}} buy or sell gloves again, but in future to try and live like a gentleman--do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> then <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will consent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, now, on your oath, {{have you}} ever, in the prisoner's presence, heard such {{language}} used respecting Captain Ussher as made <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was to be}} killed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of him in that way at all. I don't {{know what to say}} yet. It--confuses me. I--I can't imagine it. But if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is trying to amuse himself----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God {{will have}} nought {{to say in}} the matter, my friend," [...] {{retorted}} Stoutenburg dryly, [...] "'tis only the Stadtholder who will have his say, and do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is like to pardon...." ...|$|E
30|$|At first sight, <b>you</b> would {{definitely}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was an aborigine.|$|R
6000|$|... 1. If Jesus Christ {{should allow}} <b>thee</b> once to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will cast <b>thee</b> out, he must allow <b>thee</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will falsify his word; for he hath said, [...] "I will in no wise cast out." [...] But Christ would not that thou shouldst count {{him as one}} that will falsify his word; for he saith of himself, [...] "I am the truth;" [...] {{therefore}} <b>he</b> would not <b>that</b> any that in truth are coming to him, should once <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will cast them out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bellamy is {{not even}} on the train," [...] Von Behrling protested. [...] "He went north to Berlin. That itself is the proof that they know nothing. If he had had the merest suspicion, do <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have stayed with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{watch for}} the postman any more {{if it makes you}} have bad {{thoughts}} about him. Yes, they are bad thoughts. I won't have <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't do everything that is right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{a little}} timidly, [...] "I don't {{understand}} this at all, {{but it is}} terribly tragic. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have lived {{if he had not}} undertaken the journey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'A great God, Andrew Arnold, and a pure, though His {{followers}} are few in {{the world}} as yet. But do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> can save you from Me, as you were asking Him to do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you like}} men to swear at you, and to swagger like Bobadils, and to misbehave themselves, {{so that one}} has to blush for them if a servant chances to hear them. Do <b>you</b> really <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has {{conducted}} himself to-day like a gentleman?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My news is good, sheik," [...] Edgar said calmly; [...] "had it been {{otherwise}} I {{would have}} left <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had died {{on the field of}} battle. I have reason to believe that Sidi has been released, and that you will soon see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True. You speak, if {{not like}} a physician, yet like a metaphysician; so you will not laugh at me, and compel the weak old man and his fancy to take refuge with a girl--who is not weak.--Grace, darling, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> still <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must be a}} {{very bad}} judge of the face as an index to the mind if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is happy. I have been {{watching}} him all dinner, and I draw a very different conclusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Seti, [...] "it is {{only when}} <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not be Pharaoh that you desert. Well, get you to your duties, rogue, who perhaps at bottom are as honest as the rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She would be," [...] Lady Blennington remarked, dryly. [...] "Look at her husband. The {{poor man}} {{ought to have}} known better than to have married her, of course, but do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> looks even {{reasonably}} happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> {{had been}} a {{different}} sort of man I should have dared to speak? Ask yourself how you can continue to live with him? You can call him which you will. Both are equally disgraceful. Your heart knows the truth. He is either a coward or a philanderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better defy him at once, and get over," [...] Barrington said. [...] "After all, don't <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{the harm}} <b>he</b> {{could do is}} a little imaginary?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do, and I'll {{tell you}} why," [...] Helen answered. [...] "I don't think Mr. Lessingham {{is at all}} the type of man to which you are accustomed. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is in deadly earnest about <b>you.</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was in deadly earnest from the first. You don't really care for him, do you, dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe the}} fellow is {{friendly}} to us, but I can't quite make him out," [...] said Cochrane to Belmont. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> means {{that his name}} is Tippy Tilly, and that he killed Hicks Pasha?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what I {{have told}} myself scores of times, {{and it would}} be a relief to me indeed could I find some other {{explanation}} of the matter. Then, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had better come up to London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thy {{will be done}} on earth.' He who bade us {{ask that}} boon for generations yet unborn, was very God of very God. Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>He</b> would have bidden us ask a blessing, which He knew would never come? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I heard the death-hounds bay, that is all. Yes, with <b>you</b> I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has wisdom, and the bee which seeks honey should suck the flower--before it fades! Also, as you say, there are {{commands}} {{with which it}} is ill to trifle, even if we cannot guess their meaning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion? Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do <b>you</b> not {{yourself}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is innocent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And failed? Well, it must comfort <b>you</b> to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did fail {{if he was}} of {{the number}} of your servants. It is strange now that some knave unknown {{attempted}} murder last night in the palace gardens, also with poisoned arrows. I say attempted, but as yet I cannot be sure <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not succeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{thought for}} a minute or two before he {{answered}} her. Perhaps the man would be more impressed if the message came to him through his wife. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will not be annoyed with you, you may do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet {{there is}} one thing wanting," [...] she whispered. [...] "What do you suppose, if he were here at this moment, Paul Fiske would say? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be content to listen to these brazen voices and accept their verdict?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} very unkind," [...] she declared. [...] "You have not been to see me {{for a very long}} time. I do not think that I shall forgive you. What do you say, Mr. Wrayson? Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> deserves it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I {{have cut}} it. Darwin doesn't {{interest}} me, <b>you</b> know. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was a rather}} misguided person. May I carry the books home for you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Clash writer Anna Wilson {{referred}} to Crazy Clown Time as [...] "a masterful accomplishment" [...] and [...] "beautifully beguiling" [...] and said its production was [...] "as meticulous {{as the sound}} design in Lynch's movies", rating it eight out of ten. Rating the album a C+ in Consequence of Sound, critic Adam Kivel commented that [...] "although it won't make <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> a musician first and a filmmaker second" [...] that Crazy Clown Times [...] "expressive, emotive features … create a real response in the listener, from familiarity to icy discomfort." [...] Filter awarded the album an 80%/100% rating, with writer Kurt Orzeck saying that [...] "when Lynch decides to sing, you should listen." [...] However, Orzeck {{also said that the}} album [...] "comes across as Lynch trying to measure up to &#91;Angelo Badalamenti&#93;, but falling short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sh! Sh!" [...] hissed Babalatchi, with {{a glance}} towards Omar. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> O girl! <b>that</b> <b>he</b> himself would live like a beggar, even with you?" ...|$|R
