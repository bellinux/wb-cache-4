50|$|The {{yaw drive}} is an {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have a <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. A <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area.

40|$|Natural wind is stochastic, being {{characterized}} by its speed and direction which change randomly and frequently. Because of the certain lag in control {{systems and the}} yaw body itself, wind turbines cannot be accurately aligned toward the wind direction when the wind speed and wind direction change frequently. Thus, wind turbines often suffer {{from a series of}} engineering issues during operation, including frequent yaw, vibration overruns and downtime. This paper aims to study the effects of <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> on wind turbine running characteristics at different wind speeds and control stages by establishing a wind turbine model, <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> model and the equivalent wind speed model that includes the wind shear and tower shadow effects. Formulas for the relevant effect coefficients Tc, Sc and Pc were derived.

40|$|Abstract. The Space Astronomy Laboratory is {{building}} an attitude determination and digital imaging system with embedded compression. The attitude determination system uses a 30 -square-degree {{field of view}} and an embedded star catalog to determine the Right Ascension and Declination of its line of sight to better than 5 arcseconds. The digital imaging subsystem uses a scheme of “progressive image transmission ” in which the image is sent out over a very-low-bandwidth channel, such as a spacecraft telemetry downlink, {{in such a way}} that it can be reconstructed “on the fly ” and updated as more data arrive. Large (768 × 474) useful images can be obtained over a 4 -kbit downlink in as little as 10 seconds. In addition to its use in sounding rockets and spacecraft, we are planning to use it for two ground-based applications at the Southern Africa Large Telescope (SALT). We will explore its use in generating real-time measurements of the telescope pointing, independent of the telescope control system, and we will use the low bandwidth imaging capability for public outreach. 1. Flight Test We tested the ST 5000 on a sounding rocket flight (36. 172, PI K. Nordsieck) in April 1999. The ST 5000 was mounted beside a Ball STRAP tracker, which was in control of the rocket, and was optically aligned with it. During the two guide star acquisitions, the ST 5000 measured pitch and <b>yaw</b> <b>errors,</b> which were telemetered by the rocket ACS. During the science phase of the mission, the ST 5000 generated pitch, <b>yaw,</b> and roll <b>errors</b> while progressively transmitting the acquisition field over a 19, 200 baud RS- 232 downlink.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that even a small {{decrease}} in the accuracy of a turbine’s yaw control due to hysteresis of the yaw drive and other factors results in considerable loss in energy capture by the rotor. As a cost-effective means of characterizing the turbine’s dynamic response when such losses are experienced, it is proposed that rotor-mounted inertial sensors can be used to measure static and dynamic variables that are correlated with swept wind loads on the blades. Based on this type of measurement, it is shown that the yaw set point can be tuned to shape the loads on the rotor to maximize energy capture. Improved maintenance schedules for individual turbines can also be realized using these measurements to reduce turbine down time and increase turbine component life. For example, cyclic loading that is observed in the blade’s lead-lag direction is known to cause torsional oscillations that result in accelerated gear and bearing wear. ^ In this thesis, free and forced dynamic response measurements on a 2. 1 meter horizontal axis wind turbine are used to characterize the rotor-dynamics of a turbine operating in yawed wind flow to demonstrate that rotor-mounted inertial sensors provide an effective means for characterizing the wind loads on the rotor disk. It is shown that operational modal analysis of the flap degree of freedom (DOF) exhibits a 1. 5 % change at 1 rot- 1 in the order domain per degree change in <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> when the yaw misalignment occurs between +/- 5 °.

First, the straightness error of a linear slide incorporated with angular error (pitch error in the vertical direction and <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> in the horizontal direction) is schematically explained. Then, a laser interferometry–based system is constructed to measure the motion errors of a linear slide, and an algorithm of error separation technique for extracting the straightness error, angular error, and tilt angle error caused by the motion of the reflector is developed. In the proposed method, the reflector is mounted on the slide moving along the guideway. The light-phase variation of two interfering laser beams can identify the lateral translation error of the slide. The differential outputs sampled with shifting initial point at the same datum line are applied to evaluate the angular error of the slide. Furthermore, the <b>yaw</b> <b>error</b> of the slide is measured by a laser interferometer in laboratory environment and compared with the evaluated values.

One is the application of a preprocessing on image pairs before matching. The other is the establishment of a scale and rotation restriction criteria on tie-points after SIFT matching. Compared with other matching methods, experiment results show that the proposed method is much more suitable for SAR image and successes in matching performance improvement.

40|$|Fatigue damage {{calculations}} {{are conducted}} as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing edge tape (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main {{objective of the}} research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like <b>yaw</b> <b>errors,</b> wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo) -elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in ’Octave’ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive <b>yaw</b> <b>errors</b> are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing edge tape is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in <b>yaw</b> <b>errors</b> in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here {{are based on a}} particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable cone angle, shaft tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing edge tape length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Miner’s sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An aero-elastic stability analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.

40|$|The {{navigation}} of pedestrians {{based on}} inertial sensors, i. e. accelerometers and gyroscopes, {{has experienced a}} great growth over the last years. However, the noise of medium and low-cost sensors causes a high error in the orientation estimation, particularly in the <b>yaw</b> angle. This <b>error,</b> called drift, {{is due to the}} bias of the z-axis gyroscope and other slow changing errors, such as temperature variations. We propose a seamless landmark-based drift compensation algorithm that only uses inertial measurements. The proposed algorithm adds a great value to the state of the art, because {{the vast majority of the}} drift elimination algorithms apply corrections to the estimated position, but not to the yaw angle estimation. Instead, the presented algorithm computes the drift value and uses it to prevent <b>yaw</b> <b>errors</b> and therefore position errors. In order to achieve this goal, a detector of landmarks, i. e. corners and stairs, and an association algorithm have been developed. The results of the experiments show that it is possible to reliably detect corners and stairs using only inertial measurements eliminating the need that the user takes any action, e. g. pressing a button. Associations between re visited landmarks are successfully made taking into account the uncertainty of the position. After that, the drift is computed out of all associations and used during a post-processing stage to obtain a low-drifted yaw angle estimation, that leads to successfully drift compensated trajectories.

In {{order to maintain the}} desired path of the vehicle, in presence of disturbances due to cross wind, different road conditions, and tire deflections, a fuzzy logic based yaw stability controller is proposed in this paper. Proposed control system receives <b>yaw</b> rate <b>error,</b> steering angle given by the driver, and side slip angle as inputs, for calculating the additional steering angle as output, for maintaining the yaw stability of the vehicle. As the side slip angle cannot be measured directly in a vehicle, it was estimated using a model based Kalman observer. A two-degrees-of-freedom vehicle model is considered in the present work. The effect of disturbance on yaw rate and <b>yaw</b> rate <b>error</b> of the vehicle is simulated for sinusoidal, step maneuver and compared with the existing fuzzy control system which uses two inputs such as steering angle and yaw rate. The simulation results show better performance of the proposed fuzzy based yaw controller as compared with existing control system. Proposed fuzzy based yaw stability controller can be implemented in steer-by-wire system for an active front steering of a road vehicle...|$|R
