2500|$|... "Money cannot make armaments. Armaments {{can only}} {{be made by the}} skill of the British working class, and it is the British working class who would be called upon to use them. To-day <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> glorious {{opportunity}} that the workers have ever had if you will only use the necessity of capitalism in order to get power yourselves. The capitalists are in your hands. Refuse to make munitions, refuse to make armaments, and they are helpless. They would have to hand the control of the country over to you".|$|E
60|$|Duen. O sir, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> insinuating manner, but indeed {{you should}} {{get rid of that}} odious beard--one might as well kiss a hedgehog.|$|E
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth. You {{always find}} out that one's most glaring fault is one's most {{important}} virtue. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> comforting views of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} {{to say that they}} come to a good deal more than that," [...] he said. [...] "I hope you do not forget that I took the liberty of advising you more than once to stop. <b>You</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> abominable luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> to forgive. I was an ungrateful little wretch--and after <b>you</b> <b>had</b> really {{saved my}} life that day on the pond, too. How I loathed that load of {{obligation}} at first! I don't deserve <b>the</b> happiness that <b>has</b> come to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not <b>the</b> <b>most</b> remote {{idea of making}} any apology whatever. Therefore, we had only to arrange the {{preliminaries}} of a meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Cherry, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{influence}} with Gerald, but {{he talks to}} the girls of our having no right to keep the treasures of the hills for our exclusive pleasure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say!--Say that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{beautiful}} figure, and the slimmest waist in the world, Blanche--Miss Amory, I mean. I {{beg your}} pardon. Another turn; this music {{would make an}} alderman dance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed she is. I think you'll {{like her}} {{when you see}} her some day. If you don't, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{extraordinary}} taste I ever knew a man to possess. How about the horse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This-matter grows serious," [...] he said: [...] "it {{will admit}} of no farther hesitation. Signor Grimaldi, command all {{to leave the}} chapel in whose {{discretion}} <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not <b>the</b> <b>most</b> perfect confidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one thing," [...] {{he remarked}} meditatively, [...] "which I can't help {{thinking}} about you Britishers. You may deserve it or you may not, but <b>you</b> do <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> almighty luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My conscience," [...] I replied, [...] "is {{about as}} {{imaginary}} {{a thing as}} my early- Victorian drawing-room. I can assure <b>you</b> I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> profound admiration for your father. I think {{he is one of}} the cleverest men I ever met." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind me. You do {{whatever}} you like; and I'll {{do whatever}} you like. You have a conscience; so I know that whatever you like {{will be the best}} thing. I have the most science; but <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sense. Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your modesty {{prevented}} you. But it's a fact, nevertheless. I'm glad, I say, because I {{have been}} thinking a lot along those lines myself, and I have been anxious to discuss the point with you. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> glorious hair I have ever seen!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish {{he could}} but hear you! But, suppose I were to quote Mr. Moore, or Mr. Thomas Moore, would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> distant {{conception}} whom I meant? Certainly not. By-the-bye, {{did you ever}} hear the pretty name they gave him at Paris?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose you}} will get a prize, because <b>you</b> <b>have</b> created <b>the</b> <b>most</b> prodigious and in all ways <b>most</b> {{wonderful}} Fair <b>the</b> planet <b>has</b> ever seen. Very well, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> indeed earned it: and with it the gratitude of the State and the nation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't go, don't go!' {{cried the}} boy. 'If you do {{you will never}} come back! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> got <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{beautiful}} skin in the world--just the kind that everyone is wanting, {{and they will be}} sure to kill you and strip you of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! old fellow," [...] said Leo {{aside to}} me in English, [...] "the lady is very civil. We seem to have tumbled into clover. I hope that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>the</b> <b>most</b> of your opportunities. By Jove! what a pair of arms she has got!" ...|$|R
6000|$|John listened coldly. [...] "I {{suppose that}} I am bound to believe you, Meinheer Muller," [...] he said. [...] "But I {{have been told}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{wonderful}} sight of any man in these parts, which makes it odd that at three hundred yards you should mistake a man upon his hands and knees for a vilderbeeste calf." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is an infamous falsehood!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Madame, you are unbearable!" [...] He {{was very}} angry, and it infuriated him {{the more that}} she should stand so coldly mocking before an anger that could bow the proudest heads in France. [...] "You have the pride of Satan, your greed is insatiable, your domineering spirit utterly insufferable, and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> false and {{poisonous}} tongue in the world!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Richmond. Then you {{disapprove}} of {{the whole of the}} European hanging of pictures in galleries?--I think it very beautiful sometimes, but not to be imitated. It produces most noble rooms. No one can but be impressed with the first room at the Louvre, where <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> noble Venetian pictures one mass of fire on the four walls; but then none of the details of those pictures can be seen.|$|E
6000|$|... "And little wonder!" [...] {{returned}} the captain. [...] "From {{what you say}} I judge that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> management of <b>most</b> of <b>the</b> mines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said Beechnut, [...] "it {{requires}} more skill to drive, than {{to hold the}} plow, and more strength to hold the plow, than to drive. I think, therefore, that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better drive, for as between you and I, it is I that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> strength, and <b>you</b> that <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> skill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{am afraid}} {{we are on}} the edge of a desert,” Will said, “which means that there are no more fowls and fruit for us. I see, Dimchurch, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{thoughtful}} this time. That half sheep and those cakes will be very valuable to us.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't there a view here?" [...] said Beatrice, {{pointing}} to the vast stretch of land and sea. [...] "I think, Mr. Davies, that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beautiful house in the whole world. Your great-uncle, who died a year ago, spent more than fifty thousand pounds on repairing and refurbishing it, they say. He built the big drawing-room there, where the stone is a little lighter; it is fifty-five feet long. Just think, fifty thousand pounds!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} {{something}} doing, of course," [...] Violet continued. [...] "My dear Peter, you may be an enigma to other people. To me <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> expressive countenance I ever saw. You have had a cable which you have just transcribed. If I had been a few minutes later, I {{think you would have}} torn up the result. As it is, I think I have come just in time to hear all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Call it {{what you}} please, but we won't do it any more, will we?" [...] He cleared his throat nervously, for her eyes advertised the {{immediate}} beginning of hostilities. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] he hurried on. [...] "I should have spoken for myself. What I mean is that I refuse to quarrel. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> horrible way, without uttering a word, of making me play the fool. Why, I began with the kindest intentions, and here I am now--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Perhaps you're {{making a}} mistake as to what I was {{thinking}} about,' I said innocent-like, as if I didn't have sense enough to go home when it rained. 'I was saying to myself that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> quite <b>the</b> <b>most</b> beautiful tail I ever saw on one of your family.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I solemnly do. Now lie down, {{and let us}} forget {{ourselves}} {{as soon as we}} can; for me, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made me <b>the</b> <b>most</b> miserable dog alive." ...|$|R
50|$|This was a TNA tournament-like event, {{first seen}} in 2004, where two four-man teams have 4 singles matches, 2 tag team matches, and one 8-man tag elimination. The singles matches are worth 1 point, the tag teams are worth 2 and the Elimination is worth 4. To win <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> points. <b>The</b> Tournament {{would later become}} the World X-Cup.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't {{think of}} {{anything}} else. But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips, and the bright look in the eyes. I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, but he has certainly made <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> wonderful expression. I suppose he has been paying you compliments. You mustn't believe a word that he says." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Edna," [...] {{said the}} elder lady, [...] "I have liked you ever since I have known you, and I expect to like you {{as long as}} I live, but I must say that, for an {{intelligent}} person, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> colorless character I have ever seen. Whatever comes to pass, you receive it as quietly and calmly {{as if it were}} just what you expected and what you happened to want, and yet, as long as I have known you, you have not had anything you wanted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Westgate Buildings!" [...] said he, [...] "and who is Miss Anne Elliot to {{be visiting}} in Westgate Buildings? A Mrs Smith. A widow Mrs Smith; {{and who was}} her husband? One of five {{thousand}} Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere. And what is her attraction? That she is old and sickly. Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> extraordinary taste! Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you. But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day. What is her age? Forty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but {{it comes}} nearer to it as people get older. Now go, my dear; I am busy, and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better make <b>the</b> <b>most</b> of your time with your cousins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wrong me," [...] replied Tarzan. [...] "My {{thoughts}} of <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been only <b>the</b> <b>most</b> pleasant. You must {{not feel that}} any explanation is due me. <b>Have</b> they annoyed <b>you</b> further?" ...|$|R
6000|$|DON JUAN. I {{say nothing}} against your chastity, Senora, since {{it took the}} form of a husband and twelve children. What more could <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done <b>had</b> <b>you</b> been <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{abandoned}} of women? ...|$|R
