30|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the darkening of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> pigments and have attributed this phenomenon to the reduction of Cr 6 + to Cr 3 + [21]. The reaction is accelerated by sunlight and the action of sulfurous pollutants, leading to a color shift from yellow to brown. The color change observed in Fig.  8 for the <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> paint used in the Haku Maki prints, changing slightly faster than BWS 3, is therefore not surprising. The orange paint characterized as a mixture of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> and molybdate orange, however, altered even faster than pure <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow,</b> showing a rate of color change approximately halfway between BWS 2 and 3. This result raises concerns regarding its exposure to exhibition lighting. Analysis of the individual color coordinates indicated that the orange paint shifted to become darker, less red, and less yellow.|$|R

40|$|It {{shall be}} the object of this {{investigation}} to measure the hydrogen ion concentration in lead acetate solutions and to apply the measurements to the control {{of color in the}} preparation of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellow</b> pigments.

Since the color of the pigment is believed to be dependent on the hydrogen ion concentration of the lead acetate solution used, such a study is of interest to dry-color manufacturers and to users of <b>chrome</b> <b>yellows.</b> The methods now in use for the analysis of lead acetate are to be reviewed, and an attempt will be made to measure the hydrogen ion concentration of the lead acetate solutions by a potentiometric method.

40|$|This study {{discuss the}} {{problems}} of displaying artworks containing <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome</b> pigments, reactive to the wavelengths in LED lights, often used in modern exhibitions. In the late 19 th century there where a variety of chrome pigments manufactured, such as lead chromate (PbCrO 4) and lead chromate mixed with lead sulphate (PbCrO 4 · PbSO 4). Studies have found that lead chromates with high content of sulphate and/or a certain crystal structure, tends to darken when exposed to light with short wavelengths. The main purpose has been to analyze two yellow paint samples from Vincent van Gogh’s Olive groove, Saint-Rémy - 1889, in Gothenburg art museum’s collection. Analysis with Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) confirmed {{the presence of a}} lead chromate, probably mixed with zinc white (ZnO). No complete characterization of potential sulphate content in the pigment could be made. The lack of sulphur in parts of the samples {{and the fact that the}} paint after 134 years in various lighting conditions still remain bright yellow, may indicate that it is not one of the most reactive type of lead chromates. As a supplement a series of oil colours containing <b>yellow</b> <b>chrome</b> pigments was made and artificially aged for 8 400 000 lx h, with a halogen spotlight and a “warm white” LED spotlight. The experiment simulated c. 19 / 25 years of exposure with 200 / 150 lux, with respect to the museums annual open hours. The lead chromates change in colour while a zinc chromate din not. The LED light caused no more darkening of this sulphur containing lead chromate, than the halogen light. As this experiment simulated exposure for a relatively short period of time with only one sulphur containing lead chromate, the reports on the potential danger of LED lights should not be neglected.
