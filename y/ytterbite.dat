Thinking {{that it was}} an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten, he named it <b>ytterbite.</b> Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or [...] "earth" [...] in Arrhenius' sample in 1789, and published his completed analysis in 1794; in 1797, the new oxide was named yttria. In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements, it was believed that earths could be reduced to their elements, meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within, which in this case would have been yttrium. Until the early 1920s, the chemical symbol [...] "Yt" [...] was used for the element, after which [...] "Y" [...] came into common use. Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium(III) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} in Vaxholm, Arrhenius visited the {{feldspar}} mine {{in the village of}} Ytterby on the island of Resarön, near Vaxholm. He found a dark mineral which he named <b>ytterbite</b> and sent to the chemist Johan Gadolin at the University of Åbo for further analysis. This permitted the discovery of four new elements by various chemist: yttrium, terbium, erbium, and ytterbium, and eventually the rest of the rare-earth metals, including scandium, lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and thulium.|$|E
50|$|Gadolinite, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} <b>ytterbite,</b> is a silicate mineral consisting principally of the silicates of cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, yttrium, beryllium, and iron with the formula (Ce,La,Nd,Y)2FeBe2Si2O10. It is called gadolinite-(Ce) or gadolinite-(Y), {{depending on the}} prominent composing element (Y if yttrium predominates, and Ce if cerium). It may contain 35.48% yttria sub-group rare earths, 2.17% ceria earths, as much as to 11.6% BeO, and traces of thorium. It is found in Sweden, Norway, and the US (Texas and Colorado).|$|E
