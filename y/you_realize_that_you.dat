500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It sounds a bit like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Graduation {{opens on}} a sparse note with [...] "Good Morning", {{beginning}} with an echoed, metronomic cowbell beat and a thumping bassline melded with a simple, arpeggiating synthesizer drone. The drone is drowned {{by the music}} that arrives at the chorus, which is a conflation of ambient synths and an astral backing choir crafted from a non-verbal vocal sample of [...] "Someone Saved My Life Tonight" [...] by Elton John. [...] "Good Morning" [...] eventually concludes with the voice of Jay-Z reiterating lyrics from [...] "The Ruler's Back", the rapper's own opening track of his sixth studio album The Blueprint. The production for [...] "Champion" [...] features intermittent drops and 808-handclaps and expresses a slight jazz-rock influence, eschewing guitars and trumpets in favor of breezy synths. During the verses, West raps over a constant loop of the words [...] "their eyes" [...] while the chopped-up hook is formed from the question, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>realize,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were a champion?" [...] Both phrases are recontextualized from a line lifted from [...] "Kid Charlemagne" [...] by Steely Dan. The song also sports a reggae-inspired bridge delivered by Connie Mitchell in a distinct toasting vocal style. The soul-fired track [...] "I Wonder" [...] starts off with its piano-based refrain, which contains samples of [...] "My Song" [...] by British poet Labi Siffre. It then proceeds to morph into a myriad of interlaced synths that are impacted by distorted snare drum strokes and ethereal electronic keyboards. During the bridge, the chord progression changes and the song adopts a heavy string section that emulates the melody of its synths. The composition then enters an instrumental passage and finishes off with a sweeping string arrangement.|$|E
2500|$|In 1947, Soros {{immigrated to}} England {{and became a}} student at the London School of Economics. While a student of the philosopher Karl Popper, Soros worked as a railway porter and as a waiter. [...] Soros {{received}} £40 from a Quaker charity. In a discussion at the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 2006, Alvin Shuster, former foreign editor of the Los Angeles Times, asked Soros, [...] "How does one go from an immigrant to a financier? ... When did <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew how to make money?" [...] Soros replied, [...] "Well, I had a variety of jobs and I ended up selling fancy goods on the seaside, souvenir shops, and I thought, that's really not what I was cut out to do. So, I wrote to every managing director in every merchant bank in London, got just one or two replies, and eventually that's how I got a job in a merchant bank." [...] That job was an entry-level position in Singer & Friedlander.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high cost}} of Titanic's set made it {{impossible}} for the show to have traditional out of town tryouts. [...] Titanic opened at Broadway's Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in 1997 to mixed reviews. The New Yorker's was a positive assessment from the New York press: [...] "It seemed a foregone conclusion that the show would be a failure; a musical about history's most tragic maiden voyage, in which fifteen hundred people lost their lives, was obviously preposterous.... Astonishingly, Titanic manages to be grave and entertaining, somber and joyful; little by little <b>you</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{in the presence of a}} genuine addition to American musical theatre." [...] The show was championed by Rosie O'Donnell, who talked about the show daily on her television show, inviting the cast to perform musical numbers and giving theatre tickets to the members of her studio audiences. This publicity, along with the show's strong showing at the Tony Awards, sweeping all five categories in which it was nominated including Best Score, Best Book, and Best Musical, enabled it to outlast its competition. [...] It ran for 804 performances and 26 previews, toured America for three years, and has had national and international productions ever since. The most recent 2013 Southwark Theatre production in London swept all the Off-West End Awards as Best Musical Production.|$|E

5000|$|The Green Street {{site was}} not the only {{intelligence}} unit in the area, nor was it the only camouflaged building. The Royal Australian Air Force operated the No 1 Wireless Unit at Stuart. This was a highly secret post intercepting aircraft transmission signals. A RAAF officer, serving in Townsville described a visit to a telegraphists' bunker at Stuart:"My first impression was that it was an old farm house. It had been camouflaged with verandah rails and doors etc. and it wasn't until you got right up to it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were looking at a solid concrete building.
