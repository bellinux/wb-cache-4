25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I was sitting up in the bleachers and jumped down — I was three-quarters of the way up. <b>You</b> <b>jump</b> down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

500|$|A musical score, {{consisting}} of 19 pieces composed by score producer tomandandy, {{was released on}} May 27, 2008 and was distributed by Lakeshore Records. The album was received with generally positive reviews by critics. [...] "It's a creepy score for {{what appears to be}} a movie that will make <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> as well as make sure that the doors are locked at night," [...] writes reviewer Jeff Swindoll. [...] "This is an impressive score and adds a tremendous chill-factor to the film," [...] says Zach Freeman of Blogger News, grading it with an A.|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When <b>you</b> <b>jump,</b> you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, {{executive editor}} of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride that will make <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated {{that it was more}} accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E

500|$|MacFarlane was {{recruited}} during the senior film festival by development executive Ellen Cockrill and President Fred Seibert. He {{went to work}} at Hanna-Barbera (then Hanna-Barbera Cartoons) based on the writing content of The Life of Larry, rather than on cartooning ability. He was one of only a few people hired by the company solely based on writing talent. He worked as an animator and writer for Cartoon Network's Cartoon Cartoons series. He described the atmosphere at Hanna-Barbera as resembling an [...] "old-fashioned Hollywood structure, where you move from one show to another or <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> from a writing job on one show to a storyboard job on another". MacFarlane worked on four television series during his tenure at the studio: Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, I Am Weasel, and Johnny Bravo. Working as both a writer and storyboard artist, MacFarlane spent the most time on Johnny Bravo. He found it easier to develop his own style at Johnny Bravo through the show's process of scriptwriting, which Dexter's Laboratory, Cow and Chicken, and I Am Weasel did not use. As a part of the Johnny Bravo crew, MacFarlane met actors and voiceover artists such as Adam West and Jack Sheldon of Schoolhouse Rock! fame. Meeting these individuals later became significant to the production and success of his Family Guy series.|$|E
500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Friday the 13th {{was produced}} {{and directed by}} Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously worked with filmmaker Wes Craven on The Last House on the Left (1972). Cunningham, inspired {{by the success of}} John Carpenter's Halloween (1978), wanted Friday the 13th to be shocking, visually stunning, and [...] " [...] <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> out of your seat". Distancing himself from The Last House on the Left, Cunningham wanted Friday the 13th {{to be more of a}} [...] "roller coaster ride". The first film was meant to be [...] "a real scary movie", and at the same time make audiences laugh. The concept for Friday the 13th began as nothing more than a title. A Long Night at Camp Blood was the working title Victor Miller used while he drafted a script, but Cunningham believed in his [...] "Friday the 13th" [...] moniker and rushed to place an advertisement in International Variety. Worrying that someone else owned the rights to the title and wanting to avoid potential lawsuits, Cunningham thought it would be best to find out immediately. Cunningham commissioned a New York advertising agency to develop his visual concept of the Friday the 13th logo, which consisted of big block letters bursting through a pane of glass. In the end, Cunningham believed there were [...] "no problems" [...] with the title, but distributor George Mansour contends that there was an issue: [...] "There was a movie before ours called Friday the 13th: The Orphan. Moderately successful. But someone still threatened to sue. I don't know whether Phil [...] paid them off, but it was finally resolved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you never}} do {{anything}} more foolish than that, you will get through life well enough. Appearances were against me, and <b>you</b> <b>jumped</b> at conclusions a little too fast. Let us say no more about it." ...|$|R

2500|$|To {{develop the}} game's themes, Kaplan {{stated that they}} wanted to create a future that was not typical of what a post-apocalyptic world might be like, opting instead for a future where {{conflict}} still exists but a [...] "bright and aspirational vision" [...] is maintained. The title's creative director, Chris Metzen, acknowledged that parts of Overwatch, such as maps, share [...] "continuity" [...] with Titan. Citing a desire to keep its game styles [...] "simple", and because it contradicted its emphasis on accomplishing goals as a team rather than trying to achieve large numbers of kills, Overwatch does not contain a traditional deathmatch mode. Metzen stated that [...] "we have a long legacy of developing multiplayer games, and it came down to 'is it even possible to build a shooter that doesn't feel cynical, that doesn't feel cruel, that doesn't feel nasty? Can you build one that really promotes teamwork and relationship and having fun with your friends, and not getting killed with a thrown knife from halfway across the map as soon as <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> in?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Nathan Lee of The Village Voice {{said the}} film [...] "works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious. It crescendos with a {{legitimate}} {{sense of wonder}} (if not profundity) {{thanks in large part}} to the luminous and uncanny score by electro legends Underworld." [...] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis viewed director Boyle as a [...] "first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer" [...] who always [...] "sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears." [...] She went on to say, [...] "He's wickedly good at making <b>you</b> <b>jump</b> and squirm in your seat, which he does often in [...] "Sunshine," [...] but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion." [...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition." [...] He emphatically added, [...] "The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented that for the film, [...] "The voyage works, beautifully. While we don't get the ticklish conceit of Scottish profanities in the celestial outer realm, we do get something surprisingly consoling: a deep sense of the humanity that we always carry with us, no matter how far we venture from home." ...|$|E

5000|$|Movement {{is similar}} to checkers, except {{that there is no}} concept of forward, backwards, or [...] "kings".

Loops (requiring a minimum of three opposing stacks to jump) are possible.|$|R
