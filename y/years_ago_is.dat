5|$|Ancient stone {{structures}} {{testify to}} the presence of Stroma's earliest residents, while a Norse presence around 900–1,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga. It has been politically united with Caithness since at least the 15th century. Although Stroma lies only a few miles off the Scottish coast, the savage weather and ferociously strong tides of the Pentland Firth meant that the island's inhabitants were very isolated, causing them to be largely self-sufficient, trading agricultural produce and fish with the mainlanders.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E

5|$|The {{story of}} Dino Crisis {{takes place on}} a fictional {{location}} known as Ibis Island in the year 2009. The Secret Operation Raid Team (SORT) has sent an agent, Tom, to investigate a research facility. During the recon mission, he learns that Dr. Edward Kirk, a world-renowned scientist who was reported dead three <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>is</b> leading a secret weapons project within the facility. SORT sends four agents (Regina, Gail, Rick, and Cooper) to acquire Kirk and return him to custody. The team arrives on the island under cover of darkness, dropping in via parachute. Cooper is blown off course and lands in the jungle away from the others. Lost in the dark, he is chased down by a Tyrannosaurus rex and eaten. The other three agents, unaware of his death, proceed with the mission.|$|E
5|$|Eruptions {{along the}} narrow fissure system under the chain began in the west moat of Long Valley Caldera 400,000 to 60,000 years ago. Mammoth Mountain was formed during this period. Multiple eruptions from 40,000 to 600 years ago created the Mono Craters and eruptions 5,000 to 500 years ago formed the Inyo Craters. Lava flows 5,000 years ago built the Red Cones, and {{explosion}} pits on Mammoth Mountain were excavated in the last 1,000 years. Uplift of Paoha Island in Mono Lake about 250 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> the most recent activity. These eruptions most likely originated from small magma bodies rather than from a single, large magma chamber {{like the one that}} produced the massive Long Valley Caldera eruption 760,000 years ago. During the past 3,000 years, eruptions have occurred every 250 to 700 years. In 1980, a series of earthquakes and uplift within and south of Long Valley Caldera indicated renewed activity in the area.|$|E
5|$|Sophie is an amnesiac girl Asbel, Hubert, Cheria, and Richard befriend. She is {{seemingly}} killed after {{protecting them}} from Lambda. She reappears {{seven years later}} when Asbel and Cheria were in danger. Sophie is revealed to be Protos Heis, a humanoid made of tiny particles acting in concert with each other. Her death seven <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> explained as Sophie breaking up into particles residing inside Asbel, Hubert, and Cheria to heal their wounds and is the reason the three possess mystical powers. During the events of Lineage and Legacies, Sophie expresses her fears of life {{after the death of}} her friends due to her immortality. To lessen her fears, Asbel formally adopts her into the Lhant family. After fusing with a Little Queen, Sophie ages to an adult and is able to express a greater variety of emotions. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa and dubbed by Cassandra Morris. Since her debut, Sophie has ranked on the Tales character popularity polls. Sophie is a playable character in Tales of the World: Radiant Mythology 3.|$|E

25|$|The Mesolithic is the {{transitional}} period between the Upper Palaeolithic hunter-gathering existence {{and the development of}} farming and pottery production during the Postglacial Neolithic. The duration of the classical Palaeolithic, which lasted until about 10,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>is</b> applicable to the Balkans.

25|$|The coastal {{migration}} hypothesis {{has been}} bolstered by findings {{such as the}} report that the sediments in the Port Eliza caves on Vancouver Island indicate the possibility of survivable climate {{as far back as}} 16 ka (16,000 years) in the area, while the continental ice sheets were nearing their maximum extent.

However, despite such research, the coastal migration hypothesis is still subject to considerable debate.|$|E
25|$|Climates {{during the}} Pliocene became cooler and drier, and seasonal, similar to modern climates. Ice sheets grew on Antarctica. The {{formation}} of an Arctic ice cap around 3million <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> signaled by an abrupt shift in oxygen isotope ratios and ice-rafted cobbles in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Ocean beds. Mid-latitude glaciation probably began {{before the end of}} the epoch. The global cooling that occurred during the Pliocene may have spurred on the disappearance of forests and the spread of grasslands and savannas.|$|E

25|$|Some {{experts believe}} {{the main reason}} the Modern Persian {{language}} today {{is more or less}} the same language as that of Ferdowsi's time over 1000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> due to the very existence of works like the Shahnameh, which have had lasting and profound cultural and linguistic influence. In other words, the Shahnameh itself has become one of the main pillars of the modern Persian language. Studying Ferdowsi's masterpiece also became a requirement for achieving mastery of the Persian language by subsequent Persian poets, as evidenced by numerous references to the Shahnameh in their works.|$|E

25|$|Harvestmen {{are very}} old arachnids.

25|$|The revised 2016 dating of 50,000 <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>is</b> {{close to}} the time that modern humans reached the area, {{suggesting}} that the initial encounter with H.sapiens caused or contributed {{to the demise of}} H.floresiensis. This would be consistent with the disappearance of H.neanderthalensis from Europe about 40,000 years ago, within 5,000 years after the arrival of modern humans there, and other anthropogenic extinctions. Skeletal material from modern humans dated to 46,000 years ago has been recovered from the Liang Bua cave, strengthening the evidence for a role for modern humans in the extinction. Subsequent to this date, other megafauna of the island (such as the proboscid Stegodon florensis insularis and the giant stork Leptoptilos robustus) also disappeared.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{relief of}} Bulgaria {{is a result}} of continuous geological evolution. The Bulgarian lands were often submerged by ancient seas and lakes, some land layers rose others sank. Volcanic eruptions were common both on land and in the water basins. All three main groups of rocks, magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic, are found in the country. The oldest rock formations in Bulgaria date from the Precambrian period than 500million years ago. During the Archean, Proterozoic and Paleozoic eras (4.0billion to 252million years ago) the magmatic rocks were formed. Throughout most of that period the only land areas were Rila, Pirin and the western Rhodope Mountains. The Mesozoic era (252million to 66million years ago) saw the beginning of the Alpine orogeny that has formed the mountain ranges of the Alpide belt, including the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora. The Cenozoic era (since 66million <b>years</b> <b>ago)</b> <b>is</b> characterized with active tectonic processes, the definitive formation of the Balkan Mountains, the formation of grabens and horsts in Rila, Pirin and Kraishte region.|$|E
