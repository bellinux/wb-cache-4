40|$|The paper {{compares the}} {{efficiency}} of the European banking systems in view of the constitution of the European Monetary Union. Since competition among banks will increase, it is important to identify the most efficient banking system able {{to play a role in}} that market. A parametric approach is adopted based on the estimation of a stochastic cost frontier. This methodology enables one to measure X-inefficiency and to model it as a function of environmental variables which may influence firms’ efficiency. By means of this analysis it is possible to identify the most efficient banking systems and to focus on the determinants of deviations from cost minimizing. The analysis highlights significant efficiency gaps among the performances of banks in different countries and of different institutional types. In particular, it is found that the Mittel-European model is the one that operates closest to the efficient frontier. This may indicate that, compared with separated banks, the universal banking system allows for production plans which come closer to the optimal frontier.

Review of the literature showed paucity of nursing theory related to the use of technology and usability, particularly in older adults. The Roy Adaptation Model, a widely used nursing theory, was chosen to provide framework for the new model. Technology constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model and United Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and behavioral control con­struct from the Theory of Planned Behavior were integrated into the construction of the derived model. The Use of Technology for Adaptation by Older Adults and/or Those With Limited Literacy (U. S. A. B. I. L. I. T. Y.) Model© was constructed from the integration of diverse theoretical/conceptual perspectives. The four determinants of usability in the conceptual model include (a) efficiency, (b) learnability, (c) perceived user experience, and (d) perceived control.

40|$|A {{considerably}} arduous {{test of a}} novel {{class of}} composite materials consisting of [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + and TiO 2 codoped zeolites Y is presented here. The [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + and TiO 2 codoped zeolites Y served as photocatalysts in the oxidation of the model compounds 2, 4 -dimethylaniline (2, 4 -xylidine) by H 2 O 2 in an acidic aqueous medium. Zeolite-embedded TiO 2 (nano) particles {{play an important role}} in the degradation mechanism. The first step in this complex mechanism is the photoelectron transfer from photoexcited [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 +*, located inside the supercage of zeolite Y, to a neighboring TiO 2 nanoparticle. During this electron transfer process, electron injection into the conduction band of TiO 2 is achieved. The second decisive step is the reaction of this electron with H 2 O 2, which was previously chemisorbed at the surface-region of the TiO 2 nanoparticles. In this reaction, a TiO 2 bound hydroxyl radical (TiO 2 —HO) is created. This highly reactive intermediate initiates then the oxidation of 2, 4 -xylidine, which enters the zeolites framework in its protonated form (Hxyl+). The formation of 2, 4 -dimethylphenol as first detectable reaction product indicated that this oxidation proceeds via an electron transfer mechanism. Furthermore, [Ru(bpy) 3] 3 +, which was created in the initiating photoelectron transfer reaction between [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 +* and TiO 2, also takes place in the oxidation of Hxyl+. [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + is recycled in that reaction, which also belongs to the group of electron transfer reactions. In addition to the primary steps of this particular Advanced Oxidation Process (AOP), the dependence of the efficiency of the 2, 4 -xylidine degradation as a function of the [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + and TiO 2 loadings of the zeolite <b>Y</b> <b>framework</b> is also reported here. The quenching of [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 +* by H 2 O 2 as well as the photocatalytic activity of the [Ru(bpy) 3] 2 + and TiO 2 codoped zeolite Y catalysts both follow a distinct percolation behavior in dependence of their TiO 2 content...|$|E

The catalyst was found to effectively decompose TCDD in a methanol/tetrahydrofuran solution to reach 86 % after 5 h. In the presence of the catalyst, a hydroxyl derivative was identified as an intermediate for the 302 nm catalytic pathway. This was not observed for the 254 nm process. Furthermore, irradiating of TCDD under 254 nm UV source for 6 h resulted in the formation of three products with molecular ion peaks of 113, 128, and 158 amu. On the other hand, the 302 nm gives two major products with molecular ion peaks of 220 and 252 amu.

The steaming of zeolite H-Y was performed under water vapor pressures of 3. 4 - 81. 5 kPa and at a temperature of 748 K. To exclude an additional modification of the dealuminated zeolites Y, the samples were investigated in the nonhydrated state, i. e., without hydration after the dealumination. By 29 Si magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, a strong high-field shift of the signals of Si(3 Al) and Si(2 Al) sites in the spectra of nonhydrated zeolites Y in comparison {{with those of the}} hydrated samples was observed. This finding is explained by a change of the Si-O-T bond angles of Si(nAl) sites in the local structure of nonhydrated framework AlO 4 tetrahedra. With increasing water vapor pressure during the dealumination, a systematic decrease of the total amounts of framework aluminum atoms in nonhydrated zeolites Y was found by 27 Al spin-echo NMR and 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopies. The amounts of disturbed framework aluminum atoms, probably 3 -fold-coordinated species in nonhydrated zeolites Y, were determined by the increase of the concentrations of bridging OH groups after an ammonia adsorption/desorption treatment and by application of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. By a quantitative comparison of the amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms, responsible for the occurrence of negative framework charges, and the amounts of charge-compensating residual sodium cations and bridging hydroxyl protons, the mean cationic charge of extraframework aluminum atoms was estimated.

A detailed study was performed on zeolite H-mordenite, using in situ STXM and soft X-ray absorption tomography, complemented with 27 Al and 31 P magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, XRD, FT-IR spectroscopy, and N 2 physisorption. Extraframework aluminum was extracted from steam-dealuminated H-mordenite and shown to dominantly consist of amorphous AlO(OH). It was found that phosphoric acid readily reacts with the AlO(OH) phase in dealuminated H-mordenite and forms an extraframework amorphous AlPO 4 phase.

This is followed by an overview of zeolite-based catalysts, especially for NH 3 -SCR reaction with a focus toward zeolites known to possess high activity. They include zeolites <b>Y</b> (FAU <b>framework),</b> ZSM- 5 (MFI framework), SSZ- 13 (CHA framework), and (briefly) zeolite Beta (BEA framework).

This thesis examines the relationship between South Africa and Zimbabwe and argues that these two states are more interdependent than dependency scholars would acknowledge. Although {{a study of the}} historical period reveals that dependency theory, as defined by Raul Prebisch, Andre Gunder Frank and A. Valenzuela, is helpful for understanding the development of relations between the two states, it is unable to account for many of the characteristics of the relationship which are found in the contemporary context, especially since 1980. An examination of various economic areas of interaction, including investment, trade and transportation, as well as the political realm, indicates that each state exhibits a degree of dependence upon the other. Thus, it is possible to characterize the relationship as one of "mutual dependence," or interdependence as defined by Robert Keohane and Joseph S. Nye. Interdependence is further examined through the concepts of sensitivity and vulnerability. Sensitivity signifies the ability of a state to respond effectively to policy changes made by another state wi thin a given area of interaction without incurring large costs, while vulnerability denotes that an actor is unable to respond, or only at great cost. By applying these concepts to the relationship between Zimbabwe and South Africa, it is determined that although South Africa tends to be sensitive while Zimbabwe is generally vulnerable, the degrees to which these two states are sensi ti ve and vulnerable varies over time and issue area. As the changes wi thin South Africa start to affect relations wi th the rest of southern Africa, it wi 11 be necessary to understand the interaction between the states from an interdependency perspective if cooperation within the region wi 11 be successful.

Y consists of necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for a context where a person can rationally trust another person to perform a specific action. TRmin involves necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the information needed for having the beliefs in TR and <b>Y,</b> in a <b>framework</b> where information about the personal features and social ties is lacking. COMTR includes TR, Y and TRmin, but uses a different terminology, namely that of structural features of collective social action-categories. COMTR is formulated for, and applied to the framework of such categories, which have been analyzed by Tuomela and Bonnevier-Tuomela (now Tuomela) in 'From Social Imitation to Teamwork' (1997). The analyses of rational trust, TR and COMTR, are two "laymen's models of reasoning" or "lay theories" of trust. TR is concerned with the belief- components of rational trust, while COMTR states necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the information needed for having those beliefs in a framework of collective social action-categories, with "faceless" actors lacking personal features. In TR the trustor's expectation of the trustee's "acting with goodwill" is crucial. In COMTR this corresponds to "acting with a specific kind of social commitment. " The trust context (Y) serves to draw a line between trust and nearby notions, like reliance. COMTR is the central analysis of the work, and {{it is based on the}} assumption that man is a social being, wanting to be included in the fellowship of other men, thus caring for the disapproval of others. COMTR states necessary and jointly sufficient conditions for the trustor's belief that the trustee's fear of social disapproval will be aroused. In COMTR trust is based on the trustor's belief of the effectiveness of social pressure in eliciting the trustee's cooperative behavior. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Worldwide {{usage of}} diesel engines {{has been rising}} rapidly and, accordingly, more {{stringent}} emission standards are introduced to lower the concentrations of diesel exhaust pollutants. NOx abatement is crucial, especially in diesel engines where controlling NOx is extremely difficult as oxygen is always in excess. The title and objective of this thesis arises from a novel approach, the diesel oxidation NOx adsorption catalyst (DONAC), where NOx is to be stored by a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). Supported platinum catalysts are the most used technology for diesel oxidation catalysts. Hence, {{the investigation of the}} oxidation properties of supported platinum catalysts and particularly, how these properties are affected by the support material, is of great importance. This work addresses not only the effect of the support, platinum loading, preparation method, calcination conditions and platinum precursor, but also the effect of the titania phase composition (anatase or anatase-rutile). A series of supported platinum catalysts including Pt/TiO 2, Pt/SiO 2, Pt/Al 2 O 3, Pt/TiO 2 -SiO 2 and Pt/SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 were prepared by non-aqueous impregnation and chemical vapour impregnation. In order to determine the effect of the support on the structural and electronic properties of the supported platinum catalysts detailed characterisation including XRD, BET, CO chemisorption, NH 3 -TPD, H 2 -TPR, TGA, DRIFTS, Raman, XPS, SEM, TEM and EDX was performed. Two relevant oxidation reactions, total oxidation of propane and oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide, were studied. It is found that the activity of supported platinum catalysts is greatly affected by the support material, in general, their performance is enhanced by addition of SiO 2 to the TiO 2 support. The activity of the platinum catalysts depends strongly on oxidation state, with platinum in metallic state being most active. However, {{it is not only the}} platinum oxidation state but a combination of several factors including metal dispersion, surface area, morphology and phase composition of the support that explains the variations in catalytic activity. Morphology and phase composition play an active role in the redox properties of the support and its interaction with supported metal particles. The high propane oxidation activity of Pt supported on anatase TiO 2 is attributed to highly reactive oxygen species within the support. DeNOx technologies based on the concept of NOx storage have proven to be effective, however further studies are needed to succeed in finding an optimum NOx storage system. A series of metal (Cu, Fe and Pt) -exchanged zeolites with different compositions (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 5. 1 - 50) and <b>frameworks</b> (<b>Y,</b> ZSM- 5 and BETA) were prepared by two different exchange methods (WIE and CVI). The DOE method was applied to investigate the way in which preparation experimental variables affect the NOx storage capacity of CuII/ZSM- 5 (30). Evaluation of NOx storage capacity, in the presence or absence of O 2, of metal-exchanged zeolites was carried out. In order to correlate the physicochemical properties of the metal-exchanged zeolites with their NOx storage performance, characterisation including XRD, BET, NH 3 -TPD, H 2 -TPR, DRIFTS, UV-Vis DRS, XPS, TEM and EDX was performed. It is found that the NOx adsorption/desorption capacity and the stability of those adsorption species formed, is greatly affected by the nature of the exchanged metal and the structure and acidity of the zeolite support. Due to the intrinsic adsorption capacity of the parent zeolite, H+-ZSM- 5 (23), CuII/ZSM- 5 (23) catalysts prepared by WIE and CVI exhibit high NOx storage capacities. The initial redox state, Cu 2 +/Cu+ and Fe 2 +/Fe 3 + ratio, and bonding strength of the metal ions to the framework affect the reducibility of metal species and consequently the storage capacity. The preparation method is found to be crucial in controlling metal loading, nature and distribution of active species and crystallites size. The statistical approach allowed for a significant enhancement in the storage capacity of CuII/ZSM- 5 (30) and, in particular, the amount of NOx desorbed at high temperature. Temperature is found to have the greatest effect on the NOx storage capacity. In addition, its influence is dependent on the copper precursor concentration. Among the zeolite based catalysts studied, potential candidates for application under real working conditions, those that exhibit greater NOx desorption at high temperatures (T> 200 oC) were found...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{of speech}} {{parameters}} in casual speech of dementia patients Roelant Adriaan Ossewaarde 1, 2, Roel Jonkers 1, Fedor Jalvingh 1, 3, Roelien Bastiaanse 1 1 CLCG, University of Groningen (NL); 2 HU University of Applied Sciences Utrecht (NL); 33 St. Marienhospital - Vechta, Geriatric Clinic Vechta (DE); r. a. ossewaarde@rug. nl Introduction Individuals with dementia often experience {{a decline in}} their ability to use language. Language problems have been reported in individuals with dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease or degeneration of the fronto-temporal area. Acoustic properties are relatively easy to measure with software, which promises a cost-effective way to analyze larger discourses. We study the usefulness of acoustic features to distinguish the speech of German-speaking controls and patients with dementia caused by (a) Alzheimer’s disease, (b) Parkinson’s disease or (c) PPA/FTD. Previous studies have shown that each of these types affects speech parameters such as prosody, voice quality and fluency (Schulz 2002; Ma, Whitehill, and Cheung 2010; Rusz et al. 2016; Kato et al. 2013; Peintner et al. 2008). Prior work on the characteristics of the speech of individuals with dementia is usually based on samples from clinical tests, such as the Western Aphasia Battery or the Wechsler Logical Memory task. Spontaneous day-to-day speech may be different, because participants may show less of their vocal abilities in casual speech than in specifically designed test scenarios. It is unclear to what extent the previously reported speech characteristics are still detectable in casual conversations by software. The research question in this study is: how useful for classification are acoustic properties measured in spontaneous speech. MethodsParticipant recruitment and data The speech data used in this study was collected during a larger study of processing of verbs and nouns in speakers with different types of dementia, currently performed by one of the co-authors (FJ). Participant recruitment, data elicitation and manual CLAN-annotation were performed in the context of that study. Spontaneous speech fragments were elicited from German controls (n= 7) and patients with a clinical diagnosis of a form of dementia: (probable) Alzheimer’s disease (AD, n= 9), PPA (n= 3), bvFTD (n= 4), Parkinson’s disease (PD, n= 6), PD with MCI (n= 4), PD with dementia (n= 3). In this study, only data on controls and participants diagnosed with PPA, AD or PD are reported. For each participant, discourses on three different topics (past, present, future) were elicited. Because the ultimate goal of the larger study is to track the long-time decline of the linguistic system in non-controls, the elicitation of the three topics was repeated three times with non-controls, with about 6 months between each elicitation session. Narrative sampling The interviewer asked participants in separate sessions to speak of childhood memories (topic: past), of a typical day in the present (topic: present), and of plans that they might have for the next week, month or year (topic: future). Elicitation was done in the participant’s own environment. This affects recording quality: background noises are present in the signal, such as children playing, telephones ringing and papers being shuffled. Segments of the interviewer giving instructions or asking questions were removed, but only if they are of significant length and truly interrupt the flow of the discourse of the participant. This was judged by the researcher (RO). The resulting discourses (μ= 6 m 47 s; σ= 3 m 30 s) are of sufficient length that minor utterances by the interviewer to move the discourse along (hmm-hmm, oh yeah, etc.) do not significantly impact the data analysis of the speaker’s voice characteristics. Acoustic feature extraction Audio recordings were analyzed for voice activity using an unsupervised learning <b>framework</b> (<b>Ying</b> et al. 2011), and for pitch using an automatic pitch extraction algorithm implemented in REAPER[1]. Results of the analyses were stored in a database and then read in by R-scripts for further statistical analysis. Reaper’s output (in Hz) was translated to pitch interval (in cents, P 0) as proposed by Matteson, Olness, & Caplow (2013). The following variables were used for analysis: FluencyPause lengthPause frequencyPhonationDuration of speechVoice qualityJitterShimmerProsodyPitch levelmean, median, maximum and minimum P 0 Pitch rangeSDFour standard deviations around the mean (SD 4) Max-min P 0 The difference between the 95 th and the 5 th percentile (HDI, 90 % span) The difference between the 16 th and the 84 th percentile (HDI 68 % span) Skewness and kurtosis Machine learning We trained a generalized linear multilevel model using R and Stan (McElreath, 2016; R Core Team, 2017) and evaluated its performance. Evaluation was conducted using five-fold cross-validation over the set of fragments. In each of the five folds, the parameters of the model were first learned in a training phase using 80 % of the data, and then applied to the held-out data to predict the participant’s diagnosis. This procedure is repeated for each of the five folds, with accuracy being the average performance on the test data across all folds. Results Results are compared to a baseline (“Zero Rule”) strategy that always predicts the majority class. The classifier is considered informative if it performs better than the baseline strategy. Machine learning results suggest that the proposed model is superior to the baseline standard of predicting the majority class, measured as the area under curve (AUROC), cf. figure 1. Individual univariate Wilcoxon rank sum tests, adapted with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995), show that SD patients have significantly shorter pauses than controls, and PD patients have significantly lower values for voice quality parameters than controls. Discussion Post-hoc analyses show that most influence in the model comes from fluency and voice quality variables, while prosody variables contribute the least. Monopitch has frequently been associated with dementia speech, but the role of pitch is very limited in the model for this convenience sample. A possible explanation is that casual spontaneous speech invites less pitch variation, both in controls and in patients. [1] David Talkin, [URL]...|$|R
40|$|ESP] Esta tesis {{doctoral}} se presenta bajo la modalidad de compendio de publicaciones. Está formada por un total de cuatro artículos publicados en revistas del segundo cuartil del Journal Citation Reports. El artículo “A systematic {{literature review}} of the Teleo-Reactive paradigm” ofrece una completa revisión sistemática de la literatura existente sobre el paradigma Teleo-Reactivo desde su presentación por el profesor Nils Nilsson en el año 1994. Su papel en esta tesis es el de servir de estado del arte de dicho paradigma, ofreciendo una buena perspectiva de la evolución de los sistemas Teleo-Reactivos desde su formulación hasta el presente. Para poder desarrollar sistemas Teleo-Reactivos a partir de objetivos, surgió la necesidad de especificar los requisitos de estos sistemas usando el lenguaje más apropiado. Ese es uno de los objetivos principales del artículo “A controlled experiment to evaluate the understandability of KAOS and i* for modeling Teleo-Reactive systems”. Como resultado de dicho trabajo se decidió utilizar i* dado que el experimento realizado mostró que las especificaciones realizadas con dicho lenguaje resultaban ligeramente más comprensibles que las realizadas con KAOS. Aunque i* resultaba más comprensible a la hora de especificar requisitos para sistemas Teleo-Reactivos, también presentaba ciertas debilidades. Estas debilidades han sido descritas detalladamente en el artículo “A family of experiments to evaluate the understandability of TRiStar and i* for modeling Teleo-Reactive systems”, en el que además se propone una extensión al lenguaje que permite superarlas. La extensión propuesta se denomina TRiStar y fue inicialmente presentada en [Morales 15]. TRiStar ha demostrado superar los problemas de comprensibilidad identificados en i* en el modelado de sistemas Teleo-Reactivos mediante una familia de experimentos realizada con estudiantes de últimos cursos de grado y con desarrolladores software experimentados, cuyos resultados se exponen exhaustivamente en el artículo mencionado. En él se describe, además, un mecanismo que permite obtener mediante transformación de modelos el programa Teleo-Reactivo equivalente a un diagrama TRiStar dado. TRiStar permite, por lo tanto, partiendo de los objetivos de un sistema Teleo-Reactivo obtener un diagrama que especifique su comportamiento. Ese diagrama puede ser transformado en un programa Teleo-Reactivo equivalente. Y siguiendo las transformaciones descritas en “From Teleo-Reactive specifications to architectural components: a model-driven approach” se puede obtener a partir del programa Teleo-Reactivo el modelo de componentes y la máquina de estados que describe el comportamiento de cada uno de esos componentes. Con estos elementos <b>y</b> usando un <b>framework</b> como el descrito en [Iborra 09] se cerraría el proceso de desarrollo del sistema Teleo-Reactivo. Como resultado de las investigaciones realizadas en el transcurso de esta tesis, y aunque no forma parte del compendio, hay un quinto artículo [Sánchez 16] que está en segunda revisión en el Journal of Systems and Software en el que se estudian las posibilidades de introducir requisitos de tiempo real cuando se sigue el enfoque Teleo-Reactivo desde el modelado a la implementación de un sistema. Tras realizar un estudio del tipo de restricciones temporales que se pueden imponer desde el punto de vista Teleo-Reactivo, se considera la posibilidad de utilizar TeleoR [Clark 14] para incorporar dichas restricciones y se proponene una serie de extensiones a TRiStar para permitir representar requisitos temporales. Estas extensiones dan lugar a lo que hemos llamado TRiStar+. [ENG] This doctoral dissertation has been presented {{in the form of}} thesis by publication. It is comprised of four articles indexed in the second quartile of the Journal Citation Reports. The article “A systematic literature {{review of the}} Teleo-Reactive paradigm” offers a complete systematic review of the existing literature on the Teleo-Reactive paradigm since Prof. Nils Nilsson presented it in 1994. It plays the role of state of the art of that paradigm, showing a perspective of the evolution of Teleo-Reactive systems from their formulation to present time. In order to develop Teleo-Reactive systems starting from its goals, there is the need of specifying the requirements of these systems using the most adequate language. That {{is one of the main}} objectives of the article “A controlled experiment to evaluate the understandability of KAOS and i* for modeling Teleo-Reactive systems”. As a result, we decided to use i* because the experiment showed that i* specifications where slightly more understandable than those made using KAOS. Although i* was more understandable when specifying requirements for Teleo-Reactive systems, the experiment also showed some shortcomings. These shortcomings have been deeply described in the article “A family of experiments to evaluate the understandability of TRiStar and i* for modeling Teleo-Reactive systems”. In this article, an extension to i* is proposed in order to overcome the identified limitations. The proposed extension is named TRiStar and was initially presented at [Morales 15]. TRiStar has shown to be more understandable than i* when modeling Teleo-Reactive systems through a family of experiments done with last year students and experienced software developers, whose results are described in the aforementioned article. In that article, a mechanism to obtain a Teleo-Reactive program starting from a TRiStar diagram is also described. Therefore, TRiStar allows obtaining a diagram which specifies the behavior of a Teleo-Reactive system starting from its goals. That diagram can be transformed into an equivalent Teleo-Reactive program. Then, following the transformations described in “From Teleo-Reactive specifications to architectural components: a model-driven approach”, a component model and the state machine describing the behavior of each of those components can be obtained. With these elements and using a framework as that described in [Iborra 09], the development process of the Teleo-Reactive system would be finished. As a result of the research carried out during this dissertation there is another article, which is not comprised in the compilation, in second revision at the Journal of Systems and Software [Sánchez 16]. In that article, after making a study of the type of timing constraints from the TR perspective, we consider the possibility of using TeleoR [Clark 14] for incorporating such constraints. Some extensions on TRiStar notation are proposed to represent temporal requirements. Those extensions have been named TRiStar+.

40|$|To study {{aluminum}} {{species in}} dealuminated zeolites, {{a series of}} dealuminated zeolites <b>Y</b> with <b>framework</b> nSi/nAl ratios of 2. 8 to 6. 0 was prepared by steaming. The steaming of zeolite H,Na-Y was performed under water vapor pressures of 3. 4 to 81. 5 kPa and at a temperature of 748 K. As determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystallinity of zeolites was well preserved after the above-mentioned treatments. The hydrated materials were investigated by 29 Si MAS NMR, 27 Al MQMAS NMR, high-field 27 Al MAS NMR, and 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. Upon adsorption of ammonia on the steamed zeolites H,Na-Y, a reversible change of octahedrally coordinated to tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms was found. Quantitative 29 Si, 27 Al, and 1 H MAS NMR measurements indicated that this coordination change is accompanied by the formation of bridging OH groups (SiOHAl) in the dehydrated materials, while only a weak decrease {{in the amount of}} silanol (SiOH) groups and no systematic change of AlOH groups occurred. Based on these results, a model for the reversible coordination change of aluminum atoms in the framework of hydrothermally treated zeolites H-Y is proposed assuming local structures consisting of threefold-coordinated framework aluminum atoms with SiO- defect sites in their vicinity, which are coordinated to extra-framework aluminum species. After adsorption of ammonia at the threefold-coordinated framework aluminum atoms, the SiO- defect sites are healed to Si-O-Al- bridges leading to a transformation of the threefold-coordinated aluminum atoms to tetrahedrally coordinated atoms. Upon thermal decomposition of the ammonium ions formed at these Si-O-Al- bridges, SiOHAl groups occur. It is also found that framework and extra-framework aluminum species in zeolite Y were strongly influenced upon rehydration. Therefore, the investigations of these materials in non-hydrated state, i. e., without hydration after the dealumination, are required. To obtain dealuminated zeolites in non-hydrated state, these dealuminated materials were immediately filled into glass containers under dry nitrogen in an air-lock after steaming. By 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy, a strong high-field shift of the signals of Si(3 Al) and Si(2 Al) sites in the spectra of non-hydrated zeolites Y in comparison with those of the hydrated samples was observed. These high-field shifts of the Si(nAl) signals of 2 to 5 ppm occurring in the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of non-hydrated zeolites Y were discussed to be caused by i) a variation of the local structure of neighboring AlO 4 tetrahedra or ii) the presence of multivalent extra-framework aluminum cations. To clarify the reasons for these resonance shifts, zeolites Y with different H- and Al-exchange degrees were investigated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The experimental results indicate that the primary reason for the high-field shift of 29 Si MAS NMR signals of silicon atoms in non-hydrated state is the change of O-Al-O bond angles and Al-O bond lengths during the dehydration of AlO 4 tetrahedra in the framework. In contrast, the presence of extra-framework aluminum cations leads only to a strong broadening of the Si(nAl) signals, probably due to 29 Si- 27 Al couplings, and a weak high-field shift of ca. 1 ppm. With increasing water vapor pressure during the steaming of zeolite Y, a systematic decrease of the total amounts of framework aluminum atoms in the non-hydrated materials was found by 29 Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. The amounts of threefold coordinated framework aluminum atoms in non-hydrated zeolites Y were determined by the increase of the concentrations of bridging OH groups after an ammonia adsorption/desorption treatment and by application of 1 H MAS NMR spectroscopy. By a quantitative comparison of the amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms, responsible for the occurrence of negative framework charges, and the amounts of charge-compensating residual sodium cations and bridging hydroxyl protons, the mean cationic charge of extra-framework aluminum atoms was calculated. This means that the cationic charge per extra-framework aluminum atom was found to vary from ca. + 2 to ca. + 0. 5 for weakly and strongly dealuminated zeolites Y samples, respectively. Solid-state NMR characterization of zeolite catalysts in the hydrated state is often accompanied by an uncontrolled hydrolysis of the framework and a variation in the coordination of aluminum species. It is demonstrated that the limitations occurring for 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy of non-hydrated zeolites Y, such as strong decrease of resolution and significant line broadening, can be overcome by loading these materials with ammonia. In the 29 Si MAS NMR spectra of non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y, no dehydration-induced high-field shift of Si(nAl) signals (n = 3, 2, 1) occurs, which is generally responsible for the loss of resolution in the spectra of non-hydrated materials. The 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of the non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y consist exclusively of signals of the tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms with spectroscopic parameters similar to those of framework aluminum atoms in hydrated samples. The framework nSi/nAl ratios obtained by quantitative evaluation of both 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectra of the non-hydrated and ammonia-loaded zeolites Y agree well with each other. Beside adsorption of ammonia, the adsorption of other probe molecules, such as pyridine, acetone, and acetonitrile, was utilized to conquer the above-mentioned limitations occurring for 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy of non-hydrated zeolites Y. It is interestingly to note that the base strength of probe molecules is reflected by the variation of the second-order quadrupolar effect (SOQE) value of the framework aluminum atoms in the non-hydrated zeolites. The occurrence of a proton transfer from the catalyst to the probe molecules is necessary to detect the framework aluminum by 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy in moderate magnetic fields (ca. 9. 4 T). It is demonstrated that a proton affinity (PA) of the adsorbate molecules of ca. 850 kJ/mol is required to induce a proton transfer from the zeolite framework to the adsorbate compounds. In addition, other effects could influence the observation of framework aluminum by 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, such as, the size of probe molecules. The quantitative evaluation shows that the adsorption capacity of pyridine is hindering the detection of all framework aluminum atoms by both 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR spectroscopy in moderate magnetic fields. 27 Al spin-echo, high-speed MAS (nrot = 30 kHz), and MQMAS NMR spectroscopy in magnetic fields of B 0 = 9. 4, 14. 1, and 17. 6 T were applied for the study of aluminum species at extra-framework positions in non-hydrated zeolites Y. Non-hydrated g-Al 2 O 3, aluminum-exchanged zeolite Y (Al,Na-Y) and parent zeolite H,Na-Y were utilized as reference materials. The solid-state 27 Al NMR spectra of steamed zeolite deH,Na-Y/ 81. 5 were found to consist of four signals. The broad low-field signal is caused by a superposition of the signals of tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum atoms in the vicinity of bridging hydroxyl protons and framework aluminum atoms compensated in their negative charge by aluminium cations (diso = 70 ± 10 ppm, CQCC = 15. 0 ± 1. 0 MHz). The second signal is due to a superposition of the signals of framework aluminum atoms compensated by sodium cations and tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms in neutral extra-framework aluminum oxide clusters (diso = 65 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 8. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz). The residual two signals were attributed to aluminum cations (diso = 35 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 7. 5 ± 0. 5 MHz) and octahedrally coordinated aluminum atoms in neutral extra-framework aluminum oxide clusters (diso = 10 ± 5 ppm, CQCC = 5. 0 ± 0. 5 MHz). By chemical analysis and evaluating the relative solid-state 27 Al NMR intensities of the different signals of aluminum species occurring in non-hydrated zeolite deH,Na-Y/ 81. 5, the aluminum distribution in this material could be determined. Die Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie ist eine sehr empfindliche Methode für die Untersuchung der lokalen Struktur von kristallinen Alumosilicaten, wie z. B. von mikroporösen Zeolithen, die sowohl in der heterogenen Katalyse, als auch und in Adsorptionsprozessen breite Anwendungen finden. Daher wird die Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie der atomaren Bausteine der Zeolithe, wie z. B. von 1 H, 23 Na, 29 Si, 27 Al und 17 O, häufig für die Charakterisierung des Gerüstes und der Oberflächenzentren dieser Materialien verwendet [1 - 8]. Außerdem können durch Festkörper-NMR-Spektroskopie, neben der chemischen Natur von Adsorbaten, auch Wechselwirkungen dieser Moleküle mit Gerüstatomen und aktiven Zentren aufgeklärt werden [9 - 11]. Aluminiumatome in dealuminierten Zeolithen können in verschiedenen chemischen Umgebungen vorliegen, u. a. als tetraedrisch koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome, als verzerrt tetraedrisch koordiniertes Gerüst- oder Extragerüstaluminium, als fünffach koordinierte Extragerüstaluminiumspezies und als oktaedrisch koordinierte Aluminiumatome außerhalb des Gerüstes oder als flexibel koordinierte Gerüstaluminiumatome an Defektstellen. Bis jetzt wurden die meisten Festkörper-NMR-Untersuchungen von Zeolithen an hydratisierten Proben durchgeführt [11 - 16]. Die Charakterisierung fester Katalysatoren in einem Zustand, der mit ihrer Anwendung in katalytischen Prozessen vergleichbar ist, erfordert jedoch die Untersuchung calcinierter und nicht hydratisierter Materialien. 27 Al-Spin-Echo-NMR-Untersuchungen an dehydratisierten Zeolithen mit FAU- und MFI-Struktur lieferten Quadrupolkopplungskonstanten CQCC der Gerüstaluminiumatome von bis zu 16 MHz [1]. Diese hohen CQCC-Werte resultieren aus einer Abnahme der lokalen Symmetrie der AlO 4 -Tetraeder aufgrund unterschiedlicher A-O-Bindungsabstände. Bei mittleren magnetischen Feldstärken, z. B.|$|R
