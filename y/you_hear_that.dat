25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that?</b> I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

It's {{got a lot of}} {{ingredients}} to it because I never thought that Mariah could make a bouncy type of record. When <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> song — the whole bounce of the record and the way she's flipping it and the stuff she talking about ... I knew that record was gonna go just because you never heard Mariah talk about this stuff. ... She's like, 'I packed up my Louis Vuitton.' She took it really on the ghetto side. I knew that was gonna strike people. Either it was gonna hit them in a wrong way or they was gonna love it.|$|E
500|$|Dilling visited Germany in 1931 and, {{when she}} {{returned}} in 1938, noted a [...] "great improvement of conditions". [...] She attended Nazi Party meetings, and the German government paid her expenses. She wrote that [...] "The German people under Hitler are contented and happy.... don't believe the stories <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> this man has not done a great good for this country." [...] In 1938, she toured Palestine, where she filmed what she described as Jewish immigrants ruining the country. While touring Spain, then embroiled in the Spanish Civil War, she filmed [...] "Red torture chambers" [...] and burnt-out churches, [...] "ruined by the Reds with the same satanic Jewish glee shown in Russia." [...] She visited Japan, which she viewed as the only Christian nation in Asia, and in 1939, she returned to visit Spain, for a second time.|$|E

Rihanna spent {{the week of the}} 2007 Grammy Awards working with American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, who gave her vocal lessons. They wrote and sang [...] "Hate That I Love You", which was co-written and produced by Norwegian duo StarGate. Ne-Yo told Vibe magazine, [...] "The best way to express an emotion like love is through storytelling. It makes it more 'I can relate to this character in this song, because I've been through something similar.' <b>You</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> kind of storytelling in the song that I wrote for Rihanna called 'Hate That I Love You'." ...|$|E
500|$|Dose {{magazine}} {{wrote that}} Furtado's new [...] "highly sexualized" [...] image was manufactured, and noted the {{involvement in the}} album's development of Geffen's Jimmy Iovine, who helped to develop the Pussycat Dolls, a girl group known for their sexually suggestive dance routines. The writer also criticised Furtado's discussion of her buttocks and apparent rejection of feminism in a Blender magazine interview, writing: [...] "Girls, do <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> churning? Those are the ideas of Gloria Steinem turning in their grave." [...] A writer for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation said that cynics could attribute Furtado's commercial success with Loose to her [...] "amped-up sex appeal." [...] The writer added that, the failure of Janet Jackson's album Damita Jo (2004) indicated such a move was not infallible. Furtado was [...] "still demure compared to many of her competitors"—she avoided sporting lingerie or performing [...] "Christina Aguilera-style gyrations or calisthenics" [...] in the [...] "Promiscuous" [...] and [...] "Maneater" [...] videos. [...] "Despite its dramatic arrival ... Furtado's new image doesn’t feel calculated", he said. [...] " [...] seems to be thinking less and feeling more, {{to the benefit of}} her music." ...|$|E
500|$|Tina fell in {{love for}} the first time with a boy named Harry. She spoke about this {{relationship}} in her 1986 interview with Rolling Stone. [...] "It was a basketball game – the school Harry attended was playing my school. I was just graduating from junior high. Well, I looked across the gym and saw Harry, and I {{fell in love}}. My heart was beating so fast. I'm a very bold person, so I ran down to the coach and said, 'Who is number 9?' I just had to have that guy. And he said, 'His name is Harry.' And then he told Harry that I had asked who he was. And Harry looked up at me, and I'll never forget it; it was love at first sight." [...] She recalls he was a playboy,"Harry was real popular and had tons of girlfriends, but eventually I got him, and we went steady for a year." [...] The reason for their break-up she says, [...] "Harry and I broke up because he started playing around. He started dating a girl named Theresa, and by the time he and I got back together, she had become pregnant. He felt he should marry her. I wish he had told me his decision himself, but he didn't. One morning I got on the bus to school, and my friend said, 'Did <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Theresa and Harry got married?' I had to go a full day without crying. At the end of the day, I cried it all out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ianulea's {{only option}} is to flee Bucharest in a haste and escape his creditors. As he rides past Cuțitul de Argint Church, he notices that he is being pursued by armed guards, sent by the Bucharest Aga to lock him into a debtors' prison. He {{abandons}} his horse and runs up a hill and into a vineyard, pleading with the keeper to provide him with shelter. The latter, who presents himself as Negoiță, reluctantly accepts to do so when Ianulea assures him that his pursuers are not boyars. In exchange for his help, Ianulea lets him on his secret identity, and promises to reward him. He explains: [...] "Whenever <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> the devil's got into a woman, a wife, or a girl, whatever, {{no matter the place}} where they live and no matter what station in life they have, you should know it's about me that they're talking.

2500|$|Wilson, {{commanding}} the cavalry corps of the Military Division of the Mississippi, launched a raid in late March into central Alabama with orders {{to destroy the}} remaining Confederate industry in the region, especially at Elyton (present-day Birmingham) and Selma. The only force remaining to resist Wilson was Nathan B. Forrest's cavalry force. Elyton fell to Union forces on March 29, before Forrest had time to concentrate his troops. A detachment led by Brig. General John T. Croxton destroyed the area's factories and on April 4 burned down the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Selma was captured on April 2 following a battle, which was Forrest's final battle and defeat. After destroying Selma's factories and railroads, Wilson continued eastward towards Georgia. He had to capture the bridge across the Chattahoochee River at Columbus, Georgia, with a battle, then he continued on to Macon; here on April 21, he received word from Sherman to [...] "desist from further acts of war and devastation until <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> hostilities are renewed".|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Doesn't Really Matter", Jackson {{speaks of}} looking past {{physical}} appearance, choosing {{to love the}} person inside. Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about all the other things that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when <b>you</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E
