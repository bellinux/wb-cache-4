When you heard it, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to say 'Ouch!'" [...] Hutchins played the sound effects for series creator Hillenburg for review. [...] Hillenburg rejected it, saying [...] "it was too far over the edge." [...] Hutchins said, [...] "a lot of effort for something that lasts only 15 seconds on screen. In this case, the whole thing never made it on the air." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hall of Fame player Larry Bird, who is white, {{stated in}} 2004 {{that the league}} needed more white players since the league's fans are mostly white.

2500|$|According to Chris Thomas, who was present, the 9 September {{session was}} {{especially}} spirited: [...] "While Paul {{was doing his}} vocal, George Harrison had set fire to an ashtray and was running around the studio with it above his head, doing an Arthur Brown." [...] Starr's recollection is less detailed, but agrees in spirit: [...] "'Helter Skelter' was a track we did in total madness and hysterics in the studio.

2500|$|According to Iggy Pop, Bowie's celebrated riff on [...] "Lust for Life" [...] was {{inspired}} by the morse code opening to the American Forces Network News in Berlin. At various points in the song the melody is doubled by the entire band; in Carlos Alomar's words, [...] "You can't play a counter-rhythm to that, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to follow". Joy Division and New Order drummer Stephen Morris declared, [...] "On Lust for Life the drums sound not huge but massive! The loudest cymbals known to man, that riff! I wanted to sound like that, still do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{record was}} {{originally}} announced to be titled Heidi Montag, later Independent, and eventually The One. In 2009, Montag {{stated that the}} record would be titled Superficial, commenting that [...] "that's the world [...] in and how people think [...] but it's really just the surface". Its intended cover was shot by Liz Ciganovich, who commented that it was inspired by Montag's earlier music video for her song [...] "Overdosin'" [...] and [...] "Physical" [...] by Olivia Newton-John. It depicted Montag dressed in a strapless, polka-dotted leotard {{in front of a}} wall of cassettes, which she described as a [...] "shout out to the '80s" [...] and [...] "makes you remember when <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to run out to the record store and get your favorite album". However, the official cover was later revealed to be an image of Montag in a short black dress posing in front of a large camera lens.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{initially}} hesitant, Abrams {{warmed to}} the idea {{on the condition that}} the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof created the series' style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four-to-five-season run for the show. The novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by Babylon 5. Because ABC felt that Alias was too serialized, Lindelof and Abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self-contained: [...] "We promise ... that [...] requires NO knowledge of the episode(s) that preceded it ... there is no 'Ultimate Mystery' which requires solving." [...] While such statements contradicted their true plans, the ruse succeeded in persuading ABC to purchase the show. The game Myst, also set in a tropical island, was noted as an influence by Lindelof, as in its narrative, [...] "No one told you what the rules were. <b>You</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to walk around and explore these environments and gradually a story was told." ...|$|E

When you couldn't stand bein' lonely night after night, when you went out on the streets and saw everybody {{on the way to a}} good time but you? We used to look in the newspapers for notices of the big balls, and we'd take the cars to the West End and stand outside the awnings watching the carriages driving up and the people coming in. And the same with the weddings. We got to know a good many of the swells by sight. There was Mrs. Larrabbee,"--a certain awe crept into her voice--"and Miss Ferguson--she's sweet--and a lot more. Some of the girls used to copy their clothes and hats, but Florry and me tried to live honest. It was funny," [...] she added irrelevantly, [...] "but the more worn out we were at night, the more we'd want a little excitement, and we used to go to the dance-halls and keep going until we were ready to drop." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} him at present that the {{fruitful}} time was not far off; it had been brought appreciably nearer by that fortunate evening at Miss Birdseye's. If Mrs. Farrinder could be induced to write an [...] "open letter" [...] about Verena, that would do more than anything else. Selah was not remarkable for delicacy of perception, but he knew the world he lived in well enough {{to be aware that}} Mrs. Farrinder was liable to rear up, as they used to say down in Pennsylvania, where he lived before he began to peddle lead-pencils. She wouldn't always take things as you might expect, and if it didn't meet her views to pay a public tribute to Verena, there wasn't any way known to Tarrant's ingenious mind of getting round her. If {{it was a question of}} a favour from Mrs. Farrinder, <b>you</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to wait for it, as you would for a rise in the thermometer. He had told Miss Birdseye what he would like, and she seemed to think, from the way their celebrated friend had been affected, that the idea might take her some day of just letting the public know all she had felt. She was off somewhere now (since that evening), but Miss Birdseye had an idea that when she was back in Roxbury she would send for Verena and give her a few points. Meanwhile, at any rate, Selah was sure he had a card; he felt there was money in the air. It might already be said there were receipts from Charles Street; that rich, peculiar young woman seemed to want to lavish herself. He pretended, as I have intimated, not to notice this; but he never saw so much as when he had his eyes fixed on the cornice. He had no doubt that if he should make up his mind to take a hall some night, she would tell him where the bill might be sent. That was what he was thinking of now, whether he had better take a hall right away, so that Verena might leap at a bound into renown, or wait till she had made a few more appearances in private, so that curiosity might be worked up.|$|E
