And it's also done in what now is becoming my aesthetic, which is, you know, it's part pop, part performance art, part fashion installation—so {{all of those}} things are present... It's a story, it's me battling all my monsters along the way. I'm playing all the music from The Fame, all the music from The Fame Monster. And the stage that I designed with the Haus [...] is a giant cube that sits. Imagine you were to hollow out a TV and just break the fourth wall on a TV screen. It forces <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the center of the TV. It's my way of saying, 'My music is art.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for {{me to look at}} you and <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with}} C-SPAN in 1987 Cockburn was questioned by a caller on this statement and he explained that [...] "it {{was a part of}} a satirical piece which was tasteless." [...] He went on to say [...] "I would ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> some of the Mujahideen and how they treat women. They have virtual slavery of women. They are in favour of the bride price. And I {{think a lot of people}} don't have a slightest of idea of social conditions in Afghanistan." [...] When asked about the same article on Afghanistan in 1995, Cockburn stated [...] "I shouldn't have ...|$|E

"Thou art no {{judge of}} a vessel's beauty, Annina," [...] said the gondolier to his companion, who was deeply {{housed in the}} {{pavilion}} of the boat, [...] "else should I tell <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this stranger from Candia.

6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand towards the {{squatting}} negroes. [...] "Señores," [...] he said turning to the officers, [...] "I would ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, and tell me if the thing appears reasonable." ...|$|E

6000|$|WHAT Doctor Johnson called [...] "the {{insolence}} of wealth" [...] appears {{far more}} frequently in the houses of the rich than in the manners of the rich. The reason is plain enough. Personal ostentation is, in {{the very nature of}} it, ridiculous. But the ostentation which exhibits magnificent pictures, priceless china, and splendid furniture, can purchase good taste to guide it, and can assert itself without affording the smallest opening for a word of depreciation, or a look of contempt. If I am worth a million of money, and if I am dying to show it, I don't ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me--I ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my house.|$|E

60|$|I {{must take}} care, however, in {{neither of these}} last two particulars, to do {{injustice}} to our little English friend here; and before we come to his feathers, must ask <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his bill and his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Philip. [...] "They're {{not like}} any other eyes. They seem trying to speak,--trying to speak kindly. I don't like other {{people to look at}} me much, but I like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, Maggie." ...|$|E
