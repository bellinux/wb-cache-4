50|$|The Wilson <b>Yarn</b> <b>Clearer</b> is <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer,</b> i.e., {{a device}} to remove faults from yarn.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1958, Thomas Holt {{showed the}} Wilson <b>Yarn</b> <b>Clearer</b> at the International Textile Exhibition in Belle Vue, Manchester as the “Yarnspec”, which was {{believed}} to be the World’s first commercially viable <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s [...] Peter Wilson, a young {{physicist}} working at William Hollins Pleasley Vale yarn production factory, {{became interested in}} the <b>yarn</b> <b>clearing</b> process.|$|R
5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of many slubs in the yarn {{was well known}} to the weavers in the Hollins factory in Glasgow for they knew that much labor had to be spent after the weaving on “burling and mending” of the fabric in order to remove as many faults as possible. But in the spinning mill at Pleasley Vale <b>yarn</b> <b>clearing</b> was regarded as an undesirable and costly process. [...] The yarn production people in Pleasley believed that their slub catchers were effective - {{it was obvious to}} them that a slub up to an eighth in diameter could not pass through a slot only 10 thousandths of an inch wide. They never saw the evidence of their erroneous belief since they did not see the woven fabric with the many slubs that had passed through their yarn cleaners.|$|R
2500|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, in Europe and the United States, groups of {{localised}} professional hand knitters specialised {{in a few}} well-known patterns in which keeping a tally of rows was barely necessary, since the pattern and expected size of the work were known by heart. From the early 19th century, when printed patterns were introduced for the recreational knitter, and until the early 20th century, woollen <b>yarn</b> had <b>clear</b> stitch definition so that rows were easily seen and counted, and a mental tally could be kept. However knitters could tally by moving objects from one pocket to another, or bracelets from one wrist to the other. For lace knitting and complicated increases, a knitter could write five-bar gate tally marks around the margins of a printed pattern.|$|R
5000|$|An {{electronic}} <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> became feasible when {{a suitable}} photocell {{was found at}} the Instrumentation, Electronics and Automation Exhibition in Olympia on the Standard Telephones & Cables stand. This germanium photocell was only 3 mm in diameter and some 10 mm long and operated on low voltage. Its cost was about £1.50, which {{made it possible to}} design a <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> capable of manufacture within budget and using the signal from the photocell to operate a yarn cutter whenever a small fault was detected in the yarn passing the photocell. Peter Wilson decided to use a cold cathode trigger tube produced by Ericsson Telephones to operate the cutter using a modified electromagnetic relay.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were two}} {{problems}} for Wilson to overcome. Firstly, {{to convince the}} people who mattered {{that the development of}} an effective <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> could be justified on costs and second that an effective clearer could be designed for production at an economic price.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> is {{a device}} to remove faults (thick places, thin places, foreign matter) from the yarn. Yarn {{clearing}} improves {{the quality of the}} spun yarn and hence of the cloth made of it. Clear, uniform yarn is especially important for smooth operation of high-speed textile machinery.|$|E
5000|$|Thomas Holt and Co, a Rochdale cone winding engine maker, {{agreed to}} promote the Wilson <b>Yarn</b> <b>Clearer</b> commercially and a {{production}} prototype was made and taken to Erricson Telephone Ltd (ETL) who agreed manufacture the device. Their unit price of £13 for an initial run of 2000 was achieved by using printed circuitry that was then in its infancy and initial order was placed for 2000 units.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Wilson {{realized}} that {{the true cost of}} the defective yarn clearing which was currently being practiced warranted the development of a better <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> even if it cost as much as £5. The factory management, used to spending only a shilling or two on their yarn clearers held up their hands in horror at the thought of such an expense. There was some justification from their own narrow cost standpoint, but on an overall company view it was good business.|$|E
5000|$|Yarn {{clearing}} {{is usually}} {{part of the}} yarn winding step. The yarn {{from a number of}} spinning bobbins, called 'cops', is wound on to larger packages called 'cones' for subsequent processing into fabric. During the winding the yarn was traditionally passed through the narrow slit in a steel plate of a <b>yarn</b> <b>clearer</b> or slub-catcher. The object was to catch thick places, or slubs, which occurred when the spinning process suffered an aberration, and to prevent them being woven into the fabric to present unsightly faults.|$|E
