500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Fight Club" [...] {{was largely}} negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "D–"; {{he called it}} [...] "dire stuff" [...] and wrote that [...] "there’s something rancid about forced quirk; it’s rotten and smug". Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that somewhere out in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>The</b> X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a safe bet this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name. But then the current state of The X-Files makes Elmo in Grouchland look like an Oscar contender." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrea Towers of Entertainment Weekly {{gave it a}} good review: [...] "And if {{you thought}} we were done with surprises to set up next season, {{let me assure you}} we’re just getting started. Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have let me out to play.” And this is a war now. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E

6000|$|Why, {{what have}} <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> of {{yourself}}? Is it <b>you</b> then that <b>thought</b> yourself less? Is it <b>you</b> that <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> President greater than you? Or the rich {{better off than}} you? or the educated wiser than you? ...|$|R
6000|$|You added, you'll recall, {{that though}} [...] You were {{surprised}} and pained, <b>You</b> <b>thought,</b> upon <b>the</b> whole, you'd go, [...] And in that mind remained.|$|R
2500|$|Why? Why did I {{leave you}} many years ago? ... <b>You</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>the</b> boy seeks something, seeks such a special subtlety, that color {{descending}} like stars {{from the sky}} and landing, bright and transparent, like snow on our roofs. Where did he get it? How would it come to a boy like him? I don't know why he couldn't find it with us, in the city—in his homeland. Maybe the boy is [...] "crazy", but [...] "crazy" [...] {{for the sake of}} art. ...You thought: [...] "I can see, I am etched in the boy's heart, but he is still 'flying,' he is still striving to take off, he has 'wind' in his head." ... I did not live with you, but I didn't have one single painting that didn't breathe with your spirit and reflection.|$|E
6000|$|Hulton pondered, {{knitting}} his brows, {{before he}} said, [...] "Since <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> man was Jordan, you wouldn't know him again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Godwin, our ill-luck is {{that you}} love her also, and that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> same {{thoughts}} which I did yonder on the quay-head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{must be some}} miscalculation,' said Lord Martindale. 'There is not {{the least}} {{occasion}} {{for her to be}} straitened. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> yourself <b>the</b> allowance was ample.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> {{massacre}} {{which will}} ensue? You will have left, Adair will have left. Incidentally, I shall have left. Wrykyn will swamp them." ...|$|R
6000|$|Muriel smiled. [...] "Perhaps not. Well, I imagine it's lucky Charnock {{released}} her; Helen is {{much too}} good for him. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> took <b>the</b> proper line in laying all the stress you could upon the hardships?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do you {{account for}} it? It was an {{illusion}}, of course. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> illusion only ocular--it {{extended to the}} sense of touch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it prudent?" [...] {{she asked}} hesitatingly. [...] "If I remember, <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> work would {{cost too much}} when {{we talked about it}} last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve got to {{look after}} my ship and my men," [...] said the skipper. [...] "I suppose <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> ship would steer itself, didn’t you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he suggested, [...] "after <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> matter over, {{something}} {{may occur}} to you. Can I trouble {{you for your}} address?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{again to}} me this evening, when <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> matter over. I shall then be glad to hear any {{suggestion}} you may like to make." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a better way certainly, Campbell; I see that <b>you</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> matter over thoroughly. Of course, you will take no arms with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all very}} well saying that; but you wouldn't be {{moderate}} if Noningsby were on fire, or if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> judge was going to die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Ermine, [...] "it {{will be a}} great {{pleasure}} to poor Julia to be allowed to take us up again, and <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> doctor sufficiently convinced." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{might have}} been guessed that Sherringham resented his damned freedom, yet could but emulate his easy form. [...] "You'd be magnanimous if <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> young lady you've {{introduced}} to our old friend would be important." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you, Sir: {{the work}} was anonymous, until you saw fit to inscribe my name as its author. Ludlow! Ludlow! how meanly have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>the</b> woman <b>you</b> profess to love!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do it?" [...] Ruth's eyes sought her cousin's white, excited {{face in the}} quasi-darkness. [...] "But have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> of what it will mean?

6000|$|At {{last one}} day Mr. Starbrow {{went back to}} the old subject. [...] "Mary, my girl," [...] he said, [...] "have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> over <b>the</b> advice I gave you about this white child of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, and it {{has ever}} been {{recorded}} as a sound exposition. I see we shall make something of you even before you wear spectacles, notwithstanding <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> traces of this beautiful camp indistinct when you first observed them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear child, party {{spirit is}} {{another word for}} vitality. So <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> church we sighed for had made the place all we sighed to see it, and {{ourselves}} too. Oh! Fanny {{is this what you}} have been across the world for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{remember}} you {{said last night}} that <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> world a very stupid, grown-up place, {{because there were no}} giants and fairies in it now? Well, perhaps there are fairies, {{and they are going to}} show themselves to you, if you watch well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, of {{anything}} you want to be acquitted of! What crime would you prefer? There are whole deluges of mercy for you. But now go on, and tell me everything <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> about <b>the</b> play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want them}} to notice me, Philip," [...] she murmured. [...] "I {{want you to look}} just for a moment as though <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> me <b>the</b> only person in the world--as you did once, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's mere speciousness. Before {{you knew}} {{anything}} of me, and while <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were <b>the</b> child of poverty on both sides, you were well enough; {{but ever since}} <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were more than that, you have led a life which is intolerable. What has become of your plan of alliance between the De Stancys and the Powers now? The man is gone upstairs who can overthrow it all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, I remember," [...] replied Amy with {{a gentle}} smile; [...] "it was a charming gallop. I wished to {{continue}} it, but <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> ground {{would be too much}} for me, though I have gone over it twice since then in perfect safety. You are far too timid, papa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I don't {{know what}} else you can do,--unless you send the Dean and Chapter to talk her over. She's a pig-headed, foolish young woman;--but I can't help that. The truth is, you didn't make enough of her at first, Mr. Gibson. <b>You</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> plum would tumble into your mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have not I eyes, {{though some}} folk have not? Could not I {{look out at}} a chink on a fine summer morning, when <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>the</b> {{children}} asleep? Could not I climb up to your precious cave as well as yourself; and hear the iron clink under the stone. Ha, ha! and you and Patience thought no one knew but yourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> {{of telling}} <b>the</b> police about your journey to British Columbia {{and what you}} learned about Cyril Jernyngham?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> it. <b>The</b> {{staleness}} <b>you</b> noticed {{is due to}} our men {{being so}} largely educated by old women--old maids. Practically till he goes to College, and not always then, a boy can't get away from them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You thought, Muscari, I was {{the failure}} among our schoolfellows," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were <b>the</b> success. But I have succeeded {{more than you}} and fill a bigger place in history. I have been acting epics while you have been writing them." ...|$|R
