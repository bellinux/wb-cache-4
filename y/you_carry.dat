The treks takes you to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the popular trekking routes in the area includes Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako.

Please note that <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> all the necessary things before you head out for a trekking tour to Spiti. Tents, sleeping bags, cooking equipment, heavy wooolens, sunscreen and sunglasses are a must.|$|E

500|$|Equally {{proficient}} {{as both a}} blocker and runner, Johnson {{was described}} as [...] "the perfect NFL fullback". A talented runner, he ran with power {{both inside and outside}} the tackles, and he was as fast as McElhenny and Perry. Jim Brown called Johnson the greatest running back he had ever seen. He was also a very skilled safety and linebacker on defense. During a preseason game in 1955, Johnson hit Chicago Cardinals halfback Charley Trippi so hard that he fractured Trippi's face in multiple places, leaving him with a smashed nose and concussion and all but ended his career. [...] "Football was like a combat zone," [...] said Johnson. [...] "I was always told that <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> the impact to the opponent. If you wait for it, the impact will be on you." ...|$|E

500|$|Witherspoon owned a {{production}} company called Type A Films, which the media believed was a moniker honoring her childhood nickname [...] "Little Miss Type A." [...] However, {{when asked about}} the company by Interview magazine, she clarified the name's origin: [...] "...people think I named it after myself... It was actually an in-joke with my family because at [...] 7 I understood complicated medical terms, such as the difference between type A and type B personalities. But I just wished I'd named the company Dogfood Films or Fork or something. <b>You</b> <b>carry</b> that baggage all your life." [...] In March 2012, Witherspoon merged Type A Films with producer Bruna Papandrea's Make Movies banner to create a new production company entitled Pacific Standard. In 2016, Witherspoon and Papandrea split up, with Witherspoon gaining full control over the company.|$|E
500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool of yourself and people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> people with you." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for {{a way out of this}} confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E

[...] In his {{interpretation}} of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained [...] "Gil sings of 'looking {{for a way out}}' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he’s too far away from home, there is no way out—instead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar." [...] Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the [...] "river" [...] to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently says [...] "Africa".|$|E
2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to you at all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E
2500|$|French {{at first}} {{reported}} to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their [...] "last card" [...] and the BEF were holding them off. [...] He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps [...] "might go during the night", {{although he did}} send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French [...] "believed what he wished to believe" [...] and [...] "never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp". [...] He thought [...] "everything was going splendidly" [...] and [...] "the Germans were exhausted" [...] until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting [...] "How {{do you expect me}} to carry out my campaign if <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> on bringing up these blasted divisions?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2012, Ellis {{auditioned for}} the debut series of The Voice UK, a reality {{television}} singing competition. The show saw Ellis giving a blind audition {{in front of}} its four coaches. She sang [...] "Son of a Preacher Man" [...] but it failed to progress her further after none of the coaches turned round to select her {{to be in their}} groups. Her audition aired on BBC One in March; the panel reacted with positive feedback. Tom Jones consoled her: [...] "You seem like you've already made it," [...] referring to her theatrical career, while Danny O'Donoghue stated, [...] "I thought you did a really phenomenal job, I really did. I can't fault that, all I can fault is myself for not turning around. I am looking for a specific type of girl singer and you're not it but you will be for 99% of the UK I am sure." [...] Her name later trended on social networking site Twitter. Ellis affirmed that it was a big risk to take, but added, [...] "this industry is all about taking risks. It was a risk to be publicly said 'no' to, but it's character-building for me and you get back on the horse and <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> on." ...|$|E
2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to go, like theater, where <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time to sit around. You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference. Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the [...] "Golden Man"/Dragon.|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom it {{is illegal}} to carry a folding knife having a blade more than 3 inches (just over 7.6cm) in length in public without [...] "good reason". The terms [...] "in public" [...] and [...] "good reason" [...] are not defined, but {{examples}} of [...] "religious duty", [...] "national dress" [...] and [...] "requirement of employment or hobby" [...] are given. [...] It is left up to a police officer's individual subjective discretion, and ultimately a magistrate to decide if a knife is being carried [...] "in public", and for a [...] "good reason". [...] Folding knives with blades of [...] or less may be carried without needing to provide [...] "good reason" [...] so long as the blade is not capable of being locked in the open position. However, {{it is illegal}} to have the intention of using any object in public as a weapon, meaning that even a knife that is legal to carry without needing [...] "good reason" [...] may still be found to be illegal if the police officer has grounds to suspect it will be used as a weapon. The onus lies on the officer to prove that intent. [...] Recent court decisions in the U.K. have made it easier for public prosecutors to obtain knife possession convictions by preventing the accused from citing self-defence or even fear of attack as a justifiable reason for carrying a knife. [...] The U.K. government advisory website on crime and justice formerly stated that [...] "even if <b>you</b> <b>carry</b> a knife to protect yourself or make yourself feel safer but don’t intend to use it then you are committing a crime." ...|$|E
