500|$|Each chapter {{begins with}} a section of [...] "Observations" [...] {{on the topic of}} the chapter; thus, Chapter 3 has three pages of [...] "Observations on Roasting and Boiling". The {{observations}} are close to instructions, as [...] "when you boil mutton or beef, observe to dredge them well with flour before <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> into the kettle of cold water, keep it covered, and take off the scum".|$|E
500|$|Cuse {{served as}} show runner and head writer. Boam, {{who served as}} {{executive}} producer, also contributed scripts for the show. The writing staff included John Wirth, Brad Kern, Tom Chehak, David Simkins, and John McNamara. They followed Cuse's informal instruction that {{the tone of the}} show remain [...] "just under over-the-top": the series would be humorous but not too campy. Every member of the staff participated in breaking down and analyzing the stories they conceived. Worth commented, [...] "there was a very high percentage of ideas that worked in the room and got translated to paper that worked when <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on film. That doesn't always happen." [...] Cuse described long hours writing the show, including several overnight sessions. Each episode of Brisco was filmed in seven days, so the turn-around time for scripts was one week. McNamara said that he became a [...] "student of TV history" [...] while writing for Brisco, reviewing old episodes of Maverick for inspiration on using humor in the Western genre. He said the writing team felt the television audience was ready for a [...] "trans-genre form", because much of the audience grew up with Lethal Weapon, , and The Wild Wild West. Researchers Lynnette Porter and Barry Porter acknowledge the writer's familiarity with Mark Twain's novel Pudd'nhead Wilson. Porter and Porter describe the novel as an [...] "ancestor text", because the characters of Brisco and Bly both refer to it, and say that this type of literary device is used again by Cuse in Lost.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not get wet and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

Joginder Tuteja from IndiaFM gave the film's soundtrack 4 out of 5 stars and noted, [...] "Songs in Tashan excite, {{get on to}} you quickly and make <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on a repeat mode".

2500|$|Albie Hecht foreshadowed {{the success}} of the series after {{watching}} the film at the Hamptons International Film Festival. In an article, Hecht told New York Times reporter Felicia R. Lee: [...] "They're just real: real brothers, real friends; it's all the stuff kids do when they're hanging out on the playground. The idea that you're watching a documentary is so much fun. Then <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> into that fantasy of being a world-famous rock band, and that's the sauce that makes it work." [...] Lee also called both the film and television series, [...] "an ebullient mock documentary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Figgis had {{problems}} because permits were not issued for some street scenes. This {{caused him to}} film some scenes on the Las Vegas strip in one take to avoid the police, which Figgis said benefited production and {{the authenticity of the}} acting, remarking [...] "I've always hated the convention of shooting on a street, and then having to stop the traffic, and then having to tell the actors, 'Well, there's meant to be traffic here, so you're going to have to shout'. And they're shouting, but it's quiet and they feel really stupid, because it's unnatural. <b>You</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> up against a couple of trucks, with it all happening around them, and their voices become great".|$|E

The outraged Goto tells Ryuichi to [...] "take care of him" [...] before Ryuichi interrupts {{to tell him}} Bejo's not alone, informing him of Uco's betrayal of his father. Goto declares war against Bejo and Uco, and Reza too. When his son Keichi interjects, Goto responds [...] "They're not cops anymore. They're in my world now." [...] A bleeding and exhausted Eka tells Rama [...] "I know where you're from," [...] revealing he too was undercover. Voicing his disillusionment on the harsh realities of crime in Jakarta, [...] "There's no end to this [...] If you want out, <b>you</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> down, all of them." [...] Later at night, Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war had escalated, with even the police commissioner shot dead. Bunawar claims Eka [...] "went rogue" [...] and [...] "cost the lives of 10 honest cops when he fed us bad intel." [...] He informs him that Reza, the true objective, is meeting Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches the restaurant warehouse fighting his way through Bejo's men.|$|E
