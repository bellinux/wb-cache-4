2500|$|One day (Service later wrote), while pondering what {{to recite}} at an {{upcoming}} church concert he met E.J. [...] "Stroller" [...] White, {{editor of the}} Whitehorse Star. White suggested: [...] "Why don’t you write a poem for it? Give us something about our own bit of earth. We sure would appreciate it. There’s a rich paystreak {{waiting for someone to}} work. Why don’t <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> stake it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> get it out," [...] ses Lewis, who {{pretty well}} guessed who’d ’ave {{to do it}} if Bob didn’t. [...] "It’ll look better for you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that he {{is allowed}} except one," [...] {{answered}} the King. [...] "Suppose <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> wind him up, {{and then you can}} stay there and make your own guesses." ...|$|E
6000|$|Altamont stuttered and stammered and hemd, and hawd. [...] "O!" [...] says he, [...] "I was passing--passing as <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out." [...] And he {{instantly}} {{turned the}} conversation, and {{began talking about}} pollytix, or the weather, or some such stuff.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was after}} {{you came out}} of that little room," [...] he continued, meditatively, [...] "where that Oriental fellow had been shut up. The more I think of it, the odder it seems. You were as perky as mustard when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> you've been sort of dazed ever Since you came out." ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} architecturally {{remarkable}} about Sir Patrick's house. Ham Farm possessed neither {{the splendor of}} Windygates nor the picturesque antiquarian attraction of Swanhaven. It was a perfectly commonplace English country seat, surrounded by perfectly commonplace English scenery. Snug monotony welcomed <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> snug monotony met you again when you turned {{to the window and}} looked out.|$|R
6000|$|The {{captain was}} a merry-minded man, and he laughed. [...] "It is pretty {{hard for me}} to answer that question," [...] said he; [...] "suppose <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> find out for yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were too}} excited and {{disgusted with the}} whole scene," [...] said Hough {{as they reached the}} roaring lights of the gambling-hell. [...] "Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> play again? There are always open games." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Business?' he repeated. 'Yes, that's jest {{about the}} size of it--business. Advertizement, miss, may be the soul of commerce, but Commission's its body. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> win. Ten per cent on every order you send me!' ...|$|E
60|$|Madam, {{with this}} ring <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out as <b>you</b> please; {{it is the}} Duchess's own ring.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{may keep}} your mind easy, father,' they replied. 'We {{have never been}} disobedient to <b>you.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> peace, <b>and</b> may heaven give you a glorious victory!' ...|$|R
60|$|ENID. [With slight impatience.] Yes, I know, Frost, of course. Will <b>you</b> please <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> ask if they'll {{have some}} tea; say I sent you.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What are {{you going}} to do?' said Gillis, who held Georgina by the wrist, in case of any {{unexpected}} rush into the lamplight. 'Will <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> tell that English woman that you lived with her husband?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be frightened, Myra," [...] he said, [...] "I am {{sure that}} it is nothing serious. It struck a rib and glanced off, I think, and at the worst it has only broken the bone. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> attend to your mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charlie, what a noise you make! Don't {{you know}} better than to slam the doer in that way when you come in? If you can't learn to make less noise in going in and out, I shall not let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No, no, <b>you</b> would <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can’t come out,” {{returned}} the officer, “until {{the time has}} expired that the Judge directed for the keeping of the prisoner.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good. I {{will take}} your word for it, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> come out as you like without being watched, and you need not fear that we shall pay you another visit." ...|$|R
60|$|PARAMORE (angrily). Yes, {{you have}} been {{watching}} me because you admire Miss Craven yourself. Well, <b>you</b> may <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> win now. <b>You</b> will be pleased to hear that I am a ruined man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{the time}} comes," [...] said Herbert, [...] "when {{you see your}} opening. And <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your capital, {{you have nothing to}} do but employ it." ...|$|E
60|$|Warn. Well, my lord, cheer up! I {{have found}} a way to rid you of it all; within a short time you shall know more; yonder appears a young lady, whom I must needs speak with; please <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> prepare the old lady and your mistress.|$|E
6000|$|... "How could I forget that! What {{a selfish}} girl I am, to be {{thinking}} of jewelry, when that dear, good mother hasn't a cloak to her back. Daisy Field, I'm ashamed of <b>you!</b> <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> buy that nice, warm one at once, and don't let me hear of that ridiculous box again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, Mr. Somerset!' she exclaimed. 'You {{ought not}} to frighten me so--indeed you ought not! The train came out {{almost as soon as}} <b>you</b> had <b>gone</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>you</b> did not return--an {{accident}} was possible!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> arrange {{your hair}} there," [...] he said, [...] "I will go and order breakfast {{and have a}} shave. I will be back here in about twenty minutes. You had better take this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} see about getting tea," [...] said Felicity, [...] "so {{the rest of you}} will have to {{entertain}} her. <b>You</b> better <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> show her the photographs in the album. Dan, you do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Granet replied. [...] "Here we are, and there's Miss Conyers at the window. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{talk her}} over and I'll just see that we've {{got lots of}} petrol. I'll have you down there within two hours, all right, {{if we can get}} away before the roads are crowded." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{left the}} manager much impressed, {{the two friends}} set out for a {{ready-made}} clothing establishment. [...] "I won't come in," [...] the major said, slipping ten sovereigns into Von Baumser's hand. [...] "Just <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> till them ye want the best suit o' clothes they can give you. They've a good seliction there, I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because you can't. It's all gammon. She don't mean to have him, Mr. Newton. You {{may take}} my word for that. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> ask her if she do. A pretty thing indeed! I can't invite my friend, Mr. Newton, to eat a bit of dinner, and let him walk out with my Polly, but you must interfere. If you had her to-morrow you wouldn't have a {{shilling}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You do not know!" [...] replied Blue Beard. [...] "I {{very well}} know. You were {{resolved}} {{to go into}} the closet, were you not? Mighty well, madam; <b>you</b> shall <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> take your place among the ladies you saw there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I care to {{take this}} fellow alive. Judging from his present performance, I should say his keeping would entail no mean expense. <b>You</b> may <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> slay him if you like; I have quite changed my mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take this gentleman's handbag," [...] he said, [...] "and {{you carry}} his newspapers, {{and you take}} his umbrella. Here's a quarter for you and a quarter for you and a quarter for you. One of <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> front <b>and</b> lead {{the way to a}} taxi." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] she said. [...] "Billy Roberts has come, and I've got to go. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{sit beside}} {{her for a}} while, and maybe she'll go to sleep. But don't rush her. Let her have her own way. If she'll let you take her hand, why do it. Try it, anyway. But first of all, as an opener and just {{as a matter of}} course, start wetting the towel over her eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Thady, not to-night; {{stay here}} to-night. I {{would not have}} <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> give {{yourself}} up under cover of the dark. Early to-morrow--as soon as Counsellor Webb will be up, you shall go with me to him. He'll no doubt commit you; indeed he must do so; but that will be better for you than lying all night in the guard-room at the police station, and being dragged out in the morning, cold, comfortless, and hungry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Denis, I won't go back now,--it {{would look}} odd and do no good; {{so do you}} go back and drink a tumbler of punch with the men, and dance a turn or two with the girls, as you should on your wedding night; and by and by I'll come down again as if {{to see what was going}} on--and to walk home with Miss Feemy. The Captain must go back to Ballycloran for his horse; and if he can be persuaded that there is any danger, he can go up and sleep at the cottage; for I tell you, if they mean to hurt him at all, it's on the road home to Mohill they'd make the attempt. Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> say nothing about it, and I'll be down by and by." ...|$|E
60|$|DOCTOR. (Coming into veranda and {{touching}} G. on the shoulder.) <b>You</b> had better <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> see her now.|$|R
6000|$|Wild. Faith, I cannot help {{what your}} {{learning}} has brought <b>you</b> to. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> study; I foresee {{you will have}} but few holidays: In the mean time, I'll not fail to give the world an account of your endowments. Farewell: I'll to the gaming-house. [...] [Exit WILD.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a deuced pity. The {{governors}} {{had settled}} everything, {{and we should}} have been awfully jolly. I'd have <b>gone</b> <b>in</b> for all the things <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for; <b>and</b> though your governor was screwing us up a bit, there would have been plenty of tin to <b>go</b> on with. <b>You</b> couldn't think of it again?' ...|$|R
