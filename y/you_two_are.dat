500|$|Certain {{scenes and}} dialogues {{from the film}} earned iconic status in India, such as [...] "Kitne aadmi the" [...] (How many men were there?), [...] "Jo dar gaya, samjho mar gaya" [...] (One who is scared is dead), and [...] "Bahut yaarana laagta hai" [...] (Looks like <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> very close)â€“ all dialogues of Gabbar Singh. These and other popular dialogues entered the people's daily vernacular. Characters and dialogues from the film {{continue}} {{to be referred to}} and parodied in popular culture. Gabbar Singh, the sadistic villain, ushered in an era in Hindi films characterised by [...] "seemingly omnipotent oppressors as villains", who play the pivotal role in setting up the context of the story, such as Shakal (played by Kulbhushan Kharbanda) of Shaan (1980), Mogambo (Amrish Puri) of Mr. India (1987) and Bhujang (Amrish Puri) of Tridev (1989). Filmfare, in 2013, named Gabbar Singh the most iconic villain in the history of Indian cinema, and four actors were included in its 2010 list of [...] "80 Iconic Performances" [...] for their work in this film.|$|E

[...] and then for all of the other guests to join in and say [...] "... hooray!" [...] This is normally repeated three times. In Canada, especially at young children's birthdays, {{immediately after}} [...] "Happy Birthday" [...] has been sung, the singers segue into [...] "How old are you now? How old are you now? How old are you now-ow, how old are you now?" [...] and then count up: [...] "Are you one? Are <b>you</b> <b>two?</b> <b>Are</b> you..." [...] until they reach the right age, at which the celebrant says [...] "yes", and everybody else, who presumably know the right number, all cheer.|$|E
6000|$|... "But have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> seeing {{anything}} of one another, then? You never mentioned Thew {{in any of}} your letters, Katharine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{were sitting}} at the table. Playing cards. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> in the other room. It was silent. I thought I heard him--whirr." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> {{going on}} about?" [...] {{the young lady}} asked. [...] "I heard Maud {{speaking}} up at you. Some lovers' quarrel, I suppose?" ...|$|R
60|$|Thers. So he had need; for, to my certain knowledge, {{neither of}} <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> conjurers to inform him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Durgin, with {{a certain}} dryness, which was half humorous. [...] "I presume, if <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> satisfied, it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, we'll see! You haven't {{thought of}} the dresses <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> to have for the Drawing-Room from Worth's, and Lady Caergwent to present you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was {{a fellow}} half a mile back begging me to kill him: with which of <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>am</b> I to agree?--for you can't both be right.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is not as}} if <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> young people, {{and wanted}} to be billing and cooing," [...] Lady Ball had said to her the same evening.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would do}} nicely for you, Peters, {{when you go}} back. It would be awfully jolly, if <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> {{to fall in love}} with each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so," [...] he continued, [...] "I am to {{understand}} that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> married? And you stand up to it before my face, Miss Huddlestone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, what's this?" [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{when at last}} he broke the silence. [...] "You two are alike. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> much alike. What's this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{bound to}} go to the gold fields, Earl. <b>You</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> going there to make a fortune, and why can't I make a fortune, too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} be back {{attending}} to business," [...] was the agent's reply. [...] "My clerk can hardly take my place. Would <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>be</b> willing to go on alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, let us reason together. Let us examine details. When <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> in the sick-room raising that riot, {{what would}} you have done if you had known I was coming?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I didn't {{know that}} <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> quite-- That is, when last I heard about it, I fancied-- But if the quarrel's made up, there's nobody more rejoiced than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|CONRAD. Aha! What {{consolation}} {{will it be}} for us {{then that}} <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> able to tell off one another's defects so cleverly in your afternoon chat? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, while <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> {{stuffing}} yourselves {{with sour}} milk, I'll go {{and search for}} better fare," [...] said Fred, with a laugh {{as he left the}} hut.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And Matilda is impatient,' said Mrs. Hunt Mortimer, laughing. 'Matilda {{has reason}} to be, seated here with an index {{in front of her}} while <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> exchanging compliments.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tck! Tck!' said Father Victor sympathetically. 'I'd give a {{good deal}} {{to be able to}} talk the vernacular. A river that washes away sin! And how long have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> looking for it?' ...|$|R
5000|$|What tales, what rumours, you ask?Of whom is this praise being spread {{throughout}} the world?Have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> asleep, having forgotten to wake up?You both can think of it yourselves; do not ask me.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> quarreling?" [...] Lady Blennington exclaimed. [...] "You don't {{deserve to}} have admirers, Fenella. You always treat them badly. How is it you've never been to see me, Mr. Chetwode?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mind? Oh no, no--oh, {{give her}} {{everything}} her dear heart can desire. How good <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> to her, and how good to me! God bless you both always!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know, for {{the moment}} I had quite forgotten," [...] he confided, as he sank into an easy-chair by their side. [...] "Of course, <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> old acquaintances." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I saw {{the shadow}} of {{yourself}} putting a cloak round a lady. I was at the side door; <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> {{in a room with}} the window towards me. You came to me a moment later.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In another minute," [...] Molyneux exclaimed, {{waking up}} with a start, [...] "I should have been asleep. Whatever have <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>been</b> talking about? It was the most {{soothing}} hum I ever heard in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{is there}} to be nobody else? I'm afraid I should find it rather dull while <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> opening your hearts to each other." [...] Here {{he looked at her}} angrily. [...] "Can you think of anybody besides Lady Rosina?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{it strikes}} me <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> very game about it," [...] she went on, then added with {{the shadow of a}} sigh: [...] "What a pity you are not old-timers!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know best," [...] {{answered}} the Mermaid, smiling kindly at him. [...] "When people {{are as much}} in love with one another as <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are,</b> they don't need advice from anyone else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us walk {{round to}} Covent Garden," [...] he suggested. [...] "I daresay the gallery will be full, {{but there is}} always the chance, and I know <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>are</b> keen on Melba." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} so," [...] murmured Mrs. Aleshine in my ear, [...] "for we'd no sooner knowed that <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> {{to make a}} match of it than we put an extry spoonful of tea into his pot, and stopped scrubbin' the libr'ry." ...|$|R
6000|$|Cel. Found you! half this {{brightness}} betwixt <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>was</b> {{enough to}} have lighted me; I could never miss my way: Here's fair Olinda has beauty enough for one family; such a voice, such a wit, so noble a stature, so white a skin!-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She did {{not answer}} for a few moments. She became {{interested}} in the flame of the little spirit lamp that kept her coffee hot. She finished what she had to do with that and then remarked, [...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>two</b> <b>were</b> not to correspond." ...|$|R
