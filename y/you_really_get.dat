He {{appreciated}} the shows on {{the first leg of}} the tour, where they played the entire 20-song The River album in sequence, because [...] "when you play something night after night <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist." [...] He attributed his ability to keep playing during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E

One of the reviewers for Famitsu magazine said that {{the large number of}} characters made the game [...] "a very different [...]" [...] RPG Site's Erren Van Duine was very impressed, saying that certain character interactions were [...] "handled excellently and <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> a sense of specific character motivations because of it." [...] He also praised the sympathetic portrayal of Cid Aulstyne, and stated that the game had [...] "so many great moments, [...] have to experience each little detail for [...] Heath Hindman, writing for PlayStation Lifestyle, called the characters [...] "pretty strong overall", although she cited some scenes where various characters' inclusion felt like a necessity rather than a useful element to be a fault.|$|E
500|$|Kolbe {{thought at}} first that casting Robinson was [...] "really off-the-way" [...] but he felt the actor made the episode [...] "bloom". He gave general {{guidelines}} to Robinson about how he could approach the character, but it was Robinson who developed the traits of the character. Kolbe also praised the writing saying that [...] "I wish there was more writing like this for television. I think we'd have a much healthier industry." [...] Robinson said that Garak was a complicated character which required the use of subtext, adding that it wasn't {{a simple way to}} portray a character [...] "but when you do it well, <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> people's attention". He was told by the producers that they intended to bring him back onto the show, but in a later interview, he said that this was commonplace in the industry and doesn't usually occur. When he was brought back for the second-season episode [...] "", executive producer Ira Steven Behr apologized for not bringing him back sooner.|$|E

500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>get</b> to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
