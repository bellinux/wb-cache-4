He was never seated. <b>You</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> <b>You</b> know how your brother philanthropists and capitalists of Colorado worked it. It {{was a case of}} getting labour down and gouging it. You kept the {{president}} of the South-western Amalgamated Association of Miners in jail for three years on trumped-up murder charges, and with him out of the way you broke up the association. That was gouging labour, you'll admit. The third time the graduated income tax was declared unconstitutional was a gouge. So was the eight-hour Bill you killed in the last Congress.|$|E

60|$|Going down to Liddesdale once, I {{drew the}} castle of Hermitage in my fashion, and sketched it so {{accurately}} {{that with a}} few verbal instructions Clerk put it into regular form, Williams[201] (the Grecian) copied over Clerk's, and his drawing was engraved as the frontispiece of {{the first volume of}} the Kelso edition, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border.[202] Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have written all this down, Sir W.? Because it pleases me to record that this thrice-transmitted drawing, though taken originally from a sketch of mine, was extremely like Hermitage, which neither of my colleagues in the task had ever seen? No, that's not the reason. You want to put off writing Woodstock, just as easily done as these memoranda, but which it happens your duty and your prudence recommend, and therefore you are loath to begin.|$|E

"I suppose I {{know what}} you have come for, Mr. Burnamy," [...] said General Triscoe in a tone which was rather {{judicial}} than otherwise, [...] "and I suppose <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> have come." [...] The words certainly opened the way for Burnamy, but he hesitated so long to take it that the general had abundant time to add, [...] "I don't pretend that this event is unexpected, but I should like to know what reason you have for thinking I should wish you to marry my daughter. I take it for granted that you are attached to each other, and we won't waste time on that point. Not to beat about the bush, on the next point, let me ask at once what your means of supporting her are. How much did you earn on that newspaper in Chicago?" ...|$|E
6000|$|So the Whale swam {{and swam}} and swam, with both {{flippers}} and his tail, {{as hard as}} he could for the hiccoughs; and at last he saw the Mariner's natal-shore and the white-cliffs-of-Albion, and he rushed half-way up the beach, and opened his mouth wide and wide and wide, and said, 'Change here for Winchester, Ashuelot, Nashua, Keene, and stations on the Fitchburg Road;' and just as he said 'Fitch' the Mariner walked out of his mouth. But while the Whale had been swimming, the Mariner, who was indeed a person of infinite-resource-and-sagacity, had taken his jack-knife and cut up the raft into a little square grating all running criss-cross, and he had tied it firm with his suspenders (now, <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> were not to forget the suspenders!), and he dragged that grating good and tight into the Whale's throat, and there it stuck!

[...] "You will have it--you shall have it!" [...] she said. [...] "Some one (in this house {{or out of}} it; I don't know which) has betrayed me to the mistress of the school. A wretch in my situation suspects everybody, and worse still, does it without reason or excuse. I heard you girls talking when {{you ought to have}} been asleep. You all dislike me. How did I know it mightn't be one of you? Absurd, to a person with a well-balanced mind! I went halfway up the stairs, and felt ashamed of myself, and went back to my room. If I could only have got some rest! Ah, well, {{it was not to be}} done. My own vile suspicions kept me awake; I left my bed again. You know what I heard on the other side of that door, and why I was interested in hearing it. Your father never told me he had a daughter. 'Miss Brown,' at this school, was any 'Miss Brown,' to me. I had no idea of who you really were until to-night. I'm wandering. What does all this matter to you? Miss Ladd has been merciful; she lets me go without exposing me. You can guess what has happened. No? Not even yet? Is it innocence or kindness that makes you so slow to understand? My dear, I have obtained admission to this respectable house by means of false references, and I have been discovered.

5000|$|According to {{official}} history, Empress Dowager Du {{before her death}} in 961 asked the 34-year-old Emperor Taizu to promise that his brother will succeed him so as to ensure {{the continuation of the}} Song dynasty.

5000|$|There has {{nevertheless}} arisen a debatable performance tradition which presents Sports as a multi-media concert experience. Composer-critic Virgil Thomson, one of Satie's foremost American {{champions of}} the 20th Century, began performing Sports as a work for [...] "narrator and piano" [...] in New York City in the mid-1950s. His translations of the texts appeared in the first English edition of Sports published by Salabert in 1975. Thomson continued to perform it in this fashion {{to the end of}} his life. [...] "I feel a connection with the Satie piece", he said in 1986, when he was 90. [...] "It turns me on. You know there's a song that goes 'I don't know why I love you, but I do, ooooh, ooooh.'

5000|$|Just a year later, Empress Dowager Du fell sick, and Emperor Taizu {{personally}} fed her {{medicine and}} attended {{her by her}} bed. When the illness worsened, minister Zhao Pu was summoned to record the will. Empress Dowager Du asked her son, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> became an emperor?" [...] In tears, Emperor Taizu could not answer. The mother asked again, and Emperor Taizu responded {{that it was all}} due to the blessings of her and the ancestors. [...] "Wrong", the mother said, [...] "It was because Emperor Shizong of (Later) Zhou made his young kid succeed him as the emperor. Had (Later) Zhou had an older emperor, how could you become one? When you pass away, remember to pass the throne to your younger brother. The country is wide, the population is large, an older emperor is the blessing of the dynasty." [...] Emperor Taizu cried and nodded his head. Empress Dowager Du also told Zhao Pu: [...] "You shall also remember and follow my words." [...] This conversation was recorded by Zhao Pu with his signature at the end and sealed in a golden shelf to be kept by reliable palace attendants.|$|E

30|$|When probed {{to discuss}} types of sexual {{agreements}} {{that may occur}} in heterosexual relationships, participants focused exclusively on “open relationships” and “threesomes.” Open relationships (referred to by some participants as “swingers”) were described generally as both partners within a dyad having an explicit agreement {{to be able to}} have sex with other people. “Swingers” were defined as having sex “with other married couples or other unmarried couples” (male). Threesomes generally were spoken about as one male and two females, and female participants overwhelming reported that threesomes (or the idea of threesomes) were instigated by male partners. Some women reported that men were usually reluctant to take part in a two males-one female threesome, which could be used as reasoning not to partake in any threesomes: “And <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> can kind of kick back on that, do one on one psychology, OK so you want a threesome, OK, but let me get a threesome, I want one too… I want a man, let me have one too” (female). Some women reported that threesomes with two women were a way of fulfilling their male partner’s desires that they were unwilling to fulfill: “I didn’t want to do such and such with him, or whatever, so I would go get other girls to do these acts for him. But when I went and got the other girls I would specify to them what to do and what not to do, and how far to go and how far not to go” (female). Another female participant described a situation where she was approached to have sex with a man in a dyad whose wife wanted to watch them have sex: “Him and his baby momma, she wasn’t satisfying him sexually, so she wanted to watch him have sex with another female to see what she’s not doing for him” (female).|$|E
40|$|Why do you exist? “What did you say? ” What {{gets you}} up in the morning? “What? ” Do <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> were born? “Honestly, what is your problem? Leave me alone. ” T SEEMS THAT MANY PEOPLE do not have answers to the {{questions}} just asked? They have no idea why they exist? Either they think that talking about a purpose in life is a meaningless attempt to find out if they have a reason for living or it is a waste of time. Yet, it seems reasonable to me that every person should have a personal purpose; one that gives them hope and a future. Why? Because life is more than going to work and bringing home a pay check, however important. While life is mostly about getting a job, making money, paying the bills, getting married, raising a family, working and having fun, and many other expectations, the icing on the cake is a person’s dream and the work that goes into it. Together, the years of work and play along with a vision for living gives meaning to day-to-day living. As an example, do you see yourself becoming an entrepreneur and starting your own health care business? Do you want to help other people live a healthier lifestyle? If you are interested in owning a successful “exercise medicine ” business, you will need to prepare your thinking accordingly. This means having a vision that drives you to get the right education to fulfill your dreams and expectations. A vision of something positive and right for you will give you the energy and knowledge to make great things I For I know the plans I have for you, ” declares the LORD, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future...|$|E
