500|$|Lennon's {{most intense}} {{feelings}} were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking {{him through the}} lyrics of How Do <b>You</b> <b>Sleep?,</b> Lennon argued with him through the press for {{three years after the}} group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired. Lennon summarised his feelings towards McCartney in an interview three days before his death: [...] "Throughout my career, I've selected to work with... only two people: Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono... That ain't bad picking." ...|$|E

500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Kanal, who was also {{responsible}} for its production, while Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a [...] "light" [...] keyboard, which [...] "runs tie the song together from intro through break", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] has a midtempo beat, which according to some critics is [...] "perfect for a slow dance". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a [...] "fast-talking" [...] approach. Lyrically, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind.

2500|$|Asher {{turned out}} to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any {{producer}} she had worked with previously. Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio. Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a [...] "woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)", he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer, and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship.

[...] Amanda Sandford, spokesperson for the anti-tobacco group Action on Smoking and Health, stated that criminalizing a behaviour 26% of the population commit [...] "is ludicrous." [...] She also said: [...] "We can't turn the clock back. If tobacco were banned we would have 13 million people desperately craving a drug {{that they would not}} be able to get." [...] The deputy editor of The Lancet responded to the criticism by arguing that no other measures besides a total ban would likely be able to reduce tobacco use.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, Lanegan {{released}} his first solo album, The Winding Sheet via label Sub Pop (which {{at the time}} was home to friends Nirvana and The Afghan Whigs). Lanegan had intimated that the album came around following a Leadbelly project he was working on with Mark Pickerel, Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. The project was short lived and eventually other musicians became involved in the evolution to the debut solo record. From the Leadbelly sessions a version of [...] "Where Did <b>You</b> <b>Sleep</b> Last Night?" [...] appeared on The Winding Sheet. [...] "Ain't It a Shame" [...] is available on the Nirvana box set, With the Lights Out. Cobain also supplied backing vocals on [...] "Down in the Dark" [...] on Lanegan's debut.

There's really no need to try to take a picture of someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?...

[...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X.

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell {{to state that}} [...] "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas". One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the [...] "surrealist ethos" [...] of relying [...] "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This {{can be seen in}} John Merrick's dream of his mother in The Elephant Man, Agent Cooper's dreams of the red room in Twin Peaks and the [...] "dreamlike logic" [...] of the narrative found in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that [...] "Waking dreams {{are the ones that are}} important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, letting my mind wander. When <b>you</b> <b>sleep,</b> you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose... right there is the power of cinema."

2500|$|Unlike {{many artists}} who {{appeared}} on the show, Nirvana filmed its entire performance in a single take. The band's fourteen-song setlist included a single song from its debut album, Bleach, four songs from the 1991 album Nevermind, three tracks from the then-recently released In Utero, and six cover songs. The group shied away from playing its better-known songs; the only contemporary hit the band performed was its 1992 single [...] "Come as You Are". Ten songs in, Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets joined the band onstage to perform three of their group's songs with Nirvana. The set ended with a performance of the traditional song [...] "Where Did <b>You</b> <b>Sleep</b> Last Night", following the arrangement of blues musician Lead Belly, whom Cobain described right before the song as [...] "his favorite performer ever". This rendition has been {{regarded as one of}} the greatest live single song performances of all time. As The Atlantic critic Andrew Wallace Chamings described, [...] "For the final line, 'I would shiver the whole night through,' Cobain jumps up an octave, forcing him to strain so far he screams and cracks. He hits the word 'shiver' so hard that the band stops, as if a fight broke out at a sitcom wedding. Next he howls the word 'whole' and then does something very strange in the brief silence that follows, something that's hard to describe: He opens his piercingly blue eyes so suddenly it feels like someone or something else is looking out under the bleached lank fringe, with a strange clarity. Then he finishes the song." [...] After the band finished, Cobain argued with the show's producers, who wanted an encore. Cobain refused because he felt he could not top the performance of that song.|$|E
