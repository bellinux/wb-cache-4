30|$|When {{comparing}} ED in standing trees, {{there were}} differences in the longitudinal (EDL) and transversal (EDT) dynamic elastic modulus. EDT was higher than EDL (Table  1).

Ultrasound waves travel slower in longitudinal <b>direction</b> than in <b>transversal</b> <b>direction</b> because waves disperse along the fiber length. The contrary occurs in <b>transversal</b> <b>direction,</b> where the ultrasound spreads easily across fiber cell wall [27]. Bucur [25] mentions that speed in longitudinal direction is one-fifth or one-third of the speed in perpendicular-to-grain direction, which is why the dynamic elastic modulus is smaller in longitudinal direction as was determined in the teak trees.|$|R

The irregular pores distribution in <b>transversal</b> and longitudinal <b>direction,</b> regarding the external loading, is considered in the computational models. The complete fatigue process of analyzed porous structure is then divided into the crack initiation (Ni) and crack propagation (Np) period where the total fatigue life (N) is defined as: N = Ni + Np. The crack initiation period is determined using strain life approach where elastic-plastic numerical analysis is performed to obtain the total strain amplitude in the critical stress fields around the pores. The simplified universal slope method is then {{used to determine the}} number of stress cycles, Ni, required for formation of initial cracks. The number of stress cycles, Np, required for crack propagation from initial to the critical crack length is also numerically determined using finite element (FE) models, in the frame of Abaqus computation FEM code. The maximum tensile stress (MTS) criterion is considered when analyzing the crack path inside the porous structure. The performed computational analyses show that stress concentrations around individual pores are higher when external loading is acting in <b>transversal</b> <b>direction</b> in respect to the pore distribution. Therefore, further computational analyses regarding crack initiation and crack propagation period have been done only for pores distribution in <b>transversal</b> <b>direction...</b>|$|R

40|$|In an {{earthquake}} resistant design, {{it is assumed}} that seismic acts on an building frame separately in longitudinal (x) and <b>transversal</b> (<b>y)</b> <b>directions</b> of the frame. Then, the frame is checked to ascertain if there is damage by the seismic load in each direction. When the seismic load acts on a space frame in an arbitrary direction, the plane frames of both x and y direction are subjected to stresses caused by the seismic load. In this case, the ordinary earthquake resistant design method does not ensure the safety of the frame. In order to maintain the safety of the building frame against {{an earthquake}} force acting in an arbitrary direction, it is necessary to clarify the ultimate flexural strength of the beam-slab system as well as the column of the rectangular space frame subjected to the force in an arbitrary direction. In the present paper, two beam-slab systems in inner part of a reinforced concrete building frame are used for test specimens. The one is subjected to forces caused by the horizontal load in the direction of one plane only of the frame, and the other is subjected to forces caused by the horizontal load in a 45 degree angle from one plane of the frame. Test results are compared with the theoretical ultimate strength based on the plastic hinge method. The test observations are summarized as follows: i) The ultimate flexural strength of the beam-slab system subjected to a bending about the axis, with a 45 degree angle from one plane of the frame, is eleven percent higher than that of a beam-slab system subjected to the bending in a plane of the frame. ii) When a rectangular space frame is subjected to a force in a direction of a 45 degree angle from the one plane of the frame, cracks in this slab occur in four directions: two of them are diagonal cracks, the others are parallel to the beams. ...|$|R

Cortical bone specimens have been found to have tensile strength in the range of 79 – 151  MPa in longitudinal direction and 51 – 56  MPa in <b>transversal</b> <b>direction.</b> Bone’s elasticity is also important for its function giving the ability to the skeleton to withstand impact. Estimates of modulus of elasticity of bone samples are of the order of 17 – 20  GPa in longitudinal direction and of 6 – 13  GPa in the <b>transversal</b> <b>direction</b> (Athanasiou et al. 2000). The elastic properties of bone were successfully modeled at the level of mineralized collagen fibrils via step-by-step homogenization from the staggered arrangement of collagen molecules up to an array of parallel mineralized fibrils (Nikolov and Raabe 2008). The investigations revealed that bone deformation was not homogeneous but distributed between a tensile deformation of the fibrils and a shearing in the interfibrillar matrix between them (Gupta et al. 2005; Peterlik et al. 2006).
