6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Files. [...] "The field-flowers must be second-cousins to a Rose Princess, and I {{believe if}} <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> {{they will tell}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't see {{the use of}} {{all this}} trouble,' put in Lucy. 'Why can't <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> just what comes into your head, as I always do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would turn}} my back on you only I am {{thinking}} of these poor devils here," [...] growled Lingard, furiously. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> how they feel about it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Camp wore a bewildered look. [...] "Perhaps we {{have said}} more than we ought. But I couldn't help it, and I don't see how the {{children}} could, when <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> here, before Mr. Homos." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{might ask}} {{the police for}} a {{testimonial}} of good conduct. They know where {{every one of you}} slept last night. Perhaps if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> they would consent to publish some sort of official statement.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Maud Barrington colored {{a trifle}} as {{she remembered her}} own {{attitude}} towards him. [...] "Cannot you forget it?" [...] she said, with a curious little ring in her voice. [...] "They would do anything <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} you {{acknowledge}} that the landlord and landlady are very obliging people," [...] I said. [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> to let {{you make your own}} soup and mix your own salad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I suppose I'll {{have to give}} in. You're a {{determined}} person. People do what <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> without resenting it. You have an instance here, though {{in a general way}} it's a very undignified thing to be ordered about." ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{case would}} be managed perhaps in a little {{different}} way, where the tendency to play was more decided. After speaking to the individuals mildly, two or three times, you see them again at play. <b>You</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> to wait that day after school and come to your desk.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{can sing}} the old war {{songs in the}} streets. They can get word-drunk, and make crowds, and invade privacy in the genuine old-fashioned way; and they'll do the voting trick as often as <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>'em</b> a question.' ...|$|R
6000|$|When <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> {{the price}} of their wares they always said, [...] "Au plaisir" [...] i. e., {{whatever}} you please; but {{when we came to}} offer them money, we found [...] "au plaisir" [...] meant so much at any rate, and as much more as they could get.|$|R
5000|$|... {{give you}} a copy of their Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) Procedures if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> for <b>them.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you {{are green}} and vigorous. Plants will grow about your roots, whether <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> or not, because they take delight in your {{bountiful}} shadow; {{and as they}} grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop." ...|$|E
60|$|But the dear, sweet, loving, wise, good, self-sacrificing people, {{who really}} go there, can never tell you {{anything}} about it, save {{that it is the}} most beautiful place in all the world; and, if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> more, they grow modest, and hold their peace, for fear of being laughed at; and quite right they are.|$|E
60|$|They are {{particularly}} anxious also to have Mr. Etty and Edwin Landseer. As {{you see them}} daily at the Academy, will <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> or show them this note? Sir Martin {{became one of the}} Committee some few years ago, at my solicitation, as recommending young artists, struggling alone in London, to the better knowledge of this establishment.|$|E
5000|$|... 21st Precinct. It's just {{lines on}} {{a map of the}} city of New York. Most of the 173,000 people wedged into the nine-tenths of a square mile between Fifth Avenue and the East River wouldn't know, if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them,</b> that they lived or worked in the 21st. Whether they know it or not, the {{security}} of their persons, their homes, and their property is the job of the men of the 21st.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Would <b>you</b> mind <b>asking</b> <b>'em</b> which?' says I. 'A week don't {{amount to}} much after you're dead, but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Make ready, indeed," [...] growled Good; [...] "when one {{has only}} a flannel shirt {{and a pair of}} boots, that does not take long. I wish <b>you</b> would <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> for my trousers, Quatermain." ...|$|R
60|$|East is East, and West is San Francisco, {{according}} to Californians. Californians are {{a race of}} people; they are not merely inhabitants of a State. They are the Southerners of the West. Now, Chicagoans are no less loyal to their city; but when <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> why, they stammer and speak of lake fish and the new Odd Fellows Building. But Californians go into detail.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Sir Francis, he don't {{talk much}} before ladies; but after dinner {{he comes out}} {{uncommon}} strong, ma'am--a highly agreeable, well-informed man. When will <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> to dinner? Look out for an early day, ma'am;" [...] and looking into Lady Agnes's pocket-book, he chose a day only a fortnight hence (an age that fortnight seemed to the young gentleman), when the Claverings were {{to be invited to}} Grosvenor-street.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't that," [...] {{explained}} Mrs. Enderby; [...] "it's to {{have your}} maids say 'All right' when <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> to remove the soup. It's a bit shocking also {{to have your}} cook or housemaid going about the house singing some wretched ditty. What was that one, Charley, that Irma Maud sang till we were nearly wild (Irma Maud was my chambermaid). What was it? Something about 'Tixey Ann.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|In Labyrinth, the protagonist's {{solution}} is to ask: [...] "Answer yes or no. Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle?". As the question is about the other persons response, it will either result in a lie about the other truthfully saying which door leads to freedom or a truth about the other lying about which door leads to freedom. Either way, the response will be {{the opposite of what}} a truthful person would say had <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> whether their door leads to freedom.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you do as}} I tell <b>you,</b> and <b>ask</b> <b>them?</b> <b>You</b> can {{go round}} and tell your aunt about it. She knows that I mean to <b>ask</b> <b>them.</b> Lady Eustace is a very rich woman, and is {{disposed}} {{to do a little}} in commerce. Now do you understand?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Raised as a Mennonite, Bergen {{has noted}} that the {{tendency}} {{of the church to}} stifle questions and criticism affected his decision to write fiction. [...] "Writing is a way of figuring things out," [...] he says. [...] "If <b>you</b> can't <b>ask</b> certain questions in church, maybe <b>you</b> can <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> in fiction." ...|$|R
60|$|Ships do want humouring. They want humouring in handling; and if {{you mean}} to handle them well, {{they must have been}} humoured in the {{distribution}} of the weight which <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> to carry through the good and evil fortune of a passage. Your ship is a tender creature, whose idiosyncrasies must be attended to if you mean her to come with credit to herself and you through the rough-and-tumble of her life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you of the fact," [...] Mark said quietly. [...] "Probably you have among your acquaintances some members of White's. I am sure if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> they will confirm the fact. Now, sir, I {{can assure you}} that I have no {{interest}} in this matter, save to prevent a gentleman from being ruined by blacklegs. May I ask how much you owe to Mr. Emerson and Sir James Flash?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know a globe-trotter mustn't be fastidious," [...] replied Mr. Paynter. [...] "But I repeat firmly, an {{objection}} to eating people. The peacock trees {{seem to have}} progressed since the happy days of innocence when they only ate peacocks. If you ask the people here--the fisherman who lives on that beach, or the man that mows this very lawn in front of us--they'll tell you tales taller than any tropical one I brought you from the Barbary Coast. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> {{what happened to the}} fisherman Peters, who got drunk on All Hallows Eve, they'll tell you he lost his way in that little wood, tumbled down asleep under the wicked trees, and then--evaporated, vanished, was licked up like dew by the sun. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> where Harry Hawke is, the widow's little son, they'll just tell you he's swallowed; that he was dared to climb the trees and sit there all night, and did it. What the trees did God knows; the habits of a vegetable ogre leave one a little vague. But they even add the agreeable detail that a new branch appears on the tree when somebody has petered out in this style." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Your life {{is given}} to you by your parents. If you don't want to live, <b>you</b> have to <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> first.” ...|$|R
60|$|That {{there are}} people who are {{offended}} if <b>you</b> don't <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> at all, is a point which I suppose nobody will question. Timmins's earliest friend in life was Simmins, whose wife and family have taken a cottage at Mortlake for the season.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Lillie, since <b>you</b> have <b>asked</b> <b>them,</b> I will {{be polite}} to them; and I {{will try and}} do every thing to save you care in this entertainment. I'll speak to Bridget myself; she knows our ways, and {{has been used to}} managing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You stand excused, Master Empson," [...] {{said the}} petite maitresse, sinking gently {{back on the}} downy couch, from which a {{momentary}} irritation had startled her--"I think the chocolate will please you, though scarce equal to what we had from the Spanish resident Mendoza.--But we must offer these strange people something. Will <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> {{if they would have}} coffee and chocolate, or cold wild-fowl, fruit, and wine? They must be treated, so as to show them where they are, since here they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ruby Gillis {{is dying}} of {{galloping}} consumption," [...] said Mrs. Lynde bluntly. [...] "Everybody knows it except {{herself and her}} FAMILY. They won't give in. If <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>THEM,</b> she's perfectly well. She hasn't been able to teach since she had that attack of congestion in the winter, but she says she's going to teach again in the fall, and she's after the White Sands school. She'll be in her grave, poor girl, when White Sands school opens, that's what." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, fellows, if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them,</b> {{will tell}} you that I'm a chump. Well, I don't mind. I admit it. I am a chump. All the Peppers have been chumps. But what I do say is that every now and then, when you'd least expect it, I get a pretty hot brain-wave; and that's what {{happened}} now. I doubt if the idea that came to me then would have occurred to a single one of any dozen of the brainiest chappies you care to name.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the first}} day of Safar, {{according}} to a narration of Turabi, when they arrived at Damascus, they and the heads of fallen ones were taken into Yazid's presence. The identity of each head and killed persons were explained to him. Then he paid attention to an objecting woman. Yazid asked: [...] "Who is this arrogant woman?" [...] The woman rose to answer and said: [...] "Why are <b>you</b> <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> women? <b>Ask</b> me. I will tell you. I am the granddaughter of Muhammad. I am the daughter of Fatimah." [...] People at the court were impressed and amazed by her. At this time, Zaynab gave her khutbah (خـطـبـة, sermon).|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could send}} you things as {{pleasant}} {{out of these}} parts: but, Madam, I am obliged {{to give you a}} hint, which may be useful if you can have it followed. In Saxony, however, my Letters get opened;--which obliges me to send this by a special Messenger; and him, that he may cause no suspicion, I have charged with fruits from my garden. You will have the goodness to say [if anybody is eavesdropping] that <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> of me at Moritzburg, when I was happy enough to see you there [six months ago, coming home from the Seven-Years War]. The hint I had to give was this:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Maud Barrington. [...] "Dane, Macdonald, and Hassal know, too, but <b>you</b> {{will not}} <b>ask</b> <b>them,</b> and if <b>you</b> did {{they would not}} tell you." ...|$|R
