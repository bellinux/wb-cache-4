His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap.

500|$|Beginning in April 2008, {{the media}} {{reported}} growing speculation that Chris Matthews, news commentator {{and host of}} MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews, might run in the 2010 Democratic primary for the United States Senate Pennsylvania seat then occupied by the Republican Arlen Specter. In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Matthews said that he believed Specter {{had been in the}} Senate for too long, but that running for Senate would mean giving up a career he loved. Mark Leibovich, author of the article, wrote, [...] "Matthews has been particularly obsessed with Pennsylvania of late, devoting hours on and off the air to the state's upcoming Democratic primary, staying in close contact with the state's party apparatus". Speculation was further fueled by Matthews' appearance on an April 14 episode of The Colbert Report. Host Stephen Colbert asked Matthews about the rumors and prodded him to make a public announcement, to which Matthews replied, [...] "Did you ever want to be something your whole life? ... When <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> some kids want to be a fireman. I want to be a Senator. But I have to deal with these things as they come."

She starred {{along with her}} Beyond the Sea co-star Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, as well as newcomer Brandon Routh as Superman. The film was a box office success and received mostly positive reviews. Bosworth's performance however, was not well received among critics; Anthony Lane of The New Yorker noted, [...] "The new Lois Lane, Kate Bosworth, is not a patch on Margot Kidder, or, for that matter, on Teri Hatcher, in the [...]" [...] San Francisco Chronicle film critic Mick LaSalle felt that Bosworth, {{at the age of}} 22 years, was too young to portray Lois Lane, and the climax did not [...] "match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film". Although Bosworth's performance was ambivalently received, she herself loved the experience of working on the movie. As she told Teen Vogue in August 2006, [...] "You know how you have an experience, a time in your life when you feel you've come into your own? When <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> a bit, and think, Now I get it? [...] That's how I feel. I feel a little bit more complete."

He also noted that: [...] "The whole song seems to be centred around the desire to be famous when <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up,</b> which while not my favourite of all messages to give out to The Kids". He ended his review writing [...] "but in all fairness: who cares? It's hella catchy, and really, who's the bigger fool here – the Pussycat Dolls lyricist who wrote some vaguely nonsensical lyrics, or the reviewer who expected anything different?" [...] Dan Cairns from The Times said that [...] "if every song here were as batty and brilliant as this, Doll Domination {{would be one of the}} great pop records of 2008."

500|$|Although it {{had been}} {{reported}} for several years that Jackson had an abusive childhood, he first spoke openly {{about it in a}} 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He grimaced when speaking of the childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he stated he had missed out on much of his childhood, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. In the same interview, speaking of his father, Jackson said, [...] "There were times when he'd come to see me, I'd get sick...I'd start to regurgitate. I'm sorry...Please don't be mad at me...But I do love him". In Jackson's other high-profile interview Living with Michael Jackson (2003), he covered his face with his hand and began crying when talking about his childhood abuse. Jackson recalled that Joseph sat in a chair as the group rehearsed, saying, [...] "He had this belt in his hand. If you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you. It was bad. Real bad". When Jackson received his Living Legend award—presented to him by Janet Jackson—at the 1993 Grammys, he said, [...] "I don't read all the things written about me, I wasn't aware the world thought I was so weird and bizarre. But when <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> like I did in front of 100million people since the age of five, you're automatically different...My childhood was completely taken away from me. There was no Christmas, no birthdays. It was not a normal childhood, no normal pleasures of childhood.

500|$|However, in January 2012, Heigl {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that she has asked the producers if she could return to the show to give closure to Izzie's storyline: [...] "I've told them I want to ," [...] she said. [...] "I really, really, really want to see where [...] is. I just {{want to know what happened}} to her and where she went and what she's doing now. My idea is that she actually like figures it out, and finds some success and does really well in a different hospital. She was always floundering you know, and so she was always one step behind the eight ball and I want to see that girl take some power back." [...] She later went on to say that she regrets leaving the show, [...] "Oh yeah, sometimes, yeah. You miss it. I miss my friends. It was a great work environment ... and it becomes a family. I spent six years together with these people every day ... <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> together, in a way," [...] and again commented on Izzie possibly returning to the show, [...] "I always felt that if they wanted me to come back and sort of wrap up that storyline ... I want them to know that I'm down with it if they want me to, but I completely understand if it doesn't necessarily work ... They've got a lot of story lines going on there." [...] But in March 2012, Shonda Rhimes said that there are no plans at the moment for the character to return, [...] "I think it was really nice to hear her appreciating the show. At the same time we are on a track we have been planning. The idea of changing that track is not something we are interested in right now." [...] Three years later, Rhimes said she has completely moved on from the idea of Izzie coming back, “I’m done with that story. I’ve turned that idea over in my mind a thousand times and thought about how it would go. And I don’t think so.” ...|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E

[...] He also said that Star Wars (1977) and Alien (1979) influenced Interstellars production design: [...] "Those always stuck in my head as being how you need to approach science-fiction. It has to feel used—as used and as real as {{the world we live}} in." [...] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced [...] "elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water".

Although if <b>you</b> <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> in West Texas, {{there are a lot}} of ways to be lonely." [...] His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, [...] "He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things... Before that no one would do it." [...] Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: [...] "When [...] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry."

[...] In other words, an individual high in core self-evaluations {{will be more likely to}} capitalize on the advantages given to them via their families economic success or through their own academic achievements and will consequently be more likely to be financially successful later on in life. [...] The authors explain that individuals high in core self-evaluations cope better with events and situations they encounter in life and are motivated to consistently increase their performance and thus, are more likely to capitalize on the educational and financial advantages they already possess in young adulthood. [...] This will allow them to have greater economic success, as measured by their income, in mid-life.|$|E
