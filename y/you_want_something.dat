Director Richard Lester said, [...] "The general aim of the film was to present what was {{apparently}} becoming a social phenomenon in this country. Anarchy is too strong a word, but the quality of confidence that the boys exuded! Confidence that they could dress as they liked, speak as they liked, talk to the Queen as they liked, {{talk to the people}} on the train who 'fought the war for them' as they liked. ... still based on privilege—privilege by schooling, privilege by birth, privilege by accent, privilege by speech. The Beatles were the first people to attack this… they said if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>something,</b> do it. You can do it. Forget all this talk about talent or ability or money or speech. Just do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{praised the}} {{commercial}} {{nature of the}} album and called it [...] "a mature pop album only in that it's aimed at the boozy girl's night out rather than the school disco". Jacqueline Hodges favoured the album's consistency and complimented its commercial prospect, predicting that the album is [...] "going to sell bucket loads". Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly labelled the album [...] "the best guilty-pleasure retro-dance smash since Eiffel 65's [...] "Blue"", but felt that Minogue [...] "milks the formula (of [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head") dry on the album". Michael Hubbard from MusicOMH enjoyed the fun nature of the album and said that [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>something</b> to drive to, dance to, play at a house party or cheer your workmates up with, Fever is for you". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave the album a negative review, criticizing Minogue's [...] "painfully precise" [...] vocals and the album's monotony.|$|E

[...] He adds that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>something,</b> all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it." [...] This is the core theme of the book.|$|E

2500|$|Esch is {{a reserve}} deputy sheriff in his {{hometown}} of Jasper, Alabama, and starred in the reality television documentary entitled Big Law: Deputy Butterbean, which debuted on the Investigation Discovery channel in August 2011. He described the genesis of the show: [...] "They came to me wanting to do a reality documentary on my restaurant and I {{was in the process of}} closing my restaurant down. I said 'If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>something</b> interesting and fun to watch, follow us on our drug busts in the sheriff's department.' They agreed people would be interested in this. [...] "They started following us, filming it and documenting us actually making the busts. You arrest somebody and say 'Look, if you don't want to go to jail you've got to help us bust a bigger guy.' We make a bigger bust from that. The whole goal is to get people on file and lessen the number of criminals on the streets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chicago Tribune critic Michael Phillips {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a comedy rueful but tidy and safe," [...] which sparked not much interest in him, and added that it is [...] "a placid tale of impulses running wild." [...] He, however, deemed the ensemble [...] "excellent." [...] The Star-Ledger writer Stephen Witty said that the film [...] "has a few good lines, and a fine cast." [...] He thought that Laurie was [...] "particularly good," [...] Keener amusing and Platt charming, but expected more of the film: [...] "You want something that plays a little sharper, and cuts a little deeper. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>something</b> that demands more of its performers, and delivers more to its audience." [...] Similarly, New York Post Lou Lumenick wrote: [...] "While there are laughs, the farcical elements of The Oranges are not presented with sufficient discipline {{to live up to}} the full potential of its cast." [...] The Hollywood Reporter critic David Rooney praised members of the cast [...] "who manage to hit a sweet spot even in this mediocre material," [...] noting that the film [...] "runs out of juice" [...] when it becomes serious and that the film's [...] "cathartic moments feel fabricated" [...] and concluded that the cast [...] "deserves better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>something</b> to be understood, you say it at least twice." ...|$|E
