500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{contains}} elements of funk-pop, synthpop, and disco house. The song {{is backed by}} a [...] "busy but buoyant" [...] instrumentation featuring a [...] "deeply rhythmic impulse". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt [...] "Birthday" [...] was a musically updated version of disco, achieved by replacing [...] "cheesy strings" [...] with [...] "jerky breaks and synth washes". Its [...] "joyful" [...] lyrics present the commemoration of her partner's birthday {{as a metaphor for}} sexual intercourse. The bridge section of [...] "Birthday", which sees Perry singing [...] "Let me get you in <b>your</b> <b>birthday</b> suit / It's time to bring out the big balloons", was found by Ben Rattliff to resemble French duo Daft Punk's works.|$|E
2500|$|On the 2008 {{release in}} an Israel-Hezbollah deal of Samir Kuntar, who had murdered Four Israelis in 1979, {{including}} a 4-year-old girl, Al Jazeera Arabic threw him a party: [...] "Brother Samir, {{we wish to}} celebrate <b>your</b> <b>birthday</b> with you," [...] crowed the station's Beirut bureau chief, hailing Kuntar as a [...] "pan-Arab hero." ...|$|E

"I can understand, my dear, and am {{glad you}} enjoyed your {{stay in the}} city, because {{sometimes}} when I count <b>your</b> <b>birthdays</b> I can't help a fancy {{that you are not}} young enough," [...] she said. [...] "You have lived out here with two old people who belong to the past too much." ...|$|R
2500|$|While {{the title}} and the {{dialogue}} refer to Meg's planning a party to celebrate Stanley's birthday: [...] "It's <b>your</b> <b>birthday,</b> Stan. I was {{going to keep it}} a secret until tonight," [...] even that [...] "fact" [...] is dubious, as Stanley denies that it is his birthday: [...] "This isn't my birthday, Meg" [...] (48), telling Goldberg and McCann: [...] "Anyway, this isn't my birthday. [...] No, it's not until next month," [...] adding, in response to McCann's saying [...] "Not according to the lady ," [...] "Her? She's crazy. Round the bend" [...] (53).|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee's media {{exposure}} {{continued to}} grow when he appeared on The Colbert Report on August 16 and the season premiere of Real Time with Bill Maher on August 24. Colbert jokingly attributed Huckabee's success in the Ames Straw Poll to [...] "the Colbert bump" [...] in reference to Huckabee's two prior appearances on the show while Maher remarked, [...] "Rudy Giuliani scares {{the hell out of}} me so I hope you win, and the good news for you, on <b>your</b> <b>birthday,</b> is that this year a Republican dark horse could win." [...] The coverage from Colbert instigated the Who Made Huckabee? mock feud.|$|E
2500|$|The A.V. Club {{reviewer}} Michaelangelo Matos {{opined that}} [...] "while One Life Stands mindset is Hot Chip's most overtly serious, {{the album is}} also its most musically accomplished. The melodies are Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard's longest-lined, and the melodies often unfurl beautifully." [...] Ian Mathers of PopMatters viewed it as [...] "Hot Chip's most kinetic album" [...] and stated that [...] "One Life Stand may be less pleasingly idiosyncratic than Hot Chip's previous work, but it pays off in their most consistently winning set of songs to date. It's still not quite as raucous as their incredible live show, [...] but those who felt that Made in the Dark never built up enough momentum ought to find this one's straightforward drive more satisfying." [...] Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork named One Life Stand the band's [...] "most consistent and most complete record", but remarked that [...] "it's missing an A-list single on par with 'Boy From School', 'Over and Over', or 'Ready for the Floor'. It's also missing dance songs {{in the mode of}} the latter two, focusing instead on Hot Chip at their most lush and romantic." [...] Drowned in Sound's Hayden Woolley wrote that the album [...] "sees their familiar pick'n'mix genre-shopping combined with unprecedented levels of Mills & Boon sentimentality. It's a heady cocktail, but when mixed in the right proportions the results are stunning." [...] Jamie Fullerton of NME concluded that the album [...] "does have some of the best songs of the year on it. But, again, waiting for Hot Chip to make that classic album is a bit like waiting for an alcoholic parent to arrive at <b>your</b> <b>birthday</b> party. There's a kind of unconditional love that'll keep you hoping every time one comes around, but there may be a point where you have to accept that it's just never going to happen." [...] Chris Beanland of BBC Music felt that [...] "his is an imbalanced record, and one that leaves you frustrated rather than elated. But despite the blips, they have dished up at least two cerebral bangers here." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent characterised it as [...] "an album full of earnest endeavour, but lacking verve and creative zest." ...|$|E
