25|$|Why do {{you retire}} from me? I can easily follow <b>you</b> <b>anywhere,</b> and be where you are. It {{is much better}} for you to return to your own estate, and not be quitting it on my account. You see well that if I wished it I could take away all you have, but I am not {{inclined}} to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Her father wasn't {{completely}} {{supportive of}} her basketball interest, calling her {{in from the}} neighbor's basketball hoop, telling her, [...] "Basketball won't take <b>you</b> <b>anywhere.</b> Come in and do your algebra." [...] Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn't {{going to take her}} anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, she thought she was too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary's Athletic Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|Austin's rise {{to stardom}} {{began at the}} 1996 King of the Ring. He began using his {{trademark}} finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament. After defeating Marc Mero in the semi-finals, Austin defeated Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts in the finals. The Stunner debuted on June 8, 1996 on Superstars when he defeated jobber Jason Arndt, who later became known as Joey Abs {{a member of the}} Mean Street Posse. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts, [...] "You sit there and you thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get <b>you</b> <b>anywhere!</b> Talk about your Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck. Triple H was originally scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring, but was punished for the infamous Curtain Call incident that had transpired earlier that year. [...] "Austin 3:16" [...] ultimately {{became one of the most}} popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history. It is also credited as the iconic moment that began the WWF's [...] "Attitude Era".|$|E

6000|$|... “What! is {{this the}} little man that used to talk Latin and fetch our bowls? How tall thou art grown! I protest I should have known <b>thee</b> <b>anywhere.</b> And so <b>you</b> have turned ruffian and fighter; and wanted to measure swords with Mohun, did you? I protest that Mohun said at the Guard dinner yesterday, {{where there was a}} pretty company of us, that the young fellow wanted to fight him, and was the better man of the two.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. <b>You</b> can go <b>anywhere</b> <b>you</b> please during off hours {{so long as}} {{you don't}} go out of bounds," [...] was the reply. [...] "If {{you want to go out}} of bounds, you have to report at the office and get permission." ...|$|R
