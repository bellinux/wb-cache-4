5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day and Age in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day and Age takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E

"Within a dozen, upon my honor; my best picking is {{when the}} corps is detached; for when we are with the main army, {{there are so many}} boys to be satisfied, that I seldom get a good subject.

60|$|It {{happened}} thus. There was a Marquesan in {{the train}} of Pomaree who officiated as nurse to her children. According to the Tahitian custom, the royal <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> carried about until it requires no small degree of strength to stand up under them. But Marbonna was just the man for this--large and muscular, well made as a statue, and with an arm like a degenerate Tahitian's thigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] exclaimed Oldbuck, [...] "what is {{the meaning}} of all this? Have we got Hiren here?--We'll have no swaggering <b>youngsters.</b> <b>Are</b> you come from the wars abroad, to stir up {{domestic}} strife in our peaceful land? Are you like bull-dog puppies, forsooth, that when the bull, poor fellow, is removed from the ring, fall to brawl among themselves, worry each other, and bite honest folk's shins that are standing by?" ...|$|E
60|$|Many years since, when I {{was a young}} man, and {{had just}} left Oxford, I was sent on the grand tour to finish my education. I believe my parents had {{tried in vain to}} {{inoculate}} me with wisdom; so they sent me to mingle with society, in hopes I might take it the natural way. Such, at least, appears to be the reason for which nine-tenths of our <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> sent abroad.|$|E

6000|$|... "Them two city-bred <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> {{having the}} worst {{end of this}} queer cruise," [...] the sailor said thoughtfully. [...] "To an old moss-back like me, it don't make much {{difference}} whether he's on the Bahamas or the Sandwich Islands, providin' there's plenty of grub; but the lads must come pretty nigh eatin' their hearts out sometimes when they think of home an' the sadness that's in it through their disappearin' so mysterious-like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish I {{had been}} at home' said the Captain, who had taken a great fancy to Felix when they had been {{together}} in London two years before; 'but I've been giving my boy and his cousins, the two young Somervilles, {{a trip to the}} Hebrides; and now, just as I am come home, I fall upon Mrs. Brandon, hounding me out to an abominable picnic, and my <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> wild to go.

60|$|Imagine {{the long}} sunny {{hours of a}} Saturday {{afternoon}} insensibly slipping away, as we <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> exploring the length and breadth of a trout stream, or chasing gray squirrels, or building mud milldams in the brook. The sun sinks lower and lower, but we still think it does not want {{half an hour to}} sundown. At last, he so evidently is really going down, that {{there is no room for}} scepticism or latitude of opinion on the subject; and with many a lingering regret, we began to put away our fish-hooks, and hang our hoops over our arm, preparatory to trudging homeward.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, {{this was}} true; for tadpoles always become frogs {{when a few}} days old. The {{children}} told us they had been quite comfortable inside the great fish, but they were now hungry, for young frogs always have wonderful appetites. So Mrs. Frog and I set to work to feed them, and had just finished this pleasant task when your soldiers came to arrest me. I assure your Majesty {{this is the first}} time I have been out of the water for a week. And now, if you will permit me to depart, I will hop back home and see how the <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> growing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{stopped there}} a week. Your sister seems {{perfectly}} happy, and plays {{the part of}} queen of the county admirably. The four <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> jolly little things. As to your mother, you will find very little change in her. I really don't think that she looks a day older than when we saw her off, at Calcutta, something like ten years ago. Of course, then she was cut up with her loss; but quiet and comfort have agreed with her, and the climate {{is a good deal}} less trying than it is out here. At any rate, I should not take her for a day over forty, and she is something like five years older than that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That 'rithmetic do bother me, an' no mistake," [...] he said, with a grave {{shake of}} the head at a lively lizard which was looking up in his face. [...] "You see, history is easy. What I knows I knows an' can teach, an' what I don't know I let alone, an there's an end on't. There's no makin' a better o' that. Then, as to writin', though my hand is crabbed enough, and my pot-hooks are shaky and sprawly, still I know the shapes o' things, an' the <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> so quick that they can most of 'em write better than myself; but in regard to that 'rithmetic, it's a heartbreak altogether, for I've only just got enough of it to puzzle me. Wi' the use o' my fingers I can do simple {{addition}} pretty well, an' I can screw round subtraction, but multiplication's a terrible business. Unfort'nitely my edication has carried me only the length o' the fourth line, an' that ain't enough." ...|$|E

[...] "It's as if the morbid condition was an evil creature which, when it found itself closely hunted, flew at the throat of its pursuer. If you worry the microbes too much they may worry you. I've seen cases of it, and not necessarily in microbic diseases either. There was, of course, the well-known instance of Liston and the aneurism; and a dozen others that I could mention. You couldn't have a clearer case than that of poor old Walker of St. Christopher's. Not heard of it? Well, of course, it was a little before your time, but I wonder that it should have been forgotten. You <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> so busy in keeping up to the day that you lose a good deal that is interesting of yesterday.|$|E
60|$|This is {{a chapter}} devoted to reminiscences {{of what was}} a very happy and splendid time with me, but {{presenting}} little of mark {{in the way of}} adventure; as is generally the case when times are happy and easy. It would seem idle to fill pages with accounts of the every-day occupations of a man of fashion,--the fair ladies who smiled upon him, the dresses he wore, the matches he played, and won or lost. At this period of time, when <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> employed cutting the Frenchmen's throats in Spain and France, lying out in bivouacs, and feeding off commissariat beef and biscuit, they would not understand what a life their ancestors led; and so I shall leave further discourse upon the pleasures of the times when even the Prince was a lad in leading-strings, when Charles Fox had not subsided into a mere statesman, and Buonaparte was a beggarly brat in his native island.|$|E
6000|$|Mackitchinson's {{wine was}} really good, and had its effect upon {{the spirits of}} the elder guest, who told some good stories, cut some sly jokes, and at length entered into a learned {{discussion}} concerning the ancient dramatists; a ground on which he found his new acquaintance so strong, that at length he began to suspect he had made them his professional study. [...] "A traveller partly for business and partly for pleasure?--why, the stage partakes of both; it is a labour to the performers, and affords, or is meant to afford, pleasure to the spectators. He seems, in manner and rank, above the class of young men who take that turn; but I remember hearing them say, that the little theatre at Fairport was to open with the performance of a young gentleman, being his first appearance on any stage.--If this should be thee, Lovel!--Lovel? yes, Lovel or Belville are just the names which <b>youngsters</b> <b>are</b> apt to assume on such occasions--on my life, I am sorry for the lad." ...|$|E
