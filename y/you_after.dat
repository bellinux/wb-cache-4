500|$|In 1920, {{at the age}} of 20, Coward {{starred in}} his own play, the light comedy I'll Leave It to <b>You.</b> <b>After</b> a tryout in Manchester, it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in 2006), his first {{full-length}} play in the West End. Neville Cardus's praise in The Manchester Guardian was grudging. Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. The Observer commented, [...] "Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days." [...] The Times, on the other hand, was enthusiastic: [...] "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head – spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'." ...|$|E

[...] Critical reception towards the song was positive, with critics complimenting its piano melody.

The song was also commercially successful, peaking within the top ten in more than ten countries. It also peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the charts in Canada, Greece and the US Adult Pop Songs chart.

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song refer to a spirit that haunts {{the memory of a}} grieving loved one. Similar to several other songs written by Moody, the lyrics {{of the song}} are based on a short story he had {{previously}} written. According to Lee, it was [...] "Ben 's song." [...] Moody said that the song talks about [...] "a spirit staying with <b>you</b> <b>after</b> its death and haunting you until you actually wish that the spirit were gone because it won't leave you alone." [...] He also stated in the booklet of Fallen that he dedicated the song to his grandfather, Bill Holcomb. In [...] "My Immortal", Lee expresses her feelings through the line, [...] "Though you're still with me / I've been alone all along."

[...] Mark Kermode from the BBC said that the film is a [...] "pretty solid and ambitious adaptation of a very complex book", but he criticised the post-converted 3D. Christy Lemire of the Associated Press gave the film [...] out of 4 stars and said [...] "While Deathly Hallows: Part 2 offers long-promised answers, it also dares to pose some eternal questions, and it'll stay with <b>you</b> <b>after</b> the final chapter has closed."

Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether {{we will continue to}} support <b>you</b> <b>after</b> this...You people have broken a lot of dishes and now we have to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

500|$|Ponsford used a heavy bat——nicknamed [...] "Big Bertha". Opposition players {{sometimes}} {{joked that}} Ponsford's bat {{was larger than}} allowed under the laws of cricket and indeed in one match in Sydney, it {{was found to be}} slightly larger than permitted—the result of the bat spreading from his powerful hitting. Throughout his innings, Ponsford would pull his cap further to the left. Robinson claimed that [...] "if you saw the peak at a rakish angle towards his left ear you could tell he was heading for his second hundred". When volunteering for service with the Royal Australian Air Force, Ponsford discovered he possessed abnormal colour vision, unable to distinguish red from green. The examining doctor was astonished and asked Ponsford, [...] "What colour did [...] look to <b>you</b> <b>after</b> it was worn?" [...] Ponsford replied, [...] "I never noticed its colour, only its size."

500|$|Smith soon {{tired of}} Sloan's off-track antics, which {{included}} lavish parties and often arrogant statements that questioned Smith's {{judgment on the}} track. A case in point was Sloan's behavior prior to the running of 1897 Brooklyn Handicap which occurred over a sloppy, mud-laden track that year. Sloan had won several races on Belmar, a gray 5-year old by Belvidere, and felt confident that the horse would win the Brooklyn Handicap, openly criticizing Smith's choice of Howard Mann {{in front of his}} other employees. However, Smith knew that Belmar was not a fast runner in the mud and that Sloan would not push the horse to win because he disliked being splattered with mud. Smith instead put Skeets Martin, who was better at racing on sloppy tracks, on the 4-year old Howard Mann. He advised Martin to, [...] "Use your own judgment with this horse, and don't bother about Belmar. Tod probably won't be anywhere near <b>you</b> <b>after</b> the first hundred yards." [...] Howard Mann won easily, winning $50,000 for Smith, while Belmar finished in 8th place. When James R. Keene asked Smith in late 1897 for permission to take Sloan to England to race in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Smith accepted the offer. Sloan achieved great success while racing in England, but he lost his racing license permanently in 1900. Sloan and Smith remained friends after dissolving their partnership, the later loaning Sloan $5,000 without interest after his license was revoked. After Sloan's departure, Smith used Skeets Martin as his principal jockey, but in 1899 Martin also left the US for better racing prospects in England. Willie Shaw was ultimately hired to replace Sloan and raced for Smith from 1899 until 1903.|$|E
