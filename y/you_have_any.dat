500|$|Many songs {{performed}} by Welch and Rawlings contain dark themes about social outcasts struggling against such elements as poverty, drug addiction, death, a disconnection from their family, and an unresponsive God. Despite Welch being the lead singer, {{several of these}} characters are male. [...] Welch has commented, [...] "To be commercial, everybody wants happy love songs. People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> happy love songs?' Well, {{as a matter of}} fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts." [...] To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs.

TIME ranked Avatar number 3 in their list of [...] "The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)" [...] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-TIME 100 list, and IGN listed Avatar as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.|$|E
500|$|The audio {{equipment}} and record review magazine Stereo Review named Nilsson Sings Newman their {{album of the}} year. Even so, the album did not sell well, possibly because of the [...] "idiosyncratic quality" [...] of its ballads and the paucity of reviews. Newman {{said in an interview}} how he personally went to assess the sales of the album at a record store in Los Angeles. He asked a clerk (who did not recognize him) [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> Nilsson albums?" [...] and the clerk guided him through each one, describing its sales and whether he recommended it. He came to Nilsson Sings Newman and said, [...] "this is the one that nearly finished him off." [...] In one of the few reviews, the weekly magazine Cue in New York praised the artistry saying that [...] "Nilsson was dealing with material as powerful as his own, but was free to concentrate entirely on his gifts as a performer."
