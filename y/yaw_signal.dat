40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{development}} and initial testing of a digital resolver to replace existing analog signal processing instrumentation. Radiometers, mounted directly {{on one of the}} fully articulated blades, are electrically connected through a slip ring to analog signal processing circuitry. The measured signals are periodic with azimuth angle and are resolved into harmonic components, with 0 deg over the tail. The periodic nature of the helicopter blade motion restricts the frequency content of each flapping and <b>yaw</b> <b>signal</b> to the fundamental and harmonics of the rotor rotational frequency. A minicomputer is employed to collect these data and then plot them graphically in real time. With this and other information generated by the instrumentation, a helicopter test pilot can then adjust the helicopter model's controls to achieve the desired aerodynamic test conditions...|$|E

To control roll, twin engines with differential pitch or <b>yaw</b> control <b>signals</b> are used to provide torque about the vehicle's roll axis.|$|R
40|$|Gaze {{stabilization}} was quantified {{in subjects}} (n= 11) {{as they walked}} on a motorized treadmill (1. 8 m/s) and viewed visual targets at two viewing distances. A "far" target was positioned at 4 m (FAR) {{in front of the}} subject and the "near" target was placed at a distance of 0. 5 m (NEAR). A direct measure of visual acuity was used to assess the overall effectiveness of the gaze stabilization system. The contributions of nonocular mechanisms to the gaze goal were also quantified using a measure of the distance between the subject and point in space where fixation of the visual target would require the least eye movement amplitude (i. e. the head fixation distance (HFD)). Kinematic variables mirrored those of previous investigations with the vertical trunk translation and head pitch signals, and the lateral translation and head <b>yaw</b> <b>signals</b> maintaining what appear as antiphase relationships. However, an investigation of the temporal relationships between the maxima and minima of the vertical translation and head pitch signals show that while the maximum in vertical translation occurs at the point of the minimum head pitch signal, the inverse is not true. The maximum in the head pitch signal lags the vertical translation minimum by an average of greater than 12 percent of the step cycle time. Three HFD measures, one each for data in the sagittal and transverse planes, and one that combined the movements from both planes, all revealed changes between the FAR and NEAR target viewing conditions. This reorganization of the nonocular degrees of freedom while walking was consistent with a strategy to reduce the magnitude of the eye movements required when viewing the NEAR target. Despite this reorganization, acuity measures show that image stabilization is not occurring while walking and viewing the NEAR target. Group means indicate that visual acuity is not affected while walking in the FAR condition, but a decrement of 0. 15 logMAR (i. e. 1. 5 eye chart lines) exists between the standing and walking acuity measures when viewing the NEAR target...|$|R
30|$|Many cues {{can be used}} to {{estimate}} the maneuver intention of a driver, for example the physical state of the vehicle (position, speed, heading, acceleration, <b>yaw</b> rate, turn <b>signal,</b> etc.), information about the road network (geometry and topology of the road, speed limit, traffic rules, etc.), driver behavior (head movement, driving style, etc.). Maneuver intention estimation has been investigated by many works. This survey focuses on maneuver intention estimation at road intersections, but most of the approaches presented here can be applied to other traffic situations.|$|R
40|$|For {{experiments}} at {{the torque}} meter, flies are kept on standard fly medium at 25 °C and 60 % humidity with a 12 hr light/ 12 hr dark regime. A standardized breeding regime assures proper larval density and age-matched cohorts. Cold-anesthetized flies are glued with head and thorax to a triangle-shaped hook {{the day before}} the experiment. Attached to the torque meter via a clamp, the fly's intended flight maneuvers are measured as the angular momentum around its vertical body axis. The fly is placed {{in the center of a}} cylindrical panorama to accomplish stationary flight. An analog to digital converter card feeds the <b>yaw</b> torque <b>signal</b> into a computer which stores the trace for later analysis. The computer also controls a variety of stimuli which can be brought under the fly's control by closing the feedback loop between these stimuli and the yaw torque trace.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a semi-global exponentially stable {{output feedback control}} law for automatic heading control of ships described by a nonlinear model. Only compass #yaw angle# feedback is used. The <b>yaw</b> rate <b>signal</b> is reconstructed by a linear observer. A wave #lter {{is included in the}} observer to reduce wear and tear on the rudder servo due to 1 st-order wave-induced disturbances. Integral action is included in the control law to compensate for wave drift # 2 nd-order wave disturbances #, low-frequency wind and current disturbances. The performance and robustness of the controller are demonstrated in a simulation study of two medium-sized ships. 1 Introduction Conventional autopilots for ships require feedback from the yaw angle and yaw rate. Most ships, however, are only equipped with a gyro or a magnetic compass to measure the yaw angle. Hence, the yaw rate must be estimated by using a state estimator #observer#. In addition to this, the yaw angle measurement is corrupted with wave- [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{closed loop}} fuzzy motion control system {{including}} on-line Kalman's filter (KF) {{for the two}} dimensional motion of underactuated and underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is presented. Since the sway force is unactuated, new continuous and discrete time models are developed using a polar transformation. A new hierarchical control architecture is developed, where the high level fuzzy guidance controller generates the surge speed and the yaw rate needed {{to achieve the objective}} of planar motion, while the low level controller gives the thruster surge force and the <b>yaw</b> control <b>signals.</b> The Fuzzy controller ensures robustness with respect to uncertainties due to the marine environment, forward surge speed and saturation of the control signals. Also Lyapunov's stability of the motion errors is proved based on the properties of the fuzzy maps. If Inertial Measurement Unit data (IMU) is employed for the feedback directly, aleatory noises due to accelerometers and gyros damage the performances of the motion control. These noises denote a king of non parametric uncertainty which perturbs the model of the ROV. Therefore a KF is inserted in the feedback of the control system to compensate for the above uncertainties and estimate the feedback signals with more precision...|$|R
40|$|We used {{wild type}} Canton S and radish mutant Drosophila flies as in van Swinderen & Brembs (2010). However, the genetic {{background}} was now changed to the Canton S strain of Thomas Préat, {{to test for}} {{the stability of the}} effect across genetic backgrounds. Flies were tethered as described previously (Maye et al., 2007) and tested the following day for flight behavior (for a video of the procedure, see Brembs, 2008). The duration of the experiments had to be confined to 6 min because radish mutants were reluctant to fly continuously in the arena, sampling rate 20 Hz. In this experiment, four identical stripes were placed {{in the center of the}} four quadrants on the wall of a cylindrical drum. The fly was placed in the center of that drum, attached to a torque meter. The angular speed of arena rotation was made inversely proportional to the <b>yaw</b> torque <b>signal</b> of the fly (Dill et al., 1993; Brembs and Heisenberg, 2000, 2001). Power spectra were computed from the yaw torque data.

Veh. 6 (1) : 82 - 92, 2013, doi: 10. 4271 / 2013 - 01 - 0674. This paper {{presents}} {{the implementation of}} an off-line optimized torque vectoring controller on an electric-drive vehicle with four in-wheel motors for driver assistance and handling performance enhancement. The controller takes vehicle longitudinal, lateral, and <b>yaw</b> acceleration <b>signals</b> as feedback using the concept of state-derivative feedback control. The objective of the controller is to optimally control the vehicle motion according to the driver commands. Reference signals are first calculated using a driver command interpreter to accurately interpret what the driver intends for the vehicle motion. The controller then adjusts the braking/throttle outputs based on discrepancy between the vehicle response and the interpreter command. A test vehicle equipped with four in-wheel electric motors, vehicle sensors, communication buses, and dSPACE rapid prototyping hardware is instrumented and the control performance is verified through vehicle handling tests under different driving conditions.

40|$|A spinner {{anemometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the yaw misalignment and flow inclination experienced by a wind turbine. Previous calibration methods used to calibrate a spinner anemometer for flow angle measurements were based on measurements of a spinner anemometer with default settings (arbitrary values, generally k 1,d  [*]=[*]  1 and k 2,d  [*]=[*]  1) and a reference <b>yaw</b> misalignment <b>signal</b> measured with a yaw position sensor. The yaw position sensor is normally present in wind turbines for control purposes; however, such a signal is not always available for a spinner anemometer calibration. Therefore, an additional yaw position sensor was installed prior to the spinner anemometer calibration. An innovative method to calibrate the spinner anemometer without a yaw positions sensor was then developed. It was noted that a non-calibrated spinner anemometer that overestimates (underestimates) the inflow angle will also overestimate (underestimate) the wind speed when there is a yaw misalignment. The new method leverages the non-linearity of the spinner anemometer algorithm to find the calibration factor  F α by an optimization process that minimizes the dependency of the wind speed on the yaw misalignment. The new calibration method was found to be rather robust, with F α  values within ± 2. 7  % of the mean value for four successive tests at the same rotor position...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{shows that}} an active front {{steering}} control {{can be designed}} {{taking into account the}} nonlinear behaviour of the tire-road forces considering the vehicle dynamics with respect to the tire sideslip angle and by approximating the tire force characteristics by piecewise affine functions. The proposed control strategy involves the design of two control loops: the first one is a state feedback and it is designed to improve the vehicle dynamics using the pole placement techniques while the second control loop uses a PI control to ensure the tracking of constant <b>yaw</b> rate reference <b>signal</b> {{on the basis of the}} yaw rate tracking error despite constant disturbances and parameters uncertainties. Several simulations, including disturbances rejections and step references, are carried out on a standard CarSim D-Class vehicle model to explore the robustness with respect to unmodelled effects such as combined lateral and longitudinal tire forces, pitch, roll and driver dynamics. The simulations confirm that the proposed PWL control can greatly improve the vehicle stability and may be advantageous in very demanding manoeuvres in comparison with the use of the proposed controller designed for the linear region only...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{integrated}} {{vehicle dynamics}} control system is developed {{in this paper}} {{by a combination of}} active front steering (AFS) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) based on fuzzy logic control. The control system has a hierarchical structure consisting of two layers. A fuzzy logic controller is used in the upper layer (yaw rate controller) to keep the yaw rate in its desired value. The yaw rate error and its rate of change are applied to the upper controlling layer as inputs, where the direct <b>yaw</b> moment control <b>signal</b> and the steering angle correction of the front wheels are the outputs. In the lower layer (fuzzy integrator), a fuzzy logic controller is designed based on the working region of the lateral tire forces. Depending on the directions of the lateral forces at the front wheels, a switching function is activated to adjust the scaling factor of the fuzzy logic controller. Using a nonlinear seven degrees of freedom vehicle model, the simulation results illustrate considerable improvements which are achieved in vehicle handling through the integrated AFS/DYC control system in comparison with the individual AFS or DYC controllers.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} flowfield of turbulent jet issuing from rectangular nozzle (Aspect Ratio= 12. 5) with {{a rectangular}} notch at the midspan, {{has been investigated}} experimentally. Four aspect ratios of rectangular notch (NAR: Notch Aspect Ratio) used in this experiment were 2. 5, 7. 5, 12. 5 and 165. The Reynolds number based on the nozzle width d and the exit mean velocity Ue, was kept constant 30000 (NAR= 2. 5 and 7. 5), 15000 (NAR= 12. 5) and 13000 (NAR= 165), respectively. Longitudinal mean velocity and turbulent intensities were measured using an X-array Hot-Wire Probe (5 µm in diameter, 1 mm effective length) operated by the linearized constant temperature anemometers (DANTEC), and the spanwise and the lateral mean velocities were measured using a <b>yaw</b> meter. The <b>signals</b> from the anemometers were passed through the low-pass filters and sampled using A. D. converter. The processing of the signals was made by a personal computer.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from large eddy simulation (LES) of the flow around a simplified train model moving through a crosswind flow. The results are compared with the experimental data from previous experimental study by Suzuki et al. [1] who used a model train with 1 / 60 scale that was moved along a 4 m linear guide rail {{placed in front of}} a wind tunnel nozzle. The train in the present numerical work is stationary and the influence of the train movement is simulated by changing the boundary conditions. In addition to the simulation of the flow around the moving model, another simulation of the flow around a steady model influenced by the maximum crosswind from the moving case was made and the results are compared with the moving case. Comparison of the LES results with the experimental data from [1] showed good agreement proving that LES is capable of accurately predicting the dynamic change of the aerodynamic coefficients caused by the motion of the model through the wind profile. The aerodynamic moments and forces are computed and the results from the dynamic and the steady case were compared. Overshoots in several aerodynamic coefficients of the moving case over the steady case were observed. The yawing moment coefficient displayed an overshoot of some 30 % indicating the importance of performing the dynamic tests for the purpose of satisfying the safety conditions. The large difference between the front and the rear part of the body in the distribution of the flow structures attached to the lee side of the body were found to cause the overshoot in the <b>yawing</b> moment <b>signal</b> during the dynamic case simulations. The instantaneous trailing vortices responsible for much of the aerodynamic stability of the vehicle when it enters the crosswind region were analysed. Several differences between the trailing vortices resulting from the dynamic and the steady cases were observed. These flow structures were found have a shape that changed during the cross flow passage. During their evolution, some of them obtained, for some time instances, the shape of the vortices in the steady case while other (such as the trailing vortex around the lower front edge) never reached exactly the same shape of the structure as in the steady case...|$|R
40|$|The mean flowfield of {{a linear}} array of {{multiple}} rectangular jets run through transversely with a two-dimensional jet, has been investigated, experimentally. The object of this experiment is to operate both the velocity {{scale and the}} length scale of the multiple rectangular jets using a two-dimensional jet. The reason of the adoption of this nozzle exit shape {{was caused by the}} reports of authors in which the cruciform nozzle promoted the inward secondary flows strongly on both the two jet axes. Aspect ratio of the rectangular nozzle used in this experiment was 12. 5. Reynolds number based on the nozzle width d and the exit mean velocity Ue (≅ 39 m / s) was kept constant 25000. Longitudinal mean velocity was measured using an X-array Hot-Wire Probe (lh = 3. 1 μm in diameter, dh = 0. 6 mm effective length : dh / lh = 194) operated by the linearized constant temperature anemometers (DANTEC), and the spanwise and the lateral mean velocities were measured using a <b>yaw</b> meter. The <b>signals</b> from the anemometers were passed through the low-pass filters and sampled using A. D. converter. The processing of the signals was made by a personal computer. Acquisition time of the signals was usually 60 seconds. From this experiment, it was revealed that the magnitude of the inward secondary flows on both the y and z axes in the upstream region of the present jet was promoted by a two-dimensional jet which run through transversely perpendicular to the multiple rectangular jets, therefore the potential core length on the x axis of the present jet extended 2. 3 times longer than that of the multiple rectangular jets, and the half-velocity width on the rectangular jet axis of the present jet was suppressed 41 % shorter compared with that of the multiple rectangular jets...|$|R
