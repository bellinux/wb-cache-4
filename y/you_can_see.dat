Benches and observation decks dot the park and Haikus about the windmills, submitted for Ikata's Windmill Festival, are on display year-round.|$|E
5|$|What Bethesda had {{originally}} disclosed to us, as an example: In {{that section of}} the game, there is a hanging corpse. What they disclosed to us was a hanging corpse in the dark, pretty far away and without much detail. And yet, when you bring a torch up to the hanging corpse in the actual game, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that it's very mutilated with lots of blood and bones. That {{was a very different}} depiction, far more intense, far more extreme than what had been disclosed to us.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} shrines {{in the city}} include Inaba Shrine, Kogane Shrine, and Kashimori Shrine. They are {{considered}} a family of shrines because the Inishiki Irihiko-no-mikoto god at Inaba Shrine is married to the Nunoshi Hime-mikoto goddess at Kogane Shrine; together, they are {{the parents of the}} Ichihaya-no-mikoto God at Kashimori Shrine. Inaba Shrine was originally located on the northern side of Mount Kinka, but was moved to its present location by Saitō Dōsan during his reign over Gifu. Kogane Shrine is located in Kogane Park, behind the Gifu City Culture Center, and a popular legend says that, behind Kashimori Shrine, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the footprints of Tenba, a mythical horse.|$|E
5|$|It {{is mounted}} on a {{rectangular}} cast-iron column of two-tons weight that rests on the masonry pier. Through a glass door in the column <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the driving clock that keeps the telescope turning westward just {{as fast as the}} stars go, so that a star remains in view as long as the astronomer wishes to observe it. The telescope turns on two axes {{at the top of the}} column. One axis slants upwards toward the north pole of the heavens; the other at right angles to it, and it is to this one that the tube of the telescope is attached. Two large circles provide graduated scales for locating objects by their coordinates. The instrument can be turned on these axes toward any part of the sky. It is a heavy instrument, but so perfectly balanced that the astronomer moves it easily with one hand.|$|E
