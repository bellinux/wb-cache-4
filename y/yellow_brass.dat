50|$|In {{appearance}} the pelisse was characteristically a {{very short}} and extremely tight fitting (when worn) jacket, the cuffs and collar of which were trimmed with fur. The jacket was further decorated with patterns sewn in bullion lace. The front of the jacket was distinctive and featured several rows of parallel frogging and loops, and either three or five lines of buttons. For officers of the British Hussars this frogging, regimentally differentiated, was generally of gold or silver bullion lace, to match either gold (gilt) or silver buttons. Other ranks had either <b>yellow</b> lace with <b>brass</b> buttons or white lace with 'white-metal' buttons. Lacing varied from unit to unit and country to country. The pelisse was usually worn slung over the left shoulder, {{in the manner of}} a short cloak, over a jacket of similar style - but without the fur lining or trim - called a dolman jacket. It was held in place by a lanyard. In cold weather the pelisse could be worn over the dolman.

A simulation curve is obtained from the model. Burnishing process experiments have been undertaken in which <b>yellow</b> <b>brass</b> H 62 was selected as the specimen material and a new cylindrical polycrystalline diamond tool developed by the authors was employed in the burnishing process.

In the theoretical part important properties of ozone, possibilities of its production, methods of ozone determination and relation of ozone to different solid surfaces were described. In the experimental part there was investigated how much ozone is decomposed by five commonly available metal materials (stainless steel, <b>yellow</b> <b>brass,</b> copper, aluminium and iron). Measurements were realized in the glass tube (Liebig condenser). Hollow pipes made of particular material were inserted into this tube. Ozone passed through this glass tube and ozone concentration was determined on its output by two methods: the iodometric titration and spectrophotometry. Several series were measured and compared by different set-up conditions like reaction time, experimental parameters (flow rate of air, input power of the ozone generator) and two types of gas – technical and synthetic air (because moisture contained in technical air can cause ozone decomposition) were used. The most suitable materials – stainless steel and aluminium were determined according to gained results...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{behavior of}} copper alloys cast in permanent molds was investigated. This {{is one of the}} least studied subjects in copper alloy castings. Grain refinement is not widely practiced for leaded copper alloys cast in sand molds. Aluminum bronzes and high strength yellow brasses, cast in sand and permanent molds, were usually fine grained due to the presence of more than 2 % iron. Grain refinement of the most common permanent mold casting alloys, leaded <b>yellow</b> <b>brass</b> and its lead-free replacement EnviroBrass III, is not universally accepted due to the perceived problem of hard spots in finished castings and for the same reason these alloys contain very low amounts of iron. The yellow brasses and Cu-Si alloys are gaining popularity in North America due to their low lead content and amenability for permanent mold casting. These alloys are prone to hot tearing in permanent mold casting. Grain refinement is one of the solutions for reducing this problem. However, to use this technique it is necessary to understand the mechanism of grain refinement and other issues involved in the process. The following issues were studied during this three year project funded by the US Department of Energy and the copper casting industry: (1) Effect of alloying additions on the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys and their interaction with grain refiners; (2) Effect of two grain refining elements, boron and zirconium, on the grain size of four copper alloys, <b>yellow</b> <b>brass,</b> EnviroBrass II, silicon brass and silicon bronze and the duration of their effect (fading); (3) Prediction of grain refinement using cooling curve analysis and use of this method as an on-line quality control tool; (4) Hard spot formation in <b>yellow</b> <b>brass</b> and EnviroBrass due to grain refinement; (5) Corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys; (6) Transfer the technology to permanent mold casting foundries; It was found that alloying elements such as tin and zinc do not change the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys. Aluminum promoted b phase formation and modified the grain structure from dendritic to equiaxed. Lead or bismuth reduces the size of grains, but not change the morphology of the structure in Cu-Zn alloys. The grain size of the Cu-Zn-alloy can be reduced from 3000 mm to 300 mm after the addition of aluminum and lead. Similar effects were observed in EnviroBrass III after the addition of aluminum and bismuth. Boron refined the structure of yellow brasses in the presence of iron. At least 50 ppm of iron and 3 ppm of boron are necessary to cause grain refinement in these alloys. Precipitation of iron from the melt is identified as the cause of grain refinement. Boron initiates the precipitation of iron which could not be explained at this time. On the other hand zirconium causes some reduction in grain size in all four alloys investigated. The critical limit for the zirconium was found to be around 100 ppm below which not much refinement could be observed. The mechanism of grain refinement in the presence of zirconium could not be explained. Grain refinement by boron and iron can remain {{over a long period of}} time, at least for 72 hours of holding or after remelting few times. It is necessary to have the iron and boron contents above the critical limits mentioned earlier. On the other hand, refinement by zirconium is lost quite rapidly, some times within one hour of holding, mostly due to the loss of zirconium, most probably by oxidation, from the melt. In all the cases it is possible to revive the refinement by adding more of the appropriate refining element. Cooling curve analysis (thermal analysis) can be used successfully to predict the grain refinement in yellow brasses. The precipitation of iron in the liquid metal causes the metal to solidify without undercooling. Absence of this reaction, as indicated by the time-temperature (t-T) and its first derivative (dt/dT) curves, proved to be an indicator of refinement. The viability of the technique as an on-line quality control tool was proved in two foundries. The method can also correctly predict the onset of fading. The corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys was measured in two solutions having different hydrogen activities, pH 6 and pH 8, and compared with the base alloys. Potentiodynamic polarization and long term weight loss experiments were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance. Cu-Zn alloys were evaluated for dezincification. In general, the grain refined alloys performed marginally better than the base alloys...|$|E

The main objective {{of this study was}} to acquire scientific data to assess the production technology used in the making of these lamps. Optical microscopy, X-ray digital radiography and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS) were used to study the base, oil reservoir and the reflector of the selected lamps. SEM/EDS analysis showed that although the analyzed parts of the lamps have slightly different elemental compositions, they are all made out of <b>yellow</b> <b>brass</b> (Cu 70 % and Zn 30 %, in w. t.) and soft-solder (Pb-Sn alloy). The lamp bases alloys also contain tin, which increases the dezincification resistance, and lead was also found in one of the lamps, which is known to increase malleability and reduce the melting point of the alloy. Metallographic procedures were performed on two selected components of a lamp. Observation of as-cast and wrought brass microstructures support the main processing techniques used in manufacturing of this kind of objects. Likewise, the metallic phase encountered – alpha – of the Cu-Zn binary system – are in agreement with the elemental analysis performed. This study reveals the importance of the radiography analysis to obtain a better understanding of structural aspects, as much thickness and density as mechanical processes and their impact on the manufacture of the different elements of these lamps.

40|$|Water model {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} develop a two-stage stirring method for obtaining higher yields and a more uniform distribution of graphite particles in copper alloys. This was followed by several melts for synthesis of copper-graphite alloys in which Ti {{was used as a}} wetting agent to improve the wettability of graphite in the copper melt. In the first stage, a vortex method was employed to facilitate the addition of graphite particles into the copper melt. In the second stage, a specially designed stirrer was used for uniform particle distribution while avoiding the formation of vortex in the melt. The two-stage stirring was found to considerably improve the recovery of graphite, over those obtained with the prior practice of single-stage stirring and resulting in a more uniform particle distribution. In addition, graphite recoveries increased with increasing Ti content in the range investigated. Floatation, fluidity, and directional solidification {{experiments were}} also conducted on copper-graphite alloys synthesized in this study. Fluidity tests showed that the spiral fluidity length of the <b>yellow</b> <b>brass</b> alloy increased with temperature and decreased with graphite. The fluidity of copper-graphite alloys investigated to-date remained adequate to make a variety of castings. The observations of casting microstructure under directional solidification and floatation showed that in certain castings the graphite particles remained agglomerated, and they readily floated to {{the upper part of the}} castings where they reduced the size of gains. However, even in the agglomerated form, the graphite particles improved the machinability of copper alloys in a manner similar to lead.

The purpose of this study was to show the correlation of the fracture-strength of four-unit zirconium-oxide bridges constructed with the CAD/CAM-designed LAVA-System, in a three point-bending test. Thereby special attention was placed on the different die materials and the influence of thermocycling on them. The die materials used were fibreglass-enforced resins (DC-Tell,Firm DCS), LAVA-Zirconiumoxide-ceramics (3 M ESPE) and <b>yellow</b> <b>brass.</b> Two dies of each material were embedded in Paladur Clear (Heraeus Kulzer), whereby a defined mobility of the dies was reached by a heat shrink tubing (3 M, type HSR) which was previously wrapped around the dental roots. For each group of die materials 20 bridges were cemented conventionally with zinc-oxide-phosphate cement (Hoffmann Berlin) and were then stored in 0, 9 % Sodiumchloride-solution for 21 days. Subsequently half of the bridges of each group were aged artificially through thermocycling. The results of the fracture strength test were analysed and described statistically with the t-test. The results showed that when using ceramic or metal dies, the fracture strength of the bridges were clearly higher than the bridges that were cemented on resin enforced dies. The artificial aging procedure through thermocycling had no significant influence in the case of ceramic or metal die materials, whereas it lead to a visible but not significant reduction of the fracture strength when full-ceramic bridges were cemented on fibre-enforced resin die material. In conclusion it can be noted that the fracture strength, that was detected for these ceramics, implies a clear indication for use in the cantilever region. The previous reconstruction of teeth using ceramic or brass core materials, even under constant influence of changing temperatures and fluids in the oral cavity, are clearly recommended. About the implementation of resin-based core materials, when testing these bridges clinically, no reliable conclusion can be done...|$|E
