[...] The Playboy, I Never Liked You, and several shorter pieces placed No.38 on The Comics Journals list of the best 100 English-language comics of the 20th century as [...] "The autobiographical comics from Yummy Fur". [...] Cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez asserted, [...] "The Playboy and I Never Liked <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> the best graphic novels next to Maus". [...] Critic Frank Young called it a [...] "pivotal work" [...] in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s. [...] Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading {{for those who are}} serious about comics and a [...] "landmark look at an artist's growth", referring to the pace with which Brown's work matured {{over the course of the}} three issues of its serialization.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{scarcely}} {{know what}} to think. I should think it <b>was</b> a lie. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> as tame three months ago as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> now. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> born tame, like {{most people in the}} world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] Deane answered, with {{a little}} bow. [...] "But I thought you told me, Miss Sinclair, that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> leaving us before long." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{composition}} [...] "Aujourd'hui C'est Toi" [...] (Today It's <b>You)</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> {{best known}} in the UK as the theme music for the long-running BBC television current affairs documentary series Panorama.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have since}} been {{thinking}} <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> right. I am sure {{you are in the}} principle of the thing. It was the particular application that startled me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Then {{the matter}} stands thus. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> aware that fuller's-earth is a {{valuable}} product, {{and that it is}} only found in one or two places in England?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where is}} the use of going on," [...] I asked, [...] "when <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{preparing}} some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No. Nobody {{knows where}} he <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the last to see him. What {{happened}} when you and he started {{for the long run}} this afternoon? You lost sight of the rest, did you not?' ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to these developments, several particularly difficult honkyoku pieces, e.g., Distant Call of the Deer (Shika no tone 鹿の遠音), became well known as [...] "tests": if you could play them, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> a real Fuke. If <b>you</b> couldn't, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> a spy and might very well <b>be</b> killed if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in unfriendly territory.|$|R
6000|$|... "'We {{have been}} to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so {{fortunate}} as to find you there, and being informed that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> walking in this direction, we followed, {{in the hope of}} overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By no means!' {{said his}} friend, {{slightly}} elevating his eye-brows. 'Here {{all men are}} equal. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> not aware that you are at present in the freest country in the world.' ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know whether}} you know Mariposa. If not, it is of no consequence, for if you know Canada at all, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> well acquainted with a dozen towns just like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "As <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{pretty well}} aware, Miss Harmer, {{we have not}} found it. And now {{let me ask you}} distinctly, do you, or do you not, know where your late brother's will is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Notwithstanding the fact," [...] Sir Edward {{reminded}} him quietly, [...] "that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> {{the last person}} to see Vanderpole alive? He came to the Savoy to call upon you before he got into the taxicab where he was murdered. That is so, isn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose one {{can only}} {{make the best of}} it; but {{considering}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> consulted before a warrant was issued, I can't help feeling astonished," [...] I said. [...] "However, there is no use in wasting words, and an hour will suffice me to get ready in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Flint never pretended," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Vane, coldly, [...] "that {{the nomination}} and {{election of a}} governor was anything but a business transaction. His regard for <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> unchanged, but the interests he has at stake are too large to admit of sentiment as a factor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I am very grateful," [...] he said angrily, [...] "and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{doing this because}} it suits you. In any case, your friends dare not have offered {{violence}} to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} impossible, sir," [...] I answered, respectfully. [...] "We {{are not exactly}} what we seem, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> deceived by our roundabouts; but we are {{the first and second}} {{officers}} of a letter-of-marque." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "since plain {{speaking}} seems admissible, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{aware that}} Laura Waynefleet has nothing beyond a kindly interest in me. She is, I needn't point out, a remarkably sensible young lady." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "…problems {{that arise}} {{naturally}} (i.e., from nature) do have solutions, so {{the assumption that}} things will work out eventually is justified experimentally {{without the need for}} existence sorts of proof. Assume everything is okay, and if the arrived-at solution works, <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> right, or at least right enough. …so why bother with the details that only show up in homework problems?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jane, <b>you</b> <b>are</b> mistaken: <b>probably</b> not one in {{the school}} either despises or dislikes you: many, I <b>am</b> sure, pity <b>you</b> much." ...|$|R
40|$|You’re {{driving down}} the street, and {{flashing}} red and blue lights appear in your rear view mirror. Time to get pulled over, or as the police call it a “traffic stop. ” <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> speeding or forgot to put your headlights on. Thank your personal deity that you haven 2 ̆ 7 t had a drink. You sink in your seat—the night just went from great to horrible...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{say what}} I think. But {{you would not}} have done that. And though you are not industrious, you are far too active and too clever for such a life. Now <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> in earnest as to the future.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget," [...] he observed, [...] "that a {{man does}} not look at his best after such an illness as Phillips has had. You find him, perhaps, a little insignificant. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> aware of his {{vocation}} and station in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt. Well, Lucy, I had {{intended}} to be kind to your Mr. Hamel, but, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> aware, I was not enabled to carry out my intentions. He {{seems to be a}} very independent sort of young man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask you no questions," [...] he said. [...] "The Baroness {{works on}} a higher plane. I know more than you would believe, though. I know why the dear lady went to Rome; I know why {{she was at the}} ball. I know in what respect <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> able to help her. But I ask no questions. We work towards a common end, but we work at {{opposite}} ends of the pole. Curiosity alone would <b>be</b> gratified if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to tell me everything that transpired." ...|$|R
50|$|Schachat {{has held}} {{a number of}} directorships during his {{business}} career. Schachat's early business background was in housing development, serving nine years with the Schachat housing group, Schachat Cullum. The housing group bought most of Ernst Erikson's sprawling Norscot estate in Witkoppen and divided it to create homes. Schachat's former wife described the profile of Schachat Cullum clients: Buying a Schachat Cullum house mean that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> professional, probably white, and this was your first time as a home-buyer.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Patience, young man,' {{said the}} unperturbed querist--'we are on serious business, and no idle {{etiquette}} must prevent its being discussed seriously. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> {{aware that you}} speak to a person proscribed by the severe and unjust laws of the present government?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are young}} and hasty," [...] he said. [...] "I may lament my friend's extravagances, without failing on that account in what is due to an old friendship. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> not aware {{that we have no}} sympathy in England with Socialists." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 142. This {{question}} of measurement is, as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>probably</b> aware, one much vexed in art schools; {{but it is}} determined indisputably by the very first words written by Lionardo: [...] "Il giovane deve prima imparare prospettiva, per le misure d'ogni cosa." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was obvious," [...] Allott remarked {{with some}} dryness. [...] "Sir James was very sore when you {{refused to come}} back, but he came round after a time. When he was ill he told Helen it was {{refreshing}} to find {{a man who could}} not <b>be</b> bought, and <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> better fitted for roughing it in Canada than the career he had planned for you. He added that he doubted if there <b>were</b> many like <b>you</b> in that country. Still I think if you had married Evelyn, you'd have got a larger share." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{assumed as}} much," [...] the Duke said. [...] "What <b>you</b> did see <b>was</b> this. <b>You</b> saw {{a meeting between}} the German Emperor and the Czar of Russia. It was marvellously well arranged, and except those {{interested}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> the only witness. According to the newspapers they were never less than four hundred miles apart, but on the day in question the Emperor {{was reported to be}} confined to his room by a slight chill, and the Czar to be resting after a fatiguing journey. You understand that this meeting was meant to be kept a profound secret?" ...|$|R
40|$|If {{you look}} at a map of the air {{temperature}} of the surface of the Earth, you will see that North West Europe, including the UK, is warmer than Alaska, which is at the same latitude but on the Pacific rather than Atlantic Ocean. At school <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>probably</b> told that this was because of the Gulf Stream. However, there is a very similar current in the Pacific—the Kuroshio—which takes warm water north past Japan and then out into the Atlantic. Peter Challenor asks: What is the unique feature of the Atlantic that keeps us warm and could it change in the next few years...|$|R
