5|$|Emergency {{ambulances}} {{are highly}} {{likely to be}} involved in hazardous situations, including incidents such as a road traffic collision, as these emergencies create people who are likely to be in need of treatment. They are required to gain access to patients as quickly as possible, and in many countries, are given dispensation from obeying certain traffic laws. For instance, {{they may be able to}} treat a red traffic light or stop sign as a <b>yield</b> <b>sign</b> ('give way'), or be permitted to break the speed limit. Generally, the priority of the response to the call will be assigned by the dispatcher, but the priority of the return will be decided by the ambulance crew based on the severity of the patient's illness or injury. Patients in significant danger to life and limb (as determined by triage) require urgent treatment by advanced medical personnel, and because of this need, emergency ambulances are often fitted with passive and active visual and/or audible warnings to alert road users.|$|E
25|$|In road transport, a <b>yield</b> <b>sign</b> or {{give way}} sign {{indicates}} that a vehicle driver must prepare to stop if necessary to let a driver on another approach proceed. However, {{there is no need}} to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The <b>yield</b> <b>sign,</b> but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer Clinton Riggs.|$|E
25|$|Like in the Netherlands, Belgium and France have a {{road sign}} that allows cyclists to {{turn right on}} a red light. The French and Belgian signs consist of a <b>yield</b> <b>sign</b> with a yellow bike and arrow inside. Such signs are placed under traffic lights.|$|E

5000|$|... {{flashing}} signals used {{in conjunction}} with warning signs (such as dangerous curves, speed limit reductions, school zones, signal ahead, low clearance, flooding, icing, or fog) and regulatory controls (such as Stop and <b>Yield</b> <b>signs).</b>|$|R
25|$|Intersection sight {{distance}} is the {{sight distance}} needed to safely proceed through an intersection. The distance needed {{depends on the}} type of traffic control at the intersection (uncontrolled, <b>yield</b> <b>sign,</b> stop sign or signal), and the maneuver (left turn, right turn, or proceeding straight). All-way stop intersections need the least, and uncontrolled intersections require the most. Intersection sight distance is a key factor in whether no control or yield control can be safely used, or more restrictive control in needed.|$|E
25|$|Police {{vehicles}} are often fitted with audible and visual warning systems to alert other motorists of their approach or {{position on the}} road. In many countries, use of the audible and visual warnings affords the officer a degree of exemption from road traffic laws (such {{as the right to}} exceed speed limits, or to treat red stop lights as a <b>yield</b> <b>sign)</b> and may also suggest a duty on other motorists {{to move out of the}} direction of passage of the police car or face possible prosecution.|$|E
25|$|All public {{crossings}} in the United States {{are required}} to be marked by at least a crossbuck. The 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices requires passive crossings (crossings without actuated flashing lights or gates) to have either stop signs or yield signs {{in addition to the}} crossbuck, unless a flagger will stop traffic every time a train approaches. Normally a <b>yield</b> <b>sign</b> is used, unless it is determined that all vehicles should stop at the crossing, such as a location with poor sight distance. All passive crossings must be upgraded to meet this standard by December 31, 2019.|$|E
5000|$|Chatham {{has only}} one traffic light; right turn on red is allowed at that intersection. It has 49 stop <b>signs,</b> 11 <b>yield</b> <b>signs,</b> and one traffic circle. In addition, there are 121 signs {{regulating}} parking.|$|R

25|$|In September 1991 {{construction}} {{began on}} a project to improve the circle. The project included an overpass that allows Route 202 to bypass the circle, and the inclusion of traffic signals. The project was completed in 1994. In {{the year after the}} overpass opened the circle saw 302 traffic accidents. In an attempt to lower the accident rate the New Jersey Department of Transportation installed yield ahead signs for approaching vehicles in February 1995. The signs made little difference and the accident rate remained high. Another attempt to make the circle safer came in November when the Transportation Department painted lane lines and arrows on the roads and replaced a <b>yield</b> <b>sign</b> with a stop sign. The new changes resulted in fewer accidents.|$|E

Lois goes on to instruct Peter {{that it is not a}} television, with Barbara interrupting and telling him it is actually the television channel PBS. Peter then interjects his hatred of PBS, after viewing a nine-part series on traffic signs by director and producer Ken Burns, the fourth of which on the <b>yield</b> <b>sign.</b> Later, after returning to dinner, Peter becomes an embarrassment to Lois, who recalls having dinner with Paul McCartney's ex-wife, Heather Mills, during which Peter began playing footsie with Mills, whose prosthetic leg ultimately falls off.|$|E

2500|$|The Idaho stop is {{the common}} name for a law that allows cyclists to treat a stop sign as a <b>yield</b> <b>sign,</b> and a red light as a stop sign. It first became law in Idaho in 1982, but was not adopted {{elsewhere}} until Delaware adopted a limited stop-as-yield law in 2017. [...] "Stop as Yield", a version that deals only with stop signs, has also expanded to parts of Colorado and been considered in several other states. Advocates argue that current law criminalizes normal cycling behavior, and that the Idaho stop makes cycling easier and safer and places the focus where it should be: on yielding the right-of-way.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} impactable signs that used the yield-symbol as approved by the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD) in the 2003 Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD). Impactable <b>yield</b> <b>signs</b> are low- costsignsconstructed of flexible material. The signs wereinstalled in the medians adjacent to crosswalks at selected non-signalized intersections to instruct drivers to yield the right-of-way to pedestrians. This paperexamines the effect on safety characteristics of the intersections of these signs at three stop-sign controlled intersections in San Francisco over two follow up periods. Since these signs were installed recently, there were no post-installation crash data for comparison with the pre-installation crash data. As such, surrogate measures, including (a) driver yielding behavior, (b) conflicts among drivers and pedestrians crossing the intersection, (c) waiting time for pedestrians, and (d) time taken by pedestrians to cross a given crosswalk were documented. Previous {{studies have indicated that}} impactable <b>yield</b> <b>signs</b> are effective in increasing the rate of drivers yielding to pedestrians. Video recordings were taken at the intersection pre- and post-installation to observe any changes in behavior. Analyses of these recordings yielded data for baselineand the first and second follow-up periods respectively. Testing the first and second follow-up data against the baseline data reveal that, a substantial increasein yielding behavior by drivers occurred immediately after installationas well as during the second follow-up period. No significant effect was observed in any other variables. intersection safety, impactible <b>yield</b> <b>signs,</b> san francisco...|$|R
