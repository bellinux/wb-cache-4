6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know!" [...] she faltered, {{with white}} lips. [...] "It {{was all so}} horrible. <b>You</b> <b>pointed</b> to him, and your eyes when you looked at him seemed to shine {{as though they were}} on fire.

"I {{congratulate you}} most heartily upon {{the innocence of}} your brother having been, to our minds, so {{conclusively}} proved, and, as Mr. Henderson tells us, chiefly owing to your shrewdness in the matter. Before you begin, you can repeat your opinion about the bullet that <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out to the chief constable last night, in order that the point may be included in your statement. After that {{you can tell us}} the story of your search in the wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} the {{investment}} is all that could be desired, Mr. Simpson. I merely wished you to know, as soon as possible, that I {{did not intend to}} put my money into it. There are one or two other little matters which you have mentioned during the week. <b>You</b> <b>pointed</b> out that it would be an advantage to Grenoble to revive the county fair, and you asked me to subscribe five thousand dollars to the Fair Association." ...|$|E
6000|$|...

[...] "Also, if there were such things, that this was the very place for them. I have tried to think over the matter since <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out the configuration of the ground.

6000|$|Mr. Ridgeway has an illustrative {{argument}} with some one, who says: [...] "The dress and weapons of the Saxons {{given in the}} lay of Beowulf fitted exactly the bronze weapons in England, for they had shields, and spears, and battle-axes, and swords." [...] If <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out {{to him that the}} Saxon poem spoke of these weapons as made of iron, he would say, [...] "I admit that it is a difficulty, but the resemblances are so many that the discrepancies may be jettisoned."

6000|$|... "Why {{it should}} be I cannot tell you; {{but it is the}} truth," [...] I said.

60|$|I owe you many {{apologies for}} having so long {{deferred}} thanking {{you for your}} poems, and your obliging letter accompanying them, which I received early in March. The poems have given me the greatest pleasure; and if I were obliged to choose out of them, I {{do not know whether}} I should not say that 'Harry Gill,' 'We are Seven,' 'The Mad Mother,' and 'The Idiot,' are my favourites. I read with particular attention the two <b>you</b> <b>pointed</b> out; but whether it be from early prepossessions, or whatever other cause, I am no great friend to blank verse for subjects which are to be treated of with simplicity.|$|E
