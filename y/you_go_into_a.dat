2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{rated the}} film 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Real Steel {{is a real}} movie. It has characters, it matters who they are, it makes sense of its action, it has a {{compelling}} plot. Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> movie with low expectations and are pleasantly surprised." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an A-, saying director Levy [...] "makes good use of his specialized skill in blending people and computer-made imaginary things into one lively, emotionally satisfying story".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} it was {{difficult}} to take on a role that [...] "so many fans" [...] associate with another actress, Baker stated, [...] "It was. I fortunately had the opportunity to work with her on her last day, which was my first day." [...] Baker said that it [...] "was kind of bittersweet, but when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> character who has been established by another actor, it's hard to take on." [...] "You want everybody to love you {{but a lot of people}} don't like change. In time, though, people get used to it," [...] she said.|$|E
2500|$|She is, however, {{at pains}} to stress the {{differences}} between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> world within a world {{that you can see}} if you happen to belong. A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday world. Generally there isn't much humour in the Narnia books, although I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal." [...] New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley, the obnoxious son of Harry's neglectful guardians, and Eustace Scrubb, the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until converted by Aslan.|$|E

2500|$|J. K. Rowling, {{author of}} the Harry Potter series, has {{said that she was}} a fan of the works of Lewis as a child, and cites the {{influence}} of The Chronicles on her work: [...] "I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King's Cross Station— it dissolves and he's on platform Nine and Three-Quarters, and there's the train for Hogwarts." [...] Nevertheless, she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world: [...] "Narnia is literally a different world", she says, [...] "whereas in the Harry books <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong.

5000|$|From November 1983 to 1987, Galloway was the General Secretary of War on Want, a British charity campaigning against poverty worldwide. In this post he {{travelled}} widely, {{and wrote}} eye-witness {{accounts of the}} famine in Eritrea in 1985 which were published in The Sunday Times and The Spectator. His deputy at the charity, Simon Stocker, recalled: [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> fight with George, you knew you would never walk out with a win." ...|$|R

5000|$|Pianist Levy {{attested to}} that fact, saying, [...] "I didn’t {{even know they}} {{recorded}} Ella in Rome, I really didn’t.

6000|$|... "One {{may be more}} {{awkward to}} deal with than two, or two hundred, for that matter. In a place that's full of women you needn't look at them unless you like; but if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> room where {{there is only one}} woman, young or old, pretty or ugly, you have got to face her.

6000|$|... "Men stand more {{in awe of}} a well-dressed woman {{than they}} do even of a {{beautiful}} woman," [...] Madge was of opinion. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> office looking dowdy they'll beat you down.

6000|$|One mere boy in {{his company}} was wont to enter a fray with a leg perched flippantly about the horn of his saddle, a {{cigarette}} hanging from his lips, which emitted smoke and original slogans of clever invention. Buckley would have given a year's pay to attain that devil- may-care method. Once the debonair youth said to him: [...] "Buck, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> scrap {{like it was a}} funeral. Not," [...] he added, with a complimentary wave of his tin cup, [...] "but what it generally is." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{talked the}} matter over, and at length {{concluded}} to {{do a little}} more exploring of the cave.

60|$|A very trivial {{circumstance}} {{will serve}} to exemplify this.

You take up another one, and that too is hard, green, and sour. The shopman offers you a third; but, before biting it, you examine it, and find that it is hard and green, and you immediately say that you will not have it, as it must be sour, like those that you have already tried.|$|E

5000|$|Marcus Minucius Felix (c. late 2nd to 3rd century), an Early Christian writer, {{argued for}} the {{existence}} of God based on the analogy of an ordered house in his The Orders of Minucius Felix: [...] "Supposing <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house and found everything neat, orderly and well-kept, surely you would assume it had a master, and onemuch better than the good things, his belongings so in this house of the universe, when throughoutheaven and earth you see the marks of foresight, order and law, may you not assume that the lord andauthor of the universe is fairer than the stars themselves or than any portions of the entire world ?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On 5 October 2005 Flake {{appeared}} {{briefly on}} Deutsche Welle. When {{asked how he}} felt about the reunification of Germany, he said he prefers/misses the way things were then. [...] "Even if the GDR survived, I still would've stayed a musician. The increased size of the world also brought the danger of being compared to all of the international acts. The bands which were in the east were the only ones there, and if you were successful there, you were successful. I miss the simplicity. <b>You</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bar, ordered a beer, and you got a beer!... They didn't ask if you wanted... with a head or without a head, foam top or bottom... It really gets on my nerves having all of these choices I really don't want".|$|R
6000|$|Old Mr. Toad held {{up one of}} his stout hind feet, and on {{it was a kind}} of spur. [...] "There's another {{just like}} that on the other foot," [...] said he, [...] "and I use them to dig with. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hole headfirst, but I go in the other way. I make my hole in soft earth and back into it at the same time, this way." [...] He began to work his stout hind feet, and as he kicked the earth out, he backed in at the same time. When he was deep enough, the earth just fell back over him, for you see it was very loose and not packed down at all. When he once more reappeared, Peter thanked him. Then he asked one more question.|$|E

"I {{had nothing}} to do," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "and I climbed a tree not fifty yards from the marshal's litter, and keeping the trunk {{in front of me}} to protect me from a stray bullet I had {{a good view of the}} whole proceedings. At one time I was on the point of {{slipping}} down and making a bolt for it, for I thought it was all over with us. How that column did fight! I have been in many a battle, but I never saw anything like it, it was grand; and if it hadn't been for the Irish Brigade, I think that they would have beaten the whole French army. But if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> battle again I sha'n't come to see you.

60|$|I {{said in my}} last lecture {{that art}} would create a new brotherhood among men by {{furnishing}} a universal language. I said that under its beneficent influences war might pass away. Thinking this, what place can I ascribe to art in our education? If children grow up among all fair and lovely things, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they know the reason why. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house where everything is coarse, you find things chipped and broken and unsightly. Nobody exercises any care. If everything is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of manner are unconsciously acquired. When I was in San Francisco I used to visit the Chinese Quarter frequently. There I used to watch a great hulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every day drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal of a flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands of dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I have been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups {{an inch and a}} quarter thick. I think I have deserved something nicer.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was then}} a {{discussion}} between them whether Mr. Robarts should go at once to Mr. Mason; but it was decided at last that he should see Mr. Crawley and also write to the dean before he did so. The dean might wish to employ his own lawyer, and if so the double expense should be avoided. [...] "Always remember, Mr. Robarts, that when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>an</b> attorney's office door, {{you will have to}} pay for it, first or last. In here, you see, the dingy old mahogany, bare as it is, makes you safe. Or else it's the salt-cellar, which will not allow itself to be polluted by six-and-eightpenny considerations. But there is the other kind of tax to be paid. <b>You</b> must <b>go</b> up and see Mrs. Walker, or you won't have her help in this matter." ...|$|R

"Art shouldn't be {{something}} that <b>you</b> <b>go</b> quietly <b>into</b> <b>an</b> art gallery and dip your forelock and say 'I {{have to be very}} quiet, I'm in here amongst the art.'

60|$|Nothing {{can be more}} graceful {{than their}} mode of speech, for the very {{construction}} of the language conduces to courtesy. The Spaniards have also an oriental way of offering you things, placing themselves and their houses entirely at your disposal. If you remark on anything of theirs they beg you at once to take it. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> pot-house where a peasant is dining on a plate of ham, a few olives, {{and a glass of}} wine, he will ask: 'Le gusta,' 'Will you have some,' with a little motion of handing you his meal. Of course it would be an outrage to decorum to accept these generous offers, but that is beside the question; for good manners are not an affair of the heart, but a complicated game to be learned and played on either side with due attention to the rules. It may be argued that such details are not serious; but surely for the common round of life politeness is more necessary than any heroic qualities. We need our friends' self-sacrifice once in a blue moon, but their courtesy every day; and for my own part, I would choose the companions of my leisure rather for their good breeding than for the excellence of their dispositions.|$|E
60|$|My Lords, the Commons of Great Britain are not {{disposed}} {{to resort to}} the ridiculous relations of travellers, or to the wild systems which ingenious men have thought proper to build on their authority. We will take another mode. We will undertake to prove the direct contrary of his assertions in every point and particular. We undertake to do this, because your Lordships know, and because the world knows, that, if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> country where you suppose man {{to be in a}} servile state,--where, the despot excepted, there is no one person who can lift up his head above another,--where all are a set of vile, miserable slaves, prostrate and confounded in a common servitude, having no descendible lands, no inheritance, nothing that makes man feel proud of himself, or that gives him honor and distinction with others,--this abject degradation will take from you that kind of sympathy which naturally attaches you to men feeling like yourselves, to men who have hereditary dignities to support, and lands of inheritance to maintain, as you peers have; you will, I say, no longer have that feeling which you ought to have for the sufferings of a people whom you suppose to be habituated to their sufferings and familiar with degradation. This makes it absolutely necessary for me to refute every one of these misrepresentations; and whilst I am endeavoring to establish the rights of these people, in order to show in what manner and degree they have been violated, I trust that your Lordships will not think that the time is lost: certainly I do not think that my labor will be misspent in endeavoring to bring these matters fully before you.|$|E
6000|$|... "These visions {{often appear}} with startling vividness, {{and so far}} from {{depending}} on any voluntary effort of the mind, [10] they remain when I often wish them very much to depart, and no effort of the imagination can call them up. I lately saw a framed portrait of a face which seemed more lovely than any painting I have ever seen, and again I often see fine landscapes which bear no resemblance to any scenery I have ever looked upon. I {{find it difficult to}} define the difference between a waking vision and a mental image, although the difference is very apparent to myself. I think I can do it best in this way. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> theatre and look at a scene--say of a forest by moonlight--at the back part of the stage you see every object distinctly and sufficiently illuminated (being thus unlike a mere act of memory), but it is nevertheless vague and shadowy, and you might have difficulty in telling afterwards all the objects you have seen. This resembles a mental image in point of clearness. The waking vision is like what one sees in the open street in broad daylight, when every object is distinctly impressed on the memory. The two kinds of imagery differ also as regards voluntariness, the image being entirely subservient to the will, the visions entirely independent of it. They differ also in point of suddenness, the images being formed comparatively slowly as memory recalls each detail, and fading slowly as the mental effort to retain them is relaxed, the visions appearing and vanishing in an instant. The waking visions seem quite close, filling as it were the whole head, while the mental image seems farther away in some far-off recess of the mind." ...|$|E
