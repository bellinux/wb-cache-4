[...] After {{describing}} Gordon-Cumming's background and record, he explained the rules of baccarat, which he described as [...] "the most unintelligent mode of losing <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>money,</b> or getting somebody else's, I ever heard of". Clarke also outlined Gordon-Cumming's [...] system of placing bets which, he explained, could have been mistaken by the inexperienced players as cheating, rather than a correct method of gambling. After his opening speech, Clarke then questioned Gordon-Cumming, and his approach was to show that Gordon-Cumming [...] "was a man of honour who had been sacrificed to save the courtiers".|$|E

The issue of housing solves most of us, at least once in their life. Investment in housing greatly exceeds our income, so it is necessary to the selection of type of housing, correctly decided on its method of financing itself. The statistics which are in the Czech Republic's disposal indicates that the total expenditures of Czech households, housing costs are up to 1 / 4. Compare the different products occurring in the Czech market, which are intended to finance housing (building savings, mortgage loans, [...] .).

Grown intensively these hybrids are capable of producing and storing a usable 250 mBTU per acre per year on a biennial harvest of the total tree. Employing the best of today's silvicultural techniques and boiler equipment each tree can produce a little more than one boiler horsepower per year. Utilizing non-prime lands for the production of 'hybrid poplars' one acre can generate the wood fuel equivalent of 40 barrels of oil ($ 8 /bbl) or 2500 therms of natural gas ($ 0. 13 /therm) per year and can be harvested every other year.

That's fair and honourable!' Is that logic?" [...] demanded the captain, vehemently, [...] "It is not!

Instead of his exhibiting the rigor and severity of an accountant and a book-keeper, you would think that he had been a reader of sentimental letters; there is such an air of a novel running through the whole, that it adds to the ridicule and nausea of it: it is an oxymel of squills; there is something to strike you with horror for the villany of it, something to strike you with contempt for the fraud of it, and something to strike you with utter disgust for the vile and bad taste with which all these base ingredients are assorted.|$|E

If I tell you how he {{received}} {{the first and last}} attempt at remonstrance that I ever made, you will know how he has always treated me, as well as if I had described it in so many words. It was one day at Rome when we had ridden out together to the tomb of Cecilia Metella. The sky was calm and lovely, and the grand old ruin looked beautiful, and the remembrance that a husband's love had raised it in the old time to a wife's memory, made me feel more tenderly and more anxiously towards my husband than I had ever felt yet. 'Would you build such a tomb for ME, Percival?' I asked him. 'You said you loved me dearly before we were married, and yet, since that time----' I could get no farther. Marian! he was not even looking at me! I pulled down my veil, thinking it best not to let him see that the tears were in my eyes. I fancied he had not paid any attention to me, but he had. He said, 'Come away,' and laughed to himself as he helped me on to my horse. He mounted his own horse and laughed again as we rode away. 'If I do build you a tomb,' he said, 'it will be done with <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> I wonder whether Cecilia Metella had a fortune and paid for hers.' I made no reply--how could I, when I was crying behind my veil? 'Ah, you light-complexioned women are all sulky,' he said. 'What do you want? compliments and soft speeches? Well! I'm in a good humour this morning. Consider the compliments paid and the speeches said.' Men little know when they say hard things to us how well we remember them, and how much harm they do us. It would have been better for me if I had gone on crying, but his contempt dried up my tears and hardened my heart. From that time, Marian, I never checked myself again in thinking of Walter Hartright. I let the memory of those happy days, when we were so fond of each other in secret, come back and comfort me. What else had I to look to for consolation? If we had been together you would have helped me to better things. I know it was wrong, darling, but tell me if I was wrong without any excuse." ...|$|E
