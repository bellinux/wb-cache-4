Strauss, wherein Strauss said to her, [...] "When you first came to town, Nancy, I didn't like <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> But after I got to know you, I changed my mind and said, 'She's some broad!'" [...] Reagan responded, [...] "Bob, based on the press reports I read then, I wouldn't have liked me either!" ...|$|E
500|$|Charles B. Harris sees Jake's and Joe's intellectualism as a Freudian obsessional neurosis. [...] To Freud, he writes, {{the source}} of such a {{condition}} lies in [...] "the chronic existence of love and hatred, both directed towards the same person and both of the highest degree of intensity". [...] Rennie expresses this overtly when she tells Jake, [...] "f I love <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> I don't just love you. [...] I swear, along with it I honestly and truly hate your God-damned guts!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Krypto has a {{surprisingly}} violent reaction to Kara Zor-El {{when he first}} encounters her. The dog happens upon the girl while she was exploring the Fortress of Solitude and attacks, {{going so far as}} to use his heat vision and other potentially lethal attacks. Batman, who distrusted Kara at that time, pointed this out as an argument that Kara might not be who she says she is when he remarks [...] "Doesn't it bother <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> that the dog hates her?" [...] Superman's response was [...] "It's his job to protect the fortress while he's here. Besides...the dog hates everybody." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hawaii {{has had a}} {{long history}} of queer identities. Māhū people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a {{respected}} group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers. Another Hawaiian word, aikāne, referred to same-sex relationships. According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many alii engaged in aikāne relationships. Hawaiian scholar Lilikalā Kameeleihiwa said, [...] "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle?

2500|$|After the Boxer Campaign, {{the couple}} had at first {{exchanged}} letters, which Beatty signed 'Jack', as Ethel was still a married woman and discretion was advised. Ethel became involved with another man and the exchange of letters ceased but on Beatty's return she sent him a telegram and letter inviting him to resume their friendship. Beatty did not respond until after surgery on his arm in September 1900 when he wrote, [...] "I landed from China with my heart full of rage, and swore I did not care if I ever saw you again, or if I were killed or not. And now I have arrived with the firm determination not to see <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in my own mind... Unfortunately I shall go on loving you to the bitter end... To me always a Queen, if not always mine, Good-bye." ...|$|E
2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing to <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all...</b> He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Wolf {{spoke of}} his role as {{journalist}} Chad Decker: [...] "Part of the fun will be that relationship between his ambition and his journalistic integrity." [...] David Richmond-Peck who plays Georgie has deemed his character: [...] "A really dark, multi-layered complex character with a past. It's an extremely demanding role because of the weight this character carries. Even just doing a scene in an office, {{at the end of}} the day your neck is cramped up — to maintain that intensity in the performance is an extreme amount of mental and physical work even while standing still. You’ve got to have that on <b>you</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times." [...] Joel Gretsch was cast as Catholic priest Jack Landry. The character was originally scripted as being much younger, in his late twenties to early thirties. When the production team cast Mitchell as Erica, they began to consider making Jack [...] "a little bit more man's man", and cast Gretsch in the role when he coincidentally contacted Peters immediately after this alteration had been made. Peters characterized Jack's motivation in the pilot episode as attempting to reconcile the reality of arriving spaceships with his religious beliefs, finding his faith shaken.|$|E
