50|$|A {{more widely}} used {{approach}} to fixed-income attribution is to decompose the returns of individual securities by source of risk, {{and then to}} aggregate these risk-specific returns over an entire portfolio. Typical sources of risk include <b>yield</b> <b>return,</b> return due to yield curve movements, and credit spread shifts. These sub-returns can then be aggregated over time and sector to give the overall portfolio return, attributed by source of risk.

Investing in the market that ceased to <b>yield</b> <b>returns</b> dropped precipitously, and investing in the unchanged market increased significantly. Although the behavior may be economically “irrational,” it is predictable from the matching law and shows that interactions among a history of intermittent returns in a course of action, current return rate, and currently available alternative courses of action are important determinants of persisting in, or withdrawing from, a failing course of action...|$|R

The equity premium estimate that emerges from most of this work matches one moment of the data alone: the mean difference between an estimate of the return to holding equity and a risk-free rate. We instead match multiple moments of U. S. market data, exploiting the joint distribution of the dividend <b>yield,</b> <b>return</b> volatility, and realized excess returns, and find that the equity premium lies within 50 basis points of 3. 5 %, a range much narrower than was achieved in previous studies. Additionally, statistical tests based on the joint distribution of these moments reveal that only those models of the conditional equity premium that embed time variation, breaks, and/or trends are supported by the data. In order to develop the joint distribution of the dividend <b>yield,</b> <b>return</b> volatility, and excess returns, we need a model of price and return fundamentals.

However, fruit set is often poor and young orchards are slow to come into production despite application of GA 3. GA 3 application and scoring during FB were evaluated for their effect on fruit set, <b>yield,</b> <b>return</b> bloom and vegetative growth in a young 'Triumph' orchard during two seasons. GA 3 did not increase fruit set or yield.

Scoring decreased average fruit mass by 18 % in 2006 - 07 and also decreased one-year-old shoot growth. In conclusion, our data show that GA 3 application is ineffective and does not increase fruit set or yield.

Scoring should be accompanied by appropriate pruning and thinning strategies to obtain sufficient fruit size and enough new fruiting wood. Conference Pape...|$|E

40|$|Optimism is an {{indispensable}} element of effective salesmanship. It is therefore quite natural for {{the directors of}} public companies to want to optimistically tout the potential long-term benefits of investing in their companies. After all, directors of public companies must be empowered {{to attract the attention}} and money of American investors. But what happens if these long-term projections fail to come true? Who is to blame for long-term projections that are simply unrealistic? A doctrine called the “bespeaks caution” doctrine has emerged in order to govern these inquiries, and holds that these optimistic forward-looking statements are legally immunized provided that they are sufficiently tempered with “meaningful” cautionary language in accompanying stock offering documentation. Such cautionary language must operate to put investors on notice that their investment is merely speculative, and that returns on investment are not guaranteed. Through this doctrine, public companies are protected against lawsuits brought by disappointed investors scrounging for settlement handouts when their investments fail to <b>yield</b> <b>return.</b> The structure of this doctrine, of course, begs the question: what constitutes “meaningful” cautionary language? In recent years, circuit courts have been split on this issue, and remain divided about whether stock-issuing companies are required to truly believe their optimistic forward-looking statement before they may be protected from shareholder lawsuits in the event that such statements fail to materialize. In other words, it is currently unclear under the law whether these forward-looking statements must be made in good faith in order to merit legal protection.

40|$|An optimal {{stochastic}} multi-crop irrigation scheduling algorithm {{was developed}} which {{was able to}} incorporate complex farm system models, and constraints on daily and seasonal water use, {{with the objective of}} maximising farm profit. This scheduling method included a complex farm simulation model in the objective function, used decision variables to describe general management decisions, and used a custom heuristic method for optimisation. Existing optimal schedulers generally use stochastic dynamic programming which relies on time independence of all parameters except state variables, thereby requiring over-simplistic crop models. An alternative scheduling method was therefore proposed which allows for the inclusion of complex farm system models. Climate stochastic properties are modelled within the objective function through the simulation of several years of historical data. The decoupling of the optimiser from the objective function allows easy interchanging of farm model components. The custom heuristic method, definition of decision variables, and use of the Markov chain equation (relating an irrigation management strategy to mean water use) considerably increases optimisation efficiency. The custom heuristic method used simulated annealing with continuous variables. Two extensions to this method were the efficient incorporation of equality constraints and utilisation of population information. A case study comparison between the simulated annealing scheduler and scheduling using stochastic dynamic programming, using a simplistic crop model, showed that the two methods resulted in similar performance. This demonstrates the ability of the simulated annealing scheduler to produce close to optimal schedules. A second case study demonstrates the ability of the simulated annealing scheduler to incorporate complex farm system models by including the FarmWi$e model by CSIRO in the objective function. This case study indicates that under conditions of limited seasonal water, the simulated annealing scheduler increases pasture yield returns by an average of 10 %, compared with scheduling irrigation using best management practice. Alternatively expressed, this corresponds to a 20 - 25 % reduction in seasonal water use (given no change in <b>yield</b> <b>return)</b> ...|$|E

While correct, and in fact frequently practice among several industries, many companies have failed {{in their attempt to}} innovate on ecosystem’s settings due mainly to lack of the appropriate management methodologies. Although co-development alliances have become a common practice in the market place, tools and strategies to manage them are quite behind on real execution. Furthermore, companies currently involved in such scenarios have overlook the new conditions of co-creation, failing to <b>yield</b> <b>return</b> over the cost of capital, and losing credibility on their ecosystems. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to identify practical managerial strategies, process and tools for orchestrating innovation ecosystems in general, and tailored them into real company current practices, in particular. In this thesis, a theoretical revision has been carried out in order to understand what innovation ecosystems are, why companies involved in innovation should care about them and what are the essential elements for orchestrating projects breed in that setting, being successful at it. Furthermore, a case study was developed with the purpose of connecting empirical findings to theoretical suggestions, and draw conclusions and recommendations. The company chosen for the analysis is one of the larger international players in their industry; having strong motivations to grow their innovation field, clear objectives to do it on partnership basis, and unquestionable position to claim the role of orchestrator. Moreover, management at this company believed that their innovation partnerships are not fulfilling expectations, and wanted to know how they can improve the way those projects are being managed, while keeping the center of the innovation ecosystem. The results show the process to create an orchestration strategy model, and a final proposal for the company under analysis. The case was developed taking into consideration information provided by key processes stakeholders over a series of interviews, and critical observation of the system during a six-month period. Scientific implications contribute in providing a framework for orchestrating innovation ecosystems on a technology-driven industry, while managerial implications contribute in providing the company with a robust model on how to position as a global hub for cross-innovation. ...|$|E
