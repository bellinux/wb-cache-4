5|$|Before {{heading out}} of Brazil on a mid-1991 European tour, Sepultura {{performed}} one more concert in São Paulo, the country's largest city. It {{took place at}} Praça Charles Miller (in front of Estádio do Pacaembu), on May 11. Local military police expected 10,000 to attend. 30,000 showed up instead, making crowd management nearly impossible. Six people were hurt, 18 were arrested and one was murdered with an axe. A week before, a <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> stabbed to death at a Ramones concert in São Paulo, during a brawl between headbangers and skinheads. These events were followed by a huge mainstream media backlash throughout the country against rock music.|$|E
5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
5|$|The <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{not certain}} {{if he should}} accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

One 1936 entry claims that {{he was born in}} 1889 in Buzdugeni. Both villages were at the time included in the Russian Empire's Bessarabian Governorate, and the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> educated at a teachers' seminary in Bayramcha.

25|$|By this date, Charles Pratt was {{reaching}} an age to consider retirement, and he subsequently devoted {{much of his}} time and interests to activities such as founding the Pratt Institute. However, Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt (1858 to 1913), became Corporate Secretary of Standard Oil. As a part owner of Pratt and Company, Rogers, who was about 35 years old, now owned a share of Standard Oil himself. In the deal, Rockefeller had also added Henry Rogers to his team. He undoubtedly placed a high value on Rogers' potential. History does not tell us if he foresaw that the promising <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> destined to become one of his major partners.|$|E

25|$|In March 1978, Gacy lured a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall {{into his}} car. Upon {{entering}} the car, the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> chloroformed and {{driven to the}} house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall was then driven to Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. Eventually he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Rignall was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Police were again informed of the assault, but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He staked out the exit on the Expressway where {{he knew he had}} been driven until—in April—he saw Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Police issued an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.|$|E

The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that the <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> now able {{to understand what the}} proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor.

500|$|Spurs were {{commonly}} used throughout the period, especially by knights, with whom they were regularly associated. [...] A <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> said to have [...] "won his spurs" [...] when he achieved knighthood. [...] Wealthy knights and riders frequently wore decorated and filigreed spurs. Attached to the rider's heel by straps, spurs could be used both to encourage horses to quickly move forward or to direct lateral movement. [...] Early spurs had a short shanks or [...] "neck", placing the rowel relatively close to the rider's heel; further developments in the spur shape lengthened the neck, {{making it easier to}} touch the horse with less leg movement {{on the part of the}} rider.|$|E
