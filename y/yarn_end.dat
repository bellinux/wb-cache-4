40|$|Air {{drag force}} on a nylon {{monofilament}} yarn in a confined jet was measured {{as a basic}} study for operating yarn by airflow, for example; for weft-insertion, for holding the <b>yarn</b> <b>end,</b> for adjusting yarn tension and for drawing yarn into a hollow spindle. The relative velocity of airflow around a yarn was expanded up to 300 m/s. Previously, this had been investigated up to 100 m/s. Both the supplying air pressure and combinations of nozzles and pipes changed diffusion of the flow in a pipe. Air drag force increased extremely if the primary stream acted on the yarn directly when the jet from the nozzle was directed at very high speed (around sonic velocity). Yarn was often stuck inside the pipe by the airflow when very thin pipes were used. When this occurred, air drag force was reduced to half. The air drag coefficient Cf for monofilament yarn has been arranged using the radius Reynolds number, Rea, for suction flow with lower than 100 m/s. The formula, Cf = KRea-n, has been applied for suction flow under 500 in Rea. Cf could be arranged {{in the same manner}} for annular jet or confined jet if airflow acted on a yarn in the pipe uniformly. This formula, then, is also available even for very high velocity over 100 m/s. According to these results, we were able to calculate air drag force on monofilament yam. We anticipate applying this to the other kinds of yarn, and expect air power savings and improvement in yarn operation...|$|E

30|$|In a real {{braiding}} process, {{the natural}} forming point occurs {{somewhere between the}} forming ring and the carriers. This position depends on parameters such as take-up speed, yarn fineness and yarn-to-yarn coefficient of friction. The smaller the take-up speed, the higher the coefficient of friction and the coarser the yarn, the closer the natural forming point will be to the carriers. In the FE model, the yarns were modelled as converging {{to the center of}} the braiding machine and, when the simulation started, they were pulled from the take-up node (Fig.  5 b) in the positive y-direction through the forming ring at a speed equal to the real braiding machine take-up speed υtu. Based on experimental observations, the position of the take-up nodes relative to the carriers was adjusted depending on the take-up speed to be as close as possible to where the braid would form in a real braiding process. Opposite to the take-up nodes, linear elastic springs modelled with discrete elements, were attached to each <b>yarn</b> <b>end</b> to simulate the carrier tensioning springs (0.2 N was the effective pre-tension applied by the springs to the attached yarns). These springs, as in a real carrier, were restrained to move in the y-direction during their movement on the x-z plane, and were used to maintain a uniform tension in the yarns throughout the braiding simulation. The tension of the yarns at the beginning of the virtual braiding process was not uniform among different yarns. This is because of the difference in the yarn length and the relative position of the yarns with respect to the forming point. In order to even out the tension in each yarn before the starting of the braiding process, the springs were pulled in the negative y-direction for two seconds while keeping the uppermost nodes fully constrained. From their initial position, the eyelets and the yarn ends with springs were moved along a prescribed path established by Eq. 10 on the x-z plane. Their velocity was equal to the maximum carriers’ velocity of the braiding machine used for the manufacture of microbraids.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of prototype braiding machines {{for the production}} of generalized braid patterns is described. Mechanical operating principles and control strategies are presented for two prototype machines which have been fabricated and evaluated. Both machines represent advances over current fabrication techniques for composite materials by enabling nearly ideal control of fiber orientations within preform structures. They permit optimum design of parts that might be subjected to complex loads or that have complex forms. Further, they overcome both the lack of general control of produced fiber architectures and the complexity of other weaving processes that have been proposed for the same purpose. One prototype, the Farley braider, consists of an array of turntables that can be made to oscillate in 90 degree steps. <b>Yarn</b> <b>ends</b> are transported about the surface formed by the turntables by motorized tractors which are controlled through an optical link with the turntables and powered through electrical contact with the turntables. The necessary relative motions are produced by a series of linear tractor moves combined with a series of turntable rotations. As the tractors move about, they weave the <b>yarn</b> <b>ends</b> into the desired pattern. The second device, the shuttle plate braider, consists of a braiding surface formed by an array of stationary square sections, each separated from its neighbors by a gap. A plate beneath this surface is caused to reciprocate in two perpendicular directions, first in one direction and then in the other. This movement is made possibly by openings in the plate that clear short columns supporting the surface segments. <b>Yarn</b> <b>ends</b> are moved about the surface and interwoven by shuttles which engage the reciprocating plate as needed to yield the desired movements. Power and control signals are transmitted to the shuttles through electrical contact with the braiding surface. The shuttle plate is a passively driven prime mover that supplies the power to move all shuttles and the shuttles are simple devices that employ only a solenoid to engage the shuttle plate on command. Each shuttle is assigned a unique identity and is controlled independently. When compared to each other, the Farley braider is felt to have the advantage of speed and the shuttle plate braider, the advantage of simplicity...|$|R

50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms.

The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of prototype machines {{for the production}} of generalized braid patterns is described. Mechanical operating principles and control strategies are presented for two prototype machines which were fabricated and evaluated. Both machines represent advances over current techniques for forming composite material preforms by enabling near ideal control of fiber orientation. Furthermore, they overcome both the lack of general control of produced fiber architectures and the complexity of other weaving processes that were produced for the same purpose. One prototype, the modified Farley braider, consists of an array of turntables which can be rotated 90 degrees and returned; hence, they can form tracks in the x and y axis. <b>Yarn</b> <b>ends</b> are transported about the surface formed by the turntables using motorized tractors. These tractors are controlled using an optical link with a control circuit and host computer. The tractors are powered through electrical contact with the turntables. The necessary relative motions are produced by a series of linear tractor moves combined with a sequence of turntable rotations. The movement of the tractors about the surface causes the yarns to produce the desired braiding pattern. The second device, the shuttle plate braider, consists of a braiding surface formed by an array of square elements, each separated from its neighbor by a gap. Beneath this surface lies a shuttle plate, which reciprocates first in one axis and then in the other. As this movement takes place, yarn carrying shuttles engage and disengage the plate by means of solenoid activated pins. By selective engagement and disengagement, the shuttles can move the <b>yarn</b> <b>ends</b> in any desired pattern, forming the desired braid. Control power, and control signals, are transmitted from the electronic interface circuit and host computer, via the braiding surface through electrical contact with the shuttles. Motive power is proved to the shuttles by motion of the shuttle plate, which is passively driven using pneumatic rams. Each shuttle is a simple device that uses only a solenoid to engage the plate and is a simple device that uses only a solenoid to engage the plate and is independently controllable.

40|$|Yarn {{diameter}} is {{an important}} property which affects the physical properties of the end products. Variations in yarn diameter cause undesirable effects such as imperfections in the knitted or woven fabric and difficulties in weaving prep-aration stages. Thin places in the yarn cause low breaking strength creating difficulties in the downstream processes such as warping, sizing and weaving. Thick places and neps cause appearance imperfections in the fabric. As is known in winding, yarns on spinning bobbins are assembled into larger yarn packages with different tech-niques of splicing. In splicing, {{it is very important}} to obtain a splice with a diameter that is close to the diameter of the parent yarn for the reasons mentioned above. Many studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effects of splicing parameters on the diameter of the splices in yarns. Cheng and Lam investigated different properties of spliced ring spun yarns such as abrasion, bending rigidity and appearance [1, 2]. 1 They used an overall score to evaluate the data obtained from experiments and found that yarn linear density and the degree of overlapping of <b>yarn</b> <b>ends</b> mostly affect the overall spliced yarn properties [1, 2]. Das et al. studied the parameters of fiber friction, yarn twist and splicing air pressure. They observed that the diameter of the splices in yarn is influenced by yarn twist and splicing air pressure [3]. Drobina and Machnio applied image analysis for the identification of the geometric sizes of spliced zones [4]. Hassen et al. found that increasing the time of water injection and yarn overlapping length improved the appear-ance of splices in yarns in water injection splicing [5].
