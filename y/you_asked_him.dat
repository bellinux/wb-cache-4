6000|$|I {{put down}} the {{photograph}} album, {{and looked at him}} in a deuced serious way. [...] "Then it's high time <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What d'you {{want for}} 'em?" [...] Good Lord! how he jumped if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> a plain question. The chap was as nervous as a guinea-fowl! ...|$|E
6000|$|Nora {{smiled and}} shook her head. [...] "I wonder {{what he would say}} if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> But if he came I should do the same thing." ...|$|E
60|$|MOSES. You'll {{be found}} out directly--if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{no more than}} that, you'll be {{discovered}} immediately.|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to dine {{with you}} on Thursday to meet {{a few people who}} are anxious to know him.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{surely it}} can make no {{difference}} if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him.</b> There can be no reason {{for him not to}} trust you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Eldridge was dreadfully put {{out because}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{what he knew}} about General Gordon," [...] {{he said to the}} headmaster, with an attempt at a chuckle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I knew {{it before}} {{just as well}} as though I had seen it. I ain't often very wrong in these things. <b>You</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> for the money,--and {{threatened}} him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alon. Daughter, be not too {{confident}} in your belief; there's nothing more uncertain {{than the old}} prophecies of these Nostradamusses; but of what nature was the question which <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him?</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Roth wrote The Breast. Would <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> how {{he could}} do this since {{he had never been}} a breast? Adams wrote Watership Down. Would <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{how he could}} do this since he {{admitted}} his rabbit knowledge came from a book about rabbits? ... And those hobbits!... I am a bigger risk-taker than these others. The Hoosiers can contradict me. No rabbit, hobbit, or breast has been known to speak up in reply to their exploiters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> Major," [...] Richards said, as {{he wiped}} his {{forehead}} with his pocket handkerchief, [...] "to {{make sure that she}} is solid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Daddy, wouldn't {{it be nice}} if Harold {{could come}} here altogether? Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to? And old Mr. Harold could come too. Oh, I wish he was here!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} all about it, Mr. Gray," [...] she answered. [...] "Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset. And {{it seems that}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> not to shoot the hare. How curious!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's {{refused to}} answer anyone. I tried to get {{something}} out of him, but I couldn't, and I lost my temper. He might give you the truth if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> pointblank.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course {{his soul}} felt {{none of these}} emotions. [...] "If you asked this famous man, who by himself was as well worth a journey to England to see, as all the wonders of Rome are worth a journey to Italy, if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him,</b> I say, for the scene of The Little Baker's Boy, he played it; if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> the next minute for the scene from Hamlet, he played that too for you, equally ready to sob over the fall of his pies, and to follow {{the path of the}} dagger in the air."[278] ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Hastings smiled. [...] "I {{want you}} to plead that woman's cause. Gregory may do what <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> gracefully. That would be much the nicest way out of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to {{come out}} to me at once, please?" [...] Rupert said. [...] "It is a most serious business, or you may be sure I should not ask." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was right. And did you consult {{him about}} another thing? did <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> what <b>you</b> were {{to live on}} till such time as you could earn your own bread?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did not," [...] Mr. Sabin answered, [...] "but it was {{scarcely}} necessary; you stopped {{to speak to}} him of your own accord, and <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to supper, which {{was scarcely}} discreet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please sir, Mr. Costigan's in the sittin-room, sir, and says, sir, <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to breakfast, sir. Called five times, sir; but wouldn't {{wake you}} on no account; {{and has been}} here since eleven o'clock, sir---" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think what}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> is very material," [...] he said reflectively. [...] "In any case, he wouldn't get very much. Mr. Merril {{is not the}} man to hand over money when it isn't necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Done, for a poney, {{provided}} <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> in ten minutes," [...] {{said the}} Squire; [...] "but you dare not, Bingie--he has a d----d cross game look, {{with all that}} civil chaff of his." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll take my gun {{and shoot}} them," [...] valiantly exclaimed Tom; and while threats were passing among the boys, Margaret asked, {{in a low}} voice, [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to come with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|UNDERSHAFT. Not {{on a large}} scale, Mr Lomax. Bilton {{will give}} you a sample of gun cotton when you are leaving if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> can {{experiment}} with it at home. [Bilton looks puzzled].|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Fanny, {{who had a}} wife's {{willingness}} to see her husband occasionally snubbed, [...] "I don't know why <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> I'm sure nobody wants to see that old chief and his wretched bead trumpery again." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{was silent}} {{in the face of}} her naïve {{expression}} of self-sacrificing love, and after a moment she added, hesitatingly: [...] "I wish I could meet your father. Perhaps he'd come up here if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to do so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The consul {{tells me}} <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to search for}} Mercy Merrick," [...] he said. [...] "Is it not true that he caused {{inquiries}} to be made, and that no trace of any such person was to be heard of?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{the lack}} of support from his superiors, gendarme Jean-François Abgrall quickly {{understood}} the basic rule about who he is responsible for tracking down: [...] "It's when <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> nothing that he says the most." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You! You {{will be as}} old as Methuselah, if {{you wait}} till I am your wife. I dare say Perry has got a sister. Suppose <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him?</b> She would be just the right person for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Min, the all-loving Father is more merciful than man. He {{will forgive}} <b>you,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>Him,</b> and <b>you</b> will {{wait for me}} till I come. I will stay here and do my duty--I will try hard--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is the Major all over!" [...] {{cried the}} old lady. [...] "If you pin your faith on that man, I pity you. He is as {{slippery}} as an eel. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> {{to introduce you}} to Dexter?" ...|$|E
60|$|Morton (slowly and seriously). He {{has left}} me here {{to answer the}} {{unanswered}} question <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him.</b> (Enter Don Jose and Col. STARBOTTLE, R. and L.) I am {{here to tell you}} that I am his father, and that he is Alexander Morton.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dandy's a darling, and wouldn't do {{anything}} of the sort if <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>him</b> to. He's a kind little 'oss, as Thomas says. He only walked away when I got off to pick some roses, and I couldn't catch him. And then I met Jimmy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Behind {{the door}} her daddy kept a shotgunHe {{kept it in}} the springtimeIn the merry month of MayAnd if <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> why the heck he kept itHe kept it for her soldier who was far far away ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What did <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for, when <b>you</b> know?" [...] said Janet, mirthfully, {{when they}} had gone on, and Ditmar was imitating him. Ditmar's reply was to wink at her. Presently they saw another figure on the road.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Pistone {{said that}} Mirra was the nastiest and most intimidating {{man he had}} met during his seven years undercover. Due to Mirra's irrational behavior, nobody could ever build a close {{relationship}} with him. He would never talk about anything that did not involve criminal activities. Pistone said that, [...] "One day <b>you</b> might <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> 'How's your mother, Tony?' He might say, 'Okay.' Another day <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him,</b> and he might answer, 'What the fuck you so nosy about?' [...] " ...|$|R
