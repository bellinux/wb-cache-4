2500|$|In 1873, Rhodes {{left his}} farm {{field in the}} care of his {{business}} partner, Rudd, and sailed for England to complete his studies. He was admitted to Oriel College, Oxford, but stayed for only one term in 1873. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by John Ruskin's inaugural lecture at Oxford, which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British imperialism. Among his Oxford associates were James Rochfort Maguire, later a fellow of All Souls College and a director of the British South Africa Company, and Charles Metcalfe [...] Due to his university career, Rhodes admired the Oxford [...] "system". Eventually he was inspired to develop his scholarship scheme: [...] "Wherever <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> eye—except in science—an Oxford man {{is at the top of}} the tree".|$|E
2500|$|Gardner depicts Mason as {{a lawyer}} who fights hard {{on behalf of his}} clients and who enjoys unusual, {{difficult}} or nearly-hopeless cases. [...] He frequently accepts clients on a whim based on his curiosity about their problem, for a minimal retainer, and finances the investigation of their cases himself if necessary. In The Case of the Caretaker's Cat (1935), his principal antagonist, District Attorney Hamilton Burger, says: [...] "You're a better detective than you are a lawyer. [...] When <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> mind to the solution of a crime, you ferret out the truth." [...] And in The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink (1952), a judge who has just witnessed one of the lawyer's unusual tactics says: [...] "Mr. Mason...from time to time you seem to find yourself in predicaments from which you extricate yourself by unusual methods which invariably turn out to be legally sound. [...] The Court feels you are fully capable of looking after your own as well as your clients' interests." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in 2010, for the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, {{she created}} a {{retrospective}} exhibition [...] "Spine, Chapter 20", of new pieces. Unlike all previous Chapters, this exhibit did not incorporate {{the specifics of}} the venue, instead reflecting upon all of her work to date. Together the Chapters form a figurative book – an overarching structure for all the paintings. [...] "The installation itself has a 'spine': an 80-foot wall extending from one corner of the room, on which most of the roughly 30 paintings are hung, creating a sense of space — even emptiness, if <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>your</b> attention toward the walls where paintings are customarily hung in the Neuberger." [...] according to the New York Times critic Martha Schwendener. Pieces in this chapter pull elements from all her previous chapters, such as [...] "Distracting Distance / Hardy", in which a nude woman {{stands in front of the}} Marcel Breuer window at the Whitney. [...] "Spine, Chapter 20" [...] also provided the final chapter of an impressive physical book - the retrospective she published in 2011, Spine, with 380 color illustrations.|$|E
