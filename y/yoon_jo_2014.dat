30|$|The second {{significant}} {{factor is the}} methodology, that is, how DDL is implemented. There are generally two ways to adopt DDL approach, namely, direct DDL and indirect DDL (<b>Yoon</b> and <b>Jo</b> <b>2014).</b> In direct DDL, learners consult corpora directly for solving language problems; whereas indirect DDL refers to learners’ use of paper-based concordance lines extracted by teachers or researchers. Direct DDL is the dominant paradigm in previous studies (Yoon and Hirvela 2004; Yoon 2008; Gaskell and Cobb 2004; Gilmore 2009; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Pérez-Paredes et al. 2012; Chang 2014; Tono et al. 2014; Cotos 2014), but recently {{there are also a}} lot of studies employing indirect DDL such as Boulton (2009, 2010), Huang (2014), Smart (2014), etc. These studies have shown that both direct and indirect DDL have their own distinctive advantages and disadvantages. To compare the effectiveness of the two ways, <b>Yoon</b> and <b>Jo</b> (<b>2014)</b> conducted a small-scale study investigating their different effects on L 2 learners’ error correction in a writing class. This study revealed that the self-correction rate was higher in indirect DDL than in the direct DDL for most learners, especially for lower-level learners; however, direct DDL activities may have more positive effects on learner autonomy especially for higher-level learners. Thus it could be found that indirect DDL is more appropriate for lower-level or novice learners, which is consistent with Gaskell and Cobb’s (2004) viewpoint that indirect DDL is a transitional step to direct DDL.|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws on}} data from a child poverty study in Peru to explore how poverty mediates a {{multitude}} of risks in rural children’s lives. It offers three main arguments. First, risk {{is not simply a}} feature of ‘extraordinary’ childhoods and circumstances but also an integral part of everyday, ‘ordinary’ lives. Second, social and moral dimensions of risk are crucial for shaping children’s responses to adversity. Third, where high levels of intra-familial dependence prevail, children can make essential contributions to reducing household risk. Current approaches focus on so-called ‘objective’ risks, but these often neglect children’s own priorities and subjective experiences. © 2012 Crivello et al.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Hippocampus (HPC) {{has been}} implicated in {{decision-making}} as context-based features of reward {{have been shown to}} bias hippocampal place field properties. Its direct connectivity with brain structures known to be involved in determining the value of response outcomes (e. g. ventral striatum) and impulsivity related to reward-motivated behavior (e. g. orbitofrontal cortex) further suggests a role for the HPC during reward-motivated decision making. Indeed, {{it has been shown that}} the expected probability of receiving a reward biases HPC place field remapping: it seems to scale directly with the probability of receiving a reward during a probability discounting task (Tryon et al., 2017). In addition, HPC lesions increase variability in an animal’s preference for large delayed rewards over small immediate rewards in a delay discounting task suggesting that the HPC is involved in cost-benefit decision making (McHugh et al., 2008, Abele and Chudasama, 2013). In this study, we sought to determine whether HPC is necessary for accurately representing and utilizing delay information by temporality inactivating HPC during a delayed discounting T-maze task. In addition, we examined hippocampal CA 1 place cell activity during performance of the same task in an effort to determine if they encode delay associated costs information. A delay-based decision making maze task required rats to evaluate the cost of a decision in terms of the amount of time they were willing to wait in order to obtain the large reward (<b>Jo,</b> <b>2014).</b> The HPC was infused with saline (SAL) or muscimol (MUS), a GABA antagonist, prior to experimental sessions for the inactivation study. For the rats in the recording study, neural activity was correlated with maze region and delay context. Consistent with operant studies, the behavior analysis from 10 rats revealed the strongest preferences for the large reward when it was associated with the 10 s delay, but this preference declined as the delay increased. Inactivation results suggest that HPC is necessary for normal delay discounting on this particular task. Current preliminary analysis of hippocampal place fields does not show evidence for encoding the cost of a reward in that population level place field remapping was not observed across trials associated with different delays. This suggests that the intrinsically generated value constructs, such as the expected cost of a reward, may be facilitated by HPC but it is not reflected in broad population level changes in place cell activity...|$|R
