In 1850, Hervé Faye and Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve (1793-1864) proposed that astronomical observations should be taken in Lisbon, being the first and [...] "unique locale in all of continental Europe that the zenithal telescope could encounter the marvelous Argelander star". In order to do so, it was necessary to build a new observatory where <b>you</b> could <b>install</b> <b>the</b> appropriate equipment.
