"For {{those of}} you who are curious as to what our [...] "legal issues" [...] were that halted the {{production}} of Dingir, and pushed its official release date from Nov. 20th, 2012 to Feb 5th, 2013, we are able to explain them now. A third party was legally fighting us for the rights to our name using a loop hole method that renders the protection of our copyright obsolete in that specific circumstance. After butt loads of money was dropped in attorney and legal fees, we were able to keep our name as well as take precautions to ensure that this sort of thing never happens to us again. During this time, someone leaked an unfinished, poor quality pre-production version of our album months before our new release date. In light of the album being pushed back, and the leak, we decided to just stream the entire high quality finished version of the album on Youtube for everyone, as well as make it available for download, and put up the guitar tabs on ultimate-guitar.com for people who were interested in learning our songs. We know <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> <b>had</b> been waiting for the album long enough, and we would rather have you all jam out to the high quality finished album, then a poor quality unfinished product.

We have full trust that <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> will support the band and still pick up a copy of Dingir when our album drops on Feb. 5th, 2013 so that we can hit the road again on tour, and hang out, and play for all of <b>you</b> <b>guys!</b> We are currently working on pre-order packages, a music video, and something else special for everyone that we will be releasing starting on our album's original release date of Nov. 20th, 2012!" ...|$|R
