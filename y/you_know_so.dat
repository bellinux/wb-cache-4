Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

25|$|In March 1982 {{he worked}} in Modena, Italy, and from November, Basquiat worked from the ground-floor display and studio space Larry Gagosian had built below his Venice, California, home and {{commenced}} a series of paintings for a 1983 show, his second at Gagosian Gallery, then in West Hollywood. He brought along his girlfriend, then unknown aspiring singer Madonna. Gagosian recalls, “Everything was going along fine. Jean-Michel was making paintings, I was selling them, and {{we were having a}} lot of fun. But then one day Jean-Michel said, ‘My girlfriend is coming to stay with me.’ I was a little concerned-one too many eggs can spoil an omelet, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>So</b> I said, ‘Well, what’s she like?’ And he said, He said, ‘Her name is Madonna and she’s going to be huge.’ I’ll never forget that he said that. So Madonna came out and stayed for a few months and we all got along like one big, happy family.” During this time he took considerable interest in the work that Robert Rauschenberg was producing at Gemini G.E.L. in West Hollywood, visiting him on several occasions and finding inspiration in the accomplishments of the painter. In 1982, Basquiat worked briefly with musician and artist David Bowie.|$|E

When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>So</b> {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings in this thing was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>so</b> it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to go in there and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E

500|$|In September 2005, {{the band}} {{announced}} the album's title and {{revealed that the}} title track, [...] "Lights and Sounds", was confirmed {{to be the first}} single from the album, with a video shot in Van Nuys, California and a release date of November 15. On October 24, the band began a tour in support of the album, during which they began playing at small venues at college arenas. The tour lasted for six weeks. In November 2005, it was announced that guitarist Ben Harper had parted ways with the band. Key explained that the band went through [...] "a lot of the highest and lowest points" [...] and that making an album [...] "would be on the highest list, and losing a member would be on the lowest." [...] He also added, [...] "It's really been a long journey together, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>so</b> obviously, parting ways with Ben was a really unpleasant experience. It was either go on without him, or don't go on at all. And, at the core, we decided that we had something too great to let go of, and that we had to kind of make a last resort and move on without him." [...] Harper was replaced by Ryan Mendez.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{was raised}} in a strict {{conservative}} Christian household, and her interest in performing was discouraged by both of her parents: [...] "My father was of missionary stock," [...] she later explained, [...] "so theater and acting were just one step up from being a streetwalker, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>So</b> when I was performing in school, he would drive my mom [...] and sit in the car.

2500|$|The {{members of}} Foo Fighters meld melodic {{elements}} with heavier ones. Grohl noted in 1997, [...] "We all love music, whether it's the Beatles or Queen or punk rock.

But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>So</b> it is just natural." [...] Grohl said in 2005, [...] "I love being in a rock band, but I don't know if I necessarily wanna be in an alternative rock band from the 1990s {{for the rest of}} my life." [...] Grohl noted that the band's acoustic tour was an attempt to broaden the group's sound.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon Parks was {{approached}} {{to direct the}} film, and though he was disillusioned by his experience {{with the release of}} his 1976 feature film Leadbelly, he anticipated a different experience in television. After not having directed a film in years, he returned to adapt the autobiography. The script mostly followed Northup's autobiography, though Parks had to change some parts. Parks said, [...] "Solomon was very tolerant in a terrible situation, and very fair in his reporting. I tried to remain fair in my reporting and not go overboard, although it's very difficult not to when <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>so</b> much happened that was so bad to so many people.

2500|$|OB4CL popularized street-related, Mafioso rap on {{the east}} coast. While this style was {{originated}} by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s, it didn't completely permeate the hip hop world until the release of OB4CL in 1995. References to Cuban Linx could be heard heavily in following years with several notable changes in hip hop culture. For instance, the album refers to [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] in various occurrences; the term being {{a name for the}} 'alter-egos' of the rappers involved in Cuban Linx, and used on various later projects. These alter-egos inspired an already dissociative hip-hop world to adopt new names and personae, from Nas' Escobar moniker to Notorious B.I.G.'s Frank White counterpart, which he would go on to further utilize upon the release of OB4CL. A known fan of the Wu, Tupac Shakur began to refer to himself as Makaveli and gave his Outlawz crew new names, albeit with a militaristic, dictatorial theme. In regard to Raekwon's innovation of the gambinos, Method Man later affirmed [...] "Raekwon started that. Rae always had that mobster mentality, always liked to watch gangster movies and read mob books and stuff like that, <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> <b>So</b> he pretty much knew the names of the cats and what they was about. He polished his whole style like that." [...] Ghostface Killah also touched base on the gambino influence stating [...] "We done took that to the highest peak. We bonded as a tight family, so niggas is starting to try and do that right now. Everybody thinking they have a strong family. We opened up the door for a lot of niggas. The shit was just crazy on how it came together." ...|$|E
