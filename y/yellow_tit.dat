50|$|The Indian black-lored tit, Indian tit, or Indian <b>yellow</b> <b>tit</b> (Grimmett et al., 2011) (Machlolophus aplonotus) is a {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} tit family Paridae. The yellow-cheeked tit {{is probably}} its closest relative, and both {{may be related to}} the <b>yellow</b> <b>tit.</b> These three tits almost certainly form a distinct lineage as evidenced by morphology, and mtDNA cytochrome b sequence analysis (Gill et al., 2005). The subgenus name Macholophus may apply for them.|$|E
50|$|Its {{length is}} 13 cm. The <b>yellow</b> <b>tit</b> is mostly yellow, with a crest. The crest and back are blackish blue-grey.|$|E
50|$|The <b>yellow</b> <b>tit</b> was {{formerly}} {{one of the}} many species in the genus Parus but was moved to Machlolophus after a molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 showed that the members of the new genus formed a distinct clade.|$|E
50|$|The Himalayan black-lored tit (Machlolophus xanthogenys), {{also known}} as simply black-lored tit, is a {{passerine}} bird in the tit family Paridae.

50|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the distribution of}} Taiwan’s 17 endemic bird species, using data from bird surveys conducted from 1993 to 2004, classified the firecrest as uncommon (along with the Formosan magpie, Taiwan bush warbler, <b>yellow</b> <b>tit</b> and Taiwan barwing). It found that the flamecrest occurred in high- and mid-altitude coniferous forests, and in high-altitude broad-leaved mixed forests, mainly at 2000-3600 m above sea level. The sites where it was recorded had an average altitude of about 2550 m, the highest of all the endemic birds. Its habitats had the coldest mean temperature and lowest warmth index of all 17 endemics, as well as the highest annual rainfall for the five uncommon species, though its distribution regarding vegetation and human disturbance was {{similar to those of the}} others.|$|E
50|$|The taxonomic changes {{proposed}} {{increase the}} number of South Asian endemic bird species, and the numbers of restricted-range endemic bird species in several of South Asias Endemic Bird Areas. Using the taxonomic arrangements in Birds of South Asia, the following species are additional South Asian endemics: Ceylon bay-owl, hill swallow, white-bellied and orange minivets, square-tailed black bulbul, Jerdons leafbird, Indian blackbird, large blue flycatcher, common babbler and Indian and white-cheeked nuthatches; the following are additional Indian endemics: crested hawk-eagle, grey-fronted green-pigeon, Malabar barbet, Malabar woodshrike, flame-throated bulbul, Nilgiri thrush, white-bellied blue robin, Naga wren-babbler, Indian <b>yellow</b> <b>tit,</b> Nilgiri flowerpecker and Malabar white-headed starling; the following are new Sri Lankan endemics: Ceylon green-pigeon, Ceylon small barbet, crimson-backed flameback, Ceylon swallow, Ceylon woodshrike, black-capped bulbul, Ceylon scaly thrush and Ceylon crested drongo; and the following are additional endemics in the Andaman/Nicobar islands: Nicobar imperial-pigeon, Andaman barn-owl, Humes hawk-owl, Andaman cuckooshrike, Andaman bulbul, Nicobar jungle-flycatcher, Andaman shama and Andaman flowerpecker.|$|E
