6000|$|JULIA (with studied insolence). Has {{that woman}} told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has given {{you up to}} me without an attempt to defend her conquest? ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. It {{took her}} {{years to get}} to the same point with <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> got to with me in five minutes, it seems.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield; [...] "not {{being able}} to be here herself, Miss Asher {{requested}} me to say to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> must decline--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> can? Do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{knows what}} she wishes herself until the last moment, until it is too late?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Christine {{will tell}} <b>thee</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{expected}} to see him at the convent. We are a race proscribed, Mademoiselle de Willading, but we are human." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I played {{these songs}} to Susan {{the other day}} - she just laughed and said I was being spiteful because she wouldn't sleep with me when we first met. She also said to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> {{perfectly}} happy where she is at the moment, thank you very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No injury, no real injury--I am sure of that. But may not {{unhappiness}} come of it? Does {{it seem to}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is happy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{enough to}} agree with <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is charming," [...] said the consul. [...] "I dined with them, and saw them at the consulate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Explain, red man, to {{the woman}} the truths that I have {{explained}} to <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may meet the arrows with a stronger counter-suggestion of immunity." ...|$|E
25|$|Downsizing the {{importance}} of another line: “You do see, don't <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> got to be killed?” The line, the first sentence in the novel uttered by Raymond to his sister Carol, is not said in its entirety in the adaptation, and is not given much thought after the fact.|$|R
5000|$|Lyn Gardner {{reviewed}} {{a performance}} {{in which the}} father was played by Sophie Okonedo: 'Watching her, never for a moment do <b>you</b> forget <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is a woman, and Crouch cannily ensures with his stream of stage directions <b>that</b> <b>you</b> never can forget <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is an actor. Nonetheless, as the evening wears on, neither do <b>you</b> doubt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is a middle-aged man. She looks the same, but she is different.' ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{knowledge}} of envy {{was a pleasant}} feeling to the man of no account. It was intensified {{later in the day}} when a luncher at the Club said spitefully, 'Well, for a debilitated Ditcher, Yeere, you are going it. Hasn't any kind friend told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> the most dangerous woman in Simla?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are, no doubt, {{anxious to}} rejoin your daughter," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Perhaps I had better tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is not at}} Valverde." ...|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (stopping him). Oh, it's no secret: {{everybody}} in the club guesses it. (To Cuthbertson.) Has Grace never mentioned to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wants to marry me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A woman {{gave it to}} me yesterday, and {{she told}} me, father, to tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wanted her forfeit, and when was she to have it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went and}} did not stand upon the order of my going. Mrs. Williamson is She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed. She has an {{inconvenient}} habit of making <b>you</b> realize <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is exactly right, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be all kinds of a fool if you didn't take her advice. <b>You</b> feel <b>that</b> what <b>she</b> thinks to-day you will think to-morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear <b>you</b> say <b>that.</b> It was but the other day <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{declared}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should be your wife in spite of herself." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{always seemed}} so glad so see <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thought <b>she</b> {{must have been}} anxiously {{awaiting}} <b>you,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were the very person of all others <b>that</b> <b>she</b> wished to have with her. Of course, I knew it was an affectation, {{but it was a}} very charming one.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kept here? She {{has been}} dead a score of years or more. Ask Flintwinch--ask HIM. They can both tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> died when Arthur went abroad.' ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (recoiling). Who told <b>you</b> <b>that?</b> (<b>She</b> {{shakes her}} head mysteriously, and he turns away from her moodily and adds) You had much better not have asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Norah's letter, no doubt, tells <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has left}} her situation. I feel it my painful duty {{to add that}} she has left it on your account.|$|E
30|$|Facilitator: So first, Ms. [Linda] Williams, {{say more}} about what <b>you</b> mean, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{increased}} the cognitive demand.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have it--the rotten, insular conceit {{of these}} Englishmen! <b>You</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would not come? Do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> if I {{were to say}} to her,--'Come and listen while I make garlands of words, while I take you through the golden doors!'--do <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would not put her hand in mine? Fancy--to live in my fairy chamber, to listen while I give shape and {{substance}} to all that I conceive--what woman would refuse!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what can}} she be doing there, James? Do {{you mean to}} say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has really gone to service at the Hall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|GRINNIDGE: [...] "It didn't {{occur to}} <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might feel bound {{to pay you}} for the first half-dozen, and was embarrassed how to offer {{to pay for them}} alone?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And as you've known {{me for a}} long time, you know,' said Mr Toots, 'let me assure <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is one of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} women that ever lived.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why,' says I, 'if {{you can get}} {{any woman}} you like to take your word, I suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> takes herself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In fact, {{she gave}} <b>you</b> to {{understand}} <b>that</b> the prisoner was actually {{related to her}} by blood. Did <b>you</b> say <b>that</b> <b>she</b> also told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> he was persecuted or ill-used by her other relations?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Holidaying in Jerusalem, Poirot overhears Raymond Boynton {{telling his}} sister, [...] "You do see, don't <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she's</b> {{got to be}} killed?" [...] Their stepmother, Mrs Boynton, is a [...] tyrant who dominates her family. When she is found dead {{on a trip to}} Petra, Poirot proposes to solve the case in twenty-four hours, even though he has no way of knowing whether it was murder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is also true,' {{said the}} Ambassador, 'provided she be constant; but <b>you</b> own <b>that</b> <b>she</b> signed the {{requisition}} for the dissolution.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Avery {{sent me to}} tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is going}} to marry Bruce Gordon instead of you. He came last night--and {{she says that she}} has always liked him best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} write to him those words. Indeed you must, mamma! 'She bids me tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has forgiven you, {{and will not}} hate you.' Promise me that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good heavens, I have {{forgotten}} her husband! They {{have been married}} rather more than a month. Did I tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is just {{two years older than}} I am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Positively! Haven't I told <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Miss Lockwood {{travels with}} Lord and Lady Montbarry? and don't <b>you</b> know <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is a member}} of the family? You will have to move, Countess, to our hotel.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Did <b>you</b> notice <b>that</b> <b>she</b> left {{us without}} even shaking hands? It {{was a very}} small omission, but it meant <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was quite absorbed in her grief.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! yes--the alterations. Didn't <b>you</b> say <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{has had a}} London {{architect}} stopping {{there on}} that account? What was he--old or young?' ...|$|R
