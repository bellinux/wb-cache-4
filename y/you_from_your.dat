500|$|In {{order to}} promote [...] "Get Enough", Ivy {{performed}} at several music festivals and made several concert appearances. Serving as the opening act for English band Gene, the trio performed [...] "Get Enough" [...] (along with [...] "Shallow" [...] and [...] "Don't Believe a Word") at Union Square in San Francisco on July 21, 1995. Aurore Bacmann from Twee Kitten noted that the rendition was [...] "very good" [...] and [...] "never too loud, but pleasantly enough to distract <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> grim thoughts and worries". Additional performances with varying set lists occurred the same day at the Wherehouse Records headquarters, where Durand allowed the audience to request certain songs, and at the Rasputin Records music shop in Berkeley, California, the following afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Each {{edition of}} Harris's List {{opens with a}} {{frontispiece}} showing a mildly erotic stock image opposite the title page, which, from the 1760s to 1780s, {{is followed by a}} lengthy commentary on prostitution. [...] This preamble argues that the prostitute is of benefit to the public, able to relieve man's natural inclination towards violence. [...] It describes the customer as a patron supportive of a good cause: [...] "be your purse strings never closed; nor let the name of prostitute deter <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> pious resolve!" [...] Prostitutes were generally scorned by 18th-century society, and the 1789 edition's preface complains [...] "Why should the victims of this natural propensity... be hunted like outcasts from society, perpetually gripped by the hand of petty tyranny", continuing: [...] "Is not the minister of state who sacrifices his country's honour to his private interest... more guilty than her?" ...|$|E
500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Rock Your Body", {{incorporates}} tinny, [...] "keyboard-set-to-emulate-clavichord" [...] synthesizers of The Neptunes' late 90s productions, overlaid with [...] "keys and a propulsive drum vamp". The seventh {{track of}} the album is [...] "Nothin' Else"; which according to David Merryweather of Drowned in Sound is a [...] "slinky" [...] and [...] "smooth" [...] song {{that is similar to}} the works of American musician Stevie Wonder. Influenced by Jackson's musical style and Van McCoy's 1975 single [...] "The Hustle", [...] "Last Night" [...] is played with a xylophone. [...] "Still On My Brain", the ninth track on the album, is a slow jam, similar to the songs performed by Timberlake's former band 'NSYNC. [...] "(And She Said) Take Me Now" [...] which features singer Janet Jackson, is a disco, '80s funk and dub song that contains racy lyrics. Similar to the previous song, the eleventh {{track of the}} album has racy lyrics; on it Timberlake [...] "cockily" [...] sings the line, [...] "I could think of a couple positions for you". [...] "Let's Take a Ride" [...] is the twelfth song on the album, on which, according to Uncut magazine, Timberlake [...] "offers to deliver <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> humdrum existence". The record concludes with [...] "Never Again", a ballad, on which Timberlake becomes [...] "downright maudlin and snippy".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the retreat}} of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza {{neighbourhood}}s were besieged by the Muslims, in revenge. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions. On {{the request of}} the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence according to the Torah, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. [...] says: [...] When you march up to attack a city, make its people an offer of peace. If they accept and open their gates, all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you. If they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle, lay siege to that city. When the Lord your God delivers it into your hand, put to the sword all the men in it. As for the women, the children, the livestock and everything else in the city, you may take these as plunder for yourselves. And you may use the plunder the Lord your God gives <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> enemies. [...] Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.|$|E

2500|$|The priest {{may offer}} counsel, and proposes {{an act of}} penance which the {{penitent}} accepts and then recites an act of contrition. An essential for forgiveness from serious sin is a sincere resolve {{to try to avoid}} the sin in the future. The Council of Trent (Session Fourteen, Chapter I) quoted [...] as the primary Scriptural proof for the doctrine concerning this sacrament. The priest imparts absolution. Since the Council of Trent, the essential words of absolution have been: [...] "I absolve <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> sins {{in the name of the}} Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."

2500|$|Henry Cheevers was {{the husband}} of Sarah Cheevers {{and the father of}} her children. The Cheevers family was settled in Slaughterford, Wiltshire. Henry Cheever’s {{religious}} beliefs are unclear, though in some letters, Sarah seems to be attempting to persuade him towards Quakerism. She wrote, “I am a witness of… the messengers of Christ, who ... directing you where you may find your saviour to purge and cleanse <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> sins, and to reconcile you to his Father.” ' Some historians believe that this indicates that her husband and children may not have been practicing Quakers, and might have been Protestants of a different denomination. Though families generally shared the same religious beliefs, various forms of Protestantism were popular in England in the period immediately following the English Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|In Dion's version, [...] "I Drove All Night" [...] is dance-pop. It {{was also}} {{considered}} [...] "{{a little bit}} dance-club, a little bit rock & roll." [...] Lyrically, she recalls a feverish trek for sexual gratification. She sings in the first verse, [...] "Maybe I should have called you first, but I was dying to get to you/I was dreaming while I drove the long, straight road ahead." [...] In the chorus, she sings, [...] "Woke <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> sleep {{to make love to}} you/Is that all right?/I drove all night." [...] In the second verse, Dion duplicates a line as it is heard in Orbison's original recording. Instead of singing, [...] "no matter where I go I hear the beating of our heart," [...] Dion sings, [...] "our one heart." [...] Like the original, the chorus is sung again twice, which ends the single.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Pi's mother, Empress Dowager Bian, intervened and scolded her son, [...] "If not {{for what}} Zilian did at Liang (梁) and Pei (沛), you wouldn't {{have made it}} to where you are today." [...] She also told Cao Pi's empress, Guo Nüwang, [...] "If Cao Hong dies today, {{tomorrow}} I'll make the Emperor remove <b>you</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> position as Empress." [...] The empress then tearfully pleaded with Cao Pi several times to spare Cao Hong. Cao Pi finally agreed to spare Cao Hong, but stripped him of his appointments and titles and confiscated his properties. After Empress Dowager Bian intervened again, Cao Pi reluctantly returned Cao Hong his properties but did not restore him to his former positions. Upon learning that Cao Pi had pardoned him, Cao Hong was so overjoyed that he wrote a memorial to the emperor to express his remorse and said he would {{spend the rest of his}} life behind the walls of his home.|$|E
