[...] Ted Nugent said, [...] "If you don't know every Chuck Berry lick, you can't play rock guitar." [...] Bob Dylan called Berry [...] "the Shakespeare of rock 'n' roll". Springsteen tweeted, [...] "Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{addresses}} {{the end of}} a marriage between Beyoncé's parents Tina Knowles and Mathew Knowles. The lyrics are written in a form of an [...] "open letter" [...] in which the singer praises her mother's courage for ending a dysfunctional marriage. At the beginning of the song, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / When you think about father / and how <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> be the perfect wife... I wish you didn’t hurt at all." [...] Alex Frank of Vogue noted how the song was thematically [...] "an enlightened follow-up" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies", discussing a similar private subject matter for the singer. He further opined that the lyrics apply to other women who are part of toxic relationships.|$|E

Vocals were recorded by Michael Congdon at the In Your Ear Studios in Richmond, Virginia, with assistance by Dustin Faltz.

[...] "Deuces" [...] leaked online on May 20, 2010, and was later released digitally on June 25, 2010 as the first single from Brown's collaborative mixtape with Tyga, Fan of a Fan (2010). In an interview with MTV News, Tyga elaborated on [...] "Deuces" [...] and its theme, stating: [...] "Basically it's about you getting rid of this girl, <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> make it work, {{but you got to}} move on. So you put up one finger, put up another, and then 'Deuces. The song appeared as the opening track on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).|$|E

Certainly, to buy off your {{conscience}} you helped {{here and there}} a persecuted person, but millions of innocent human beings were allowed to be murdered without any kind of protest being uttered ... first you betrayed your friends, then your children in that you let them stake their lives on a criminal war– and finally that you betrayed Germany itself, because when the war was already quite hopeless, you did not once arm yourselves against the senseless destruction of Germany.|$|E
2500|$|Reid {{served as}} {{chairman}} of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. When Jack Gordon, La Toya Jackson's future agent and husband, offered Reid a $12,000 bribe to get approval of new games for casinos, Reid brought in the FBI to tape Gordon's bribery attempt and arrest him. After FBI agents interrupted the transaction, as prearranged, Reid lost his temper and attempted to choke Gordon, saying [...] "You son of a bitch, <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> bribe me!" [...] before agents stopped him. Gordon was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to six months in prison. In 1981, Reid's wife found a bomb attached to the family station wagon; Reid suspected it was placed by Gordon, although this has never been proven in a court of law.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{critics have}} derided Friedman's {{idiosyncratic}} prose style, with its tendency to use mixed metaphors and analogies. [...] Walter Russell Mead described his prose as being [...] "an occasionally flat Midwestern demotic punctuated by gee-whiz exclamations {{about just how}} doggone irresistible globalization is – lacks the steely elegance of a Lippmann, the unobtrusive serviceability of a Scotty Reston or the restless fireworks of a Maureen Dowd and is best taken in small doses." [...] Similarly, journalist Matt Taibbi has said of Friedman's writing that, [...] "Friedman came up with lines so hilarious you couldn't make them up {{even if you were}} trying – and when <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> actually picture the 'illustrative' figures of speech he offered to explain himself, what you often ended up with was pure physical comedy of the Buster Keaton/Three Stooges school, with whole nations and peoples slipping and falling on the misplaced banana peels of his literary endeavors." ...|$|E

2500|$|The spell is {{explained}} as a complicated memory-altering magic. But {{it is not}} as simple as erasing the memory of everyone directly, as this is merely Subtractive Magic. Also, simply attempting to erase the memory because it uses Subtractive Magic, has a strong probability of destroying portions of the mind, thus killing the subject. A death spell, can for instance, make it seem like a person is dead, but everyone still remembers the person existed. [...] Also, if <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> erase the knowledge of even a simple person like a woodcutter, the nature of reality would be such that all too obvious gaps in memory would be noticed, such as how the woodcutter's wife got her food and wood if she were crippled. For this reason, some wizards came up with a workaround, using some energy to warp reality itself or at least human perception of it. [...] False memories are automatically created to fill the gaps in reality, almost as if someone went back in time and changed them.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based {{physician}} who had treated Jackson {{and his children}} on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff said that Jackson asked for stimulants {{so that he could}} get through some demanding performances. He said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue, fever, insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications. According to the toxicological tests effectuated on Jackson's body, no addiction had been reported, and none of the experts called to testify at Murray's trial have identified the singer as a drug addict. Janet Jackson confirmed that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Jackson was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in. He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> deal with him," [...] one family source said, [...] "he would shut you out. You just wouldn't hear from him for long periods." [...] The family denied that they had tried to intervene.|$|E
