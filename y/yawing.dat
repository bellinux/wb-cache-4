5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic <b>yawing</b> moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the <b>yawing</b> of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front wheels. While wobble or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|E
25|$|When {{an engine}} on a multi-engine {{aircraft}} fails, the thrust distribution on the aircraft becomes asymmetrical, {{resulting in a}} <b>yawing</b> moment {{in the direction of}} the failed engine. A sideslip develops, causing the total drag of the aircraft to increase considerably, resulting in a drop in the aircraft's rate of climb. The rudder, and to a certain extent the ailerons via the use of bank angle, are the only aerodynamic controls available to the pilot to counteract the asymmetrical thrust <b>yawing</b> moment.|$|E
30|$|Another {{critical}} component to {{be accounted for}} is {{the difference in the}} modelling of <b>yaw</b> maneuvers. <b>Yaw</b> maneuvers occur when the actual <b>yaw</b> angle differs from the nominal <b>yaw</b> angle. The nominal <b>yaw</b> angle is the orientation angle by which a satellite would maintain optimal solar visibility throughout its orbit, provided it could spin arbitrarily fast. The actual <b>yaw</b> angle is the orientation that the satellite can maintain due to its limited rate of <b>yaw.</b>|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a <b>yaw</b> {{stability control system}} for a vehicle. At least one <b>yaw</b> rate sensor (5) is arranged to generate a signal indicative of the vehicle <b>yaw</b> rate. A controller is responsive to a <b>yaw</b> rate error. The controller is arranged to activate <b>yaw</b> angle control part (1) of the controller, {{in response to a}} body-force-disturbance being detected by at least one body-force-disturbance detection unit (7), and to start performing control of the <b>yaw</b> angle error in order to obtain a correction of the vehicle <b>yaw</b> angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance, and input to the system for performing vehicle <b>yaw</b> stability control operations (6) a signal to perform a body-force-disturbance <b>yaw</b> stability control operation for eliminating the vehicle <b>yaw</b> angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance and returning the vehicle to a pre body-force-disturbance heading...|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{lack the}} {{symmetry}} between pitch and <b>yaw,</b> so that directional stability in <b>yaw</b> {{is derived from}} {{a different set of}} stability derivatives. The <b>yaw</b> plane equivalent to the short period pitch oscillation, which describes <b>yaw</b> plane directional stability is called Dutch roll. Unlike pitch plane motions, the lateral modes involve both roll and <b>yaw</b> motion.|$|R
25|$|Heavier {{aircraft}} are more stable and {{more resistant to}} <b>yawing</b> moments, and therefore have lower VMCAs. The longitudinal centre of gravity affects the VMCA as well: the further from the tail it is, the lower the minimum control speed, because the rudder {{will be able to}} provide a larger <b>yawing</b> moment, and so it is easier to counteract the imbalance in thrust. The lateral centre of gravity also has an effect: the nearer the inoperative engine it is, the larger the moment of the working engine, and so the more force the rudder has to apply. This means that if the lateral centre of gravity shifts towards the inoperative engine, the aircraft's VMCA will increase. The thrust of most engines depends on altitude and temperature; increasing altitude and higher temperatures decrease thrust. This means that if the air temperature is higher and the aircraft has a higher altitude, the force of the operative engine will be lower, the rudder will have to provide less counteractive force, and so the VMCA will be lower. The bank angle also influences the minimum control speed. A small bank angle away from the inoperative engine is required for smallest possible sideslip and therefore lower VMCA. Finally, if the P-factor of the working engine increases, then its <b>yawing</b> moment increases, and the aircraft's VMCA increases as a result.|$|E
25|$|Any {{factor that}} has {{influence}} on the balance of forces and on the <b>yawing</b> and rolling moments after engine failure might also affect VMCs. When the vertical tail is designed and the VMCA is measured, the worst-case scenario for all factors is taken into account. This ensures that the VMCs published in the AFMs guaranteed to be safe.|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} inboard engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an inboard engine {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of <b>yawing</b> moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.|$|E
40|$|The Mod- 0 100 kW {{experimental}} {{wind turbine}} was tested {{to determine the}} effects of <b>yaw</b> on rotor power, blade loads and teeter response. The wind turbine was operated for extended periods at <b>yaw</b> angles up to 49 deg to define average or mean response to <b>yaw.</b> It was determined that the effect of <b>yaw</b> on rotor power can be approximated by the cube of the velocity normal to the rotor disc as long as the <b>yaw</b> angle is less than 30 deg. Blade bending loads were relatively unaffected by <b>yaw,</b> but teeter angle increased with wind speed as the magnitude of the <b>yaw</b> angle exceeded 30 deg indicating a potential for teeter stop impacts at large <b>yaw</b> angles. No other adverse effects due to <b>yaw</b> were noted during the tests...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>yaw</b> dampers: series <b>yaw</b> dampers and {{parallel}} <b>yaw</b> dampers. The servo actuator of a parallel <b>yaw</b> damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of a series <b>yaw</b> damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.|$|R
25|$|Vestibular display: These {{displays}} {{provide a}} sense of motion to the user (motion simulator). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, <b>yawing</b> or rolling. The simulators can also move {{in such a way as}} to produce {{a sense of}} acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).|$|E
25|$|If {{an engine}} fails during taxiing or takeoff, the thrust <b>yawing</b> moment will force the {{aircraft}} {{to one side}} on the runway. If the airspeed is not high enough and hence, the rudder-generated side force is not powerful enough, the aircraft will deviate from the runway centerline and may even veer off the runway. The airspeed at which the aircraft, after engine failure, deviates 9.1m from the runway centerline, despite using maximum rudder but {{without the use of}} nose wheel steering, is the minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG).|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{asymmetrical}} thrust {{has been}} used for directional control: if the left engine is idled and power is increased on the right side this will result in a yaw to the left, and vice versa. If throttle settings allow the throttles to be shifted without affecting the total amount of power, then yaw control can be combined with pitch control. If the aircraft is <b>yawing,</b> then the wing on the outside of this yaw movement will go faster than the inner wing. This creates higher lift on the faster wing, resulting in a rolling movement, which helps to make a turn.|$|E
40|$|A {{tracking}} controller with {{wave filter}} for ships with nonlinear manoeuvring characteristics is derived. Only {{measurement of the}} <b>yaw</b> angle is needed to assure global asymptotic stability of the <b>yaw</b> angle and <b>yaw</b> rate of the ship about the desired <b>yaw</b> angle and <b>yaw</b> rate. A case study finally shows that the influence from the wave disturbances on the rudder is attenuated in some frequency range...|$|R

40|$|Direct <b>yaw</b> moment {{control is}} an {{effective}} means to enhance vehicle stability and handling. The majority of the latest direct <b>yaw</b> moment control works employ sliding mode control to generate the target <b>yaw</b> moment.

25|$|Rhacophoridae flying frogs (gliding). A {{number of}} the Rhacophoridae, such as Wallace's flying frog (Rhacophorus nigropalmatus), have adaptations for gliding, the main feature being {{enlarged}} toe membranes. For example, the Malayan flying frog Rhacophorus prominanus glides using the membranes between the toes of its limbs, and small membranes located at the heel, {{the base of the}} leg, and the forearm. Some of the frogs are quite accomplished gliders, for example, the Chinese flying frog Rhacophorus dennysi can maneuver in the air, making two kinds of turn, either rolling into the turn (a banked turn) or <b>yawing</b> into the turn (a crabbed turn).|$|E
25|$|The {{vertical}} tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays {{a crucial role}} in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust <b>yawing</b> moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the {{vertical tail}} must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.|$|E
25|$|A rudder is {{a primary}} control surface used to steer a ship, boat, submarine, hovercraft, aircraft, or other {{conveyance}} that moves through a fluid medium (generally air or water). On an aircraft the rudder is used primarily to counter adverse yaw and p-factor and is not the primary control used to turn the airplane. A rudder operates by redirecting the fluid past the hull (watercraft) or fuselage, thus imparting a turning or <b>yawing</b> motion to the craft. In basic form, a rudder is a flat plane or sheet of material attached with hinges to the craft's stern, tail, or after end. Often rudders are shaped so as to minimize hydrodynamic or aerodynamic drag. On simple watercraft, a tiller—essentially, a stick or pole acting as a lever arm—may {{be attached to the}} top of the rudder to allow it to be turned by a helmsman. In larger vessels, cables, pushrods, or hydraulics may be used to link rudders to steering wheels. In typical aircraft, the rudder is operated by pedals via mechanical linkages or hydraulics.|$|E

500|$|KAL007 {{had four}} {{redundant}} hydraulic systems of which systems one, two, and three were damaged or destroyed. There {{was no evidence}} of damage to system four. The hydraulics provided actuation for all the primary flight controls; all secondary flight controls except leading edge slats; and landing gear retraction, extension, gear steering, and wheel braking. Each primary flight control axis received power from all four hydraulic systems. Upon missile detonation, the jumbo jet began to experience oscillations (<b>yawing)</b> as the dual channel yaw damper was damaged. <b>Yawing</b> would not have occurred if hydraulic systems one or two were fully operational. The result is that the control column did not thrust forward upon impact (it should have done so as the plane was on autopilot) to bring down the plane to its former altitude of [...] This failure of the autopilot to correct the rise in altitude indicates that hydraulic system number three, which operates the autopilot actuator, a system controlling the plane's elevators, was damaged or out. KAL007's airspeed and acceleration rate both began to decrease as the plane began to climb.

5000|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the gliding <b>yaw</b> {{bearings}} and their components are designed and constructed to last the service life of the wind turbine, {{it should be possible to}} replace worn out <b>yaw</b> bearing gliding elements or other components of the <b>yaw</b> system. To allow for replace-ability of worn out components, the <b>yaw</b> systems are designed in segments. Usually one or more gliding planes comprise several sub-elements that contain a number of gliding elements (radial or axial or a combination). These sub-elements can be individually removed and repaired, re-fit or replaced. In this way the <b>yaw</b> bearing can be serviced without the need of dis-assembly of the whole gliding <b>yaw</b> bearing (e.g., in case of a roller <b>yaw</b> bearing, dis-assembly of the whole wind turbine).
