500|$|Whannell {{polished}} the script, with {{input from}} Wan, {{in order to}} bring it into the Saw universe, but kept the characters, traps and deaths from The Desperate script. [...] Bousman said, [...] "But you could read the script for The Desperate and watch Saw II, and <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to draw a comparison". [...] Wan and Whannell also served as executive producers. All the previous film's crew members returned: editor Kevin Greutert, cinematographer Armstrong, and composer Charlie Clouser.

500|$|When the {{situation}} in Czechoslovakia was discussed with the Politburo, Brezhnev was not the one pushing hardest {{for the use of}} military force. Brezhnev was aware of the dire situation he was in, and if he had abstained or voted against Soviet intervention in Czechoslovakia he may have been faced with growing turmoil— domestically and in the Eastern Bloc. Archival evidence suggests that Brezhnev {{was one of the few}} who was looking for a temporary compromise with the reform-friendly Czechoslovak government when their relationship was at the brink. Significant voices in the Soviet leadership demanded the re-installation of a so-called 'revolutionary government'. After the military intervention in 1968, Brezhnev met with Czechoslovak reformer Bohumil Simon, then a member of the Politburo of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and said, [...] "If I had not voted for Soviet armed assistance to Czechoslovakia <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sitting here today, but quite possibly I wouldn't either." ...|$|E

Specifically for the similarly themed Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors, and Runaways, which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted [...] "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... {{things that are happening}} in L.A. [...] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans ... It's being aware of it and {{trying to find a way}} for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense." [...] He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network [...] "feelings" [...] need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show Avengers Tower as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be [...] "less specific" [...] about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that [...] "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" [...] and that the characters could be in an area of the city where <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> able to see the tower, even though it exists.|$|E

2500|$|The Churubusco {{neighborhood}} has the historic Dieguinos monastery {{located near the}} ancient road to Iztapalapa. In the pre-Hispanic period, this area was a small island, which was called Teopanzolco, at the juncture of Lake Texcoco and Lake Xochimilco [...] [...] In the 17th century, the Spanish built the monastery of Churubusco over a ceremonial site dedicated to the god Huitzilopochtli. This monastery complex {{is best known for}} its role during the Mexican-American War. The Mexicans, aided by the [...] "Saint Patrick's Battalion", a military unit composed of catholic immigrants (mainly Irish), had fortified the monastery and fought until they ran out of ammunition and then beaten only after hand-to-hand combat. When U.S. General David Twiggs asked Mexican General Pedro María de Anaya to surrender his ammunition, the reply {{is said to have been}} “If there were any, <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> here.” There is a memorial to this event outside the main entrance and a plaque commemorating the [...] "Irish martyrs". The monastery’s church still retains its original function, but the most of the rest of the complex is now the Museo Nacional de las Intervenciones. The collection includes an American map of the facility from 1847, artifacts from the French Intervention in Mexico and a plot by Henry Lane Wilson to bring down the government of Francisco I. Madero in 1913.|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, Young stunned {{observers}} when {{he appeared}} before the McCarthy era House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) and defied the congressmen with sarcastic retorts and repeatedly refused to answer {{whether or not he}} was a member of the Communist Party. The encounter came at a highly publicized formal hearing in Detroit. Young’s performance made him a hero in Detroit’s growing black community. [...] On HUAC’s charge that he seemed reluctant to fight communism, Coleman said: “I am not here to fight in any un-American activities, because I consider the denial of the right to vote to large numbers of people all over the South un-American.” On the HUAC congressman from Georgia: “I happen to know, in Georgia, Negro people are prevented from voting by virtue of terror, intimidation and lynchings. It is my contention <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> in Congress today if it were not for the legal restrictions on voting on the part of my people.” [...] On the HUAC committee: “Congressman, neither me or none of my friends were at this plant the other day brandishing a rope in the face of John Cherveny, a young union organizer and factory worker who was threatened with repeated violence after members of the HUAC alleged that he might be a communist, I can assure you I have had no part in the hanging or bombing of Negroes in the South. I have not been responsible for firing a person from his job for what I think are his beliefs, or what somebody thinks he believes in, and things of that sort. That is the hysteria that has been swept up by this committee.” ...|$|E
