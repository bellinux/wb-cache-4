60|$|Wife. Why he no makee {{you much}} good better? <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> makee you.|$|E
60|$|Q. Still, I don't {{understand}} it at all. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> spoke to you, {{and that he}} was dead.|$|E
5000|$|Kʷ scutxx tl sk̓ʷətikənx"Were <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> is from Seattle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Mr. Paret. Of course I don't want to {{question}} your judgment, sir. And <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> {{a friend of}} yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|Hen. [...] With him! [...] He----might prevent it. As <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> fond [...] Of war, why makes he it not {{on those}} marauders? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, sir,' said Jim, {{in a tone}} which implied, 'I am no George Washington myself, {{but when}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> read it inadvertently, well--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Louis,' {{suddenly}} exclaimed the Earl, 'did you {{not tell}} me something extraordinary about James Frost? Whom did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was going to marry?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{not much}} to do. But why do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was a {{profitable}} visitor, mother? Did he pay you anything for what you did?" ...|$|E
60|$|Medon. I know not, lady; {{but as a}} {{messenger}} is he clad, and with great haste demandeth speech of <b>thee,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> bore tidings of great import.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; he's doing awfully well." [...] And a {{sound like}} a faint sigh caught his ears. [...] "Would <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> changed much since you knew him, Dad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{the young}} man compromises on the law. I see," [...] said Mrs. Pasmer. [...] "And <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> been going into Boston a great deal? Where does he go?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, of course! Certainly," [...] said Mr. Hamlin coolly. [...] "Of course, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>HE</b> set the trap--yes--you {{just hang}} on to that idea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Urge that {{no further}} steps be taken against the boy. After what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> {{did during the}} riot the {{officers}} of the company should be lenient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is Mr. Nicholas?" [...] she asked. It {{seemed to}} her that Fillmore was the only {{possible}} source of information. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{should have}} thought of it. A man does not allow himself to love without any {{consideration}} or purpose. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> is a gentleman. A gentleman should not look to live on means brought to him by a wife. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> did not." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go away, child; I must think. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> to consult' Dennis? Do {{you know}} her address? Ask Barbara {{when you get back}} and {{telephone}} it to me. And at her daughter's kiss, she added grimly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may have}} been critical," [...] {{admitted}} George [...] "but look at the thing {{from my point of}} view. One of <b>you</b> <b>says</b> <b>he's</b> got an instinct, and leads me to a wasps' nest {{in the middle of a}} wood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, now he knows, of course. He is a right-minded, generous boy," [...] said Geraldine. [...] "I was wrong. Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> {{was very}} much upset?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was asleep,--look at this arm, [...] And {{tell me if}} 'tis fit {{for such}} a work. [...] Oswald, Oswald! [...] [Leans upon OSWALD.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I fear she {{has much}} to suffer. He made her think him not a marrying man, and put her off her guard. Did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was agreeable?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then he is," [...] {{asserted}} the Major; [...] "for Patsy's always right, {{even when}} she's wrong. I've had me eye on that man Hucks already, for he's the merriest faced villain I ever encountered. Do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> shy with <b>you</b> girls?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, <b>you</b> image,' <b>says</b> <b>he</b> rudely, 'if <b>you</b> mean Marribon, why don't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> Marribon? What {{house are}} you a-lookin' for, eh?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Joan laughed. [...] "I can see Carleton rather fancying {{himself in}} a tiara," [...] she said. [...] "I must tell Phillips what <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> <b>He's</b> out for a fight with him. Government by Parliament or Government by Press {{is going to be}} his war cry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ken! You're all bloody!" [...] he exclaimed, {{in great}} excitement. [...] "He didn't lick <b>you?</b> <b>Say</b> <b>he</b> didn't! He's got to fight me, too! You're all bunged up!" ...|$|E
6000|$|SIR OLIVER. Ah then he {{has been}} just half {{a year on the}} stool of Repentance--Poor Peter! But <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> has entirely given up Charles--never sees him, hey? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{will be no}} rival to me,' said Lord Milford; 'for I am an avowed fortune-hunter, {{and that}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> does not care for, at least, at present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember. Yes, I {{recall the}} Sipperley case. He couldn't {{bring himself to}} the scratch. A marked coldness of the feet, was there not? I {{recollect}} <b>you</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> was letting--what was it?--letting something do something. Cats entered into it, if I am not mistaken." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{they ask}} about the cashier, <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> <b>he</b> cuts a dash here, ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Now do <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he’s</b> {{not in a}} state, my {{precious}} pet?” shouted his mother, {{dropping on}} her knees before him with clasped hands, but touching him no more than {{if he had been}} a gilded idol. “It will pass—it’s only for an instant; but don’t say such dreadful things!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, after all, {{you gave}} each other only a vague hint. It would be {{difficult}} even to reproach the corporal if, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> went back on it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall hear it with pleasure, cousin. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> holds only {{temporary}} rank. I think that, after the signal service he has rendered, {{it should be}} made substantial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he were Admiral Hawke {{he shall}} pay his score," [...] cried Silver; and then, relinquishing my hand--"Who did <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was?" [...] he asked. [...] "Black what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if this ain't outragis!" [...] {{cried the}} one-eyed man; [...] "perfectly outragis! Going to murder <b>you,</b> <b>says</b> <b>you!</b> What's <b>he</b> a-goin' {{to do that}} for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{never told}} me. You gave me to {{understand}} that your assistant was alive, and now <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he’s</b> dead. Which is it? Were you lying then or are you lying now?” No! the thought of such a scene {{was not to be}} borne. He had sat down appalled, thinking: “What shall I do now?” ...|$|R
60|$|Sandy. Couldn't you, my darling, {{keep him}} from ME? Couldn't you make him think HE was sick? Couldn't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>he's</b> exposin' his {{precious}} health by sittin' out thar to-night; thet ther's chills and fever in every breath? (Aside.) Ef the old Don plants himself in that chair, that gal's chances for goin' out to-night is gone up.|$|R
