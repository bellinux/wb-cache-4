500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter how many times you get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E

In most cases, it's inspiring but in that {{particular}} song I was pissed off with it. I {{was ready for a}} break but it didn't seem fair on the people I worked with at the time." ...|$|E

And I wish I had seen anything so influential. I suppose there was an aura, a halo, some sort of effulgency about the place; for here I find you louder than the rest. Well, it may be {{there is a time}} coming; and I wonder, when it comes, whether it will be a time of little, exclusive, one-eyed rascals like you and me, or parties of the old stamp who can paint and fight, and write and keep books of double entry, and sculp, and scalp. It might be. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of stuff in the kettle, {{and a great deal of}} it Celtic. I have changed my mind progressively about England, practically the whole of Scotland is Celtic, and the western half of England, and all Ireland, and the Celtic blood makes a rare blend for art. If it is stiffened up with Latin blood, you get the French. We were less lucky: we had only Scandinavians, themselves decidedly artistic, and the Low-German lot. However, that is a good starting-point, and with all the other elements in your crucible, it may come to something great very easily. I wish you would hurry up and let me see it. Here is a long while I have been waiting for something GOOD in art; and what have I seen? Zola's DEBACLE and a few of Kipling's tales. [...] Are you a reader of Barbey d'Aurevilly? He is a never-failing source of pleasure to me, for my sins, I suppose. What a work is the RIDEAU CRAMOISI! and L'ENSORCELEE! and LE CHEVALIER DES TOUCHES! ...|$|E

50|$|Third-party {{providers}} {{sold more}} than 200 different assembler subroutines {{that could be used}} by System/36 and Advanced/36 programmers to exceed RPG II limitations. Some of the limitations of RPGII on the System/3, 32, 34 and 36 including the Advanced/36 was the 64K limit and the number of files <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> in <b>a</b> program. So if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of programming lines or had large arrays, it was easy to exceed the 64,000 bytes of object code. However, RPGII running on the as/400 and its follow on iseries and IBM I (those running os/400 or i5/OS in what is called S/36EE (execution environment)) those limits (the 64K bytes and the number of files) were either greatly expanded or removed.|$|R

5000|$|Our {{health care}} system is {{based on the premise that}} health care is a {{commodity}} like VCRs or computers and that it should be distributed according to the ability to pay in the same way that consumer goods are. That's not what health care should be. Health care is a need; it's not a commodity, and it should be distributed according to need. If you're very sick, <b>you</b> should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of it. If you're not sick, <b>you</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of it. But this should be seen as a personal, individual need, not as a commodity to be distributed like other marketplace commodities. That is a fundamental mistake in the way this country, and only this country, looks at health care. And that market ideology is what has made the {{health care system}} so dreadful, so bad at what it does.|$|R
