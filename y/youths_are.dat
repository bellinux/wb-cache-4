5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that <b>youths</b> <b>are</b> not endangered by sexually explicit material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} much {{scholarly}} discussion {{of the reasons for}} Daniel's refusal of the king's ration. The explanation perhaps most commonly found is that Daniel and his friends wished to avoid breaking the Jewish religious laws regarding ritual slaughter (the kosher laws); alternatively, they may have wished to avoid meat and wine as these, unlike vegetables and water, were regularly used in offerings to gods (in this case, the gods of Babylon). In either case, the theological point being made is that the Jewish <b>youths</b> <b>are</b> remaining loyal to the God of Israel while still serving the foreign king.|$|E

25|$|Authority {{derives from}} the age-group and the age-set. Prior to {{circumcision}} a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group {{through a series of}} rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai <b>youths</b> <b>are</b> not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the Luhya, boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live apart from the rest of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.|$|E
2500|$|Consequences {{of youth}} {{exclusion}} in MENA have included young people entering waithood, a {{period during which}} they simply wait for their lives to begin, most notably by queuing {{for long periods of}} unemployment during which they live with parents and are financially unable to pursue marriage or home ownership. [...] While delayed marriage is a trend seen in many societies, adaptations vary, such that it is normal in the United States and Europe for young unmarried couples to cohabitate, while in MENA such an arrangement is unacceptable. [...] Instead, an increasing number of <b>youths</b> <b>are</b> engaging in nikah urfi, temporary marriages, which offer little security to the wife and any subsequent offspring. The psychological impact is also considerable, with unemployment leading to depression and social isolation, often with physical manifestations. [...] There is considerable concern in the international community that these isolated <b>youths</b> <b>are</b> marketed to by extremist groups such as al-Qaeda, who prey upon their sense of social exclusion and hopelessness.|$|E

Conversely, while introversion {{is perceived as}} less socially desirable, it is strongly associated with positive traits such as intelligence and [...] "giftedness."

2500|$|The Tanith {{people are}} always {{described}} as pale-skinned and dark-haired, with a lilting, sing-song accent. Most Tanith men (and <b>youths)</b> <b>are</b> tattooed with blue ink. No female Tanith are mentioned in detail, and it is presumed that none made it off-world, but if any did they did not accompany the Tanith First. The main Tanith curse-word is feth, which {{is used in the}} same context as [...] "fuck", but it is also the name of an ancient Tanith tree-god. Sacra is an alcoholic beverage favoured by the Tanith, although it is not clear if it is native to Tanith. Many Tanith names begin with [...] "Mk", a variant of [...] "Mc" [...] or [...] "Mac" [...] used by the Irish and Scottish, from whom inspiration for the Tanith appears to have been drawn. There are also elements of Welsh in their language. Tanith pipes are described as a small clutch of spidery reeds attached to a bellows bag which is squeezed rhythmically under the arm, and make a sound similar to Uilleann pipes. Their initial use on Tanith was to guide off-worlders through the shifting forests, but in the Tanith First they are used to rally the men and spook the enemy (although they have a similar effect on the Tanith's allies). According to Scout Trooper Bonin, most old Tanith families (his own included) baptise and officially name their children at the age of eight, as naming children at birth was considered premature and a child would grow into the names he or she would need. Bonin also remarks that this tradition wasn't observed much in Tanith's final years. Tanith was home to the legendary Nalsheen wood warriors, a brotherhood of Tanith who used the martial art cwlwhl (pronounced kil-wil); using blade-tipped staffs to fight off multiple foes. The Nalsheen were responsible for overthrowing the corrupt Huhlhuch Dynasty and ushering in the free modern era of Tanith. Mkvenner is the only remaining Tanith to have been trained in cwlwhl, but has reluctantly admitted that he never completed his training. The Nalsheen used proto-Gothic – the early form of both High and Low Gothic used presently in the Imperium – as their private language.|$|E
