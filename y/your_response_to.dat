One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is [...] "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, {{which is also the}} title of one of his books. In the book The Compass of Zen, this kong-an is transcribed as follows: [...] "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha."

[...] In her dissertation, Dyson drew heavily from scholars such as Britton, Vygotsky,Ferreiro,and others who emphasized the critical role that oral language has in literacy learning. For instance, Britton was quoted by Dyson as stating: “All that the children write, <b>your</b> <b>response</b> <b>to</b> what they write, their response to each other, all this takes place afloat upon a sea of talk. Talk is what provides the links between you and them and what they have written, between what they have written and each other.” [...] In her dissertation,Dyson elected qualitative research to investigate the role of oral language in the early writing processes of five kindergarten students over a three-month period. During her case study she collected data, such as observational notes, audio recordings of children’s talk, written products, daily log entries, child and parent interviews, and informal assessment tasks. At the conclusion of this study, some of Dyson's findings include: that talk {{is an integral part of}} the early writing process, young children write for different purposes, and that there is no one early writing process.|$|E
