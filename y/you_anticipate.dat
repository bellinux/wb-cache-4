6000|$|The best of {{the earth}} cannot be told anyhow, all or any is best, [...] It is not what <b>you</b> <b>anticipated,</b> it is cheaper, easier, nearer, [...] Things are not dismiss'd from the places they held before, [...] The earth is just as {{positive}} and direct as it was before, [...] Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are as real as before, [...] But the soul is also real, it too is positive and direct, [...] No reasoning, no proof has establish'd it, [...] Undeniable growth has establish'd it.|$|R

[...] "Well, Mr. Caresfoot," [...] she began, after a little pause, [...] "I suppose I had better {{come to the point}} at once. First of all, I presume that, as <b>you</b> <b>anticipated</b> would be the case, there exists some sort of understanding between Mr. Heigham and your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Speak on!” {{said her}} husband, smiling; “I love {{the sounds of}} your voice. <b>You</b> must <b>anticipate</b> our errand hither: I have told you my plans: {{how do you like}} them?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "My dear Miss Rachel, you {{are very}} young--and you may find more {{difficulty}} in withdrawing from your present position than <b>you</b> <b>anticipate.</b> Have you no one--I mean a lady, of course--whom you could consult?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All-right, boys; as you {{are bound}} to have it so, you shall all go. But don't blame me if the perils are greater than <b>you</b> <b>anticipate,</b> and if the {{undertaking}} costs {{one or more of}} you your lives." ...|$|E

'Good God!' exclaimed Waverley, 'why should <b>you</b> <b>anticipate</b> such {{consequences}} from a union where {{birth is}} equal, where fortune is favourable, where, if I may venture to say so, the tastes are similar, where you allege no preference for another, where you even express a favourable opinion of him whom you reject?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{inexperience}} of the world, Miss Tulliver, prevents <b>you</b> from <b>anticipating</b> {{fully the}} very unjust conceptions {{that will probably}} be formed concerning your conduct,--conceptions which will have a baneful effect, even in spite of known evidence to disprove them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} {{obliged to}} you," [...] Brott answered hurriedly. [...] "I am afraid, however, that <b>you</b> <b>anticipate</b> matters a good deal.

6000|$|... 'Sir John, Sir John,' {{returned}} the locksmith, 'at twelve tomorrow, these men die. Hear the few words I have to add, {{and do not}} hope to deceive me; for though I am a plain man of humble station, {{and you are a}} gentleman of rank and learning, the truth raises me to your level, and I KNOW that <b>you</b> <b>anticipate</b> the disclosure with which I am about to end, and that you believe this doomed man, Hugh, to be your son.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me," [...] said Jacinta, [...] "that <b>you</b> are <b>anticipating,</b> or {{confusing}} things considerably, but I'll {{try not to}} offend you by making that a little plainer, though, I should almost like to. I'm in quite a prickly humour to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, <b>you</b> have <b>anticipated</b> my occupation. Chuzzlewit be d----d. High {{comedy and}} five hundred pounds {{are the only}} matters I can think of. I call it [...] "The One Thing Needful; or, A Part is Better than the Whole." [...] Here are the characters: ...|$|R

[...] "Surely, at all events, I had my freedom no less than I have it now. Pray what explanations should I have owed you and in what fear of you should I have gone?

Where's the glory, please, and where are the medals?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] the Doctor said earnestly, [...] "don't {{take this}} thing {{too much to}} heart. I don't wish to try and persuade {{you that it is}} not a grave misfortune, but even suppose this trouble takes the very worst form possible, I do not think you will come so very badly out of it as <b>you</b> <b>anticipate.</b> Even {{assuming}} that you are unable to do your part in absolute fighting, there may be other opportunities, and most likely will, in which you may be able to show that although unable to control your nerves in the din of battle, you possess in other respects coolness and courage. That feat of yours of attacking the tiger with the dog whip shows conclusively that under many circumstances you are capable of most daring deeds." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "No, no. I {{understand}} your message. This decision {{was taken by}} me and me alone. I'd no pressure at all from the party leader. Quite the contrary, I {{think he was a}} bit surprised! He didn't understand that I was going to do it. I think it was a shock to him. The pressure came from the constituents. And I took soundings and the last week I've been taking soundings, and they are absolutely beside themselves with anger.""Why is it, do you think, that <b>you</b> didn't <b>anticipate,</b> <b>you</b> didn't see what the public reaction would be, when they found out what MPs were claiming for, such as trees?" ...|$|R
