500|$|Deus Ex {{received}} critical acclaim, attaining a {{score of}} 90 out of 100 from 28 critics on Metacritic. Thierry Nguyen from Computer Gaming World said that the game [...] "delivers moments of brilliance, idiocy, ingenuity, and frustration." [...] Computer Games Magazine praised the title for its deep gameplay and its use of multiple solutions to situations in the game. Similarly, Edge highlighted the game's freedom of choice, saying that Deus Ex [...] "never tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Goals are set, but alter according to your decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never tells <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> even though the game is always telling you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{major theme}} {{of much of}} West's work was a question: when so many organisations use extreme {{violence}} towards evil ends, when {{and under what circumstances}} is it morally acceptable for their opponents to respond with violence? [...] He stated on different occasions that his novels all deal with the same aspect of life, that is, the dilemma when sooner or later you have a situation such that nobody can tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E

2500|$|... "Out of Step", A Minor Threat {{song from}} their second EP, further {{demonstrates}} the said belief: [...] "Don't smoke/Don't drink/Don't fuck/At least I can fucking think/I can't keep up/I'm {{out of step}} with the world." [...] The [...] "I" [...] in the lyrics was usually only implied, mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song, like the updated version on the 1983 album Out of Step, which is slower, allotting a bridge where MacKaye explains his philosophy of straight edge, explaining that straight edge [...] "is not a set of rules; I'm not telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> All I'm saying is there are three things, that are like so important to the whole world that I don't happen to find much importance in, whether it's fucking, or whether it's playing golf, because of that, I feel... (chorus)". Some of the other members of Minor Threat, Jeff Nelson in particular, took exception to what they saw as MacKaye's [...] attitude on the song.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the movie}} of William Inge's {{play of the}} same name, The Dark at the Top of the Stairs, young Sonny Flood, the son of Robert Preston's {{character}} Rubin Flood, collects pictures of motion picture stars. When he asks his aunt and uncle if they wouldd like to see them, his uncle asks, [...] "Have you got any of Norma Talmadge?" [...] Apparently the uncle's attraction to Norma Talmadge is a sore spot in the marriage, because Aunt Lottie (played by Eve Arden) goes on a rant about Norma Talmadge being a Catholic. She says, [...] "Norma Talmadge! Norma Talmadge! That's all I hear, is 'Norma Talmadge'! Maybe you'd like to marry Norma Talmadge some day, and let the Pope tell <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{with the rest of}} your life." [...] She [...] "gets even" [...] with Morris, though, when she comments, seeing a picture of Rudolph Valentino, [...] "I think it's a sin for a man to be as pretty as he is. I'd be scared stiff to let a man like him touch me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some BBC staff {{felt that}} too much blame had been placed on their {{organisation}} {{in the wake of}} the David Kelly affair in the Hutton Report, and that the government was interfering in the BBC. Tim Gospill, spokesman for the National Union of Journalists said [...] "Being independent doesn't just mean not having the government telling <b>you</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It means you can criticise the government as well. I'm not at all sure the government understands that." [...] Groups of staff staged walk outs from Broadcasting House and other BBC offices in Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Cardiff and Londonderry, in protest at Dyke's resignation. In addition, on 31 January 2004, BBC staff paid for a full-page advert in the Daily Telegraph to express their [...] "dismay" [...] over Dyke's departure. The fundraisers hoped to raise £10,000, a lot less than the market rate for a full page advert in a broadsheet newspaper. Reportedly they raised less than this amount, but were offered a deal by the Telegraph's advertising department which allowed the advert to be printed. It was signed by around 4,000 BBC employees; 10,000 (around a third of total BBC staff at the time) submitted their names for publication, but there was not sufficient space to include them all.|$|E
