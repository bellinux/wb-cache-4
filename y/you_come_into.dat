500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me that <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> this world as you leave it, on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E
500|$|Greene's {{nickname}} remained {{popular due to}} his exploits on {{the playing}} field, where he was described as ferocious and intimidating. He instilled fear in opponents with the intensity of his play. In a 1979 game against the Houston Oilers, with only seconds remaining and Houston leading 20–17, the Oilers lined up near the Pittsburgh goal line to run their final play. With victory already assured for the Oilers, Greene pointed angrily across {{the line of scrimmage}} at Houston quarterback Dan Pastorini, warning, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the end zone, I'll beat the crap out of you! I'm gonna kill you!" [...] Pastorini responded by taking a knee, ending the game. Afterword, Greene laughed and said, [...] "I knew you weren't going to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, {{because you have to}} care about these people in order to be worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{he broke}} in, [...] "I cannot tell when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the country, nor I don't care. It seems <b>you</b> <b>came</b> {{in time to}} harbour rebels." ...|$|R

2500|$|During a campaigning {{event in}} an {{aboriginal}} community, Ma made a controversial remark. Responding {{to a question}} from an aboriginal woman, Ma said, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the city, you are a Taipei citizen... Aborigines should adjust their mentality – if <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the city {{you have to play}} by its rules." [...] This statement was thought to be extremely inappropriate.|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Gaskell {{described}} {{the house when}} discussing Shirley: [...] "From the ‘Bloody Lane’, overshadowed by trees, <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the field in which Oakwell Hall is situated… The enclosure in front, half court, half garden; the panelled hall, with the gallery opening into the bed-chambers running round; the barbarous peach-coloured drawing-room; the bright look-out through the garden-door upon the grassy lawns and terraces behind, where the soft-hued pigeons still love to coo and strut in the sun, – are described in Shirley. The scenery of that fiction lies close around; the real events which suggested it {{took place in the}} immediate neighbourhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “Now, that’s what I’m talking about. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> our house, {{you should}} get your behind kicked. You don’t come into the OB [...] playing that stuff. You’re across the ocean over there. You’re across the city. You can’t come over to our place talking noise like that. You’ll get your butt beat. I {{was about to go}} down the {{elevator}} to get in that thing...I say, why don't we meet outside in the tunnel after the ball game and get it on some more? You don't come into the OB, baby. We've had a down couple of years but you don't come in here talking smack. Not in our house." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Nylons Irina Grechko, Steinfeld said [...] "'Starving' is a song about sort of knowing someone, or getting to know that certain someone, {{to the point where}} even though you were somebody before that person came along, they have given you this whole new outlook on yourself and on life. It’s this idea that since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> my life everything is different, and I didn’t know that it could be this different since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Macumazahn," [...] he said, [...] "I {{would add}} a word. When you were quite a lad <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> {{this country with}} Retief, did you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, well. You {{are not so}} {{advanced}} in life but that if <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> anything good, <b>you</b> might marry and start on a new lease! You are pounds better than when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> here." ...|$|R
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted the}} {{difference}} in wording between [...] which says of the Israelites in Goshen that [...] "they got possessions therein," [...] and [...] which says of the Israelites in Canaan, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the land of Canaan, which I gave you for a possession." [...] The Midrash read [...] to read, [...] "and they were taken in possession by it." [...] The Midrash thus taught {{that in the case}} of Goshen, the land seized the Israelites, so that their bond might be exacted and so as to bring about God's declaration to Abraham in [...] that the Egyptians would afflict the Israelites for 400 years. But the Midrash read [...] to teach the Israelites that if they were worthy, the Land of Israel would be an eternal possession, but if not, they would be banished from it.|$|E
2500|$|Pearson {{signed the}} Canada–United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and {{unemployment}} fell {{to its lowest}} rate in over a decade. While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the Vietnam War. Pearson spoke at Temple University in Philadelphia on 2 April 1965, while visiting the United States and voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold. To President Lyndon B. Johnson, this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to Camp David, Maryland, to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> my living room and piss on my rug." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] then {{spoke to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, [...] "Speak to {{the sons of}} Israel, and say to them, 'When <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the land which I shall give you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the [...] Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your {{vineyard}} and gather in its crop, but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest, a sabbath to the [...] [...] [...] You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, {{so that you have}} the time of the seven sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years. You shall then sound a ram's horn abroad on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall sound a horn all through your land. You shall thus consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you (Leviticus 25:1-4, 8-10, NASB).|$|E

6000|$|... "When <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the Temple last night--" [...] said I, {{pausing to}} wonder whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago.|$|R
6000|$|That is not strange: for you know, when <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> this world, {{and became}} a land-baby, you remembered nothing. So why should he, {{when he became a}} water-baby? ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{brothers}} and sisters just laughed. [...] "We don't know about that. It's [...] Christmas to-day, anyway. <b>You</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the library and see." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Will <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> this set, Annaple?' he asked. 'They {{want another}} couple,' and, as she accepted, 'How {{do you get}} on with May's double?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there you}} touch my conscience. I {{was a little}} tactless, I'm afraid, with Ogden. It {{happened}} before <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the room. I suppose that is the trouble?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{dare say}} you will; that's natural enough. I suppose {{you have had}} as little to vex <b>you</b> since <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> this house as any {{creature}} in the world." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "See it afore <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> the shop," [...] said Mr. Kybird, triumphantly. [...] "It 'ud be {{a strange}} thing to marry into that family, Emma." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] said Mendham, who was {{altogether}} at a loss. [...] "We are, of course, {{curious to}} know something of how <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the village in such a peculiar costume." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{returned}} the minister, falling {{back in his}} chair helplessly, not luxuriously. [...] "So well that I knew it was he almost as soon as <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the room to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, maybe," [...] he said, {{speaking}} in the kindly Scots, that was like music in my ear--"now, maybe, you will tell us who you are, and how <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> this jeopardy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the coming}} matinee idol. One {{of the girls}} {{recognized}} {{you as soon as}} <b>you</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> the house, and the name settled it, though, of course, you're supposed to be here incognito." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{wrong on}} one point," [...] Batley objected dryly. [...] "I'm acquainted with your temperament--it's {{not one that}} would lead you into avoidable difficulties.
