5|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's operas {{comprise}} 22 musical dramas in {{a variety}} of genres. They range from the small-scale, derivative works of his <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> the full-fledged operas of his maturity. Three of the works were abandoned before completion and were not performed until many years after the composer's death. His mature works are all considered classics and have never been out of the repertory of the world's opera houses.|$|E
5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1992 album Dirty, which {{was released by}} DGC {{in the wake of}} Nirvana's breakthrough into the mainstream. Dirty became one of the band's most commercially successful albums, selling around 500,000 copies worldwide as of May 1994. The album also reached No. 83 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. After Dirty, Sonic Youth decided to step away from major-label alternative rock acts, which singer and guitarist Thurston Moore thought the media associated the band with. Touring with indie rock bands like Pavement, Sebadoh, and Royal Trux inspired Sonic <b>Youth</b> <b>to</b> write a quieter and more subtle album.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in sexually explicit material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually harms them through the censorship itself.|$|E

A long-term heroin user, Hope had his license to perform in New York's clubs withdrawn after a drug conviction, so he moved to Los Angeles in 1957. He was not happy during his four years on the West Coast, but had some successful collaborations there, including with saxophonist Harold Land.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, the Temenggong {{delegated}} Abu Bakar, then an eighteen-year-old <b>youth,</b> <b>to</b> {{assist him}} in negotiation efforts against Sultan Ali, {{who was making}} frivolous attempts to claim sovereignty rights over Johor. As the Temenggong aged, he gradually delegated his state administrative duties to Abu Bakar. During this period, several British officers praised of Abu Bakar's excellent diplomatic skills, as mentioned in William Napier's diaries, who was the senior law agent of Singapore. Napier had accompanied Abu Bakar to fetch Tengku Teh, {{the mother of the}} deposed Sultan of Lingga, Mahmud Muzaffar Shah to Johor shortly after her son began to exert sovereignty claims over Pahang.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 and 1998, the Bulls met the Utah Jazz in the Finals twice. Led by Olympians John Stockton and Karl Malone, the Jazz were {{defeated}} in both Finals by the Bulls in six games. In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning {{shots in the}} sixth and deciding game — the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and managing their second three-peat. However, prior to the 1999 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted {{in most of the}} team, including Jordan and Pippen, requesting to leave the Bulls. With no foundation of <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> build upon, the Bulls became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.|$|E

5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows the prelude and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of the sacrifices which they made. In this, the work is not displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed the names of all South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-one 15 - to 17 -year-olds {{attempted}} to purchase cigarettes in 232 {{stores in the}} manner that confederates typically do in access studies, {{as well as in}} the manipulative ways (e. g., lying about their ages) that youth smokers do, thereby modeling <b>youth</b> access <b>to</b> tobacco within versus outside of studies, respectively. Youth typical-research versus manipulative behavior was contrasted with clerk behavior (requests for <b>youth</b> ID cards) <b>to</b> examine the relative contributions of both <b>to</b> <b>youth</b> access <b>to</b> tobacco for the 1 st time. Results revealed that clerk behavior was the strongest predictor of cigarette sales <b>to</b> <b>youth</b> and hence underscore the need for interventions with merchants. Sales nonetheless were higher under youth-manipulative conditions and thereby highlight the low ecological validity of access research. Key words: <b>youth</b> access <b>to</b> tobacco, <b>youth</b> lies, ecological validity, primary prevention Smoking among <b>youth</b> (12 - <b>to</b> 17 -year-olds) might be under-stood as a function of supply and demand, where supply refers <b>to</b> <b>youth</b> access <b>to</b> (ability to acquire) cigarettes, and demand refers to the psychosocial variables that predict children’s desire to smok...|$|R
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members {{helped to}} sponsor job training, reading enrichment, {{heritage}} and youth programs. By encouraging <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued {{a legacy of}} community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying for equality concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality {{in the armed forces}} and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the <b>youth</b> <b>to</b> learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
