500|$|The Sandman {{grew out}} of a {{proposal}} by Neil Gaiman to revive DC's 1974–1976 series The Sandman, illustrated by Jack Kirby and Ernie Chua and written by Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher. Gaiman had considered including characters from the [...] "Dream Stream" [...] (including the Kirby Sandman, Brute, Glob, and the brothers Cain and Abel) in a scene for the first issue of his 1988 miniseries Black Orchid. While the scene did not make it into later drafts because Roy Thomas was using the characters in Infinity, Inc., Gaiman soon began constructing a treatment for a new series. Gaiman mentioned his treatment in passing to DC editor Karen Berger. While months later Berger offered Gaiman a comic title to work on, he was unsure his Sandman pitch would be accepted. Weeks later, Berger asked Gaiman if he was interested in doing a Sandman series. Gaiman recalled, [...] "I said, 'Um... <b>yes.</b> <b>Yes,</b> definitely. What's the catch?' [...] 'There's only one. We'd like a new Sandman. Keep the name. But the rest is up to you.'" ...|$|E

Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record she loved it!

The original [...] "Creep" [...] also made its appearance on The Game's [...] "Sex Skit" [...] from his album The Documentary 2.5, released in October 2015. In February 2016, singer Zendaya sampled the song for her single [...] "Something New" [...] with Chris Brown. [...] "Well the song, when I first heard it, already had that TLC sample in it.

2500|$|Dada or Dadaism {{was an art}} {{movement}} of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century. It began in Zurich, Switzerland in 1916, spreading to Berlin shortly thereafter. To quote Dona Budd's The Language of Art Knowledge, Dada {{was born out of}} negative reaction to the horrors of World War I. This international movement was begun by a group of artists and poets associated with the Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. Dada rejected reason and logic, prizing nonsense, irrationality and intuition. The origin of the name Dada is unclear; some believe that it is a nonsensical word. Others maintain that it originates from the Romanian artists Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco's frequent use of the words da, da, meaning <b>yes,</b> <b>yes</b> in the Romanian language. Another theory says that the name [...] "Dada" [...] came during a meeting of the group when a paper knife stuck into a French-German dictionary happened to point to 'dada', a French word for 'hobbyhorse'. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestoes, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti-war politics through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. In addition to being anti-war, Dada was also anti-bourgeois and had political affinities with the radical left.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1919, MacDonald {{joined her}} older sister, actress Blossom Rock, in New York, and {{landed a job}} in the chorus of Ned Wayburn's The Demi-Tasse Revue, a musical {{entertainment}} presented between films at the Capital Theatre on Broadway. [...] In 1920, she appeared in two musicals, Jerome Kern's Night Boat as a chorus replacement, and Irene on the road as the second female lead (future film star Irene Dunne played the title role during part of the tour, and Helen Shipman, actor/singer/dancer, played the title role during {{the other part of the}} tour). [...] Shipman once remarked that MacDonald did not have the legs for a top-notch chorus girl. In 1921, MacDonald played in Tangerine, as one of the [...] "Six Wives." [...] In 1922, she was a featured singer in a Greenwich Village revue, Fantastic Fricassee. Good press notices brought her a role in The Magic Ring (1923). MacDonald played the second female lead in this long-running musical which starred Mitzi Hajos. In 1925, MacDonald again had the second female lead opposite Queenie Smith in Tip Toes, a George Gershwin hit show. The following year found her still in a second female lead in Bubblin' Over (1926), a musical version of Brewster's Millions. MacDonald finally landed the starring role in <b>Yes,</b> <b>Yes,</b> Yvette (1927). Planned as a sequel to producer H.H. Frazee's No, No, Nanette, the show toured extensively, but failed to please the critics when it arrived on Broadway. MacDonald also played the lead in her next two plays: Sunny Days (1928), her first show for producers Lee and J.J. Shubert, for which she received rave reviews, and Angela (1928), which the critics panned. Her last play was Boom Boom (1929), with her name above the title (the cast included young Archie Leach, who later changed his name to Cary Grant).|$|E
2500|$|Lennon, being {{mindful of}} Elvis Presley's [...] "All Shook Up", wanted {{something}} equally as stirring: [...] "I don't {{know where the}} 'yeah yeah yeah' came from [...] I remember when Elvis did 'All Shook Up' {{it was the first}} time in my life that I had heard 'uh huh', 'oh yeah', and 'yeah yeah' all sung in the same song". The song also included a number of falsetto [...] "wooooo"'s, which Lennon acknowledged as being inspired by the Isley Brothers' recording of [...] "Twist and Shout", which the Beatles had earlier recorded, and which had also been inserted into the group's previous single, [...] "From Me to You". As Lennon later said: [...] "We stuck it in everything". McCartney recalls them playing the finished song on acoustic guitars to his father Jim at home immediately after the song was completed: [...] "We went into the living room and said 'Dad, listen to this. What do you think? And he said 'That's very nice son, but there's enough of these Americanisms around. Couldn't you sing 'She loves you, <b>yes,</b> <b>yes,</b> yes!'. At which point we collapsed in a heap and said 'No, Dad, you don't quite get it!'". EMI recording engineer Norman Smith had a somewhat similar reaction, later recounting, [...] "I was setting up the microphone when I first saw the lyrics on the music stand, 'She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah!' I thought, Oh my God, what a lyric! This is going to be one that I do not like. But when they started to sing it—bang, wow, terrific, I was up at the mixer jogging around." ...|$|E
