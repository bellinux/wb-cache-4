25|$|Former LDP {{minister}} Yoshimi Watanabe {{announced the}} foundation of a new party, <b>Your</b> <b>Party,</b> on August 8, 2009.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Watanabe {{announced}} that <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> would {{join forces with}} Osaka governor Toru Hashimoto's political group Osaka Ishin-no-kai, and praised Hashimoto's economic reform efforts in Osaka. He {{announced that}} <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> would sever ties with Hashimoto's Japan Restoration Party in May 2013 after Hashimoto made controversial comments regarding comfort women being {{a necessary part of}} World War II and suggesting that American servicemen use the Japanese sex industry to keep their urges under control.|$|E
25|$|Working with {{barbed wire}} was a nasty job under any circumstances, {{but when you}} were {{handling}} it {{in the dark and}} within a hundred yards of rifles and machine guns that would shoot at the least sound, you were doing one of the most nerve-wracking bits of work that could possibly be imagined...the slightest move might mean death for half <b>your</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "You sha'n't go to havin' <b>your</b> <b>parties,</b> Grace. I {{always have}} to eat bits and ends a {{fortnight}} after you have one, and I won't have it so." [...] And so Uncle Lot walked out, and Aunt Sally and Miss Grace proceeded to make the cake and pies for the party.|$|R
25|$|Only {{four days}} after the Sunrise Party was launched, on November 17, 2012 Ishihara and Tōru Hashimoto, leader of the Japan Restoration Party (JRP), decided to merge their parties, with Ishihara {{becoming}} the head of the JRP. <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> would not join the party, nor would Genzei Nippon, as the latter party's anti-consumption tax increase policy did not match the JRP's pro-consumption tax policy.|$|E
25|$|Watanabe formed <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> as a {{splinter}} {{from the}} Liberal Democratic Party {{prior to the}} 2009 general election. His party ran {{on a platform of}} downsizing Japan's vast bureaucracy, but managed to win only five seats in the election, which was a resounding victory for the opposition Democratic Party of Japan. The party pushed forward into 2010 with a platform of deregulation and halving the corporate tax rate. His new party became popular among private investors and upper middle-class professionals.|$|E
25|$|At the July 2010 House of Councillors election, the DPJ lost ten {{seats and}} their {{coalition}} majority. Prior {{to the election}} Kan {{raised the issue of}} an increase to Japan's 5 per cent consumption tax in order to address the country's rising debt. This proposal, together with Ozawa and Hatoyama's scandals, was viewed as one of the causes for the party's poor performance in the election. The divided house meant the government required the cooperation of smaller parties including <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> and the Communist Party to ensure the passage of legislation through the upper house.|$|E

25|$|Kan's {{approval}} ratings {{fell in the}} month of June after he proposed an increase in the sales tax rate from 5% to 10%. His sales tax increase proposal was opposed by Ichirō Ozawa, amongst others in the DPJ, and the proposal was quickly scaled back by Kan. The botched sales tax increase proposal was partially blamed for the DPJ's disappointing results in the July House of Councillors election, where the DPJ lost its majority and was forced to work with smaller, unaffiliated parties (such as <b>Your</b> <b>Party,</b> the JCP, and the SDP) in order to secure passage of bills in the House of Councillors.|$|E
25|$|In April 2014, Watanabe {{was found}} to have {{accepted}} a loan of 800 million yen from the chairman of a cosmetics company without disclosing it as a political donation. While insisting that the loan was used for personal purposes and not for political activities, he resigned as president of <b>Your</b> <b>Party.</b> The party commissioned an investigation by an outside attorney and CPA, who found that Watanabe had paid interest on the loan and had mainly used the funds for paying credit card bills for himself and his wife. While they found no violation of campaign finance laws, they discovered that Watanabe had also borrowed money from five other parties totaling 615 million yen.|$|E
500|$|In June 2016, McGregor {{supported}} Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn after mass resignations {{from his}} cabinet and a leadership challenge. McGregor tweeted, [...] "Good for you! The turncoats in <b>your</b> <b>party</b> {{should be ashamed}} of themselves. I hope you find the support you deserve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that {{is quite}} possible," [...] Reuben agreed. [...] "Will you please be careful that neither of <b>your</b> <b>parties</b> get more than two miles, at the outside, away from mine? We can {{hear the sound of}} rifles, at that distance. If either party fires, the others will of course hurry to their assistance. Now, let us move forward." ...|$|R

The Metro was described in 2006 as having a [...] "classy, intimate VIP lounge in Gods Bar along with the funky Fish Bowl on the mezzanine level providing electrifying views of the Main Room below, all available for <b>your</b> <b>partying</b> pleasure." ...|$|R
500|$|Todd {{found the}} pack's {{difficulty}} to be [...] "wildly careening" [...] and stated, [...] "Some battles are amazingly easy. You can soar through many scraps in moments, with <b>your</b> <b>party</b> carving up the opposition {{before you can}} tell if you're fighting a mummy or a zombie. However, others are absolutely brutal ... There {{are more than a}} couple of moments in the game in which <b>your</b> <b>party</b> is ambushed by enemy spellcasters that rip you to pieces before you can even think about a proper response." [...] He praised the game's music as blending in seamlessly with that of the original game, but criticized it for having a minimal amount of voice acting, with sequences of dialogue that begin with audio and transition into text. Steve Butts commented on this, saying, [...] "the dialogue here really needs some work ... you'll even be treated to some truly tortured sentences. 'Wait till you see how deep into the backside of evil I insert my boot in the name of justice!' is probably my favorite. It's too bad there's not more voice acting in the game, because hearing someone speak lines like that out loud may have given the developers an opportunity to edit some of the worst offenders." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{said that}} the expansion's single-player game was more {{difficult}} than that of Neverwinter Nights 2; 1UP.com stated that Obsidian [...] " [...] the ante with tougher enemies and a more challenging experience altogether". The expansion also has more puzzles which make the player think, rather than somehow being resolvable through combat, with one reviewer noting that the expansion has [...] "genuinely tough logic puzzles (some frustratingly short on clues) {{and a series of}} side quests that completely vary (some might not even open up) depending on <b>your</b> <b>party</b> makeup". Multiple reviewers mentioned that the expansion is more serious than Neverwinter Nights 2.|$|E
500|$|The battle {{system of}} Final Fantasy XIII {{received}} widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as [...] "thrilling"; Edges {{description of the}} battle system summarized it as [...] "among the genre's finest". 1UP.com said that [...] "Despite the fact that two-thirds of <b>your</b> <b>party</b> is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles {{may be the most}} involving the series has ever seen." [...] The story got a mixed reception, with Wired remarking that the plot was [...] "a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games". 1UP.com felt that the story was [...] "hardly world-class writing", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichés. Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together, and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.|$|E

500|$|In late 1997, Bruce took Myzery to St.Andrew's Hall. Eminem, then {{an unknown}} local emcee, {{approached}} Bruce and, according to Bruce, {{handed him a}} flyer advertising the release party for the Slim Shady EP. The flyer read, [...] "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)". Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Bruce said that Eminem explained, [...] "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?" [...] Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, [...] "Fuck no, I ain't coming to <b>your</b> <b>party.</b> We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this." [...] Bruce reported that Eminem attacked the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler first responded by referring to Eminem's alter ego as [...] "Slim Anus" [...] on [...] "85 Bucks An Hour" [...] from Twiztid's 1997 debut, Mostasteless, and later in 1999 releasing a parody of Eminem's [...] "My Name Is" [...] entitled [...] "Slim Anus". Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued until the feud was ended in 2005 by hip hop group D12 and Psychopathic Records.|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers {{considered}} Neverwinter Nights 2 {{superior to}} its predecessor, Neverwinter Nights, the sequel received lower overall review ratings. Implementation of the Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 ruleset was praised as faithful to the pen-and-paper version, with GameDaily stating [...] "The 3.5 edition ruleset {{is in full swing}} in Neverwinter Nights 2, where critical hits can devastate your entire party." [...] The game's representation of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting was also well received. The storyline was widely considered one of the game's strong points and an improvement over Neverwinter Nights. GameSpy stated that the single–player campaign was [...] "worthy of its exhaustive pedigree", and Game Informers reviewer said [...] "This title easily trumps the original NWN’s campaign with a vastly superior story and characters". Another reviewer declared it [...] "one of the best written games in history". [...] Aaron R. Conklin of The Wisconsin State Journal said, [...] "It'd be very easy to be turned off by the first mundane chapters of the game's sprawling plot.... Stick with it: Once <b>your</b> <b>party</b> hits Neverwinter (and reaches level seven or so), the proceedings become significantly more interesting—especially in terms of character interaction and development.... NWN2 is a masterpiece of storytelling and scope." [...] Conklin and Matt Slagle of Deseret News were pleased with the ethical choices in the game, with both noting approvingly that diplomacy was a very valid option that could succeed in place of combat.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, Masuzoe {{left the}} LDP {{and formed a}} {{splinter}} group called New Renaissance Party (Shintō Kaikaku). The party's platform included a call for decentralization, deregulation, and a halving {{of the number of}} Diet members. At the time, The Economists Banyan column dubbed Masuzoe [...] "Japan's most popular politician." [...] Both the NRP and <b>Your</b> <b>Party,</b> led by ex-LDP lawmaker Yoshimi Watanabe, were viewed at the time as potentially effective center-right counterweights to the Democratic Party of Japan, and possibly even successors to the LDP itself. Masuzoe's party nonetheless gained minimal traction. Four of its initial six Upper House members were voted out in the July 2010 election, leaving the party with only Masuzoe and Hiroyuki Arai representing it in the Upper House; the NRP was ultimately overshadowed by <b>Your</b> <b>Party</b> as a reformist element.|$|E
