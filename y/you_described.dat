5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it is unclear how comparable the two studies are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, <b>You</b> <b>described</b> Magnirostris in 2003, but to date has not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} in Sellers's {{flailing}} career came in 1974, when he teamed up with Blake Edwards to make The Return of the Pink Panther, starring alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of £3 million and earned $33 million {{at the box office}} upon release in May 1975, reinvigorating Sellers's career as an A-list film star and restoring his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor– Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, he followed it with The Pink Panther Strikes Again. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had seriously deteriorated. Edwards says of the actor's mental state at the time of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, [...] "If you went to an asylum and <b>you</b> <b>described</b> the first inmate you saw, that's what Peter had become. He was certifiable." [...] With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. Peter Evans mentioned that Sellers was a [...] "volatile and perplexing character [...] left a trail of misery in his private life". He also noted that Sellers had a [...] "compulsive personality and [...] an eccentric hypochondriac" [...] who became addicted to various medicines aside from his recreational drug habits during this period. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry {{at a time when he}} most needed the work. Despite Sellers's deep personal problems, The Pink Panther Strikes Again was well received critically. Vincent Canby of The New York Times said of Sellers in the film, [...] "There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers' Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium." [...] Sellers's performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

2500|$|In the 190s, the warlord Yuan Shu {{controlled}} the lands around the Huai River in Yang Province. He {{had heard of}} Zhang Cheng's elder brother, Zhang Fan, and wanted to recruit him as an adviser. However, Zhang Fan claimed that he was ill and sent Zhang Cheng to meet Yuan Shu instead. Yuan Shu asked Zhang Cheng, [...] "In the past, when the kings of the Zhou dynasty were weak, warlords such as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin rose up and became the dominant powers; when the Qin dynasty was collapsing, the Han dynasty rose up and replaced it. Now, as I rule over many territories and its people, I hope to enjoy the same glory as Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin did, and {{follow in the footsteps}} of Emperor Gaozu of Han. What do you think?" [...] Zhang Cheng replied, [...] "It depends on virtue rather than power. If a man can embody everyone's hopes for a benevolent and virtuous ruler, even if he has nothing to his name, it won't be hard for him to achieve what <b>you</b> <b>described.</b> However, if a man doesn't know his place and decides to do something against the people's will, everyone will abandon him instead of helping him." [...] Yuan Shu was displeased by what Zhang Cheng said.|$|E
