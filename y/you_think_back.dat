500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E

5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film a mixed 2 stars {{out of a}} {{possible}} 4. He wrote: [...] "A few loopholes I can forgive. But when a plot is riddled with them, crippled by them, made implausible by them, as in Along Came a Spider, I get distracted. I'm wondering, since Dr. Alex Cross is so brilliant, how come he doesn't notice yawning logical holes in the very fabric of the story he's occupying? ... The film contains two kinds of loopholes: (1) Those that emerge when <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> on the plot, and (2) Those that seem like loopholes at the time, and then are explained by later developments that may contain loopholes of their own ... There are places in this movie you just can't get to from other places in this movie." [...] Nonetheless, Ebert thought that Freeman's performance made Cross an intriguing character, even when the plot was verging on the nonsensical.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a pitcher}} who missed {{considerable}} playing time due to injury, Carpenter won three major Comeback Player of the Year awards {{in two separate}} seasons. Steve Adams of MLB Trade Rumors wrote that [...] "injuries to Carpenter shortened {{what could have been}} one of the most impressive careers of a generation, but few were better than Carpenter when he was healthy.

[...] Said Mozeliak, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>back</b> to everything this organization has been through in regard to his ups and downs, he will still go down as one of the greatest we’ve ever had. … We think back to his career and what an amazing one it was.

David Drake of Complex remarked: [...] "Calling a song with a Houston rapper 'Swangin' is perhaps the least imaginative possible concept for a record.

5000|$|In 2016, manager Antonio Conte praised Lippi for his {{coaching}} skills and tactical prowess, {{as well as}} his ability to communicate with and motivate his players to foster a competitive team spirit and a winning mentality; he also went on to describe his experiences as a player under Lippi with Juventus stating: [...] "I remember when Marcello Lippi arrived from Napoli with great ambition and determination. He was very important, as he was able to transmit to us precisely what he wanted. We hit rock bottom with defeat to Foggia, so Lippi said if we have to lose, we’ll go down fighting. From then on we attacked, pressed high and took the game to the opposition. Lippi was excellent at motivating the squad and passing on his ideas. I {{think the most important thing}} for a Coach is to have a clear vision and transmit that clearly to his players. Lippi always had that, as well as a great ability to motivate us, even when we played every three days. That Juventus had four consecutive European Finals and if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>back,</b> that was an exceptional achievement." ...|$|E

Elissa Blount-Moorhead began her partnership with cinematographers Arthur Jafa ("Daughters of the Dust," [...] "Crooklyn," [...] "Dreams Are Colder Than Death," [...] "Florida Water") and Malik Sayeed ("He Got Game," [...] "Belly") in 2013, establishing the film studio TNEG. Their goal is to develop and produce new black independent films, but films that will also “push what we understand to be new black cinema and to create not just new narratives, but also new aesthetics and technical parameters within black cinema." [...] She says, [...] "I feel like independent film in general is becoming more well-regarded and more supported. If <b>you</b> just <b>think</b> <b>back</b> 20 years there was no IFC, or things like that. There are more alternative platforms now, like Netflix, that are now commissioning and financing work that will go directly through their channels—those are the ways {{you are able to}} provide an outlet for people and to hopefully allow filmmakers to create a voice that is not contingent on mainstream and Hollywood expectations." ...|$|R

The style of the production and arrangement were compared to songs by Gloria Gaynor, according to Robert Copsey from Digital Spy. Lyrically, the song's theme and content was described as [...] "Scherzinger staving off an ex’s advances" [...] and {{making it clear that}} the relationship is officially over. As well as incorporating elements of club music, her tone is scornful on lines such as [...] "You can’t touch me now, there’s no feeling left/ If <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I’m comin’ <b>back,</b> don’t hold your breath/ What you did to me, boy I can’t forget".|$|R
