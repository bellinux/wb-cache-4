2500|$|Vagrant {{elephant}} seals possibly {{appear on}} tropical regions {{such as at}} Mariana Islands. [...] Historical occurrences of elephant seal presence, residential or occasional, in western North Pacific are fairly unknown. There have been two records of vagrants visiting to Japanese coasts; a male on Niijima in 1989 (reference introducing a visit by a North Pacific right whale in 2011), and a <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> on beaches in Hasama, Tateyama in 2001 (where another right whale was seen in 2000). A 2.5 meter female was found on Sanze beach, Tsuruoka, Yamagata in October 2017, making it the first record from Sea of Japan. This individual was severely weaken but showing signs of recovery after receiving medications at Kamo Aquarium, and the aquarium is discussing {{whether or not to}} release her.|$|E
2500|$|The kayak (qayaq sg qayak dual qayat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qayar ~ [...] qay'ar sg qay'ag dual qay'at ~ [...] qass'it pl in Cup'ig; from qai- [...] "surface; top")) {{is small}} narrow closed skin-covered boat and {{was first used}} by the native {{speakers}} of the Eskimo–Aleut languages. The Yup'ik used kayaks for seal hunting, fishing, and general transportation. The Yup'ik people considered a kayak the owner's most prized possession. Traditionally, a kayak was a Yup'ik hunter’s most prized possession and a symbol of manhood. It is fast and maneuverable, seaworthy, light, and strong. Kayak is made of driftwood from the beach, covered with {{the skin of a}} sea mammal, and sewn with sinew from another animal. Yup'ik kayaks are known from the earliest ethnographic reports, but there are currently no surviving full-size Yup'ik kayaks from the pre-contact period. The Yup'ik Norton Sound/Hooper Bay kayaks consisted of 5-6 <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> skins stretched for the covering. The Yup'ik style of seams contains a running stitch partially piercing the skin on top and an overlapping stitch on the inside with a grass insert. Caninermiut style Yup'ik kayak used in the Kwigillingok and Kipnuk regions and there are teeth marks in the wood of the circular hatch opening, made by the builders as they bent and curved the driftwood into shape.|$|E

5000|$|Holluschickie Bay (...) is a bay on {{the west}} coast of James Ross Island, Antarctica, entered between Matkah Point and Kotick Point. It was {{probably}} first seen by Otto Nordenskiöld in 1903. The bay was surveyed by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) in 1945; the name arose during a subsequent visit by a FIDS party in 1952, when a large number of <b>young</b> <b>seals</b> was observed near the mouth of the bay, after the word used for the <b>young</b> <b>seals</b> in Rudyard Kipling's story The White Seal in The Jungle Book.|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile, Dr Hayward and {{his party}} had been {{successful}} in their exploration, for they not only discovered a rabbit-warren, but had observed seals basking on the rocks, and found the tracks of goats, or some animal of that kind with divided hoofs. They had even succeeded in getting between a <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> and the water and speared it, {{so that there was}} something like jubilation in the camp on their return at the prospect of a fresh meal and better fare in future.|$|E
50|$|The {{indigenous}} Inuit people {{argue that}} banning seal products is detrimental to {{their way of}} life.

2500|$|<b>Young</b> crabeater <b>seals</b> {{experience}} significant predation by leopard seals. Indeed, first-year {{mortality is}} exceedingly high, possibly reaching 80%, {{and up to}} 78% of crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from leopard seal attacks. Long scars and sets of parallel scars, visible on the otherwise pale and relatively unmarked pelage of crabeaters, are present on nearly all <b>young</b> <b>seals.</b> The incidence of visible scars falls off significantly after the first year, suggesting leopard seals primarily target the young of the year. [...] The high predation pressure has clear impacts on the demography and life history of crabeater seals, and has likely had {{an important role in}} shaping social behaviors, including aggregation of subadults.|$|R
60|$|One tempestuous night, an old hag who {{had long}} done {{business}} as a hermitess on Helmet Rock came into the bar-room at the Cliff House, and there, amidst the crushing thunders and lightnings spilling all over the horizon, she related {{that she had seen}} a <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> in a comfortable overcoat, sitting pensively upon the pinnacle of Seal Rock, and had distinctly heard the familiar words of a Methodist hymn. Upon inquiry the tale was discovered to be founded upon fact. The identity of this seal could no longer be denied without downright blasphemy, and in all the old chronicles of that period not a doubt is even implied.|$|E
6000|$|... "As I had hoped, {{the thing}} floated light. I pushed it before me as I swam, {{and found that}} by putting my hands on it it would keep me up well when I wanted to rest. However, I did not want much of that. The water was too cold to be idle in, and I never stopped {{swimming}} until I got to shore at the point I had marked out as easiest to land on. I wasn't long opening the bag and getting into my things, which were perfectly dry. My first thought was of food. While I had been swimming I thought I heard a sort of barking noise, and I wasn't long in seeing {{that there were a}} lot of seals on the rocks. I picked up a goodish chunk of stone, and then lay down and set to crawling towards them. I had heard from sailors who had been whaling that the way to kill a seal was to hit him on the nose, and I kept this in my mind as I crawled up. They did not seem to notice me, and I got close among them without their moving. Then I jumped up. There was a <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> lying not ten feet from me, and before he had time to turn I smashed down my bit of rock between his eyes, and there he lay dead.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the winter}} Kadlu {{would follow the}} seal {{to the edge of}} this land-ice, and spear them as they came up to breathe at their blow-holes. The seal must have open water to live and catch fish in, and in the deep of winter the ice would {{sometimes}} run eighty miles without a break from the nearest shore. In the spring he and his people retreated from the floes to the rocky mainland, where they put up tents of skins, and snared the sea-birds, or speared the <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> basking on the beaches. Later, they would go south into Baffin Land after the reindeer, and to get their year's store of salmon from the hundreds of streams and lakes of the interior; coming back north in September or October for the musk-ox hunting and the regular winter sealery. This travelling was done with dog-sleighs, twenty and thirty miles a day, or sometimes down the coast in big skin [...] "woman-boats," [...] when the dogs and the babies lay among the feet of the rowers, and the women sang songs as they glided from cape to cape over the glassy, cold waters. All the luxuries that the Tununirmiut knew came from the south--driftwood for sleigh-runners, rod-iron for harpoon-tips, steel knives, tin kettles that cooked food much better than the old soap-stone affairs, flint and steel, and even matches, as well as coloured ribbons for the women's hair, little cheap mirrors, and red cloth for the edging of deerskin dress-jackets. Kadlu traded the rich, creamy, twisted narwhal horn and musk-ox teeth (these are just as valuable as pearls) to the Southern Inuit, and they, in turn, traded with the whalers and the missionary-posts of Exeter and Cumberland Sounds; and so the chain went on, till a kettle picked up by a ship's cook in the Bhendy Bazaar might end its days over a blubber-lamp somewhere on the cool side of the Arctic Circle.|$|E

5000|$|Vagrant {{elephant}} seals possibly {{appear on}} tropical regions {{such as at}} Mariana Islands. [...] Historical occurrences of elephant seal presence, residential or occasional, in western North Pacific are fairly unknown. There have been two records of vagrants visiting to Japanese coasts; a male on Niijima in 1989 (reference introducing a visit by a North Pacific right whale in 2011), and a <b>young</b> <b>seal</b> on beaches in Hasama, Tateyama in 2001 (where another right whale was seen in 2000).Some individuals have been observed {{on the coast of}} northeast Asia.

40|$|In highly {{dynamic and}} {{unpredictable}} environments {{such as the}} Southern Ocean, species that have evolved behaviors that reduce the effects of intra-specific competition may have a selective advantage. This is particularly true when juveniles face disadvantages when foraging due to morphological or physiological limitation, which {{is the case for}} many marine mammals. We tracked the at-sea movements of 48 juvenile southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) between the ages of 1 and 4 years from the population at Macquarie Island using locations derived from recorded light levels. There were significant differences in the total amount of the Southern Ocean covered by the different age-groups. The <b>younger</b> <b>seals</b> used a smaller area than the older seals. On average, the younger individuals also made more trips to sea than the older seals and did not travel as far on each trip. Females spent more time at sea than males and {{there were no significant differences}} between the total areas used by male and females. In summary, <b>younger</b> <b>seals</b> remained closer to the island at all times, and they spent more time in more northerly regions that older seals. These differences in behavior created temporal and spatial segregation between juveniles of different ages. Therefore, we suggest that these temporal and spatial separations help to avoid intra-specific competition for resources on land, space on beaches, and at-sea foraging areas. Such modifications of haul-out timing and behavior enable them to exploit a patchy and unpredictable environment. 9 page(s...|$|R
