50|$|There {{are more}} subtle ways of {{initiating}} the reciprocity rule than merely doing something nice for someone {{so you may}} expect something in return. One form of this more subtle form of reciprocity {{is the idea of}} reciprocal concessions in which the requester lowers his/her initial request, making the respondent more likely to agree to a second request. Under the rule of reciprocity, we are obligated to concede to someone who has made a concession to us. That is, if an individual starts off by requesting something large and you refuse, you feel obligated to consent to their smaller request even though <b>you</b> <b>might</b> not <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in either of the things they are offering. Robert Cialdini illustrates an example of this phenomenon by telling a story of a boy who asks him to buy five-dollar circus tickets and, when Cialdini refuses, asks him to buy some one dollar chocolate bars. Cialdini feels obligated to return the favor and consents to buying some of the chocolate bars.|$|R

Workbook orkbook Basics If you’re new to Excel, you’ll benefit most from a quick tour of Excel, including how you start Excel, work with its windows, and create and save a workbook. That’s what we’ll do here. NOTE This discussion assumes you’re comfortable working with Microsoft Windows. You should know, for example, how to start and stop programs, choose commands, and work with dialog boxes. 7 Starting Excel You can start Excel either by starting the program directly or by opening an existing Excel workbook. To start Excel directly, click the Start button, choose Programs, and then choose Microsoft Excel. When you do this, Excel starts and opens a blank workbook. To open an Excel workbook—which indirectly starts Excel—you can double-click an Excel workbook file (which has an icon with a green x and, if you’re viewing file extensions, has the extension. XLS) in the My Computer or Windows Explorer window. If you’ve recently used the file, you can also open it from the Documents menu by clicking the Start button, choosing Documents, and choosing the Excel file you want to open. When you do this, Excel starts and opens the workbook you selected.

Well, we’re still hop[ping], skip[ping] and jumping around with the {{expectations}} of meeting up with the outfit shortly. The days are passing uneventfully particularly since I have received no letters from you yet. The last one I received was dated Oct. 2. Don’t you worry your pretty little head since I expect to get loads and loads of mail when I do get mail. I know the temptation will be hard but I’m going to sort the mail chronologically and read the oldest mail first. I had my first hot water shower since I’ve been in France. It was one of the portable shower units that the engineers set up and operated better than anticipated. You are allowed 7 minutes under the shower, a whistle blows, and then you’ve got to scram. It was a real treat! My laundry, done by yours truly, has not been too bad since I don’t wait for clothes to accumulate, but wash often. Some of the men have had the French natives do their clothing but I don’t like the way they dip the clothes in a stagnant pool and beat the clothes with paddles. This process seems to get the clothes clean somehow. The food continues to be good [...] so far so good. I got some French bread (looks like Swedish rye) from a store and it tasted excellent as well as being a change from the regular Army bread. The military are not permitted to purchase things from French stores since it cuts down on civilian purchases 2 ̆ 6 bread is rationed, however, I spoke to the woman (in French) and she gave me two large ends of the bread. Their breads are 2 feet long [...] really monstrous breads compared to ours. One observation I’ve noticed between the English and the French. In England the people’s [sic] faces reflect the hardships that they have gone through. They are pale, few of them with smiles. The French, on the other hand, despite the destruction 2 ̆ 6 ruin of their villages, still smile, wave their arms in salutation and use lipstick 2 ̆ 6 rouge generously. These people are very much concerned with their personal appearance and I think they deserve a lot of credit. It seems that I’m starting to bump into a lot of old acquaintances.

40|$|What's New V 3. 72 and V 3. 71 fix a few bugs. V 3. 70 adds {{numerous}} major {{features to}} A 86. Let's cover the INCOMPATIBILITIES first, {{so you will}} know where to tweak your existing code: * Error messages in A 86 now have a slightly different format (on their own line with a pointer to the error location). If you have any source code lying around with old-format error messages, {{get rid of the}} messages before reassembling with this new version [...] this version cannot handle them. * I have changed the L switch to the G (code Generation) switch to prepare for L becoming a Listing-control switch. I have also changed the X switch to +G 16, to prepare for X becoming the XRF control switch. If you have any batch files or A 86 environment-flag settings with +L or +X in them, change them to +G for this new version. * The DATA SEGMENT now has a default ORG value of END; that is, it starts {{at the end of your}} program, unless you have an ORG otherwise. V 3. 20 [...] V 3. 22 of A 86 outlawed ORGless DATA segments, in anticipation of this feature. Versions before that had a default ORG of 0 [...] if you have source code written for a pre-V 3. 20 version of A 86, make sure you put ORG 0 at the start of the first DATA SEGMENT if it was ORG-less. Other new features include an INCLUDE directive (Chapter 9), a listing facility (Chapters 3 and 13), END operand value (Chapter 9), pulling XREF and EXMAC functions into the assembler (Chapter 13), operand to EVEN (Chapter 9), the removal of the limit on the length of a source file, the removal of most restrictions on forward-references within expressions, the ability to ORG in the DATA segment and structures to a forward-reference value, the REF and DEF operators (Chapter 9), the K numeric base (Chapter 10), numeric operands to STOSx and MOVSx (Chapter 5), and macros in an A 86 LIB library (Chapter 13). How to Get Everything The packages consist of many files, packed tightly into a few files with the ZIP extension. I have provided the batch files INSTALLA. BAT and INSTALLB. BAT, that create a subdirectory called A 86 on your C drive, and unpack everything except AFIX to that subdirectory. You can just type either A:INSTALLA or B:INSTALLB (depending on whether the diskette is in drive A or B) to the DOS prompt. AFIX is a conversion toolkit for certain old PC-Magazine source files. The command A:PCUNZIP A:AFIX*. ZIP will unpack AFIX from diskette drive A to the current drive and directory.  CD Content with book # E 8434 - E 8443. This diskette contains new releases for the A 86 assembler and D 86 debugger. Everything except the files REG_ONLY. ZIP and A 386 BETA. ZIP (if you have them) can be copied and distributed. Please upload the other ZIP files to bulletin boards, and give them to user groups, computer departments in schools, and anyone else <b>you</b> think <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in an assembler or a debugger package for the IBM-PC. REG_ONLY. ZIP is the file containing materials available only to registered users. A 386 BETA. ZIP is a file, available only on the A 86 +D 86 registered disk, containing preliminary test versions of A 386 and D 386. If you see one or both of these files on your registered disk, they are for your use only. You may NOT distribute them. Please support my products by honoring this restriction. You need to read the manuals to use these programs [...] they're just too complex to be self-explanatory. Chapter 2 of each manual takes you through a trial demonstration...|$|R
40|$|Between 2007 and 2012, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} of KU Leuven and Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium) worked on the project SPATIALIST: Spatial Data Infrastructures and Public Sector Innovation in Flanders. This project aimed to look at SDI-development from an interdisciplinary perspective considering the disciplines of geomatics, law, economics, sociology, and public administration. The main objective of this four-year project was to determine the technological, legal, economic, organisational and public administrative requirements for the further development of the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) in Flanders. This project was funded by the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders. In order to guarantee a comprehensive research about the SDI-development in Flanders, input from many disciplines, i. e. interdisciplinary research was needed. However, it appeared to be difficult for various reasons. One reason was the difficulty to determine what it is that distinguishes one discipline from another. Most important are the concepts (and the associated terminologies) that the discipline uses. To appreciate this point, we could suggest implementing the following experiment. Ask a few leading economists to write down the 10 most important concepts in economics. Then ask a few leading sociologists, lawyers, public administrative scientists, and geo-information scientists to do the same thing. It is very likely that there is almost no overlap in the lists of concepts. The concepts that you think are important do not appear on their lists, and vice-versa. This discordance makes true interdisciplinary research (a blending and fusion of concepts) unlikely. Another reason referred to the disciplinary questions for seeking to answer. Again, ask representatives from the different disciplines “What are the most important, the most central, and the most enduring questions in your domain?” and wide differences in the answers will be apparent across the disciplines. There may be a little more overlap of questions than concepts, but basically the different disciplines have different interests. One can imagine that disciplines are like maps; different maps answer different questions. Suppose you are planning a trip to Ethiopia. You would almost surely want a map that shows the roads and highways, cities and towns, the locations of airports, and so on. But <b>you</b> <b>might</b> also <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in hiking, so you would also want another map — a topographical map which shows altitudes, the location of lakes, and rivers. It is also possible that you would want to consult a meteorological map to learn about expected temperatures and precipitation, and one can imagine still other maps (e. g., one showing places of historical and cultural <b>interest).</b> One map <b>is</b> no “better” than another; they simply serve different purposes. The same is true of disciplines. They attempt to answer different questions, all of which may be relevant. In addition to differences in concepts and questions, the disciplines also differ in their methods. Interdisciplinary research thus far has largely taken the form of borrowing methods. One professor in public administration might tell his students, “We have some good questions, {{but if you want to}} learn how to answer them, go take the econometrics sequence. ” Many sociologists have begun to import econometric methods. Some economists have made considerable investments in survey research and others have been conducting controlled experiments. The exchange of methods is no doubt useful, but so long as the disciplines employ distinct concepts and address different questions, true interdisciplinary research will remain elusive. At the end, most of the SPATIALIST research was multi-disciplinary in nature. This approach provided also some understanding and contributed to better decisions than would be possible through reliance on a single discipline. The paper overviews the main challenges of the SPATIALIST project from an inter/multidisciplinary perspective as well as the pitfalls that were anticipated along the way. These outcomes <b>might</b> <b>be</b> helpful for future inter/multidisciplinary research in the domain of Spatial Data Infrastructures. status: publishe...|$|R
