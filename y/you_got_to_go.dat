I mean it was jolly good of you--Dash it all," [...] he broke off hotly, as if the putting his position into words had suddenly showed him how inglorious it was, [...] "what {{did you want to}} do if for?

They would stick in your mind and rankle, because, you see, they might be proofs that I didn't really love you. And then when I seemed happy with you, you would wonder if I was acting. I know all this sounds morbid and exaggerated, but it isn't. What have <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on, as regards me? What do you really know of me? If {{something}} like this had happened after we had been married half a dozen years and really knew each other, we could laugh at it. But we are strangers. We came together and loved each other because there was something in each of us which attracted the other. We took that little something as a foundation and built on it. But what has happened has knocked away our poor little foundation. That's all. We don't really know anything at all about each other for certain. It's just guesswork.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hain't but oncet. Oncet {{is enough}} for me. I run away, while I was in Venice, and went ashore--if {{you can call it}} ashore; it's all water, and <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> round in boats: gondolas they call 'em there--and went to see the American counsul, and told him I was an American boy, and {{tried to get him to}} get me off. But he couldn't do anything. If you ship under the Swedish flag you're a Swede, and the whole United States couldn't get you off. If I'd 'a' shipped under the American flag I'd 'a' been an American, I don't care if I was born in Hottentot. That's what the counsul said. I never want to see that town ag'in. I used to hear songs about Venice--'Beautiful Venice, Bride of the Sea;' but I think it's a kind of a hole of a place. Well, what I started to say was that when I turn up in Boston, now,--and I most {{generally}} do,--I don't go to no sailor boardin'-house; I break for the Wayfarer's Lodge, every time.

5000|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} to be as inoffensive as possible to prove the point that not all video games were corrupting influences. Penn Jillette commented in his radio show that the overly realistic nature of the game was in response to Janet Renos comments in support of the moral panic about violent video games at the time (see Video game controversies). He also stated that {{there would have been a}} prize for the person or group to get the highest score in the game, also substantiated by the various Desert Bus contest materials prepared for the release of the game. Penn said that the prize [...] "was going to be, <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on Desert Bus from Tucson to Vegas with showgirls and a live band and just the most partying bus ever. You got to Vegas, were going to put you up at the Rio, big thing, and then, you know, big shows." [...] Some have played the game using a tool-assisted emulator, managing to obtain 99 points, the maximum the game allows. A run of this length would have taken 33 days to complete in real time.|$|E

Do {{you really}} want every time they pass the basket in your church, and you throw a buck in, they run over and say, '...where do you come from? ... Where {{did you get this}} money?' No." [...] The TV news anchor Rick Sanchez said: [...] "...if you start going into who is giving money to whom ... you have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> my church. <b>You</b> have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Rome and start asking where the money is going into Rome.

5000|$|In a 1999 {{interview}} with Louis Paul at the Chiller Theatre Convention, Brion James said this about working on Tango & Cash, {{and the production}} problems that the movie had;BJ: TANGO AND CASH, I had two scenes when I started the film. Konchalavsky {{wanted to work with}} me for years, he worked for Cannon, they couldn't pay me, so I couldn't work for them. He wanted me to work with him on RUNAWAY TRAIN. Finally, I get to work with him and he calls me in and I meet Stallone and Russell and they say 'Yeah, he's great.' I just had two scenes with these guys, they chase me around, and I get beat up and that's it. So, I get there and I'm acting with Stallone and made my character have a cockney accent just to add something [...] I said I'm in a movie with all of these guys, how am I going to chew the scenery with all of these fuckers? So, I created the cockney, I'm not just another hit man from Cleveland. They loved it. They played off of it, they got into it. So Stallone started re-writing the script, the script wasn't really ready, but they were there to go, so when <b>you</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> you go. The script was ready, and when it was not, he would fix it. The film was twenty million dollars over budget and I wound up being on the film for fourteen weeks. My part went from a few days, to much bigger. So, I became the main bad guy, and not Jack Palance.LP: Konchalavsky lost that picture, didn't he?BJ: He did a great job, but Sly got him fired. Sly is very protective about his films. He got his own DP in, and the film went twenty million dollars over budget. So the studio had to justify it, and fired him, saying it was the director's fault. It wasn't his fault. They didn't have a script. I was even re-writing {{at the end of the}} day, over and over. They only had three weeks left and they brought in Albert Magnoli. He did rock videos and a Prince movie (PURPLE RAIN). They gave this guy three quarters of a million dollars to do three weeks. By the time he got there, I was like don't talk to me, stay back. I knew this character for weeks, I know what I'm doing. It wound up being a great film, that eventually made a lot of money. It's one of the biggest pirated videos in the history of Russia. There were 80,000 pirated copies. Warner Bros. was crazy not to market it properly, but that film was huge. I went to the Ukraine when I was shooting another film, and I was mobbed. I was in the Black Sea and I had no idea that people even knew who I was.|$|E

Which is also the case with me and my father. And, as {{there is no other way}} for us <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> I say, let us accept this man's offer if he be what my uncle thinks he is. After all, it might be as safe for us on board his ship as to be on a {{merchantman}} and be captured by pirates, which would be likely enough in those regions where we are obliged to go; and so I say let us see the man, and if he don't frighten us too much let us sail with him and get my father and Dickory." ...|$|R
