25|$|I {{thank you}} heartily for the pamphlet, {{and for the}} {{authorities}} you give me for the doctrines I have sworn by, long and long since: I know not how long, they have been my creed: I believe, before even my happiness in your acquaintance and friendship, tho' they have certainly been strengthen'd and confirm'd by <b>your</b> <b>conversation</b> and instruction—in support of these principles I trust I shall ever act, and I shall continue to attempt their general propagation;—whether by the best means, is matter of speculation: but by the best, according to my judgement—nothing can make me a disciple of Paine or Priestley, nor any thing induce me to proclaim, that I am not so, but in the mode I myself think the best to resist their mischief—private conversation and private insinuation may best suit the extent of my abilities, the turn of my temper, {{and the nature of}} my character...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{continued}} making crank {{calls as}} MacPhisto, but the targets {{changed with the}} location of each concert. Many of them were local politicians that Bono wished to mock by engaging them in character as the devil. He enjoyed making these calls, saying, [...] "When you're dressed as the Devil, <b>your</b> <b>conversation</b> is immediately loaded, so if you tell somebody you really like what they're doing, you know it's not a compliment." [...] The band intended for MacPhisto to add humour while making a point. Said the Edge, [...] "That character was a great device for saying {{the opposite of what}} you meant. It made the point so easily and with real humor." [...] A female Cardiff fan who was pulled on-stage questioned Bono's motives for dressing as the devil, prompting the singer to compare his act to the plot of the C. S. Lewis novel The Screwtape Letters.|$|E
500|$|In the Hebrew Bible, {{there are}} thirty-five verses which mention salt. One of these {{mentions}} Lot's wife, who {{was turned into}} a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:26) as they were destroyed. When the judge Abimelech destroyed the city of Shechem, he is said to have [...] "sown salt on it," [...] probably as a curse on anyone who would re-inhabit it (Judges 9:45). The Book of Job contains the first mention of salt as a condiment. [...] "Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?" [...] (Job 6:6). In the New Testament, six verses mention salt. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus referred to his followers as the [...] "salt of the earth". The apostle Paul also encouraged Christians to [...] "let <b>your</b> <b>conversation</b> be always full of grace, seasoned with salt" [...] (Colossians 4:6). Salt is mandatory in the rite of the Tridentine Mass. Salt is used in the third item (which includes an Exorcism) of the Celtic Consecration (cf. Gallican Rite) that is employed in the consecration of a church. Salt may be added to the water [...] "where it is customary" [...] in the Roman Catholic rite of Holy water.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to improve your listening skills. Begin by observing <b>your</b> <b>conversations,</b> and pay special notice to the times you begin to get distracted or ignore the other person {{and see how it}} affects your relationships. Once you understand <b>your</b> patterns in <b>conversations,</b> it's easier to change the negative aspects of <b>your</b> <b>conversations.</b> There are three main guidelines everyone should follow if they want to become effective listeners. The most important guideline is being mindful, that is, being disciplined and committed when trying to listen. The next guideline is adapting to listening appropriately because it is beneficial to be skilled in many listening behaviors and to know when each is important. The final guideline to becoming an effective listener is listening actively. [...] To listen actively, keep eye contact with the speaker, nod when a message is understood, etc. Paraphrasing what was said in order to communicate to the speaker that you understood their message correctly will also improve listening skills. A good tag phrase for paraphrasing is [...] "What I'm hearing you say is...", followed by the question, [...] "Is that right?" [...] This combination of repeating back and asking for confirmation of accuracy frees the speaker to correct any previous ineffective communication.|$|R
