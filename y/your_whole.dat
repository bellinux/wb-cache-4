Rather than use the time to rest, lead vocalist Bono and guitarist The Edge were keen to record new material. Following a hectic year of touring, the two {{did not want to}} settle back into domestic life. Bono said, [...] "We thought we could live a normal life and then go back on the road [...] But it turns out that <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> way of thinking, <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> body has been geared toward the madness of Zoo TV... So we decided to put the madness on a record. Everybody's head was spinning, so we thought, why not keep that momentum going...?" [...] The Edge also wished to distract himself from the emotions he was feeling after separating from his wife during the Achtung Baby sessions in 1991.

In Vienna, Khrushchev suggested that three inspections per year {{would have to be}} the limit, as anything more frequent would constitute espionage. Khrushchev privately believed allowing three inspections to be a significant concession to the West, as other Soviet officials preferred an even less intrusive system, and was angered by US resistance.

His 1943 revival of William Congreve's Love for Love on tour {{and then in}} London received high praise from reviewers. In 1944 he was approached by Ralph Richardson, who had been asked by the governors of the Old Vic {{to form a new}} company.

500|$|Colts {{head coach}} Weeb Ewbank cited {{injuries}} to fullback Alan Ameche {{as the key}} reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began.

500|$|To {{accommodate}} the game's visual fidelity, the team compromised on frame rate. Roberts {{said that the}} decision was made early in development, since they initially expected that the PlayStation Vita could run PlayStation 3 assets at 30 Hz. The team used existing code from Wipeout HD as a [...] "starting point" [...] to make the development process more efficient; the art and technical teams of Studio Liverpool worked in parallel. Lovegrove agreed that 30 frames per second was always the goal for the game, since the team wanted to prioritise visual quality. In a Eurogamer interview, Roberts said that Studio Liverpool were one of the first developers to use a dynamic framebuffer on the PlayStation 3: an algorithm which reduces resolution when the game engine is stressed, maintaining performance and optimising frame rate. The technique, known as resolution throttling, was carried over from Wipeout HD to Wipeout 2048: [...] "If you are dead set on locking frame-rate and resolution <b>your</b> <b>whole</b> game is (graphically) restricted by the worst-case scenario".|$|E
