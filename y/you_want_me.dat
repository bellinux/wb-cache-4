500|$|During her {{audition}} for the show, Thorne read the {{lines from the}} Pembleton character in a previous episode. She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to do? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't {{want to say that}} but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very {{aware of the fact that}} it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|During the mid-song {{instrumental}} passage, {{the melody}} {{line of the}} sitar incorporates aspects of the alap, raising the melody previewed there by an octave. The song then returns to verses sung over the A and B sections, culminating in the line [...] "I'll make love to you, if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to." [...] The arrival of the drut gat follows Hindustani convention by ending the composition at an accelerated tempo, although the brevity of this segment marks {{a departure from the}} same tradition.|$|E

500|$|Asked by a {{reporter}} {{what he thought of}} the nickname, Youkilis quipped, [...] "It's better than being 'the Greek God of Illegitimate Children.'" [...] But according to his dad, [...] "Kevin disliked that Greek God of Walks stuff." [...] Fans actually rooted for Youkilis to take pitches. [...] "It was frustrating to hear fans say, 'Get a walk!'" [...] Youkilis said.

500|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to come with you?" [...] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so {{that one of your}} creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E

500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E
500|$|Once again, Patton {{found other}} {{commands}} given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel {{and in one}} incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took Trier, Coblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented {{virtually all of the}} remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to by-pass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: [...] "Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to give it back?" ...|$|E
500|$|A live {{video of}} the band {{performing}} [...] "Mr. Highway's Thinking About the End" [...] was included in an episode of Victory's VicTorV.For subsequent tours in promotion of Homesick, the band had a line-up change adding Four Letter Lie guitarist Kevin Skaff and dropping Tom Denney, the latter of whom wanted to settle down, but was still working with the band behind the scenes. A {{video of the}} band performing [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", which was filmed on the Warped Tour, {{was added to the}} band's MySpace profile on October 16, 2009. It was included as a DVD trailer on their profile, which people mistook as the song's actual music video. [...] In December, the band released a Christmas song, [...] "Right Where <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> to Be", on their MySpace account.|$|E

500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E
500|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign began on February 28, 2012, {{with the release}} of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the TED 2023 video presents a futuristic vision of a TED conference, an annual technology and design event held in Long Beach, California. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because [...] "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to give a talk, I'm giving it in Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
