500|$|Based on {{statements}} in the Mishnah and Gemara, chavrusa learning was a key feature of yeshivas in the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE) and Amoraim (Rabbis of the Talmudic period, 200 to 500 CE). The Rabbis repeatedly urged their students to acquire a study partner; for example, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya enjoined students to [...] "Make for <b>yourself</b> <b>a</b> Rav and acquire for <b>yourself</b> <b>a</b> chaver", and Rabbi Yose ben Chalafta told his son Rabbi Abba that he was ignorant {{because he did not}} study with someone else. The choice of chavrusas seems to have been based on friendship or social proximity; thus, chavrusas fulfilled a social as well as an educational need.|$|E
