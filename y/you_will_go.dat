500|$|Fortunately for the New Navy, {{its most}} ardent {{political}} supporter, Theodore Roosevelt, became President in 1901. Under his administration, the Navy {{went from the}} sixth {{largest in the world}} to second only to the Royal Navy.

2500|$|After the campaign, Roosevelt {{took office}} as vice {{president}} in March 1901. The office of Vice President was a powerless sinecure and did not suit Roosevelt's aggressive temperament. Roosevelt's six months as Vice President were uneventful, and Roosevelt presided over the Senate for a mere four days before it adjourned. On September 2, 1901, Roosevelt first publicized an aphorism that thrilled his supporters at the Minnesota State Fair: [...] "Speak softly and carry a big stick, and <b>you</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> far." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{previous}} Union {{campaigns in}} Virginia targeted the Confederate capital of Richmond {{as their primary}} objective, this time {{the goal was to}} capture Richmond by aiming for the destruction of Lee's army.
