Rona Gindin and Jennifer Greenhill-Taylor write highly of the restaurant's hot-fudge sundaes in Fodor's 2012 Walt Disney World. In Plan Your Walt Disney World Vacation in No Time, Douglas Ingersoll writes very positively of the milkshakes, {{and argues that}} the sandwiches and burgers are better than at the fast food restaurants in the park. A reviewer for the United Kingdom's The Sentinel also writes positively of the Sci-Fi Dine-In's milkshakes, and argues that, [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> treat yourself to a good lunch {{in one of the}} Disney parks, then this is the one".|$|E

I suspect that their families will suffer the more as they simply don't {{understand why you}} did. The brutality of these ladies' deaths, designed by you to evade discovery, showing the coldness with which you dispatched them, is appalling. You should clearly have faced up like {{a man at the}} overwhelming nature of the Crown's case against you but <b>you</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> put the victims' families through misery which you compounded by this trial." [...] The motive for Smith's actions remained unclear after the trial, but police believed a [...] "lack of permanent sexual relations" [...] had been a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|When {{translating}} its game titles, Square Enix {{tries to}} take into account the cultural differences between Japan and the target territories. This sometimes involves rewriting dialogue or altering graphics, animations, and sounds. For instance, in Chocobo Racing, visual references to the Japanese folk heroes Momotarō and Kiji were changed to depict Hansel and Gretel, since the game was designed mainly for children, and Hansel and Gretel are better known in the West than Momotarō and Kiji. According to Honeywood, trying to explain to the original development teams why some changes are needed can range from [...] "frustrating to downright hilarious". Generally, older development teams trust the translators with making changes while newer teams can be more reluctant, though they usually build up trust gradually. The localization team for The World Ends with <b>You</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> preserve the Japanese elements to ensure the game's cultural aspect remained intact. While localizing Final Fantasy XII, translators Smith and Reeder worked to preserve the original script's meaning while using English dialects to reproduce the Japanese dialects found in the original version to identify factions within the game.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{televised}} leaders' debate, Turner attacked Mulroney over the patronage machine {{that the latter}} had allegedly set up in anticipation of victory, comparing it to the Union Nationale governments of Quebec. [...] Mulroney responded by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made {{on the advice of}} Trudeau and Turner. Turner had the right to advise Sauvé to cancel Trudeau's appointments—advice that she was bound to follow by convention—but failed to do so and added to his own. Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for what he called [...] "these horrible appointments." [...] Turner claimed that [...] "I had no option" [...] except to let them stand. Mulroney [...] responded, [...] "You had an option, sirto say 'no'and <b>you</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party." [...] He highlighted the Liberals long record in government and resulting patronage appointments. Many observers believed that Mulroney clinched the election at this point, as it made Turner look weak and indecisive. Analysts agreed he was [...] "done in by television." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before handing {{power to}} Turner, Trudeau advised Governor General Jeanne Sauvé to appoint over 200 Liberals to {{patronage}} positions. [...] He and Turner then crafted a legal agreement calling for Turner to advise an additional 70 patronage appointments. The {{sheer volume of}} appointments, combined with questions about the appointees' qualifications, led to condemnation from across the political spectrum. However, an apparent rebound in the polls prompted Turner to call an election for September 1984, almost a year before it was due. Turner's appointment deal with Trudeau came back to haunt the Liberals at the English-language debate, when Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize for not advising that the appointments be canceled—advice that Sauvé would have been required to follow by convention. Turner claimed that [...] "I had no option" [...] but to let the appointments stand, prompting Mulroney to tell him, [...] "You had an option, sir--to say 'no'--and <b>you</b> <b>chose</b> <b>to</b> say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party." [...] The Liberals never recovered from this. Combined with anger in Quebec at being left out of patriation, the Liberals were heavily defeated at the 1984 election, losing 95 seats {{in what was then}} the worst defeat of a sitting government at the federal level.|$|E
