25|$|On 6 June 1843, Prescod {{was one of}} {{two people}} elected from the new {{constituency}} of Bridgetown. This was particularly difficult, as not only had he to overcome the prejudices, he had to work especially hard since it was only people who owned land who could vote. Moreover, this was not a secret ballot. At that time the polling booth was a piece of paper with the names of the candidates shown.

This route was used by many gold hungry miners in 1849 and later but {{suffered}} from the disadvantage that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.|$|E

25|$|Early on, McGuinty {{set down}} three {{strategic}} imperatives. First, no tax cuts. This ran against {{the conventional wisdom}} of politics that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> offer tax cuts to win; everyone from Mike Harris to Bill Clinton had campaigned on reducing the tax burden on the middle class. But McGuinty was determined that Ontario voters would accept that the money was needed to restore public {{health care and education}} services. Second, a positive tone. McGuinty wanted to avoid the typical opposition leader role of automatically opposing whatever the government announced, and instead, set the agenda with positive alternatives. While attacking your opponent was important, that would be left to caucus surrogates. Third, one big team. At the time, the Ontario Liberal Party was riven into factions. Peterson-era people distrusted more recent arrivals. Jean Chrétien supporters fought with Paul Martin supporters. McGuinty set a tone that divisions were left at the door.|$|E
25|$|Turn of {{the century}} {{baseball}} attendances were modest by later standards. The average for the 1,110 games in the 1901 season was 3,247. However the first 20 years of the 20th century saw an unprecedented rise in the popularity of baseball. Large stadiums dedicated to the game were built {{for many of the}} larger clubs or existing grounds enlarged, including Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Shibe Park in Philadelphia, Ebbets Field in Brooklyn, the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, Boston's Fenway Park along with Wrigley Field and Comiskey Park in Chicago. Likewise from the Eastern League to the small developing leagues in the West, and the rising Negro Leagues professional baseball was being played all across the country. Average major league attendances reached a pre World War I peak of 5,836 in 1909, before falling back during the war. Where there weren't professional teams, there were semi-pro teams, traveling teams barnstorming, company clubs and amateur men's leagues. In the days before television, if you wanted to see a game, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go to the ballpark.|$|E

They kept trying to destroy me.... I just went about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean." [...] By 1972, {{after the release of}} Ladies Love Outlaws, his recording contract was nearing an end. Sick with hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E

500|$|The {{safety record}} of Adam Air was heavily criticised, {{especially}} {{in the aftermath of}} Flight 574. Pilots reported repeated and deliberate breaches of international safety regulations, with aircraft being flown in non-airworthy states for months at a time. They claimed that there had been such incidents as requests to sign documents to allow an aircraft to fly while not having the authority to and while knowing the plane to be not airworthy, flying a plane for several months with a damaged door handle, swapping parts between aircraft to avoid mandatory replacement deadlines, being ordered to fly aircraft after exceeding the take-off limit of five times per pilot per day, flying an aircraft with a damaged window, using spare parts from other aircraft to keep planes in the air, and the ignoring of pilots' requests not to take off due to unsafe aircraft. The Associated Press quoted one pilot as saying that [...] "Every time you flew, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight with the ground staff and the management about all the regulations <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> violate." [...] They also claim that if pilots confronted their seniors in the airline, they were grounded or docked pay.|$|E
