5|$|YMD, YAR. Prior to Yemenite {{unification}} in 1990, North <b>Yemen</b> participated as the <b>Yemen</b> Arab Republic (YAR) in 1984 and 1988, and South <b>Yemen</b> participated as the <b>Yemen</b> Democratic Republic (YMD) in the 1988 Games.|$|E
5|$|Turan-Shah {{drove out}} the Hamdanid rulers of Sana'a, conquering the mountainous city in 1175. With {{the conquest of}} <b>Yemen,</b> the Ayyubids {{developed}} a coastal fleet, al-asakir al-bahriyya, which they used to guard the sea coasts under their control and protect them from pirate raids. The conquest held great significance for <b>Yemen</b> because the Ayyubids managed to unite the previous three independent states (Zabid, Aden, and Sana'a) under a single power. However, when Turan-Shah was transferred from his governorship in <b>Yemen</b> in 1176, uprisings {{broke out in the}} territory and were not quelled until 1182 when Saladin assigned his other brother Tughtekin Sayf al-Islam as governor of <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E

5|$|After the war, {{the tribes}} were better {{represented}} in the republican government. In 1969, sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council. Under Iryani, the sheikhs, particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt. By {{the end of the}} war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks, and certain army sheiks and activists from South <b>Yemen.</b> In the summer of 1972, a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North <b>Yemen</b> and South <b>Yemen</b> that they would reunite, but they did not. There were complaints in North <b>Yemen</b> about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to <b>Yemen,</b> Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in <b>Yemen.</b> In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in <b>Yemen</b> was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist <b>Yemen</b> from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on <b>Yemen</b> that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and {{had no sense of}} loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of {{topographical}} maps causing a real problem in {{the first months of}} the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted that information on <b>Yemen</b> was nonexistent. Egypt had not had an embassy in <b>Yemen</b> since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to <b>Yemen,</b> all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E
5|$|GDRT {{was most}} likely the first Aksumite king to be {{involved}} in South Arabian affairs, as well as the first known king to be mentioned in South Arabian inscriptions. His reign resulted in the control of much of western <b>Yemen,</b> such as the Tihāmah, Najrā, Ma`afir, Ẓafār (until c. 230), and parts of Hashid territory around Hamir in the northern highlands. Furthermore, GDRT's military alliances and his conquests in <b>Yemen</b> and Saudi Arabia, the required formidable fleet for such feats, and the extension of Aksumite influence throughout <b>Yemen</b> and southern Saudi Arabia all reflect a new zenith in Aksumite power. His involvement would mark the beginning of centuries of Aksumite involvement in South Arabia, culminating with the full-scale invasion of <b>Yemen</b> by King Kaleb in 520 (or 525), resulting in the establishment of an Aksumite province covering all of South Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah {{to conquer}} <b>Yemen</b> and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi {{wrote that the}} {{reasoning}} behind the conquest of <b>Yemen</b> was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and executed its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden {{was taken from the}} Shia Banu Karam tribe. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of <b>Yemen,</b> although the official capital of Ayyubid <b>Yemen</b> was Ta'iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its commercial infrastructure, the establishment of new institutions, and the minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Yemen</b> and Hadramaut, {{much of the}} {{population}} adhered to Shia Islam in its Zaydi form. The inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia were made up of Sunni Muslim Kurds and Turks, {{although there was a}} significant Yazidi minority in that region as well. Jews were spread throughout the Islamic world and most Ayyubid cities had Jewish communities due to the important roles Jews played in trade, manufacture, finance, and medicine. In <b>Yemen</b> and some parts of Syria, Jews also lived in rural towns. The Ayyubid emir of <b>Yemen</b> in 1197–1202, al-Malik Mu'izz Isma'il, attempted to forcibly convert the Jews of Aden, but this process ceased after his death in 1202. Within the Jewish community, particularly in Egypt and Palestine, there existed a minority of Karaites.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Khwarezemids under Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu {{captured}} {{the town of}} Khilat from al-Ashraf, while the normally loyalist Rasulids began to encroach on Ayyubid territorial holdings in Arabia. In 1222 the Ayyubids appointed the Rasulid leader Ali Bin Rasul as governor of Mecca. Ayyubid rule in <b>Yemen</b> and the Hejaz was declining and the Ayyubid governor of <b>Yemen,</b> Mas'ud bin Kamil, {{was forced to leave}} for Egypt in 1223. He appointed Nur ad-Din Umar as his deputy governor while he was absent. In 1224 the local al-Yamani dynasty gained control of Hadramaut from the Ayyubids who had held it loosely due to the troubled situation of their administration in <b>Yemen</b> proper. Following Mas'ud bin Kamil's death in 1229, Nur ad-Din Umar declared himself the independent ruler of <b>Yemen</b> and discontinued the annual tribute payment to the Ayyubid sultanate in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{conceivable}} that any future {{members of the}} Commonwealth such as applicants (for example South Sudan, Sudan and <b>Yemen)</b> may participate in future games. The Colony of Aden and Federation of South Arabia, precursors to modern <b>Yemen,</b> participated before in 1962 and in 1966. Sudan was an Anglo-Egyptian protectorate until independence in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{from the}} first week of November 2009, Saudi Air Force Tornados, along with Saudi F-15s {{performed}} air raids during the Shia insurgency in north <b>Yemen.</b> It was the first time since Operation Desert Storm in 1991 that the Royal Saudi Air Force participated in a military operation over hostile territory. Saudi Air Force Tornados are playing a central role in Saudi-led bombing campaign in <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bunche and Bunker mission {{gave birth}} to the idea of an {{observer}} mission to <b>Yemen,</b> which eventually became the United Nations <b>Yemen</b> Observation Mission. The U.N. observer team, which would be set up by the former UN Congo commander, Swedish Major General Carl von Horn. His disengagement agreement called for (1) Establishment of a demilitarized zone extending twenty kilometers on either side of a demarcated Saudi Arabian <b>Yemen</b> border, from which all military equipment was to be excluded; (2) Stationing of UN observers within this zone {{on both sides of the}} border to observe, report and prevent any continued attempt by the Saudis to supply royalist forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{recorded}} in the northeast African nations of Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, the Western Asian nations of Iran, Israel, Jordan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, South <b>Yemen,</b> the United Arab Emirates, and <b>Yemen</b> (including the Yemeni island of Socotra), and the South Asian nations of India and Pakistan. Within India, it is documented in the western states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.|$|E
5|$|After {{the scale}} of the damage became clear, the {{government}} of <b>Yemen</b> requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1971, both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had {{disengaged}} from <b>Yemen.</b> South <b>Yemen</b> {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established. Clashes along {{the border between the}} states rose, and in 1972 a small war broke.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Megh made {{landfall}} on the <b>Yemen</b> mainland, it had weakened enough to not produce any strong winds or heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Cosmas Indicopleustes, a 6th-century Eastern Roman monk {{and former}} {{merchant}} {{who wrote the}} Christian Topography (describing the Indian Ocean trade leading {{all the way to}} China), visited the Aksumite port city of Adulis and included eyewitness accounts of it in his book. He copied a Greek inscription detailing the reign of an early 3rd-century polytheistic ruler of Aksum who sent a naval fleet across the Red Sea to conquer the Sabaeans in what is now <b>Yemen,</b> along with other parts of western Arabia. Ancient Sabaean texts from <b>Yemen</b> confirm that this was the Aksumite ruler Gadara, who made alliances with Sabaean kings, leading to eventual Axumite control over western <b>Yemen</b> that would last until the Himyarite ruler Shammar Yahri'sh (r. c. 265 – c. 287) expelled the Aksumites from southwestern Arabia. It is only from Sabaean and Himyarite inscriptions that we know the names of several Aksumite kings and princes after Gadara, including the monarchs `DBH and DTWNS. Inscriptions of king Ezana mention stone-carved thrones near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum (the platforms of which still exist), and Cosmas described a white-marble throne and stele in Adulis that were both covered in Greek inscriptions.|$|E

Obama left about 9,800 US troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 US troops in Iraq, 503 US troops in Syria, 133 US troops in Pakistan, 106 US troops in Somalia, 7 US troops in <b>Yemen,</b> and 2 US troops in Libya {{at the end}} of his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in <b>Yemen</b> was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans, rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North <b>Yemen,</b> the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans, the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North <b>Yemen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since 2013, Saudi Arabian hacktivists {{have been}} {{targeting}} government websites protesting {{the actions of}} the regime. These actions have seen attacks supported by the possibly Iranian backed <b>Yemen</b> Cyber Army.|$|E
5|$|Techniques {{based on}} DNA {{comparison}} suggest Aloe vera is relatively {{closely related to}} Aloe perryi, a species endemic to <b>Yemen.</b> Similar techniques, using chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and ISSR profiling have also suggested it {{is closely related to}} Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe striata. With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to Socotra (<b>Yemen),</b> Somalia, and Sudan. The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of hybrid origin.|$|E

5|$|The internationally {{recognized}} government, which controls most of southern <b>Yemen,</b> announced {{the suspension of}} schools in four governorates: Hadhramaut, Socotra, Al Mahrah and Shabwah. By 1November, evacuations were ordered in Mukalla and Hadhramaut, and the government's meteorological agency recommended residents to stay more than one kilometre from the coastline. About 18,750people left their homes ahead of the storm on the <b>Yemen</b> mainland. Most people sheltered in public buildings like schools or hospitals, or stayed with relatives. There were reports that al-Qaeda evacuated residents near the coast in Mukalla immediately before the storm struck. Ahead of the storm, the World Health Organization distributed gasoline to ambulances and hospitals to ensure they would continue operating effectively.|$|E

Embassies that are scheduled to reopen in the city include those of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Italy and South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla was now {{the senior}} ruler of the Buyid Empire, and several rulers such as the Hamdanids, Saffarids, Shahinids, Hasanwayhids and even other lesser rulers who {{controlled}} <b>Yemen,</b> including its surrounding regions, acknowledged his authority. Other regions such as Makran, was also under Buyid control.|$|E
5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and <b>Yemen,</b> and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. Typically, the staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, Kurdish and Yemenite Jews, and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.|$|E
5|$|After passing {{just north}} of Somalia, Megh progressed westward into the Gulf of Aden, the {{waterway}} between Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula. This {{marked the first time}} on record when two storms entered the body of water in the same year. By 12:00UTC on November9, the center was beginning to become exposed from the convection due to the unfavorable conditions. Throughout the day, the structure rapidly deteriorated as the storm curved to the west-northwest. At 21:00UTC on November9, Megh weakened further into a severe cyclonic storm, and degraded further to a cyclonic storm by six hours later. While just offshore <b>Yemen,</b> the circulation slowed and turned to the northeast, after the ridge to the north receded eastward. At 06:00UTC on November10 the storm weakened to a deep depression, and three hours later Megh made landfall in southwestern <b>Yemen</b> northeast of Zinjibar, with estimated winds of 55km/h (35mph). The structure eroded significantly over land, prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories. The circulation continued inland, and Megh degenerated into a low pressure area by 18:00UTC on November10.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received the governorship of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of <b>Yemen,</b> became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of <b>Yemen,</b> but was deposed two years later and returned to the governorship of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E
