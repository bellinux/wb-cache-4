500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One of the few things in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on Mwng feature quite solemn, {{personal}} lyrics, which reflect on a difficult few years for Rhys. The single, [...] "Ysbeidiau Heulog", is about [...] "looking back at a bad time which had the odd good moment", while [...] "Pan Ddaw'r Wawr" [...] deals {{with the death of}} rural communities. The singer claims to have wept—rather than sung—the album's last track, [...] "Gwreiddiau Dwfn" [...] / [...] "Mawrth Oer Ar y Blaned Neifion", which features lyrics [...] "so bleak it's almost comic" [...] about [...] "being rooted to a sad piece of land [...] being doomed to live somewhere and that's all <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> that's what you're stuck with". Rhys has described Datblygu's [...] "Y Teimlad" [...] as being about [...] "not knowing what love is or what love means." [...] "Drygioni" [...] is a song about [...] "sleaze [...] about good versus evil, and a person's need for both", and [...] "Y Gwyneb Iau" [...] is a [...] "moody song about war" [...] whose title is a Welsh insult that translates into English as [...] "Liverface". In contrast, [...] "Nythod Cacwn" [...] is a comedic song, based on an incident involving drummer Dafydd Ieuan being chased by bees after he disturbed a beehive while attempting to build a bonfire on a beach. It features lyrics that were [...] "made up on the spot" [...] by Rhys. [...] "Dacw Hi" [...] is inspired by one of Rhys's former teachers who claimed she had eyes {{in the back of her}} head. [...] "Sarn Helen" [...] is about the decline of the Roman road of the same name that was built between North and South Wales. [...] "Ymaelodi Â'r Ymylon" [...] is partly inspired by the ostracisation the band felt from some areas of the Welsh musical community due to their decision to sing in English on earlier albums. The track's lyrics feature the old Welsh idiom [...] "y cythraul canu", which means [...] "the demon in music" [...] and refers to the friction this can create between people.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, {{the program}} De 1 a 5, {{transmitted}} by C5N, found Gastón Soffritti and Marzol talking and bowling in Buenos Aires. Lucas Velasco, {{a friend of}} the actor, said: [...] "There are a couple that is forming and I wanted to show you there's <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> you're watching". However, they were not in a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|What are the {{characteristics}} of the fibres? [...] For instance, cotton and linen, being plant fibers, are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk. [...] Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures. [...] All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care. [...] Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted. [...] Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> <b>and</b> how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.|$|E
2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in Coma in Lower Egypt in 251 to wealthy {{landowner}} parents. When he was about 18 years old, his parents died and left him with the care of his unmarried sister. Shortly thereafter, he decided to follow the Evangelical counsel of Jesus which reads, [...] "If {{you want to be}} perfect, go, sell what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> give to the poor, and you will have treasures in heaven." [...] Anthony gave away some of his family's lands to his neighbors, sold the remaining property, and donated the funds thus raised to the poor. He then left to live an ascetic life, placing his sister with a group of Christian virgins, a sort of proto-convent.|$|E
2500|$|... ”You who are already, by {{the will}} of God and the {{commands}} of your father, lawfully married to noble wives of your own nation, whom you are bound to cherish. And certainly it is not lawful for you to put away the wives <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> marry others, or ally yourselves in marriage with a foreign people, a thing never done by any of your ancestors.... It is wicked of you even to entertain the thought of marrying again when you are already married. You ought not to act thus, who profess to follow the law of God, and punish others to prevent men acting in this unlawful manner. Such things do the heathen. But they {{ought not to be}} done by you who are Christians, a holy people and a kingly priesthood.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the front}} line {{continued}} to withdraw, they appeared from the woods {{directly in front of}} Morton and then slowly took refuge behind his lines. The Confederates, still in pursuit, began to appear from the woods, allowing Stokes' battery to open fire with canister. Morton rode to the front of his troops and said, [...] "Men, you haven't much ammunition, but give them what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> then wade in on `em with the bayonets!" [...] With that, the lines were ordered to stand and open fire, putting gaps into the oncoming Confederate lines. The lines wavered and then began to withdraw. Upon seeing the success, Rosecrans order the brigade to charge forward and occupy the fields just outside the woods. The Confederates rallied three times and pressed forward again, but each time, were forced back.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{day before}} the invasion, US President Gerald R. Ford and Kissinger met with Indonesian {{president}} Suharto. Documents released by the National Security Archive in 2001 revealed that they gave a green light for the invasion. In response to Suharto saying, [...] "We want your understanding if we deem it necessary to take rapid or drastic action ," [...] Ford replied, [...] "We will understand and will not press you on the issue. We understand the problem <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>and</b> the intentions you have." [...] Kissinger agreed, although he had fears that the use of US-made arms in the invasion would be exposed to public scrutiny, and Kissinger urged Suharto to wait until Ford had returned from his far eastern trip, because [...] "we would be able to influence the reaction in America if whatever happens happens after we return. This way there would be less chance of people talking in an unauthorised way." [...] The US also hoped the invasion would be relatively swift and not involve protracted resistance. [...] "It is important that whatever you do succeeds quickly," [...] Kissinger said to Suharto.|$|E
