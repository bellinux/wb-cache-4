The worker must have bread, but she must have roses, too. Help, you women of privilege, give her the ballot to fight with.|$|E
500|$|... Meaney pointed out, [...] "When {{you don't}} have anything, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to lose by}} these radical actions. But when you become {{a person who has}} a home and has property, to some extent you become conservative." ...|$|E
500|$|Frise and Clark {{had grown}} {{concerned}} with the Stars treatment of its staff and made an agreement in 1946 to leave at the first opportunity. [...] Clark contacted John McConnell, publisher of the Montreal Standard, a newspaper with a smaller circulation than the Star that had earlier offered him a position. [...] McConnell offered the pair salaries similar to what they received at the Star, {{as well as the}} opportunity for Frise to have his strip syndicated in the United States, which would supplement his income. [...] When they handed in their resignations that Christmas Eve, Hindmarsh asked them, [...] "Aren't you going to give us a chance to bid?" [...] Frise told him, [...] "Mr Hindmarsh, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to bid with." [...] The last Birdseye Center episode ran on 1 February 1947.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene when}} Walter pleads with Gus {{demonstrates}} the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse. During that scene, Walter tells Gus, [...] "You kill me, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing.</b> You kill Jesse, you don't have me." [...] Jesse is visibly {{moved by the}} statement, which Aaron Paul described as [...] "the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt's loyalty is to Jesse." [...] "Box Cutter" [...] also illustrated Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to break into Walter's house, {{going so far as}} to use her baby as a prop in her facade. After Skyler breaks into Walter's apartment, she finds the plastic eyeball of a teddy bear that has been part of the series since the second season. The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter's gradual descent into a life of crime, and Skyler's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent.|$|E
500|$|On the thirtieth {{anniversary of}} the series, Henderson called the {{incident}} [...] "the low point of the series", but would later apologize to Clarke. In his 2007 book, Conacher wrote that [...] "from the broadcast booth I was shocked and disgusted when I saw Clarke viciously chop at Kharlamov's left ankle." [...] He noted [...] "that emotionally these games had clearly gone beyond sport for Team Canada and had truly become unrestricted war on ice." [...] Media opinion is divided on the effect it had {{on the outcome of}} the series. The controversy and admissions that have come forth throughout the years have led some to the belief that the incident could be considered a form of cheating. Kharlamov, who {{had been one of the}} Soviets' best forwards, missed game seven, when the Soviets could have clinched the series and while he did play in game eight, he was not at 100% and did not score. In Clarke's opinion, there were other factors for Team Canada's turnaround in Moscow: [...] "In Moscow we played much better than in Canada. We were almost equal to the Soviet team physically by then, we passed much better, we shot the puck much better, we became faster and played better on defence. Besides, when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose, it is easier to play. And after the fifth game we had nothing to lose." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} anniversary of Bethany's disappearance, Nelson {{challenged}} Roldan {{to take a}} lie detector test. [...] "I {{would like to hear}} what happened," [...] she told Washington-area news radio station WTOP-FM. [...] "I'd like him to join the polygraph list {{like the rest of us}} did. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to hide, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to worry about." [...] Geloo in response repeated that Roldan had answered all questions he was asked during the original investigation and was innocent of any crime that may have been committed.|$|E

6000|$|... "And I think, madam," [...] {{said the}} Lord Keeper, losing his {{accustomed}} temper and patience, [...] "that if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> better to tell us, <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better have kept this family secret to yourself also." ...|$|R

2500|$|Although Stevenson's eloquent oratory and thoughtful, stylish {{demeanor}} impressed many intellectuals, journalists, political commentators, {{and members}} of the nation's academic community, the Republicans and some working-class Democrats ridiculed what they perceived as his indecisive, aristocratic air. During the 1952 campaign Stewart Alsop, a powerful Connecticut Republican, labeled Stevenson an [...] "egghead", based on his baldness and intellectual air. His brother, the influential newspaper columnist Joe Alsop, used the word to underscore [...] Stevenson's difficulty [...] in attracting [...] working-class voters, and the nickname stuck. Stevenson himself made fun of his [...] "egghead" [...] nickname; in one speech he joked [...] "eggheads of the world unite, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to lose but your yolks!" [...] In his campaign speeches Stevenson strongly criticized the Communist-hunting tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy, labeling [...] "McCarthy's kind of patriotism as a disgrace" [...] and ridiculing right-wing Republicans [...] "who hunt Communists in the Bureau of Wildlife and Fisheries while hesitating to aid the gallant {{men and women who are}} resisting the real thing in the front lines of Europe and Asia...they are finally the men who seemingly believe that we can confound the Kremlin by frightening ourselves to death." [...] In return, Senator McCarthy stated in a speech that [...] "he would like to get on the Stevenson campaign trail with a club and...make a good and loyal American out of the governor." ...|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know what they were talking about... So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. First of all, I don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I see, I see.... And yet I believe I don't quite see, after all. You {{stood the}} torture {{and refused to}} confess; which shows plain enough to even the dullest {{understanding}} that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to confess--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should not}} bother {{any more about}} it," [...] Alice said decidedly. [...] "Uncle Harry and I are all quite, quite sure that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with that}} horrible business, and that ought to be quite enough for you." ...|$|R
