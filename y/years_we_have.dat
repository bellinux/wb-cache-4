500|$|Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, from New London, Wisconsin, set up Wolf River Kennels {{in order}} to save the breed. Numbers held by the kennel fluctuated but at times went up to 132 dogs. He advertised the dogs widely across the country, selling male dogs for $25 and females dogs for $20. Part of a sales pitch that Pfeifer mailed to {{prospective}} dog owners read, [...] "The American Brown Spaniel is distinctively an American production. Hunters have known this type for years and it was through their efforts that this dog was propagated.... For <b>years</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> bred only selective stock, breeding for gameness, stability, courage, intelligence, and beauty. They are dogs to admire and trust under all conditions whether in the home circle or in the field with the outdoor man." ...|$|E
500|$|On July 7, 2009, Walter O'Malley was {{inducted}} into the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame along with two other Dodger icons: slugger Steve Garvey and announcer Vin Scully. [...] "Over the <b>years,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned more of his decade-long quest to build a new stadium in Brooklyn and about how those efforts were thwarted by city officials. Perhaps this induction will inspire fans who themselves started new lives outside the borough to reconsider their thoughts about Walter O’Malley", said John Mooney, curator of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame. [...] "He privately built one of baseball's more beautiful ballparks, Dodger Stadium, and set attendance records annually. While New York is the home of the Irish American Baseball Hall of Fame, it seeks to honor inductees whose impact was and is national." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five <b>years.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have.</b> We've made several. We just didn't release them because we were waiting for something that would be as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} drivers {{competing}} in the 2010 Chase for the Sprint Cup entered the race optimistic about their chances of winning the championship. Biffle argued that he, Burton, or Stewart were [...] "capable of winning it". Johnson, who already had eighteen previous wins in the Chase, observed that [...] "those 10 races in the Chase is its own world. The people act and react differently under pressure, {{and for the last}} four <b>years</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done a great job in that environment." [...] Hamlin commented, [...] "Reliability is the only thing we need to work on. It's taken us out of the last three Chases, not being reliable. You have to have it to be the champion." [...] Ray Evernham also opined on Hamlin, [...] "I think Denny knows that he has the talent to win the championship. I think that he's got focus right now and a good, veteran crew chief in Mike Ford. If Toyota gives him the speed, he could be a threat." ...|$|E
500|$|Sensing {{an attack}} coming, Washington told his troops on September 5th, [...] "Should they [...] push their design against Philadelphia, on this route, their all is at stake—they {{will put the}} contest on {{the event of a}} single battle: If they are overthrown, they are utterly undone—the war is at an end." [...] Two days later, upon hearing that British ships had left the Chesapeake, Washington was sure Howe's move was imminent. He rallied his troops, {{referencing}} Horatio Gates's successes against the British in the north, saying [...] "Who can forbear to emulate their [...] noble spirit? Who is there without ambition, to share with them, the applauses of their countrymen, and of all posterity, as the defenders of Liberty, and the procurers of peace and happiness to millions in the present and future generations? Two <b>years</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> maintained the war and struggled with difficulties innumerable. But the prospect has since brightened, and our affairs put on a better face—Now is the time to reap the fruits of all our toils and dangers! ...

500|$|In 2001, Andrew Billen {{compared}} the contemporary cultural {{relevance of the}} series to The Way We Live Now, as a follow-up to his comparison of the first series with Vanity Fair: [...] "In previous <b>years</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> seen the anguish caused by infidelity, impotence and infertility. This season the characters face the hazards thrown up by miscarriage, alcoholism and a late-flowering career. Sustaining relationships looks as hard as ever. Yet there is nothing each protagonist wants more than old-fashioned domestic bliss." [...] The review resonated with other critics; in The Scotsman, Linda Watson-Brown wrote an overall positive review of the series in general—dismissing the spate of [...] "anti-Cold Feet" [...] reviews—but criticised [...] "the ease with which problems are resolved and morality used to slap the viewer in the face". The final episode set in Australia polarised critics; in a column focusing on Chewin' the Fat, Scotsman critic Aidan Smith accused the big-budget episode [...] "which somehow managed to squeeze the Harbour Bridge into every shot" [...] of being the point the series jumped the shark, and Times columnist Caitlin Moran complimented it, but was concerned that the series' original main characters—Adam and Rachel—were being sidelined by everyone including Mike Bullen.|$|E

500|$|The band {{suffered}} a personal tragedy {{on the night}} of July 11, 1996, when touring keyboardist Jonathan Melvoin and Chamberlin overdosed on heroin in a hotel room in New York City. Melvoin died, and Chamberlin was arrested for drug possession. A few days later, the band announced that Chamberlin had been fired {{as a result of the}} incident. The Pumpkins chose to finish the tour, and hired drummer Matt Walker and keyboardist Dennis Flemion. Corgan later said the decision to continue touring was the worst decision the band had ever made, damaging both their music and their reputation. Chamberlin admitted in a 1994 Rolling Stone cover story that in the past he'd [...] "gotten high in every city in this country and probably half the cities in Europe." [...] But in recent years, he had reportedly been clean. On July 17, the Pumpkins issued a statement in which they said, [...] "For nine <b>years</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> battled with Jimmy's struggles with the insidious disease of drug and alcohol addiction. It has nearly destroyed everything we are and stand for. … We wish [...] the best we have to offer". Meanwhile, the band had given interviews since the release of Mellon Collie stating that it would be the last conventional Pumpkins record, and that rock was becoming stale. James Iha said at the end of 1996, [...] "The future is in electronic music. It really seems boring just to play rock music." ...|$|E

2500|$|To host a stage start or finish brings {{prestige}} and business to a town. The prologue and first stage (Grand Départ) are particularly prestigious.
