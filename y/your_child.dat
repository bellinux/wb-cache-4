500|$|Some {{criticism}} {{came from}} {{the feeling that the}} program was not educational.

500|$|In April 2010, Rowling {{published}} an article in The Times, in which she criticised Cameron's plan to encourage married couples to stay together by offering them a £150 annual tax credit: [...] "Nobody who has ever experienced the reality of poverty could say 'it's not the money, it's the message'. When your flat has been broken into, and you cannot afford a locksmith, it is the money. When you are two pence short of a tin of baked beans, and <b>your</b> <b>child</b> is hungry, it is the money. When you find yourself contemplating shoplifting to get nappies, it is the money." ...|$|E

When Galloway leaks an intimate photo of Claire to appease his jealous fianceé, Claire intimidates him into publicly stating that he fabricated the picture, ruining his reputation.

500|$|Censors have {{objected to}} the profanity in Shiloh. Naylor {{received}} an angry letter from {{the parents of a}} 10-year-old boy, who were angered by the language in the book. The character Judd had sworn, [...] "dammit". The author replied in an interview with The Virginian-Pilot that some people in the world [...] "speak crudely" [...] and [...] "you can't put <b>your</b> <b>child</b> in a glass bubble and protect him always". Several West Virginian book reviewers have complained about the dialect in the novel, believing that West Virginians do not speak with a dialect. In one review, a newspaper writer said that when she read the book to her children, she chose not to read with the dialect.|$|E

But the breakup of your marriage can be even more stressful and painful for <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> You may stop being husband and wife, but you both always will remain parents of <b>your</b> <b>children.</b> You will celebrate their successes and support them during times of disap-pointment.

500|$|When {{the news}} of Rowe's {{pregnancy}} broke to Jackson's mother Katherine, the Jackson family matriarch urged her son to wed {{the mother of his}} unborn child. Katherine did not want her son to be like his father, who had produced an illegitimate child with a woman while married to Michael's mother. Katherine first spoke on the telephone to Rowe about the sanctity of marriage and about the Jehovah's Witness faith. She later spoke to Jackson, telling him to marry [...] "that nice girl, Debbie" [...] and [...] "give <b>your</b> <b>child</b> a name, not like your poor, half-sister, Joh'Vonnie". The words resonated with the musician, {{who did not want to}} repeat his father's sins.|$|E
500|$|The Mortaras {{were not}} {{surprised}} by the verdict in Feletti's trial. Momolo hoped that his son might be a major topic of discussion at an international conference {{on the future of}} Italy, but was disappointed when no such summit materialised. His cause and visit to Paris partly motivated the formation in May 1860 of the Alliance Israélite Universelle, a Paris-based organisation dedicated to the advancement of Jewish civil rights across the world. As the Italian nationalist armies advanced through the peninsula, the fall of Rome seemed imminent. In September 1860 the Alliance Israélite Universelle wrote to Momolo offering him financial and logistical support if he wished to reclaim his son by force, as [...] "getting <b>your</b> <b>child</b> back is the cause of all Israel". A separate plan was formulated by Carl Blumenthal, an English Jew serving in Giuseppe Garibaldi's nationalist volunteer corps: Blumenthal and three others would dress up as clergymen, seize Edgardo and spirit him away. Garibaldi approved this plan in 1860, but it was apparently called off after one of the conspirators died.|$|E
500|$|Blakeman {{said that}} she read the book in a single sitting, before [...] "crying her eyes out". The film {{includes}} the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's [...] "heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in." [...] Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke {{of the limits of}} taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's [...] "account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer [...] "a unique take" [...] on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that [...] "At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about <b>your</b> <b>child</b> more than you care about yourself." ...|$|E
