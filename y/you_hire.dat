[...] "I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> me, {{and it will be}} recognizable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Eastern, Torque {{encounters}} a dying member of Blackmore's gang, who says [...] "the {{things you did}} in here. I mean, you sure made your mark, but why would <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> someone to..." [...] With that, the lights go out, and when they turn back on, the man is dead. Torque is contacted by Miles, who angrily tells him [...] "how long it's been man? How long you been making a mockery of everything?" [...] He then encounters Warden Elroy (James Patrick Stewert), son of the infamous warden Raymond Elroy, who took sadistic pleasure in torturing inmates through manual labor and solitary confinement. Elroy tells Torque the prison has descended into chaos since {{the appearance of the}} malefactors, and asks for help in restoring order. He is able to convince the guards and prisoners to work together, and with Torque's help they are able to escape, although Torque remains behind.|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought that's 'bout the way {{it would}} turn out, when I heard <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> Sim to help you. He's got the business, an' you've got the shake." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{official}} got up {{and took}} down a book from a shelf. [...] "How long had he been at the Cape before <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> him, do <b>you</b> know?" [...] he asked as he turned over the leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. In {{that case}} I will land, {{tomorrow}} morning at daybreak, and start at once; so that we shall reach Johore tomorrow. Will <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> four men, to act as carriers for us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about mining, but I'm pretty strong," [...] Drummond answered, giving Scott a deerskin bag. [...] "Anyhow, Mr. Thirlwell had better read his letter before <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> me. Antoine, the patron, brought up your mail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do, Calvert. Didn't <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> my horses, once?" [...] I replied. [...] "You {{must take}} my meaning {{the right way}} when I say that I'm pleased to see you here. But what brought you and the others into this desolation?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Brown {{came under}} fire in early 2017 for {{reportedly}} using the [...] "N-word" [...] when in a heated argument with John Scavelli (Evesham school district superintendent). Brown is quoted saying [...] "I can't believe <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> that n----." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy own tongue blister {{the roof}} of thy mouth!" [...] cried Mrs. Glendinning, in a half-stifled, {{whispering}} scream. [...] "'Tis not for <b>thee,</b> <b>hired</b> one, to rail at my son, though he were Lucifer, simmering in Hell! Mend thy manners, minx!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{do nothing}} of the sort. It's yours, to do with as you please, and if you won't take it, I'll give it to Maria. She'll {{know what to do}} with it. I'd suggest, though, that <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> a servant and take a good long rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, father, if <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> the waggons to government, may I go with them? I can {{see that}} the Kaffirs look after the oxen, you know, and that {{everything}} goes straight. I have picked up a little Kaffir from Joel, and can manage to make them understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow, I didn't. You {{want to stop}} {{shooting}} rocks {{when there}} are men around. Then you've mussed up the track and can't put her straight. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> more boys and rush the job? Can't see why the bosses let two deadbeats like {{you and your partner}} have the contract!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} so {{faithful}} a chronicler, my dear father; but I believe that Norman once served here while a boy, and {{before he went to}} Ledington, whence <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> him.

6000|$|... "That's {{out of my}} camp, too," [...] said Matlack, [...] "but I'm {{bound to}} report it. The bicycle fellow that <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> a gun to don't know the fust thing about usin' it, {{and the next thing}} you'll hear will be that he's shot his pardner, who's worth six of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{the butt}} had been freshly cross-cut," [...] {{declared}} Thurston with an ominous glitter in his eyes. [...] "I understand you are pretty slack just now.

6000|$|... "But, Mr. Newcome," [...] said Mary Warren, quietly, {{though with}} a sort of demure irony in her manner that said she was not without humor and {{understood}} herself very well, [...] "even you let your land--land that you lease, too, and which you do not own, except as <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> it from Mr. Littlepage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I'll bet {{you would}} {{if you had}} me alone. But these outlaws--these sheep-thieves--these tools <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> are better than you and Riggs....

500|$|On February 8, Stephanopoulos {{broadened the}} scope of the affair by announcing that the past hiring of an illegal alien would [...] "probably be disqualifying" [...] for {{applicants}} to any of the 1,100 presidential appointments that were subject to confirmation by the Senate. [...] As one White House official said, [...] "If <b>you</b> ever knowingly <b>hired</b> an illegal alien, that's a killer. If <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> someone who was legal but didn't pay Social Security taxes, you're probably O.K., but only if you come clean and pay the back taxes." ...|$|R

6000|$|Margaret nodded. [...] "We {{know your}} sort. You are not, like our tourists, merchants and manufacturers. You have {{no use for}} business. All you think about is sport, and your sport's extravagant. You stop at our big hotels, {{and when you go}} off to hunt and fish <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> a gang of packers to carry your camp truck." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{they are}} not ornamental. The boat <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> up the river above Marlow is {{not the sort of}} boat in which you can flash about and give {{yourself}} airs. The hired up-river boat very soon puts a stop to any nonsense of that sort on the part of its occupants. That is its chief—one may say, its only recommendation.|$|E
6000|$|The officer {{smiled a}} little {{and went back to}} the rest. [...] "Two of you will ride after the other rascal," [...] he said. [...] "Now look here, my man; the first time my troopers, who'll call round quite frequently, don't find you about your homestead, you'll land {{yourself}} in a tolerably serious difficulty.

60|$|And {{now comes}} the most {{extraordinary}} {{part of the history}} of this Prince. When he had turned out those servants, of course he wanted others. What was his astonishment to find that in all his dominions, which contained no less than twenty-seven millions of people, there were not above five-and-twenty servants altogether! They were so lofty about it, too, that instead of discussing whether they should hire themselves as servants to Prince Bull, they turned things topsy-turvy, and considered whether as a favour they should hire Prince Bull to be their master! While they were arguing this point among themselves quite at their leisure, the wicked old red Fairy was incessantly going up and down, knocking at the doors of twelve of the oldest of the five-and-twenty, who were the oldest inhabitants in all that country, and whose united ages amounted to one thousand, saying, 'Will <b>YOU</b> <b>hire</b> Prince Bull for your master? - Will <b>YOU</b> <b>hire</b> Prince Bull for your master?' To which one answered, 'I will if next door will;' and another, 'I won't if over the way does;' and another, 'I can't if he, she, or they, might, could, would, or should.' And all this time Prince Bull's affairs were going to rack and ruin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that. It was my coming {{that made}} <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> her; and, now I think of it, I've {{a right to}} claim {{at least part of}} her, so she can come too, an' we'll lock up the house an' get Mr Green-grocer to look after it-- air it now and then. Come, just make up your minds. Only think, how {{beautiful}} the blue sea will be just now, an' the sunny skies, an' the yellow sands--I declare it makes me long to go. An' then you'll see that pretty boy you've taken such a fancy to--what's 'is name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} {{something}} in that. Of course we might, if he were arrested, allow him to turn Queen's evidence, but there is always a certain feeling against this class of witness. However, we needn't discuss that now. I suppose that we ought to allow {{an hour and a half}} or two hours to get to this place from Gravesend, but you can find that out when <b>you</b> <b>hire</b> the boat. Of course, it will depend a good deal on which way the tide is. By the way, you had better look to that at once; for if it is not somewhere near high tide when we get to Hole Haven there may not be water enough to row up the creek." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Gregoire," [...] Monsieur Flambard said, as they alighted, [...] "here {{are five}} louis for yourself. You had better {{drive back to}} the place where we changed horses, and put up there for the night. Tomorrow you can go quietly back to Bordeaux. Don't get there until late in the afternoon. Return the {{carriage}} and the other two horses to the stables where <b>you</b> <b>hired</b> them, and take my two horses back to our stables.|$|R
