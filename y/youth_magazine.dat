25|$|In 1946, Raymond Leblanc {{wanted to}} start a <b>youth</b> <b>magazine</b> to expand his small {{publishing}} house Lombard, and decided to use the already very popular Tintin as the main hero for Tintin magazine. It started in 1946 with a French and Dutch language version (the latter called Kuifje), as had become the custom for Belgian comics magazines. A version for France followed in 1948. The magazine immediately employed mainly Belgian artists, most coming from Bravo: Jacobs (who already had collaborated with Hergé), Laudy, and the young debutant Paul Cuvelier. It was an instant success, and soon other names joined, including Jacques Martin. To get the same success with the Flemish version (where Tintin was not so well known yet), two of the best new Flemish artists were contacted: Bob de Moor and Willy Vandersteen. De Moor stayed with Hergé and Tintin until the end of his life, but Vandersteen left the magazine again after 11 years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1930s, most Walloon youth {{magazines}} made room for one or more comics by local artists. Examples are Jijé in Le Croisé in 1936 and in Petits Belges in 1939, François Gianolla in Jeunesse Ouvrière, and Sirius in Le Patriote Illustré. Dupuis, a publisher based in Marcinelle near Charleroi, was already having success with its two family magazines Le Moustique and Bonnes Soirées. Charles Dupuis, son of the CEO, decided to start a <b>youth</b> <b>magazine</b> centred around a new hero, Spirou. It debuted on April 21, 1938. French artist Robert Velter, a former assistant of Martin Branner, was asked to create the title series, and the rest of the magazine was filled with popular American comics such as Superman. 8 months later, in an unusual move, the magazine was published in Dutch under the name Robbedoes. This would have a profound influence on the development of the Flemish comics and assured that Belgian comics would have a large part of their development in common. In 1939, Jijé joined the magazine. He worked there until his death in 1980, and was the driving force of the magazine during and directly after the war. He was responsible for its expansion and success in the next decades, and was as the inspirator for the later generation of comics artists in the 1940s and 1950s which is known as the Marcinelle school. Apart from Hergé, Jijé's main inspiration came from American artists such as Milton Caniff and Noel Sickles.|$|E

While the <b>youth</b> <b>magazines</b> of Averbode flowered and multiplied fared the adult magazineslike Averbode's Weekblad and La Semaine worse. Averbode's Weekblad {{disappeared}} in 1964 with a circulation of less than 10,000, and La Semaine ended four years later. These losses were compensated {{by the appearance of}} Zonnekind (1958), Doremi (first called Prutske, 1963), and Zonnestraal (1966).

This paper presents the findings of the qualitative element of this research, which examined British first year students' perceptions of the pro-smoking imagery found in the magazines and explored the relationship between this and their own smoking images and identities. The research found that: (a) this imagery was perceived to be, on the whole, attractive, sociable and reassuring; (b) that it supported young people's perceptions of smoking and reinforced their smoker identities; and (c) that it has the potential to be more powerful than advertising imagery.
