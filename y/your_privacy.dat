The question that arises on the ethical dilemmas since the licensing laws have not yet caught up with the rapid pace of technology. The salient ethical dimensions of e-therapy include competence, credentialing, informed consent, exceptions to confidentiality, as well as privacy and security limits (Corey, Corey, & Callanan, 2007). The informed consent (written and verbal) including the potential risks, consequences and benefits of telemedicine, or competence to practice, confidentiality, doing no harm, and on how terminations, interruption of service and payment arrangements need to be discussed. In addition, when using these technologies, it's important to conduct an initial assessment of each client to determine his or her appropriateness for telepsychology. Other factors to consider include making sure you have provided adequate emergency contact information in case your distance client faces a crisis, and ensuring that <b>your</b> patient's <b>privacy</b> and confidentiality are adequately protected by encrypting electronic transmissions and records. Furthermore the APA “Ethics Code applies to these activities across a variety of contexts, such as in person, postal, telephone, internet, and other electronic transmissions” (p. 1061).

40|$|To {{meet the}} needs of an increasing, heterogeneous, ageing {{population}} it is imperative to understand links between home and health. In Latvia, only limited research targeting the health and home situation of very old people is available. Consequently, the aim {{of this study was to}} describe how the home environment and aspects of health have changed over nine years between 2002 and 2011 for very old people in Latvia, living in their home environment. This study is based on the Latvian part of the cross-national European ENABLE-AGE Project comprising data on objective, as well as perceived, aspects of home and health. Longitudinal data from those involved on both data collection occasions (N = 59) was used. At the nine-year follow-up, participants were between 86 and 90 years of age, still living in their own homes. The results show that not only health aspects varied along the ageing process, objective and perceived aspects of home also changed. The physical as well as the cognitive and emotional bonding to the home significantly increased i. e. aspects of meaning such as familiarity and feeling safe in <b>your</b> home, <b>privacy</b> and independence became more important for the very old participants over time. Life satisfaction increased over the years even though objective health factors decreased. Since aspects of home as well as health can be assumed to impact on the outcome of ageing, the situation for this age group in Latvia must be further studied in order to develop suitable and appropriate social and health services, policies and living conditions...|$|R

40|$|This report {{looks at}} how Australians manage their {{personal}} data online. SummaryMost Australians have multiple digital identities, managing {{between five and}} 50 login and password combinations to conduct their day - to - day online activities, according to recent ACMA research. Half {{the participants in the}} research said they sometimes find it difficult to manage their online identities and passwords. While they are generally comfortable with providing details like their date of birth and phone numbers to government agencies, they resist providing personal data to other organisations and services. Some Australians respond to unwelcome demands for information by going elsew here. But a significant number (47 per cent) — and an even greater proportion of younger Australians — would provide inaccurate or misleading information about themselves to use a site, application or service. Australians also have three distinct online ‘identities’:>a ‘transactional identity’ — the minimum informatio n required to make a specific task work with an organisation or service such as a financial institution, insurance company, online retailer or government agency>a ‘social identity’ — developed on social networking services and including personal data shared across online communities>a ‘professional identity’ — locatable online with a positive image of their skills, experience or business offering. Most did not recognise the strategies they have adopted to manage their logins and passwords are risky, or they ar e simply not worried about it. But {{there are a number of}} strategies that can help Australians take control of their online identity management and enhance their security and privacy. These are: 1.

The referral On 12 December 2013, the Senate referred the following matter to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by 10 June 2014 : Comprehensive revision of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (the TIA Act), with regard to: a) {{the recommendations of the}} Australian Law Reform Commission For <b>Your</b> Information: Australian <b>Privacy</b> Law and Practice report, dated May 2008, particularly recommendation; and b) recommendations relating to the Act from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Inquiry into the potential reforms of Australia’s National Securit y Legislation report, dated May 2013. Overview The committee 2 ̆ 7 s inquiry has spanned 15 months.

40|$|Taking {{into account}} Australia 2 ̆ 7 s {{existing}} privacy laws, this paper asks whether a new statutory {{cause of action}} for privacy should be introduced and what elements a statutory cause of action might include. Community concern about the right to and protection of privacy is growing as new technologies change the way we interact with business, government, and each other.  Australians are increasingly {{connected to the internet}} at home and work.  Digital technologies are readily affordable and available. Online activity is growing and ways of communicating are more diverse.  Recording devices in phones are becoming standard.  These changes have significant advantages for Australian society, but they also pose commensurate risks to our privacy. Images, sounds and other information can easily be recorded, and just as easily can be uploaded to the internet, or distributed via email and instant messaging — sometimes without a person’s consent or without their knowledge. Social networking platforms allow extensive online networks to be created and maintained, for links and associations to be made, and for images and information to be widely shared. Once on the web it becomes increasingly difficult for an individual to control.  Privacy may be protected through a range of regulatory, administrative, educational, and legal mechanisms.  In Australia, the Commonwealth Privacy Act 19881, along with privacy and personal information legislation in most States and Territories, seeks to protect the personal and sensitive information of individuals, primarily by requiring that such information be collected and handled appropriately.  Laws relating to defamation, telecommunications, breach of confidence and trespass, amongst other things, also offer protection for aspects of the private lives of those resident in Australia.    In its 2008 Report, For <b>Your</b> Information: Australian <b>Privacy</b> Law and Practice, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) considered the range of privacy protections available in Australia and made a number of recommendations.  As part of that report, the ALRC recommended thatfederal legislation should provide for a statutory cause of action (a right to sue created by law) for serious invasions of the privacy of natural persons.  The New South Wales and Victorian Law Reform Commissions have also recommended similar causes of action.
