500|$|In {{addition}} to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students. Stone said of {{this aspect of the}} episode, [...] "The whole basis of South Park was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. Instead of what a lot of hippies and Democrats think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us. We believe the first way, that society controls you and makes <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> person, ultimately, because when you're little, you're just a little asshole." ...|$|E
2500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Frank Bruni {{questioned the}} existence of exclusive clubs on campuses that are meant to facilitate independence, writing: [...] " [...] should be cultivating the kind of sensibility that makes <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> citizen of a diverse and distressingly fractious society. How is that served by retreating into an exclusionary clique of people just like you?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Who Dey chant's {{first known}} use was by {{fans of the}} 1980 Cincinnati Bengals. While {{the origin of the}} chant is unsettled, one {{possible}} source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: [...] "Who's going to give <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!" [...] Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.|$|E

[...] Seifert said: “When I joined Miss Earth I became aware of the things I can do as a Filipino and as a citizen of the world. I would like to share this awareness with more people, whether on a personal level or through the media. I want to make a difference in every little way I can.” She nailed the competition with her answer.|$|E
2500|$|Members {{were drawn}} {{from all of the}} Protestant churches: from the Roman, Greek, Syrian and Armenian Catholic churches; from Theosophy, Christian Science and Spiritualism; and from many Oriental religions. [...] Cayce's {{philosophy}} was, if it makes <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> member of your church then it's good; if it takes you away from your church, it's bad. [...] The philosophy of the readings was that truth is one, each organization is part of this one, therefore the A.R.E. was not to function as a schism or in opposition to any religious organization. [...] The goal of the work was not something new but something ancient and universal.|$|E
2500|$|Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, [...] "As a kid I had {{to leave}} my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got {{divorced}} and my mother couldn't support herself. We lost everything overnight, so {{we came to the}} United States. For 10 years we lived in a one-bedroom apartment, and my mother worked 12 hours a day. It is not that these types of experiences make <b>you</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> person, but they give you a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world. Personally, I always know I'll be able to survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1883, Luther {{was sent}} to work as an intern for John Wanamaker in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. [...] Captain Pratt told Luther: “My boy, you are going away from us to work for this school. [...] Go and do your best. [...] The {{majority}} of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. [...] They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. [...] Now {{you are going to}} prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man. [...] If John Wanamaker gives you the job of blacking his shoes, see that you make them shine.

2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man.

[...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys on the way to work. At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E
