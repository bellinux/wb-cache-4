500|$|After TGS 2014, where Episode Duscae {{was first}} announced, Tabata {{and the team}} {{adjusted}} the gameplay experience based on fan feedback. The original plan was for a large area of the worldmap that players could explore using the car. While the ability to drive the party's car was originally included, it was later cut as Tabata feared that the feature would be too new for older fans of the series, who might have mistaken XV for [...] "a driving game". The team decided {{to focus on the}} characters and environment. The demo included English and Japanese audio for all regions. The demo released in all regions alongside the physical and digital releases of Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. The physical version was exclusive to day-one editions of Type-0 HD, while the digital version was valid for two months after purchase. The code had to be redeemed within one <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchase.</b> While players could save their progress in the demo, save data could not be carried over to the main game. Despite this, the team announced its intention to create a bonus for those who purchased the demo. A patch titled Episode Duscae 2.0 was released in June 2015, which included enhancements for the camera and controls, fixes for bugs, and adjustments to gameplay. The demo ran on Version 1.5 of Luminous Studio.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{strategies}} to access customer lifetime value (CLV). Traditionally, heuristics based on recency, frequency and monetary value variables (RFM) {{are used to}} determine the best customers. Here, some forms of directly exploring these parameters to predict CLV are compared to an approach based on fitting a stochastic model. The model employed is a composition of a model for the number of transactions along the residual lifetime and a model for the value spent. New evidence is raised on the effect of aggregating transactions monthly. The data analyzed refer to two <b>years</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchases</b> <b>of</b> a group of customers of the same entrance cohort of a fidelity program cadastre of a supermarkets network in Rio de Janeiro. Using the first year to calibrate and the second year to validate the models, good fit of both models to the series of individual data and coherent CLV predictions are obtained...|$|R

For example, a motor vehicle, which is 30% pooled, can be first granted a 60% initial allowance and 30% of annual allowance on the remaining 40% asset value.
