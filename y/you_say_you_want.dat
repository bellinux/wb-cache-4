The song begins with the lyrics [...] "I got a body full of liquor and a cocaine kicker", during the song [...] "a slew of f-bombs" [...] can be heard, and varied graphic descriptions such as: [...] "You got your legs {{up in the sky}} with the devil in your eyes / Let me hear <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> it all" [...] and the chorus [...] "You and me, baby, making love like gorillas!". Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor. On September 11, 2013, The Daily Telegraph reported that Dannielle Miller, co-founder of Enlighten Education, decided to appeal to mainstream radio in order to ban [...] "Gorilla", due to its sexual and violent lyrics towards women.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, as for that, I {{should have}} thought the new horse {{might have been able}} to carry you as far as that. I heard <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to see Mr. Crawley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. I don't ride behind {{anything}} but Vermont; never did. Touch of Morgan, of course; but you can't have much Morgan in a horse if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> speed. Hambletonian mostly. Where'd <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to get out?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Never bore them--and {{they are}} so easily bored! It bores them if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to be married. I {{think it would be}} sweet to be married, but you should never ask for a wedding. They give you {{everything}} else, but if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a wedding, they stamp their feet and go away. Why are you crying, girl? You should not cry; they don't like it. Put on your prettiest gown and laugh and pretend you are happy, and then they will tell you naughty stories and give you these." [...] She felt her ears and looked at her fingers, on which there may once have been jewels, but there were none now.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{you should}} be told that seven-league boots only take those prodigious steps when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to go a long distance. Otherwise they would be very inconvenient--when you only want to cross the room, for example. Perhaps {{this has not been}} {{explained}} to you by your governess? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{conclusion}} was, perhaps, {{not entirely}} logical, but Jack overlooked it, {{and handed the}} sum to his visitor. [...] "The old-woman business is about played out, Brown," [...] he added, by way of commentary; [...] "why don't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to buck agin' faro? You know you ain't married!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure he's got the parcel. I'll {{tell you}} what you might do. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> that Mr. Berkeley wired that he had left {{something}} here. He had Bertie's room, <b>you</b> know. <b>You</b> might <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to look for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} what it cost;--but there it is." [...] This she said, drawing off her glove and showing him her finger. [...] "And when I am dead, there it will be. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> money, Frank. May I {{not give it}} you? Are not we brother and sister?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The humour of this {{appeared}} {{to touch his}} father, who lay a little while taking it in. [...] "I'll do anything you like," [...] Mr. Touchett said at last; [...] "but I'm not sure it's right. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to put wind in her sails; but aren't you afraid of putting too much?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah,--that is so kind of you. There {{is nothing}} makes one so good as goodness;--nothing binds your friend to you so firmly as the {{acceptance}} from him of friendly actions. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me, because I have so sadly wanted you. When I go you will simply miss an almost daily trouble, but where shall I find a friend?' ...|$|E
60|$|SIR PETER. I dare <b>say</b> <b>you</b> must--certainly--when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to {{find out}} {{anything}} in a Hurry.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{absence of}} programme. Why don't <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do--give us {{some idea of}} how far {{you are going to}} carry your tenets? Are we to have the anarchy of Bolshevists or the {{socialism}} of Marx,--a red flag republic or a classical dictatorship?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In Spain [...] "tocar madera" [...] (literally: {{to touch}} wood) is {{something}} that <b>you</b> <b>say</b> when <b>you</b> <b>want</b> your luck or a good situation to continue.

6000|$|... "Of course, I {{remember}} your name, Mr. Hartington, {{with reference to}} the Abchester Bank failure. It seemed a particularly hard case, and I know our Mr. Wanklyn, who had charge of the winding up, took particular interest in it, and personally consulted me more than once about it, though I cannot exactly recall the circumstances now. What is it that <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to examine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|By way of {{an awful}} warning {{to you on}} this score, and also, as <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a true book about Red Indians, let me {{recommend}} to you the best book about them I ever came across. It is called [...] "A Narrative of the Captivity and Adventures of John Tanner, during Thirty Years' Residence among the Indians," [...] and it was published at New York by Messrs. Carvill, in 1830.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is bad. It {{is one of}} the houses,--but not the lowest. I can eat {{my heart}} out here, peaceably, and die with a great needle in my hand and a towel in my lap. But if I were to marry him I should kill myself the first hour after I had gone away with him. Things! What would things be with such a monster as that leaning over one? Would you marry him?" [...] In answer to this, Lucy made no {{immediate}} reply. [...] "Why don't <b>you</b> <b>say?</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> me to marry him. Would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you leave}} off a Poll Parroting, I ask you?' cried Mr Riderhood, half beside himself between the two. Then, propitiatingly and crawlingly: 'You sir! You han't said what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> of me. Is it fair, is it worthy of yourself, {{to talk of}} my defying <b>you</b> afore ever <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> of me?' ...|$|R
60|$|My {{works are}} well known. I am {{a young man}} in the Art line.

Don't be too sure about that. Stop a bit.|$|R
50|$|Word order {{can change}} to clarify words {{that can be}} nouns or verbs. For example, 'akimat' means 'old woman', or, 'to drink'. If <b>you</b> <b>say</b> 'acamit ayoŋ akimat' <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> the old woman rather than <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to drink, so {{in this case the}} infinitive is rather oddly {{replaced}} by the vocative, thus 'acamit ayoŋ tomat' to avoid confusion when you need a drink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't attack it!" [...] implored Miss Vane. [...] "You don't {{know what}} a blessing it is. Then, the man-body never complains, and I can't see that he expects {{anything}} more in an order than the clear understanding of it. He doesn't {{expect it to be}} accounted for in any way; the fact that <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a thing is enough. It is very strange. Then the moral support of the presence of a man-body is enormous. I now know that I have never slept soundly since I have kept house alone--that I have never passed a night without hearing burglars or smelling fire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember, {{the meaning}} of {{marriage}} to me is not to get a man's money to spend. I want the man. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> ME. And suppose I consented, but gave you only one-hundredth part of me. Suppose {{there was something else}} in my life that took the other ninety-nine parts, and, furthermore, that ruined my figure, that put pouches under my eyes and crows-feet in the corners, that made me unbeautiful to look upon and that made my spirit unbeautiful. Would you be satisfied with that one-hundredth part of me? Yet that is all you are offering me of yourself. Do you wonder that I won't marry you?--that I can't?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; I carried dem in a bundle. Dis bag has got linen, and boots, and oder tings for you, sah. What I tink am de {{best way}} dis. Dar am a train pass trou here {{at two o'clock}} and stop at dis station. Some people always get out. Dar is an hotel just {{opposite}} the station, and some of de passengers most always go there. I thought de best way for you would be to go outside the station.

30|$|CD-Diffuseness dimension. Eleven out {{of twelve}} of the {{participants}} {{agreed or strongly agreed}} that “the G.S.T. lets <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> reasonably brief”. There was one participant against it and the reason was “too many words”. Too much information will undermine the effectiveness of the graphical presentation, while too little information will make it difficult to understand. Future work should focus on identifying an appropriate level of abstraction of the G.S.T.|$|R
6000|$|... “Let us two {{meet him}} accidentally {{at the street}} corner to-morrow,” said Eleanor; “we can walk a little way with him, and with luck {{we ought to be}} able to side-track him into the shop. <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get a hair-net or something. When we’re safely there I can say: ‘I wish you’d tell me what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> for your birthday.’ Then you’ll have {{everything}} ready to hand—the rich cousin, the fur department, and the topic of birthday presents.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "and there ends your {{absorption}} of the talents. That is what I complain of your cosmopolitanism. When <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> all peoples to unite, you really {{mean that you}} want all peoples to unite to learn the tricks of your people. If the Bedouin Arab {{does not know how}} to read, some English missionary or schoolmaster must be sent to teach him to read, but no one ever says, 'This schoolmaster does not know how to ride on a camel; let us pay a Bedouin to teach him.' You say your civilisation will include all talents. Will it? Do you really mean to say that at the moment when the Esquimaux has learnt to vote for a County Council, you will have learnt to spear a walrus? I recur to the example I gave. In Nicaragua we had a way of catching wild horses--by lassooing the fore feet--which {{was supposed to be the}} best in South America. If you are going to include all the talents, go and do it. If not, permit me to say what I have always said, that something went from the world when Nicaragua was civilised." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so there}} IS a whale on the {{premises}} for all you know," [...] asseverated Smith, striking the table with passion. [...] "I bet you've never examined the premises! I bet you've never been round at the back as I was this morning-- for I found the very thing you say could only grow on a tree. There's an old sort of square tent up against the dustbin; it's got three holes in the canvas, and a pole's broken, so it's not much good as a tent, but as a Canopy--" [...] And his voice quite failed him to express its shining adequacy; {{then he went on}} with controversial eagerness: [...] "You see I take every challenge as you make it. I believe every blessed thing you say couldn't be here has been here all the time. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> a whale washed up for oil. Why, there's oil in that cruet-stand at your elbow; and I don't believe anybody has touched it or thought of it for years. And as for your gold crown, we're none of us wealthy here, but we could collect enough ten-shilling bits from our own pockets to string round a man's head for half an hour; or one of Miss Hunt's gold bangles is nearly big enough to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|You ask for items, {{details of}} my early life--of {{genealogy}} and parentage, particularly {{of the women}} of my ancestry, and of its far-back Netherlands stock on the maternal side--of the region where I was born and raised, {{and my mother and}} father before me, and theirs before them--with a word about Brooklyn and New York cities, the times I lived there as lad and young man. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to get at these details mainly as the go-befores and embryons of [...] "Leaves of Grass." [...] Very good; you shall have at least some specimens of them all. I have often thought of the meaning of such things--that one can only encompass and complete matters of that kind by 'exploring behind, perhaps very far behind, themselves directly, and so into their genesis, antecedents, and cumulative stages. Then as luck would have it, I lately whiled away the tedium of a week's half-sickness and confinement, by collating these very items for another (yet unfulfilled, probably abandon'd,) purpose; and if you will be satisfied with them, authentic in date-occurrence and fact simply, and told my own way, garrulous-like, here they are. I shall not hesitate to make extracts, for I catch at anything to save labor; but those will be the best versions of what I want to convey.|$|E
