5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned for}} the fourth series of The Sarah Jane Adventures, it would have seen many {{children}} avoiding a strange street next to Bannerman Road, called Sally Lane, after hearing an urban legand which states if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street, she will eat you alive. Sarah Jane and the gang investigate, and find a twelve-year-old girl, who was trapped in the street for years by an evil spirit, called the 'Trickster's Triangle'.|$|E
25|$|The first ostensive {{goal of a}} BMX racer is {{to become}} the number one amateur racer in your district. The racer's home state/province maybe divided up into several Districts {{depending}} how many participants and how spread out they are over the state/province. A balance is sought. Too many people in a single district could discourage new, inexperienced riders from having {{a sense of accomplishment}} if they are doing reasonably well but not advancing his point score up the list of total points in relation to other racers. Too small a district would cheapen any sense of accomplishment due to paucity of racers, producing an artificially high ranking for the following season for the racer(s) in the points race. Points determine how well you do in the district rankings. How high <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rankings depends on what skill level category you are in as well as how well you do in your particular races since it affects how many points you win, which adds to your total for your district ranking. The higher your skill level, the more points you will gather at any given race (providing that you have qualified for the Main).|$|E
2500|$|Familiar {{to viewers}} was Jim Rockford's gold Pontiac Firebird Esprit car. One oft-recurring {{element of the}} show was the famous [...] "Jim Rockford turn-around" [...] (also known as a J-turn or a [...] "moonshiner's turn" [...] - {{commonly}} employed as an evasive driving technique taught to Secret Service). [...] Garner explained the move in his 2011 autobiography The Garner Files: [...] "When you are going straight in reverse about 35 miles an hour, you come off the gas pedal, go hard left, and pull on the emergency brake. [...] That locks the wheels and throws the front end around. [...] Then you release everything, hit the gas, and off <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction." [...] James Garner stated in a Season One DVD interview that he performed this stunt {{for the duration of}} the series. The car's license plate was 853 OKG, although the plate in some early episodes displayed the number 835 OKG. Garner writes in his autobiography that he believes that the letters OKG stood for [...] "Oklahoma Garner" [...] but that he does not know the origin of the numbers 853.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bear thy punishment, thou fool," [...] {{said the}} Talisman. [...] "Know {{that the king}} will by-and-by pardon thee and will let <b>thee</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{meantime}} bear thy punishment; perhaps it will cure thee of thy folly. Only do not call upon Zadok, the King of <b>the</b> Demons, <b>in</b> this thy trouble." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I've spent {{shall we}} say {{about a third of}} my life <b>in</b> semi-darkness. <b>The</b> face now. <b>You</b> <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning and it was very very low. Some seams here were just about two feet. Well, you were on your knees or {{sometimes}} lying on your back or sideways, and you were jolly glad to get your legs stretched a bit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{which would}} you rather do," [...] asked Mr. George, [...] "go {{in the morning or}} in the evening? If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning coach, you will have to set out very early, before it is light, and then stay at Civita Vecchia, in a strange hotel, alone, all night. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, you can remain here, where you are acquainted, all day; but then you will have to ride alone in the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|MILLIKEN.--When you are gone, Julia! Why are you going? Why {{should you}} go, my love--that is--why need <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> devil's name? ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, wise {{resolutions of}} the quiet night, whither do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garish light of day? To heaven, perhaps, with the mist wreaths and the dew drops.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you must," [...] I said. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spirit {{the greater}} need for <b>you</b> to <b>go</b> there <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flesh. <b>Go</b> to your sister's room once more, {{and see the}} window--I nearly fell out of it myself. It's--it's awfully low and dangerous. That would {{convince}} you," [...] I pleaded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they {{advertise}} it for to-morrow, too," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "so <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon {{when we are}} at the offices." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had <b>you</b> <b>gone</b> on, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular line of promotion, my dear sir," [...] pithily inquired Captain Truck, [...] "to what preferment {{would you}} have risen by this time?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A pretty safe {{adventure}} for YOU," [...] {{said the}} girl scornfully. [...] "YOU didn’t risk much. Look here, I like brave men. If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cage and undo that bear, I’ll marry you. That’s what I call an adventure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can’t see {{properly}} here," [...] murmured the lady, [...] "but {{it looks}} very large. S’pose <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other bunk, Jemmy. It’s a good bit higher than this, and you’d get more air and be more comfortable altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{do you see}} in Vagg Hollow, Little boy, when <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{morning at}} five on your lonely drive?" [...] "--I see men's souls, who follow Till we've passed where the road lies low, When they vanish at our creaking! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> canoe, and the Oswego {{has been}} cleared of its flood-wood by the troops. It will be {{floating}} down stream, and that, too, with a swift current." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely," [...] {{said the}} Languid Youth; [...] "but I would rather stay outside and let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> corner. <b>The</b> {{performance}} <b>in</b> that way {{will be more}} interesting to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Mr. Forster,” he said, “I have {{selected}} <b>you</b> to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prize. <b>You</b> can {{take one of}} the juniors with you; I cannot spare either of the seniors. Who would you like to take?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first boat, monsieur, {{with the}} ladies," [...] the captain said. [...] "The sooner you are ashore the better. There is no saying whether {{we may not}} be {{disturbed}} and obliged to run out to sea again at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sahib, if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> baggage train {{you might}} be miles away, and see nothing of it. Now, {{it seems to me}} that it would be almost as easy for you to go as a soldier in the regiment, as in the {{transport}} train." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That I could promise you, if {{you will}} give back the bag, though I know not how far my word may avail. But your words are vain, for you cannot {{think that we will}} be so fond as to let <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hope that you return?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah if <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for <b>the</b> public's knowing {{differences}} you're far too particular," [...] Nick laughed. [...] "D'où tombez-vous? as you affected French people say. If you've {{anything at}} stake on {{that you had}} simply better not play." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> for <b>the</b> {{principle}} of Reform, {{you must be}} prepared to take what the situation offers," [...] said Will. [...] "If everybody pulled for his own bit against everybody else, the whole question would go to tatters." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Miller's {{wandering}} eyes attached themselves, {{with a sort}} of appealing air, to Daisy, who, however, strolled a {{few steps}} farther, gently humming to herself. [...] "I presume <b>you</b> will <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cars," [...] said her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, ev'r'body {{knows that}} the deeper <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea, the more the water presses agin you," [...] he explained. [...] "Even the divers in their steel jackets can't stand it very deep down. An' here we be, miles from the top o' the water, I s'pect, an' we don't feel crowded a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can do it}} in two days. It'll take me a--week. Tank up, friend Goodall--have all the fun you can; then--off <b>you</b> <b>go,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of}} a jag, and s-s-save trouble and expense. I'm a s-son of a gun if this ain't a health resort--for your whiskers! A Lake Erie fog'd get lost here in two minutes." ...|$|E
60|$|Wherever <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{wilderness}} {{you find}} Meeko ahead of you, {{and all the}} best camping grounds preempted by him. Even on the islands he seems to own the prettiest spots, and disputes mightily your right to stay there; though he is generally glad enough of your company to share his loneliness, and shows it plainly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} {{is regarded as}} one of London's most beautiful churches.

60|$|Harry. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> world! (Boastful.) There's {{hardly a}} place <b>you</b> can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world where <b>you</b> wouldn't find {{somebody}} that did care for Harry Hagberd. (Pause.) I'm {{not of the}} sort that go about skulking under false names.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim's right," [...] the {{man behind}} the bar agreed. [...] "He's a very nasty customer, Bill the Tanner, sir. If he's coming down, I'd clear out for a moment. <b>You</b> can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guvnor's sitting-room, if you like." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indecorous!" [...] he cried, {{and pushed}} back {{his chair and}} rose. [...] "What's indecorous about it? To leave you here alone in a hotel in New York would not only be indecorous, but senseless. How long would you put it off? a week--a month--a year? Where would <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> meantime, {{and what would you}} do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nine, to-morrow morning? Yes, yes--your trap is laid for {{me before}} I {{can get my}} {{passport}} regulated and leave London. It is not earlier, I suppose? We will see about that presently--I can keep you hostage here, and bargain with you to send for your letter before I let <b>you</b> <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> meantime, be so good next as to mention your terms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Saint Leonard of Winchelsea," [...] he cried, [...] "I will rub my side {{up against}} her yet! Out with the skiff, lads, and two of you to the oars. Make fast the line to the mast, Will. Do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat, Hugh, and I'll make the second. Now if we bend our backs to it we may have them yet ere night cover them." ...|$|E

30|$|<b>You</b> just <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day of {{the game}} and they say get your jersey and get your shorts. I like this. Yeah ’cause I don’t want other people saying “Oh look she’s an XL” ’cause that feels kind of uncomfortable.|$|R
