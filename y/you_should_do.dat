5|$|Sire, be not grieved nor greatly distressed {{because of}} what has befallen us. It is not on things of wood that the issue hangs for us, but on men and horses...If then you so desire, let us {{straightway}} attack the Peloponnese, or if it pleases you to wait, that also we can do...It is best then that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> as I have said, {{but if you have}} resolved to lead your army away, even then I have another plan. Do not, O king, make the Persians the laughing-stock of the Greeks, for if you have suffered harm, it is by no fault of the Persians. Nor can you say that we have anywhere done less than brave men should, and if Phoenicians and Egyptians and Cyprians and Cilicians have so done, it is not the Persians who have any part in this disaster. Therefore, since the Persians are in no way to blame, be guided by me; if you are resolved not to remain, march homewards with the greater part of your army. It is for me, however, to enslave and deliver Hellas to you with three hundred thousand of your host whom I will choose.|$|E

25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

500|$|The PlayStation 3 version's {{critical}} review scores suffered {{because of the}} technical issues first uncovered by 1UP.com. While discussing the retail version on a podcast, 1UP.com staff members agreed {{that a significant number}} of the frame rate problems had been resolved, but not all of them. They concluded that the PlayStation 3 version was not quite as smooth as the Xbox 360 version and recommended that [...] "if you own both , <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> the 360" [...] version. Kotaku's Michael McWhertor echoed that recommendation, though stated that those who only have a PlayStation 3 should still consider The Orange Box.|$|E
500|$|In a {{cover story}} for Entertainment Weekly, Mars stated that the song [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] was {{rejected}} by a [...] "music industry decision-maker" [...] (a person he won't name) because of his race.

[...] "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room." [...] In April 2013, in {{a cover story}} for GQ magazine, Mars confessed that he changed his surname because people in the music industry took him as another Latino artist, and even tried to convince him to sing in Spanish saying: [...] "Your last name's Hernandez, maybe <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> the Latin music, this Spanish music... Enrique [...] is so hot right now”. Nevertheless, Mars used his childhood nickname Bruno and changed his surname to Mars, in an effort to [...] "avoid being stereotyped".|$|E

500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and doing {{something}} else, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it just seems to be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them quietly, as if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which is kind of like an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
2500|$|A twenty-sixth episode, Going Too Far, was {{deliberately}} created {{to be too}} violent and obscene for broadcast in Japan and was instead included as a DVD bonus.

The film also showed Ronstadt performing the songs [...] "Poor, Poor Pitiful Me", [...] "Love Me Tender", and [...] "Tumbling Dice". Ronstadt was persuaded to record [...] "Tumbling Dice" [...] after Mick Jagger came backstage {{when she was at}} a concert and said, [...] "You do too many ballads, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> more rock and roll songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Carranza {{described}} the recording process for The Bedlam in Goliath stating {{that no more}} than three takes an hour were recorded, as a way to soak in what was recorded and to hear the differences, which in turn improved the general mood and atmosphere of the album's creation. Elaborating on the method, Carranza stated that [...] "when van Gogh was around he wasn't just painting, painting, painting. I'm sure he took a step back once in a while. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> the same when you're recording." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, the Sports Authority of Thailand banned competitions. It {{has been}} speculated that the Muay Thai {{industry}} played {{a factor in the}} Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT)'s final decision, as MMA could potentially take away business from Muay Thai, from fighters to profit. SAT Deputy Governor Sakol Wannapong has said [...] "Organizing a MMA event here would hurt the image of Muay Thai, {{if you want to do}} this kind of business, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it in another country.

2500|$|Another {{facet of}} the faith was the {{structure}} of the church. It was very common – as it is today – for a church to have a leader. Ignatius wrote several letters to several churches instructing them to let the leaders (usually the bishops) handle all the problems within the church. [...] He exhorted Church members to listen to the bishops as they were the leaders: [...] "Be subject to the Bishop as to the commandment…We are clearly obligated to look upon the bishop as the Lord himself… <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> nothing apart from the bishop".|$|E

2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never tell you what <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, {{in so far as}} a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Tijerina was first {{encouraged}} to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch. As Tijerina recalls, [...] "He {{said to my}} face, 'I don't like preachers, they {{take advantage of the}} people. What I think <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> is quit talking religion. What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that … you should study law and history and help your people.'" [...] In June 1956, Tijerina and a few bravos went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. [...] There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. [...] Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. [...] The next day, they took Tijerina's group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.|$|E
2500|$|The twenty-sixth episode, [...] "Going Too Far", never {{aired in}} Excel Sagas {{original}} run on TV Tokyo {{because it was}} purposefully too violent, obscene, and exactly one minute too long for broadcast in Japan. One network that did broadcast this episode, however, was Animax in Latin America. The opening sequence is altered to contain pixelated nudity and more blood, and the closing presents the translator on fours, wearing a collar, and singing the [...] "Bolero", as Menchi translates into her own language. The episode itself, in addition to much more violence, blood, and gore, includes situations containing nudity, lesbianism, apparent paedophilia, soaplands, and a love hotel—in several instances involving minors. The episode obliquely refers to the 1995 sarin gas attack on a Tokyo subway by including sarin attacks {{as a method of}} exterminating enemies. The director himself remarks that it [...] "felt good to go past the limits of a TV series", although he thinks it [...] "is not something that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>do</b> too often".|$|E
