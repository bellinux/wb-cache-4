25|$|Annie Get <b>Your</b> <b>Gun</b> premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on May 16, 1946 {{and ran for}} 1,147 performances.

25|$|In August 1945, {{while in}} the {{hospital}} recovering from the Caesarean birth of her second child, Merman was visited by Dorothy Fields, who proposed she star as Annie Oakley in a musical her brother Herbert and she were writing with Jerome Kern. Merman accepted, but in November, Kern suffered a stroke while in New York City visiting Rodgers and Hammerstein (the producers of the show) and died a few days later. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II invited Irving Berlin to replace him, {{and the result was}} Annie Get <b>Your</b> <b>Gun,</b> which opened on May 16, 1946, at the Imperial Theatre, where it ran for nearly three years and 1,147 performances. During that time, Merman took only two vacations and missed only two performances because of illness. Merman lost the film version to Judy Garland, who eventually was replaced by Betty Hutton, but she did star in a Broadway revival two decades later at Lincoln Center with Bruce Yarnell, who was 27 years Merman's junior, cast as Annie Oakley's loyal husband and manager, Frank E.

500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, [...] film soundtracks were often bootlegged; if the officially {{released}} soundtrack had been re-recorded with a house orchestra, {{there would be}} demand for the original audio recording taken directly from the film. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland performing Annie Get <b>Your</b> <b>Gun,</b> before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production, but after a full soundtrack had been recorded. The Recording Industry Association of America took {{a dim view of}} unauthorised releases and attempted several raids on production. The Wagern-Nichols Home Recordist Guild recorded numerous performances at the Metropolitan Opera House, and openly sold them without paying royalties to the writers and performers. The company was sued by the American Broadcasting Company and Columbia Records (who held the official rights to the recordings), who managed to obtain a court injunction against producing the record.|$|E

The other five are [...] "You Can't Stop the Beat" [...] from the musical Hairspray and [...] "We Got the Beat" [...] by The Go-Gos, both performed by New Directions; [...] "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead" [...] from the film The Wizard of Oz (as performed by Barbra Streisand and Harold Arlen from Streisand's Duets album), sung by Michele and Colfer; the Tom Jones song [...] "It's Not Unusual" [...] featuring Criss; and [...] "Big Spender" [...] from the musical Sweet Charity, performed by Lengies. All songs, except for [...] "Big Spender," [...] were released as singles, available for digital download.|$|E
500|$|She next {{starred in}} the musical {{adaptation}} of Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl with music by Marvin Hamlisch (1993). Peters won her second Tony for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as Annie Oakley in the 1999 Broadway revival of Annie Get <b>Your</b> <b>Gun.</b> Among many glowing notices, critic Lloyd Rose of the Washington Post commented: [...] " [...] banishes all thoughts of Ethel Merman about two bars into her first number, 'Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.' Partly this is because Merman's Annie was a hearty, boisterous gal, while Peters plays an adorable, slightly goofy gamine. ... For anyone {{who cares about the}} American musical theater, the chance to see Peters in this role is reason enough to see the show." [...] Playbill went even further: [...] "Arguably the most talented comedienne in the musical theatre today, Peters manages to extract a laugh from most every line she delivers." ...|$|E
