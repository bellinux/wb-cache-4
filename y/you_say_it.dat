And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it.</b> Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "Some of {{the waste}} is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no {{economical}} reason why you would ever think of pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the end of}} {{his stay}} in Saint-Rémy and the days ahead in Auvers-sur-Oise neared, Van Gogh {{conveyed}} his optimism and enthusiasm by painting flowers. [...] About the time that Van Gogh painted this work, he wrote to his mother, [...] "But for one's health, as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing." [...] To his sister Wil he wrote, [...] "The last days in Saint-Rémy I worked like a madman. Great bouquets of flowers, violet-colored irises, great bouquets of roses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Consulting {{producer}} for A Nero Wolfe Mystery, Doyle was the show's only full-time writer — overseeing {{the work of}} freelance screenwriters and writing 11 of the teleplays herself. She devoted most of {{her attention to the}} dialogue: [...] "What Stout writes actually sounds good when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> out loud, but the stuff that makes you laugh out loud and fall {{on the floor in the}} books doesn't work most of the time when you transpose it directly into actors' mouths. Frequently I end up moving words — tenderly and respectfully — but retaining as much of the language as possible. I feel a great belief in Rex Stout. I see the script process as writing his second draft." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, Cardinal Nicolás de Jesús López Rodríguez {{referred}} to President Obama's nominee for Dominican Republic's ambassador (Wally Brewster) by the anti-gay slur maricón. In 2011 a Catholic bishop in Peru, Luis Bambarén, {{was forced to}} apologize for using the same word in commenting, when answering journalists' questions on plans to legalise same-sex marriage, on the use in Spanish of the English word [...] "gay": [...] "I {{do not know why}} we talk about Gays. Let's speak in Creole or Castilian: They're faggots. That's how <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it,</b> right?" [...] He later apologized, saying: [...] "It is an offensive word, and [...] deserve respect." [...] However, in December 2015 Rodríguez again insulted Brewster who he said was abusing his role by speaking out against corruption: [...] "That man needs {{to go back to his}} embassy. Let him focus on housework, since he's the wife to a man." [...] The remark received criticism from the US State Department, and Senator, Dick Durbin asked Pope Francis to intervene and reprimand Rodriguez.|$|E

2500|$|However, the film's director, Takashi Yamazaki, {{rejected}} {{these interpretations}} of the film, saying, [...] "The film depicts the war as a complete tragedy, so how can <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> glorifies war?... I really don't get it." [...] He eventually dismissed such criticism, saying that [...] "In the end, people see {{what they want to}} see. If you think from the start that 'this movie glorifies war' you're going to see it as a movie that glorifies war, no matter what." [...] Similarly, the author of the original book, Naoki Hyakuta, disagreed with this line of criticism, stating in a tweet that [...] "In my book Eternal Zero, I opposed suicide attacks with determination", [...] "I have never ever viewed wars in a positive light", and the theme of the book was [...] "not to allow our memories of war to fade away". The author also added in a tweet, [...] "I feel sorry for Eternal Zero. [...] On one side of the political spectrum, Japanese right-wing nationalists claimed the book was plagiarized and were indignant about its criticism of high-ranking Japanese government officials, while on the opposite [...] side, left-wingers criticized it as a glorification of war, Hayao Miyazaki rebukes it for fabrication [...] It is drawing fire literally from all directions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Godard became {{interested}} in 3D because [...] "it is still an area {{where there are no}} rules" [...] and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, [...] "reveal something cultural", such as what it [...] "mean about the times it emerged from" [...] and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as CinemaScope, dolly shots, close-ups or high fidelity are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by Auguste and Louis Lumière and D. W. Griffith, who made films before there were [...] "rules" [...] about technique, stating [...] "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." [...] His inspiration came from the invention of perspective in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something [...] "beyond the frame." [...] Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples. Godard was following Alfred Hitchcock's theory that [...] "when you want something to be understood, <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> at least twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|H. P. Lovecraft {{held the}} book in very high regard (though {{he did not say}} whether it {{influenced}} any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz Leiber [...] "no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon's Last and First Men ... Probably you have read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!", and in another 1936 letter to Leiber [...] "I'm glad to hear of your perusal of Last and First Men—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate [...] "scientifiction". Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity." [...] Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner he said [...] "I don't care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There's no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of H. G. Wells's novels, S. Fowler Wright's The World Below, & that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, Last & First Men." ...|$|E
