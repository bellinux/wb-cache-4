5|$|Level Mountain has {{experienced}} volcanic eruptions sporadically {{for the last}} 15 million years, making it the most persistent volcano of the NCVP. More than 20 eruptive centres are present on the summit and flanks of the massif. These have produced mainly felsic and mafic lavas, a chemical composition range typical of bimodal volcanism. Such volcanism commonly occurs at hotspots, continental rifts and leaky transform faults. The existence of olivine, orthopyroxene and spinel xenocrysts in Level Mountain basalt suggest that volcanism at the massif originated from the upper mantle. Hiatuses of up to a million <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> can be expected between periods of volcanic activity at Level Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod {{are very}} long-lived, which is {{characteristic}} of many freshwater native fish in Australia. Longevity is a survival strategy in variable Australian environment to ensure that most adults participate {{in at least one}} exceptional spawning and recruitment event, which are often linked to unusually wet La Niña years and may only occur every one or two decades. Murray cod are the most long-lived freshwater native fish in Australia. The oldest Murray cod aged yet was 48 years of age, and the even larger specimens of years past leave little doubt that the species can reach considerably greater ages, of 70 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more)</b> has been performed on its consequences. Good results {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched. In its natural environment, it has a maximum lifespan of perhaps 50 <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> and the average lifespan is 20–30 years. The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years old or more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The age of a bog turtle is determined by {{counting the number of}} rings in a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after that. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin to swarm. A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E

5|$|If {{the office}} of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less {{remaining}} in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election. The candidate with the majority of the votes in the special election is declared mayor. If no candidate receives a majority, a special run-off must be held between the two candidates with the highest number of votes. While the mayor's office is vacant pending a special election, the president of the city council serves as the interim mayor, with limited powers, until a new mayor is elected. If for any reason a Mayor serves a partial term of two <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> it will count as one full term.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|In another hundred <b>years</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> {{two groups}} arrived and settled the upper San River basin (270–170 BC) and the Kraków area respectively. This last one, {{together}} with the local population developing at about that time the Przeworsk culture characteristics (see the next section), formed the mixed Tyniec group, in existence 270–30 BC. The rise of the Tyniec group took place in particular about 80–70 BC, when the existing settlements received Celtic reinforcements from the more southern populations being displaced from Slovakia by the Dacians. In the 1st century BC another small group settled probably much further north, in Kujawy. And finally there was the long-lasting (270 BC - 170 AD) mixed Púchov culture, associated based on Roman sources with the Celtic Cotini, whose northern reaches included parts of the Beskids mountain range and even the Kraków area.|$|E
