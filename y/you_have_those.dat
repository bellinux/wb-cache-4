500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're doing a lot of fast moving around or high up on the neck. It's a pain in the ass, but I really like that sound. I don't think I would ever go to a 7-string." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to the fact I was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E

60|$|On the {{one hand}} it has been {{suggested}} that there should be, as is the system adopted by the French Academy, a permanent professor at Rome to look after the students; on the other hand it has been said that it is not desirable, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> traveling studentships, that the students should go to Rome, that it is better for them to travel, and to go to Venice or Lombardy, and to have no fixed school in connection with the Academy at Rome.

About two years since there was, in our or some other city, a famous doctor, into whose consulting-room crowds came daily, so that they might be healed. Now this doctor had a suspicion that there was something vitally wrong with himself, and he went to consult another famous physician at Dublin, or it may be at Edinburgh.
