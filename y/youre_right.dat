60|$|TARLETON. <b>Youre</b> <b>right,</b> Chickabiddy. What do I tell Johnny when he brags about Tarleton's Underwear? It's not the {{underwear}}. The underwear be hanged! Anybody {{can make}} underwear. Anybody can sell underwear. Tarleton's Ideas: thats whats done it. Ive {{often thought of}} putting that up over the shop.|$|E
60|$|BURGE-LUBIN [grasping {{the idea}} at last] By George, Confucius, <b>youre</b> <b>right!</b> I {{never thought of}} that. That {{explains}} everything. We are {{just a lot of}} schoolboys: theres no denying it. Talk to an Englishman about anything serious, and he listens to you curiously for a moment just as he listens to a chap playing classical music. Then he goes back to his marine golf, or motoring, or flying, or women, just like a bit of stretched elastic when you let it go. [Soaring to the height of his theme] Oh, youre quite right. We are only in our infancy. I ought to be in a perambulator, with a nurse shoving me along. It's true: it's absolutely true. But some day we'll grow up; and then, by Jingo, we'll shew em.|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. <b>Youre</b> quite <b>right.</b> Ive {{often said}} so. All the same, it does matter; for I want to cry. [He buries {{his face in}} his arms on the work-table and sobs].|$|R
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Oh, <b>youre</b> quite <b>right,</b> dear: quite right. It's a {{great thing}} to have brains: look what it's done for your father! Thats the reason I never said a word when you jilted poor Jerry Mackintosh.|$|R
60|$|TARLETON. <b>Youre</b> quite <b>right,</b> Miss Lina: {{you must}} stand by. I could have tackled him this morning; {{but since you}} put me through those {{exercises}} I'd rather die than even shake hands with a man, much less fight him.|$|R
5000|$|... "From Here to Eternity", [...] "First Hand Experience in Second Hand Love" [...] and [...] "Im Left, <b>Youre</b> <b>Right,</b> Shes Gone" [...] {{were all}} {{featured}} in the popular video game Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories on the fictional radio station Flashback FM. Songs from some of Giorgio Moroders other albums were also featured. In 2012 Giorgio Moroder remixed From Here To Eternity to be played at the Luis Vuitton fashion show.|$|E
5000|$|... "Whats startling {{to me is}} {{that when}} I started talking about ideas like these 30 years ago, they were so new and strange that people {{looked at me as if}} I had two heads. In retrospect, I think I was looked on as {{something}} of a cultural clown - a [...] "crazy" [...] who was fun to listen to. The reaction I get now worries me a lot more, because what most people say is [...] "Bob, today <b>youre</b> <b>right,</b> but were not going to do anything about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "We {{have got}} {{a bit of a}} reputation. I had a {{conversation}} with Noel Gallagherat a party once and said to him, Im in a band but its the most uncool band in the world - Marillion. He went, Yeah, <b>youre</b> <b>right.</b> Deadpan! Not even smiling." [...] â€”Keyboardist Mark Kelly The chief music critic of The Guardian, Alexis Petridis, has described Marillion as [...] "perennially unfashionable prog-rockers". On the subject of joining the band in 1989, Steve Hogarth said in a 2001 interview: [...] "At about the same time, Matt Johnson of The The asked me to play piano on his tour. I always say I had to make a choice between the most hip band in the world, and the least." [...] In the same conversation, he claimed: [...] "Were just tired of the opinions of people who havent heard anything weve done in ten years. A lot of whats spread about this band is laughable." ...|$|E

60|$|EDITH [petting him] Come, come! dont make a scene, dear. <b>Youre</b> quite <b>right.</b> I dont think a woman doing {{public work}} {{ought to get}} married unless her husband feels about it as she does. I dont blame you at all for {{throwing}} me over.|$|R
5000|$|Under the new {{editor in}} chief, the {{publication}} took on some drastic changes, including; making {{it into a}} biweekly publication, colorizing every page and making them glossy and removing the popular [...] "Im <b>Right,</b> <b>Youre</b> Wrong" [...] section and personals.|$|R
5000|$|San Francisco Weekly {{reviewed}} the album on May 28, 1997, where Curtis Bonney stated [...] "Exactly 20 {{years after the}} first Cheap Trick Cheap Trick, here it is, the heavily hyped, re-self-titled re-debut. Breathe easy. Its neither [...] "critically important" [...] nor Bryan Adams-abhorrent. Indeed, its vintage Cheap Trick (as the ads tell us), and since their confection has always been a product more than a process, the complainers can just go ahead and leave the arena. And unlike Dream Police - or any album thereafter - the standout tracks are fairly plentiful (bearing in mind all the relativity): The sugary Beatles-John Lennon - uh - stylings on [...] "Carnival Game," [...] "Yeah, Yeah," [...] and [...] "You Let a Lot of People Down." [...] Nice chord progressions, nice hooks; youve heard them all, but you havent, really. Youre smiling, and <b>youre</b> <b>right.</b> Youve heard this entire album before, even if you havent. Youve been dreaming it, for better or worse, since the age of 12." ...|$|E
5000|$|Q: Sir, a {{question}} about the mood among European allies. You were talking about the Islamic world a second ago. But now the European allies. If you look at, for example, France, Germany, also {{a lot of people in}} my own country -- Im from Dutch public TV, by the way -- it seems that a lot of Europeans rather give the benefit of the doubt to Saddam Hussein than President George Bush. These are U.S. allies. What do you make of that?Rumsfeld: Well, its -- what do I make of it?Q: They have no clerics. They have no Muslim clerics there.Rumsfeld: Are you helping me? (Laughter.) Do you think I need help? (Laughter.)What do I think about it? Well, there isnt anyone alive who wouldnt prefer unanimity. I mean, you just always would like everyone to stand up and say, Way to go! Thats the right thing to do, United States.Now, we rarely find unanimity in the world. I was ambassador to NATO, and I -- when we would go in and make a proposal, there wouldnt be unanimity. There wouldnt even be understanding. And wed have to be persuasive. Wed have to show reasons. Wed have to -- have to give rationales. Wed have to show facts. And, by golly, I found that Europe on any major issue is given -- if theres leadership and if <b>youre</b> <b>right,</b> and if your facts are persuasive, Europe responds. And they always have.Now, youre thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I dont. I think thats old Europe. If you look at the entire NATO Europe today, the center of gravity is shifting to the east. And there are a lot of new members. And if you just take the list of all the members of NATO and all of those who have been invited in recently -- what is it? Twenty-six, something like that? -- <b>youre</b> <b>right.</b> Germany has been a problem, and France has been a problem.Q: But opinion polls --Rumsfeld: But -- just a minute. Just a minute. But you look at vast numbers of other countries in Europe. Theyre not with France and Germany on this, theyre with the United States.|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Insane Clown Posse {{appeared}} on Attack of the Show! and repudiated claims {{that they were}} a Christian band. Bruce explained that their Dark Carnival mythology [...] "comes from the basic principle of right and wrong, you know. Evil and good. Thats all. Were just trying to say that theres bad guys out there and that theres good guys out there ... We were taught theres a heaven and a hell, but thats all we were taught. We werent taught about the Ten Commandments or whats in the Bible and all that. We just ... want to see good people hopefully go to heaven, which we refer to as Shangri-La". Joseph Utsler explained in a 2002 interview with Craig Markley that [...] "God is in your heart ... In my definition, it doesnt matter what creed, religion, or group you belong to. If youre doing whats right and are a good person, then <b>youre</b> <b>right</b> with God." [...] Bruce and Utsler have also stated that they are not certain that God and the afterlife exist, but that theyd like to believe that there is something after death.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2010, Williams {{released}} an album titled The Right Place, which he co-produced with Radney Foster. Jessica Phillips of Country Weekly magazine gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "If youre {{in the mood}} for true honky-tonk music, <b>youre</b> in the <b>right</b> place."

You can have the child. I will send for my things: you wont see me at Laurel Grove again. Good-bye." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2001, {{the year}} the novel Up in the Air was published, Sheldon Turner {{discovered}} the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley blurb on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. Reitman persuaded his father Ivan Reitman to purchase the books film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turners script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turners inventions that were utilized in the final film include Ryans boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where <b>youre</b> sitting <b>right</b> now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryans partner (written by Turner as male).Reitman initially attempted to claim sole credit for writing the film, and later admitted to being confused when the Writers Guild of America ruled that he should share credit with Turner. He and Turner later appeared at a WGA event where both said they were happy to share credit now that the course of events, and Turners contribution to the final product, had been made clear.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The albums title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the titles meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you cant put a record out without people saying its derivative of something else. So by saying the records already been heard, its kind of like saying, Yeah, <b>youre</b> <b>right.</b> Were doing something thats already been done before." [...] He reinforced, [...] "Were not trying to break new ground in music. Were {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesnt seem like were departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that {{we had a lot of}} potential and theres a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Havoc and Bright Lights {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 55, based on 17 reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Many critics first complimented the albums more mature and warmer sound. Holly Gleason from Paste {{gave it a}} positive review. She stated [...] "Twenty years later, the lithe songwriter embraces the same hybrid notion of introspection and sonics that are anything but singer/songwriterly. and Bright Lights embodies relief, release and refuge ... Without being florid or cosmic, she beckons to a far more graceful, honest world." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe praised the albums [...] "crisp, tuneful, warm, and sincere" [...] tone, {{as well as the}} production of the album. However, she was critical on the albums songwriting stating that songs [...] "Celebrity" [...] and [...] "Win and Win" [...] were [...] "clunkers". Nick Levine from BBC Music was equally positive saying the album brought out a more [...] "mellow Alanis Morissette". However, he was critical on the production saying it was [...] "too slick". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said the album [...] "is as soothing as a Sunday afternoon nap or a warm bath: its music for when you know <b>youre</b> <b>right</b> where you want to be." [...] At American Songwriter, Eric Allen called the album an [...] "intelligent and inspiring" [...] work that has [...] "winning results". The A.V. Clubs Annie Zaleski found [...] "Havoc And Bright Lights remains fearless and vibrant despite its shortcomings." [...] Elysa Gardner of USA Today said that Morissette finally has [...] "found her bliss." ...|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. Well, who denies it? <b>Youre</b> quite <b>right,</b> my boy. I don't mind confessing to you {{all that}} the {{circumstances}} that condemned me to keep a shop are the biggest tragedy in modern life. I {{ought to have been}} a writer. I'm essentially a man of ideas. When I was a young man I sometimes used to pray that I might fail, so that I should be justified in giving up business and doing something: something first-class. But it was no good: I couldnt fail. I said to myself that if I could only once go to my Chickabiddy here and shew her a chartered accountant's statement proving that I'd made 20 pounds less than last year, I could ask her to let me chance Johnny's and Hypatia's future by going into literature. But it was no good. First it was 250 pounds more than last year. Then it was 700 pounds. Then it was 2000 pounds. Then I saw it was no use: Prometheus was chained to his rock: read Shelley: read Mrs Browning. Well, well, it was not to be. [He rises solemnly]. Lord Summerhays: I ask you to excuse me for a few moments. There are times when a man needs to meditate in solitude on his destiny. A chord is touched; and he sees the drama of his life as a spectator sees a play. Laugh if you feel inclined: no man sees the comic side of it more than I. In the theatre of life everyone may be amused except the actor. [Brightening] Theres an idea in this: an idea for a picture. What a pity young Bentley is not a painter! Tarleton meditating on his destiny. Not in a toga. Not in the trappings of the tragedian or the philosopher. In plain coat and trousers: a man like any other man. And beneath that coat and trousers a human soul. Tarleton's Underwear! [He goes out gravely into the vestibule].|$|R
