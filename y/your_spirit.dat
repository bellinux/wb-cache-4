500|$|Brie Larson's {{performance}} as Grace was {{singled out for}} praise by critics. Katie Walsh of Indiewire wrote, [...] " [...] manages to convey her character as someone fierce and strong and steely, and also utterly fragile, delicate, scared and broken ... It's an incredible emotional and physical performance, and she's a whirlwind." [...] Similarly, Empire critic Ian Freer felt that Larson gave [...] "a whirling dervish of a performance ...

While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would have done better than I did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside."

500|$|Musically, [...] "Freedom" [...] is a hip hop and R {{song that}} follows a similar style to other Minaj songs heard on her debut album, Pink Friday. The song {{features}} street-slang bravado and [...] "venomous" [...] rapping in the verses with thin, fragile vocals over whipsy soft pop choruses. The instrumentation in [...] "Freedom" [...] mixes together smooth ambient riffs, pop-inspired crystal-clear synthesizers, and a smooth R beat, creating a sonically breezy soundscape. Lyrically, Minaj is still confrontational yet reflective, {{talking about her}} life in the spotlight and rise to fame. In the lyrics, Minaj states how other rappers [...] "in the competition" [...] will never thank her for opening the doors for them, and how they don't even thank their creator Jesus Christ for helping them get far, saying: [...] "They'll never thank me for opening doors / But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross / 'Cause <b>your</b> <b>spirit</b> is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel <b>your</b> <b>spirit</b> on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to be that much closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E

I {{just wanted}} to yell out 'He's behind you, he's behind you!' It takes sheer {{brilliance}} {{to be able to}} act that badly". Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, describes Paul as being very similar to fictional character J. R. Ewing. Paul is referred to in Emily Barr's fictitious novel [...] "Out of My Depth", in which character Amanda is watching Neighbours, with scenes featuring Paul and Gail receiving disapproval from Harold, Amanda opines that she believes the couple are in love. Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail commented on Paul's obsession with Rebecca stating: [...] "You can't help feeling that nothing short of a stake through the heart is going to keep Paul out of Rebecca's life." [...] Stephen later said [...] "Taking advice from Paul is like asking Charlie Sheen to be <b>your</b> <b>spirit</b> guide." [...] Paul Kalina of The Age said Dennis as Paul lightens things up and he prances about like [...] "a pantomime villain minus the moustache and cape." [...] Kalina added [...] "Erinsborough just would not be the same without him." [...] A TVTimes columnist stated [...] "He's no Brad Pitt and he's a devious beggar at the best of times, but Paul Robinson doesn't half get the ladies." ...|$|E

2500|$|John PaulII {{has been}} {{credited}} with being instrumental in bringing down Communism in Central and Eastern Europe, by being the spiritual inspiration behind its downfall and catalyst for [...] "a peaceful revolution" [...] in Poland. Lech Wałęsa, the founder of Solidarity and the first post-Communist President of Poland, credited John PaulII with giving Poles the courage to demand change. According to Wałęsa, [...] "Before his pontificate, the world was divided into blocs. Nobody {{knew how to get}} rid of Communism. In Warsaw, in 1979, he simply said: 'Do not be afraid', and later prayed: 'Let <b>your</b> <b>Spirit</b> descend and change the image of the land … this land'."

2500|$|Prayer 17, Avodah. asks God {{to restore}} the Temple services, build a Third Temple, and restore {{sacrificial}} worship. The concluding meditation ends with an additional prayer {{for the restoration of}} Temple worship. Both prayers have been modified within the siddur of Conservative Judaism, so that although they still ask for the restoration of the Temple, they remove the explicit plea for the resumption of sacrifices. (Some Conservative congregations remove the concluding silent prayer for the Temple entirely.) The Reform siddur also modifies this prayer, eliminating all reference to the Temple service and replacing the request for the restoration of the Temple with [...] "God who is near to all who call upon you, turn to your servants and be gracious to us; pour <b>your</b> <b>spirit</b> upon us." ...|$|E

His books on meditation include: Happy to Burn: Meditation to Energise <b>Your</b> <b>Spirit</b> (Lothian 1997) and Love & Imagination. His first novel, Levin's God (2004), was published by Fremantle Arts Centre Press. The Sydney Morning Heralds reviewer, Juliette Hughes, felt the book was [...] "like the reminiscences of an old rock-dog" [...] and his writing was [...] "prolific and specific and sometimes tells more than some {{of us want to}} know, but keeps us turning those hundreds of pages just to find out what happens to everyone". John Taylor became a film maker and graphics designer. He won an AFI award for The Huge Adventures of Trevor, a Cat in the category of Best Short Animation in 1986.|$|E

They formed the supergroup WhoCares and recorded a single called [...] "Out of my Mind", which was released 6 May 2011 {{for the benefit of the}} music school to be built in Gyumri, Armenia. In January 2012, when Iommi was announced to have early-stage lymphoma, the Armenian Prime Minister sent a letter of support: [...] "We know <b>your</b> <b>spirit</b> is strong as ever, and we do believe the genius of your inspiration that guides you through the work on the new Black Sabbath album will transform into a boost of strength and energy that you need now, when things look tough".|$|E

One feels that before you entered the world of great affairs, you traversed that of great ideas. With my full sympathy, high estime and vivid admiration." [...] From 1840 through 1844, Thiers traveled around Europe, crisscrossing Holland, Germany, Switzerland and Spain and visiting he battlefields where Napoleon fought and meeting people who had witnessed them. In the meanwhile, his chief political rival, Guizot, the leader of the right wing in the Deputies, headed the government. He called new elections in July 1846, which Guizot's party narrowly won, with 266 seats of 449. However, in an ominous sign, ten of the twelve deputies from Paris opposed the government. As the King's [...] unpopularity grew, he suffered also a personal tragedy with great political implications; [...] his son, the heir to the throne, was killed in an accident.

2500|$|... "One covereth {{violence}} {{with his}} garment": or, [...] "and violence covereth his garment," [...] or, it might be, {{in the same}} sense, [...] "he covereth his garment with violence" [...] , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment. It was, as it were, [...] "an outer garment of violence", as Asaph says in Psalm 73:6, [...] "violence covereth them as a garment;" [...] or David in Psalm 109:18, [...] "he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment." [...] It was like a garment with [...] "fretting leprosy," [...] unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. Leviticus 13:47-58. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had Revelation 7:14 [...] "washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb."

[...] The Hebrew favors [...] "garment," [...] being accusative of the thing covered (as in Psalm 73:6). Their [...] "violence" [...] is the putting away of their wives; the [...] "garment" [...] with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses' permission (Deuteronomy 24:1; compare Matthew 19:6-9).|$|E
