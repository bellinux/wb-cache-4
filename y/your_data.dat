500|$|Rock Paper Shotgun writer Alec Meer {{argued that}} Microsoft's intent for this data {{collection}} lacked transparency, stating that [...] "there is no {{world in which}} 45pages of policy documents and opt-out settings split across 13different settings screens and an external website constitutes 'real transparency'." [...] ExtremeTech pointed out that, while previously scroogling against Google for similar data collection strategies, Microsoft now hoovers up <b>your</b> <b>data</b> {{in ways that would}} make Google jealous." [...] However, it was also pointed out that the requirement for such vast usage of customer data had become a norm, citing the increased reliance on cloud computing and other forms of external processing, as well as similar data collection requirements for services on mobile devices such as Google Now and Siri. In August 2015, Russian politician Nikolai Levichev called for Windows10 to be banned from use within the Russian government, as it sends user data to servers in the United States. The country had passed a federal law requiring all online services to store the data of Russian users on servers within the country by September 2016, or be blocked. Writing for ZDNet, Ed Bott said that the lack of complaints by businesses about privacy in Windows10 indicated [...] "how utterly normal those privacy terms are in 2015." [...] In a Computerworld editorial, Preston Gralla stated that [...] "the kind of information Windows10 gathers is no different from what other operating systems gather. But Microsoft is held to a different standard than other companies." ...|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{a report}} by Nilay Patel of The Verge stated that [...] "all web {{services}} {{should be subject to}} harsh scrutiny of their privacy policies—but a close and careful reading reveals that Google's terms are pretty much the same as anyone else's, and slightly better in some cases", pointing to the fact that Google [...] "couldn't move files around on its servers, cache <b>your</b> <b>data,</b> or make image thumbnails" [...] without proper rights. In comparing the policies with competing services, Patel wrote that [...] "it's clear that they need the exact same permissions—they just use slightly more artful language to communicate them".|$|E

2500|$|Data {{is stored}} in Google's data centers, which are [...] "built with {{custom-designed}} servers, that run our own operating system for security and performance", with [...] "more than 550 full-time security and privacy professionals". In a blog post, Google stated that benefits of using G Suite included [...] "disaster recovery", with data and information [...] "simultaneously replicated in two data centers at once, so that if one data center fails, we nearly instantly transfer <b>your</b> <b>data</b> {{over to the other}} one that's also been reflecting your actions." [...] Though acknowledging that [...] "no backup solution from us or anyone else is absolutely perfect", Google states that it has [...] "invested a lot of effort to help make it second to none".|$|E
2500|$|The {{market is}} however {{evolving}} in this area. [...] In order to automate these processes, connectors {{are needed to}} fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A Process Driven Messaging Service is an option for optimizing <b>your</b> <b>data</b> exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a Process Driven Messaging Platform. Process Driven Messaging Service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the launch}} of the service, Google Drive privacy policy was heavily criticized by some members of the media. Google has one set of Terms of Service and Privacy Policy {{agreements}} that cover all of its services, meaning that the language in the agreements grants the company broad rights to reproduce, use, and create derivative works from content stored on Google Drive. While the policies also confirm that users retain intellectual property rights, privacy advocates raised concerns that the licenses grant Google the rights to use the information and data to customize advertising and other services Google provides. In contrast, other members of the media noted that the agreements were no worse than those of competing cloud storage services, but that the competition uses [...] "more artful language" [...] in the agreements, and also stated that Google needs the rights in order to [...] "move files around on its servers, cache <b>your</b> <b>data,</b> or make image thumbnails".|$|E
