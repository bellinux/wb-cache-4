Some of these edits included homosexual imagery, which touched a nerve with Davis and increased the ill-feeling between the two. Hardy won the fight via a narrow and controversial split decision. After the fight, Davis expressed his anger at the decision, stating, [...] "I won the fight. I won 12 minutes of the fight and they gave it to him? <b>You</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> want a rematch, right away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If it's Long Jim, <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can," [...] Sam said, as {{he turned}} toward the spectators {{that they might have}} a good {{opportunity}} of seeing such a wonderful detective as he claimed to be.|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. <b>You</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> do. I'm {{bound to}} go now. It's ridiculous keeping me here when I'm {{as healthy as}} a pig. I caught Stanton in the hall last night {{and asked him if}} I could go.|$|E
6000|$|... "I ain't so foolish. He's got {{a grip on}} {{him like}} a lobster, an' when he's mad at me he grips my arm an' twists it till I holler. When Gran'dad's aroun' <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> hev to knuckle down, er I gits the worst of it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I won't forget, <b>you</b> <b>bet.</b> <b>I</b> think saying {{my prayers}} is great fun. But it won't {{be as good}} fun saying them alone as saying them to you. I wish you'd stay home, Anne. I don't see {{what you want to}} go away and leave us for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will I? <b>You</b> <b>bet!</b> <b>I</b> {{just thought}} maybe--Say, by golly, it does do a fellow good, don't it, {{to sit and}} visit about {{business}} conditions, after he's been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a bargain," [...] said Davy. [...] "I'll be good, <b>you</b> <b>bet.</b> <b>I</b> {{meant to}} go over to Mr. Harrison's and fire peas from my new popgun at Ginger but another day'll do as well.

6000|$|... "My {{conscience}} is {{not moved}} in any way," [...] he laughed; [...] "when it is I will {{look out for}} a deserving charity. Well, if <b>you</b> won't <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> must see if I can make a small investment somewhere else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's your weight? <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> we weigh even, or I weigh most. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> Jack Morris beats you at birds or a mark, at five-and-twenty paces. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> jump {{farther than}} you on flat ground, {{here on this}} green." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Headley, I shall quietly make my call at Trebooze to-morrow, as {{if nothing}} had happened. What will <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> me that <b>I</b> am not {{received}} as usual?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure, Pete; {{but just}} the same I wasn't as keen as you. Doggone it, I was gettin' to like that plowin'. I'll never be scairt {{to ask for a}} job at it again. I've got to where I savvy the burro, an' <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can plow against most of 'm right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, this {{beats the}} Palace Hotel in Salina," [...] he continued, his wonder increasing, then he smiled. [...] "What'll <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> don't catch the 'guides' napping! You send up word you're here {{and leave me}} out o' sight somewhere. I'd like to show Julia that her daddy don't know all that blows over the roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd an {{exciting}} dream last night for once," [...] said Dan triumphantly. [...] "I dreamt old Peg Bowen chased me.

I let out a screech--and woke up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> did," [...] {{cried the}} captain. He {{was a good}} deal flushed, but not so much with wine as admiration; and his eyes drank in the huge {{proportions}} of the other with delight. [...] "You <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> did, and <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> that <b>I</b> can see you doing it! By God, you're a man, and you can say I said so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, sure, <b>you</b> <b>bet!</b> Don't <b>I</b> {{have to go}} look at that candy-store {{property}} in Akron? Don't I? Ain't it a shame I have to stop off there when I'm so anxious to get home? Ain't it a regular shame? I'll say it is! I'll say it's a doggone shame!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will let}} {{some of it}} out," [...] Jerry said wrathfully, [...] "if I {{get a chance to}} lay a bead on one of them. Don't you be afeard, chief; we will look out sharp enough, <b>you</b> <b>bet.</b> Waal, <b>I</b> reckon it is about our time to turn out, Ben." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laughably simple, eh? Do {{you realize}} I've been {{sweating}} {{for days and}} haven't been able {{to think of a}} thing to say yet, except that I won't detain them long. <b>You</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> won't detain them long.

6000|$|He {{was ready}} to comply. [...] "Our house stood near the railway, about four miles this side of Jackson, and <b>you</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> had my {{head out of the}} winder {{to see if it was}} all there. It was. It looked just the same, only the old man had painted it yellow--and seemed like I could see mother settin' on the porch. I'd had it all planned to hire the best {{automobile}} in town and go up there in shape to heal sore eyes--but changed my plan.|$|E
6000|$|They walked on, {{the girl}} following; at times straying furtively on either side, as if meditating an escape in the woods,--which indeed had {{once or twice}} been vaguely in her thoughts,--but chiefly to avoid further {{questioning}} and not {{to hear what the}} men said to each other. For they were evidently speaking of her, and she could not help hearing the younger repeat her words, [...] "Wot's agoin' to become o' me?" [...] with considerable amusement, and the addition: [...] "She'll take care of herself, <b>you</b> <b>bet!</b> <b>I</b> call that remark o' hers the richest thing out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, old man; this thing's {{got to be}} done, an' {{the sooner}} we start the better. There's no show for you to give {{yourself}} up 'less I'm with you, 'cordin' to what Dan says, an' <b>you</b> can <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> ain't countin' on goin' to jail {{so long as it}} can be helped." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right. But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> ain't {{going to}} throw off on di'monds. Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure!

I'll fix him, I will. You just watch me. (Hey, Drubel, got any lemon merang? Bring me a hunk, will yuh?) Why, Wrenn, that cross-eyed double-jointed fat old slob, I'll slam him in the slats so hard some day--I will, you just watch my smoke. If it wasn't for that messy wife of mine--I ought to desert her, and I will some day, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, blame it, it's a riddle, don't you see? Say, {{how long}} are you going to stay here? You got to stay always. We can just have booming times--they don't have no school now. Do you own a dog? I've got a dog--and he'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in. Do you like to comb up Sundays, {{and all that kind of}} foolishness? <b>You</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> don't, but ma she makes me. Confound these ole britches!

6000|$|... "We'll soon {{enter the}} valley. <b>You</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> saw. First thing, in Japan, the terraced hillsides. Take a hill so steep you couldn't drive a horse up it. No bother to them. They terraced it--a stone wall, and good masonry, six feet high, a level terrace six feet wide; up and up, walls and terraces, {{the same thing}} all the way, {{straight}} into the air, walls upon walls, terraces upon terraces, until I've seen ten-foot walls built to make three-foot terraces, and twenty-foot walls {{for four or five}} feet of soil they could grow things on. And that soil, packed up the mountainsides in baskets on their backs! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Laugh, you {{wild and}} woolly Westerners!" [...] ejaculated Carley. [...] "It {{must have been}} funny. I hope I {{can be a good}} sport.... But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> <b>I</b> ride him tomorrow." ...|$|R
