But when I went to Africa, I really experienced people celebrating and being joyful together for the first time. It really reinforced my belief in humanity. It reminded me who I am.

[...] "So many things have happened that have inspired me {{in a lot of ways}} to believe in humanity."

[...] The album is eclectic; it contains elements from hip hop, R&B, dance, rock and drum & bass.

We figured his trip home and the feelings it generated in him might make for a good interview. Of course, neither of us could have anticipated the tumultuous events that shook Urumqi this past summer and beyond, nor could we have imagined that our follow-up interview would be dominated by such subject matter. In many respects, the events of this past summer challenge the picture of relative multi-ethnic harmony that Leong described in our original interview.
