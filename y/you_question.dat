With a game, the fourth, fifth, sixth, 80th, 100 millionth time you've seen that joke it becomes not funny, then you lose faith in it, and then <b>you</b> <b>question</b> it, {{and you go}} round this {{emotional}} circle...We've always liked fresh-baked stuff a little better but, with a video game, it doesn't work that way. But the game isn't just a collection of funny South Park scenes, hopefully it's more than that.|$|E

An embarrassed Harold Warne wrote her suggesting a few minor alterations, but she was unperturbed. [...] "There is no need to apologize for criticism," [...] she wrote, [...] "But there is no doubt the animals strongly resemble rabbits, the head which <b>you</b> <b>question</b> was copied from a photograph in the book." [...] The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes was released in October 1911 to popular and commercial success.|$|E

500|$|... "Cowboy Style" [...] {{was written}} by Minogue, Steve Anderson and Dave Seaman, {{and was one of}} the first songs {{composed}} for the album. Minogue wrote the song prior to being in a relationship with French photographer Stephane Sednaoui with different lyrical context, but it was completed while she was dating. Of the song, Minogue said [...] "the way you start a new relationship with someone, they can bring out so many emotions within you and makes <b>you</b> <b>question</b> yourself a bit more." [...] The title [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] comes from when she first met Sednaoui in person, where she recalled him looking [...] "unusual" [...] and felt like he was [...] "the new cowboy coming into town".|$|E
500|$|On 25 November 2014, it was {{announced}} that Goodrem had agreed to reprise her role for Neighbours 30th anniversary celebrations. Goodrem began filming that day and tweeted her excitement about Nina making a guest appearance. Her return featured during three episodes starting from 16 March 2015. Series producer Jason Herbison confirmed that the theme of music would tie into the character's return. It was later confirmed that Nina returns to Erinsborough after her relationship with Jack ends. Goodrem said she understood what her character was going through, saying [...] "I have experienced the feelings Nina is going through. I've had those moments where <b>you</b> <b>question</b> where you are going and you have to look back to know where to move forward." [...] The singer and actress said her return to Neighbours felt [...] "natural" [...] and she instantly knew what Nina would be wearing the moment she went into wardrobe.|$|E
500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that <b>you</b> <b>question</b> who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E

500|$|Fincher {{supervised}} {{the composition of}} the DVD packaging {{and was one of the}} first directors to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video [...] "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: [...] "The film is meant to make <b>you</b> <b>question.</b> The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it." [...] The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title [...] "Fight Club" [...] was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, [...] "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside." [...] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: [...] "From a retail standpoint, [...] has incredible shelf-presence." ...|$|E
500|$|Changeling {{sits with}} other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and {{the search for}} family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental {{struggle}} to communicate with children. It {{can also be seen}} as a variation of the Eastwood [...] "revenge movie" [...] ethic; in this case, the [...] "avenging grunt" [...] transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World(1993) and Mystic River(2003). Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River, which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was [...] "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible. Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, [...] "When [...] comes along quite as big as this one, <b>you</b> <b>question</b> humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be." [...] Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was [...] "unbearable" [...] due to its attention to detail; he believed {{it one of the most}} convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would be at the top of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "With Twilight as My Guide" [...] {{appears to}} take place during the Salem Witch Trials, which is {{revealed}} through an interview with opera singer Renée Fleming, who covered the song on her album Dark Hope: [...] "I was especially fascinated by the Mars Volta song, 'With Twilight As My Guide', which is operatic in its scale and musical complexity. I was however a bit concerned about the text, specifically the reference to 'devil daughters'. I said, 'As much as I love this song, I really can't sing it for that reason.' Peter Mensch offered to contact Cedric Bixler-Zavala and asked if the text could be changed, since the overall meaning of the song wasn't completely clear anyway. Cedric responded, [...] "Sure, she can change it. I would just {{like it to be}} known that in no way is the lyric supposed to paint women in a bad light... The song feels like it was written during the Salem Witch Trials, and it sarcastically takes the religious right wing slang of how all women were treated. Our last album, Bedlam in Goliath, was one huge metaphor for the way women are treated in Islamic society (honor killings, etc) not just a story about a ouija board... it's meant to make <b>you</b> <b>question</b> the way things are." ...|$|E
