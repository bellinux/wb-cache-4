In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that.

2500|$|When {{the joint}} album leaked on February 22, 2002 it caused the label, Roc-A-Fella, {{to push the}} album's release date up from the initial date, March 26, to March 19. Jay-Z {{expressed}} his frustration about the album leak to MTV News: [...] "It's the gift and the curse. It's an honor that everybody wants your music fast, {{but on the other}} hand, it's another thing when the music gets out before you [...] Because that's your art. You feel attached to it. You feel a certain way and <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> go out and support it. The time that you take, it's like a piece of your life. You take parts of your life and you put it on these records and then for it to just be traded and moved around [...]|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2017 {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, Chad Smith {{said he had}} discussions with Flea about how much longer the band could continue touring. [...] "I was like, 'I don't know!' I want to make records, I still love making records, but the touring part... I don't know if we can continue. I mean, three of us are 54 years old – Anthony, me and Flea. Josh is 38 or 39, so he's a young man. But I don't know if {{we can continue to}} do the long tours – the year, year-and-a-half we normally do. That's a good question. We all have families and different things, your priorities shift a little bit. You kinda see that what's gonna work for you maybe doesn't necessarily work for other bands. But again, we're just so grateful that people want to come and see us play, and we love to perform. I don't know in the future how that's gonna look. We pride ourselves in putting out a really amazing performance. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> just walk away and be like, 'Wow, I haven't seen anything like that!' and when you can't do that anymore, you gotta really stop and go, 'We're not gonna be sitting on stools up there playing our songs.'"On July 18, 2017 in an {{interview with}} TMZ, Flea said of the band possibly retiring [...] "that's just silly talk. We never look past the immediate future but um, were on tour right now, we're rockin' out, we're feeling the spirit, letting the music move us and to be honest since the day we started this band nearly 35 years ago, i've never ever known what's next or what's around the corner or anything and I think that the power of the band lies in that kinda just staying in the moment and staying with the energy that's moving.|$|E

500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be sort of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|R
5000|$|... "Our whole guise is {{like giving}} {{a sign to}} the world to think of us {{in a certain way}} but there's a point between what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know about you and what you can't help people knowing about you.

5000|$|Gage {{said about}} their first show in 1983 at the Pride Festival in Loring Park, [...] "What {{we were doing}} was very unusual. The music was unusual.

5000|$|Cantrell {{also stated}} [...] "There's some real filth in there. That's intentional, and that's also just how we sound together. We're {{trying to make}} a record that we dig and we're trying to keep the bar high for {{ourselves}} {{and see if we can}} get past it, and I think that we did again.

When <b>you</b> say <b>you</b> <b>want</b> all <b>peoples</b> <b>to</b> unite, <b>you</b> really mean that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> all <b>peoples</b> <b>to</b> unite {{to learn the}} tricks of your people. If the Bedouin Arab {{does not know how}} to read, some English missionary or schoolmaster must be sent to teach him to read, but no one ever says, 'This schoolmaster does not know how to ride on a camel; let us pay a Bedouin to teach him.' You say your civilisation will include all talents. Will it? Do you really mean to say that at the moment when the Esquimaux has learnt to vote for a County Council, you will have learnt to spear a walrus? I recur to the example I gave. In Nicaragua we had a way of catching wild horses--by lassooing the fore feet--which {{was supposed to be the}} best in South America. If you are going to include all the talents, go and do it. If not, permit me to say what I have always said, that something went from the world when Nicaragua was civilised." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the status}} of the band, and the {{unreleased}} second album, former drummer Ed Graham noted in 2012, [...] "I know they made a second album which Dan was hoping to release at some point.

5000|$|However, {{the music}} video also {{received}} some negative reviews.

5000|$|Their {{third album}} Ego Death was {{released}} by Odd Future & Columbia on June 30, 2015 to widespread acclaim. Matt Martians on NPR said about the album's title: [...] "A {{lot of people that}} we know are just having their egos checked in many ways. Some people losing their jobs when, last year, they were {{at the top of the}} mountain; certain people's careers going in different directions that they didn't anticipate. And just kind of two words that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> think about these days, because we do have a lot of people who, on the Internet — whether it's Instagram, Twitter — it's a lot of egos that are really based on nothing backing it up." ...|$|E
5|$|It's good <b>to</b> know <b>people</b> didn't see it coming. That's a {{big concern}} when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. <b>You</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|R

On Foursquare, if <b>you</b> don't <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know <b>you</b> are on a date or with a friend at a certain place, then you don't have <b>to</b> let <b>people</b> know. You don't check in." [...] Selvadurai also states that Foursquare does not passively track users, which means a user has to actively check in <b>to</b> let <b>people</b> know where they are.|$|R

5000|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated: [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be a little bit off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E

5000|$|In {{parallel}} with his film career, Flemyng {{has continued to}} take various television roles. He told BBC News Online in 2004 that: [...] "Of the 40 feature films I've made, 15 of them failed to make it onto the screen and have only ever been seen by cast and crew. It is very frustrating when a film you really believe in remains unseen. That's not a problem with television.

[...] In 2005 he played the famous science-fiction role of Professor Bernard Quatermass when digital television channel BBC Four produced a live remake of the 1953 serial The Quatermass Experiment. In 2005 he also played the part of Dimitry, a Russian ex-biological weapons specialist, in Transporter 2, where he was briefly reunited with Jason Statham.|$|E
5000|$|Part of Parker and Stone's anger {{came from}} the fact that [...] "Super Best Friends", a 2001 episode of South Park, {{featured}} images of Muhammad uncensored as a superhero, and aired without censorship for several years on both Comedy Central and in local syndication. The duo struggled to come up with how to present Comedy Central's refusal to broadcast the images as a real situation and not a joke. Parker later related previous South Park episodes, [...] "Cartman Joins NAMBLA" [...] (2000) and [...] "Trapped in the Closet" [...] (2005), which parodied NAMBLA and Scientology, respectively, as similar situations. [...] "You have to make sure, when you're doing that kind of subject matter, <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> know what you're doing is a joke and then what really is real, you know, you're trying to make fun of", said Parker. The duo, instead of settling on the black title card, toyed with [...] "putting some really incredible quote up or making a big speech.

2500|$|Actors {{have been}} known to bring some part of their real {{experience}} into the roles they portray. Hansis and Silbermann also spoke of this aspect regarding their own roles; they detailed what, if anything, they find useful in their lives when creating Luke and Noah. Hansis stated, [...] "Luke is all about the need to be loved and accepted. I think that need is universal. Life is about acceptance from the <b>people</b> who <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> love <b>you.</b> If that means family, a wife, a husband, a girlfriend/boyfriend, a best friend, <b>you</b> just <b>want</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> love <b>you</b> for who you are.
