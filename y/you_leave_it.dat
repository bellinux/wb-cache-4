500|$|While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and {{two friends}} were {{abducted}} overnight and held at gunpoint {{by a group}} of locals. Eventually their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation. Cumberbatch said of the incident: [...] "It taught me that you come into this world as <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it,</b> on your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." [...] He subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern {{described}} Like Crazy as a [...] "wise and beautiful little film", giving particular praise to Guleserian's cinematography and Yelchin and Jones's improvised performances. David Edelstein of New York magazine claimed that Like Crazy was [...] "the most infectious love story in decades", comparing its [...] "wonderfully sane" [...] perspective to other romance films and romantic comedies. Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film an A– grade and praised Doremus, Yelchin and Felicity Jones's storytelling ability in creating [...] "a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love {{in all its}} ecstasy and agony". In a review for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing that [...] "Drake Doremus has crafted a crazily inventive and totally irresistible tale of first love that makes the familiar seem bittersweet and heart-stoppingly new". He described Felicity Jones as [...] "a marvel" [...] and Yelchin as [...] "outstanding". Time magazine's Mary Pols commended the film's ambiguous ending and wrote, [...] "Like Crazy is a cinematic love potion and <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> feeling bewitched." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, praising Jones and Yelchin's performances and the [...] "intelligent, graceful indie style" [...] of the film, although he found the storyline somewhat unrealistic. Indiewire's Eric Kohn gave the film a B+ grade and felt that while the plot developed slowly, Yelchin and Jones shared [...] "an indelible and entirely realistic chemistry". Variety film critic Andrew Barker, who described the film as [...] "an exquisite, beautifully acted gem", gave particular praise to the film's [...] "dexterous editing", given that it [...] "contains nary an extraneous detail, while still managing to luxuriate in the tender and awkward silences of young love".|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{members of}} the {{audience}} reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramović described it later: [...] "What I learned was that... if <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> up to the audience, they can kill you.... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done... You know how it is, you go in your there non-stop, <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>it</b> alone for a minute and you come back– you're like, okay, this is what I need." ...|$|E
