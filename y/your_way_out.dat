Jolene Burdge, {{the sister of}} Stephen Reinboldt, read a letter that her brother had written {{shortly before his death}} in 1995. Addressing Hastert, Burdge stated that she wanted to [...] "hold you accountable for sexually abusing my brother.

"Through the Rain" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics; many complimented Carey's restrained vocal performance, {{as well as}} the song's simple instrumental accompaniment, while others criticized it for being overly-dramatic. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as [...] "inspirational", and felt that due to its vagueness, the song is would be applicable to all listeners, not just Carey. The Daily Unions David Germain commented how the song's simple musical arrangement and Carey's [...] "restrained" [...] vocal delivery aided it in becoming [...] "modest and reserved". Writing for Billboard, Michael Paoletta chose [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a top pick from the album, as did Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. He described it as a song that was designed as [...] "'Vision of Love' meets 'Hero'", and wrote, [...] "Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp, no longer trying to prove that she's real." [...] Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a [...] "powerhouse ballad", while Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair wrote [...] "embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics, it is one of those highly personal songs about finding <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of an emotional wilderness, but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality". Similarly, a writer from Newsday also described [...] "Through the Rain" [...] as a [...] "powerhouse ballad", and felt it was reminiscent of Carey's previous single [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] (1995). Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey's personal struggles from the previous year. Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey's personal troubles may not have been fully solved, the song made her appear [...] "strong and triumphant".|$|E

You have to buy <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>out,</b> {{or some kind of}} talent has to take you out, or {{you have to be very}} bright and move away to university." [...] Also at fourteen, Connolly started to become interested in music— mainly Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry.

Petraeus was responsible for U.S. operations in 20 countries spreading from Egypt to Pakistan—including Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. During his time at CENTCOM, Petraeus advocated that countering the terrorist threats in the CENTCOM region requires more than just counter-terrorism forces, demanding instead whole-of-governments, comprehensive approaches akin to those of counterinsurgency. One of his closest colleagues said that Petraeus knew that defeating an insurgency required living among the people, convincing them that we were better than the insurgents. [...] "ou can't kill 'em all ... ou can't kill <b>your</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of an insurgency. ... You have to find other kinds of ammunition, and it's not always a bullet." ...|$|E
