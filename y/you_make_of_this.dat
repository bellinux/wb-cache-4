But Malviny knows, I reckon, what ought to be worn at the Tooilleries, and she don't want our Mamie to take a back seat before them furrin' princesses and gran' dukes.

It must be suthin' first class and A1, for Malviny ain't the woman to throw away twelve hundred dollars on any of them small-potato despots! She says Mamie speaks French already like them French Petes. I don't quite make out what she means here. She met Don Caesar in Paris, and she says, 'I think Mamie is nearly off with Don Caesar, who has {{followed}} her here. I don't care about her dropping him TOO suddenly; the reason I'll tell you hereafter. I think the man might be a dangerous enemy.' Now, what do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> <b>this?</b> I allus thought Mamie rather cottoned to him, and it was the old woman who fought shy, thinkin' Mamie would do better. Now, I am agreeable that my gal should marry any one she likes, whether it's a dook or a poor man, as long as he's on the square. I was ready to take Don Caesar; but now things seem to have shifted round. As to Don Caesar's being a dangerous enemy if Mamie won't have him, that's a little too high and mighty for me, and I wonder the old woman don't make him climb down. What do you think?" ...|$|E

(George Bush, 2003) A large part of the {{opposition}} to Bush's war was based on recognition that Iraq is only a special case of the "imperial ambition" that is widely condemned and rightly feared. (Noam Chomsky, 2003) Bush gave an intentional explanation of his action as "regime change" in Iraq. As president, Bush gave the order and so initiated this intentional action. But intentional actions are public, and Chomsky had reckoned that this action Bush's action—was undertaken with a different intention, namely "imperial ambition. " Many intentional actions lead to divergent interpretations as to whether an agent°s avowed intention or an intention attributed by an observer is the operative intention behind an action. Elsewhere, intentionality "dropped out. " Despite being fundamental for two millennia, its marginalization resulted from the rise of the ABCs of 20 th-century psychology: associationism, behaviorism, and "cognitive revolution. " There are two versions of what happened. One is that intentionality was excised {{on the grounds that it}} was no more necessary than phlogiston in chemistry; compare Skinnerian behaviorism. The other was that intentionality was admissible, provided that an observer°s interpretation had exclusive priority over an agent°s avowals, which were in fact dispensable; compare cognitive psychology...|$|E
