The study used a case study research design conducted in one English course in Bandung, involving 11 participants. The data, then, were collected and analyzed through triangulation data sources: vocabulary test, classroom observation, journal response, and interview. The {{results of this study}} revealed that the materials presented in <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> fit young learners’ learning principles. <b>YouTube</b> <b>video</b> is also effective in teaching English vocabularies.

40|$|Leveraging the {{characteristics}} of <b>YouTube</b> <b>video</b> id space and ex-ploiting a unique property of YouTube search API, {{in this paper we}} develop a random prefix sampling method to estimate the total number of <b>videos</b> hosted by <b>YouTube.</b> Through theoretical model-ing and analysis, we demonstrate that the estimator based on this method is unbiased, and provide bounds on its variance and confi-dence interval. These bounds enable us to judiciously select sam-ple sizes to control estimation errors. We evaluate our sampling method and validate the sampling results using two distinct collec-tions of <b>YouTube</b> <b>video</b> id’s (namely, treating each collection {{as if it were the}} “true ” collection of <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos).</b> We then apply our sampling method to the live YouTube system, and estimate that there are a total of roughly 500 millions <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> by May, 2011. Finally, using an unbiased collection of <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> sampled by our method, we show that <b>YouTube</b> <b>video</b> view count statistics collected by prior methods (e. g., through crawling of re-lated video links) are highly skewed, significantly under-estimating the number of videos with very small view counts (< 1000); we al-so shed lights on the bounds for the total storage YouTube must have and the network capacity needed to delivery <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{investigating the}} effect of <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> and pictures as the authentic materials on EFL Indonesian students’ writing performance. The experimental research is conducted by using quasi-experimental design. This research employs two groups experimental. This is comparing two groups to see which one is effective {{to be used in}} helping the students in writing. The first group is employed by using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> and the second group is treated by using pictures. Both of YouTube and pictures are the authentic materials which help the students to have better writing performance. The subjects are the second semester students of English Department, IKIP PGRI Madiun. Both of the groups, the students are asked to write paragraph by using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> and pictures as the authentic materials. The data are analyzed by using Independent t-test. The result of the study shows that there is significantly different between the students who write paragraph after being treated by using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> and by using pictures as the authentic materials. The students who are treated by using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> have lower writing performance than the students who are treated by using pictures. The mean of the students who write paragraph after being treated by using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> as authentic materials is lower than those who are treated by using pictures. This means that using pictures in writing are better than using <b>YouTube</b> <b>videos</b> to help the students in writing performance.  </p...|$|R
