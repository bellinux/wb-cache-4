6000|$|... "I {{have been}} unjust, proud and willful--and I {{am going to}} do full penance. You have surely the gift of prophecy. Do <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> last bold prediction?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What talk is this?" [...] said Father Abram. [...] "You {{said that}} <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> parents. Why {{do you say}} you have no name? I do not understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't help it,' said Mrs. Frost. 'He must be his old aunt Kitty's Louis le Debonnaire! Don't <b>you,</b> <b>remember</b> <b>your</b> {{calling him}} {{so when he}} was a baby?' ...|$|E
