Etymologies, often very far-fetched, form the subject of just one of the encyclopedia's twenty books (Book X), but perceived linguistic similarities permeate the work. An idea of the quality of Isidore's etymological knowledge is given by Peter Jones: [...] "Now we know most of his derivations are total nonsense (eg, he derives baculus, 'walking-stick', from Bacchus, god of drink, because <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>one</b> to walk straight after sinking a few)".|$|E

50|$|Masks {{help with}} the {{creation}} of Commedia as they create the characters themselves. Comedy masks tend to make a statement from the second they are seen on stage. They tell the audience who the character is, their social class and type, what they will do or won't do, and what their attitudes are. The moment they step on stage the character comes alive, typically even introducing themselves as soon as they notice the audience. A comic mask is a nobody and a somebody at the same time, the characters seem important even if they are a lowly servant. A mask helps to create the beautiful, extravagant, repulsive and yet attractiveness of each character. Masks represent the actor and the character at once, the actors movements help to create the character and the mask finishes it. The mask and lazzo connected, without the lazzo a character in a mask is not making anything and is less entertaining. Masks and lazzo go hand in hand and <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>one</b> to have the other. Without one, the other is not as great and fantastic, or as funny, lazzi without masks is not as meaningful.|$|E
5000|$|When {{discussing}} {{the recording of}} the album, in an interview the following year with Pete Hamill in Rolling Stone, Lennon recalled: [...] "Elton sort of popped in on the sessions for Walls and Bridges and sort of zapped in and played the piano and ended up singing 'Whatever Gets You Thru the Night' with me. Which was a great shot in the arm. I'd done three quarters of it, 'Now what do we do?' Should we put a camel on it or a xylophone? That sort of thing. And {{he came in and}} said, 'Hey, I'll play some piano!'" [...] "Nobody Loves You (When You're Down and Out)" [...] was later remembered by Lennon as an expression of his feelings about the lost weekend period. Lennon imagined Frank Sinatra singing it: [...] "I don't know why. It's kind of a Sinatraesque song, really. He would do a perfect job with it. Are you listening Frank? <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>one</b> song that isn't a piece of nothing. Here's one for you, the horn arrangement and everything's made for you. But don't ask me to produce it." ...|$|E

5000|$|China's Li Na held firm in {{the face}} of a ferocious {{comeback}} on the part of defending champion Francesca Schiavone to win 6-4, 7-6 and claim the first-ever Grand Slam title for a player from Asia. The sixth seed put in a brilliant display, dominating Schiavone in the opening set and then stymieing the Italian's comeback in the second. Li is a fully deserving champion, having beaten four top ten seeds to claim the crown, and her success should do wonders for the popularity of the sport in China. [...] "Someone was saying I'm getting old", Li said after the match - the first clay court title of her career. [...] "So you know the old woman like the dream to come true. Not easy. At 6-0 in the tie-break I was thinking don't do a stupid thing. Before I have many match points on clay but I never win the match. So I was like, okay, <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>one</b> point. Of course, it's exciting. Not so many players can win a Grand Slam." [...] Li, who also made the Australian Open final earlier this year, has been largely responsible for putting Chinese tennis on the map, but she is not convinced everyone will remember her when she gets home. [...] "The next two weeks is Wimbledon, so I don't have time to go back to China right now", she said. [...] "I go back after Wimbledon, maybe people forget me already. These are tough times you know." [...] Meanwhile, members of Li's immediate family - including her mother - are unlikely to have witnessed her historic victory. [...] "I didn't contact her...My mum and sister always say oh she's playing now and then they turn off the TV because it made them nervous. I don't think she watched but I will contact her later." [...] Defending champion Francesca Schiavone praised Li's performance. [...] "She played, really deep so I couldn't play my spin and really high so she could come in", said Schiavone. [...] "She played really high level through one set and 2-1, 3-1, she was playing really good. I tried to push more, to risk more and she went down with the level. But it's normal. Tennis is always like this. I think at the end we were really close and (the set) could be for me or for her. But at the end, she won. She deserve this final. She fight a lot and she played good also on the clay." ...|$|E
