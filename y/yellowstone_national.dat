5|$|The Heritage and Research Center {{is located}} at Gardiner, Montana, near the north {{entrance}} to the park. The center {{is home to the}} <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park's museum collection, archives, research library, historian, archeology lab, and herbarium. The <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park Archives maintain collections of historical records of Yellowstone and the National Park Service. The collection includes the administrative records of Yellowstone, as well as resource management records, records from major projects, and donated manuscripts and personal papers.

5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} was acted upon and in 1889 the first non-native fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, {{a practice that}} continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park is renowned for.|$|E
5|$|<b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park was {{established}} in 1872. By the 1890s, the Yellowstone cutthroat trout fishery in the Yellowstone River and Yellowstone Lake were well known and being promoted in national guidebooks.|$|E
50|$|Delano was {{the first}} Secretary of the Interior {{to be in charge}} of <b>Yellowstone,</b> America's first <b>national</b> park. The charges of {{misconduct}} and lax management made during Delano's tenure at Interior did not include the new park, the management of which was seen as a success. Among its features, it outlawed poaching wildlife and served as a haven for small numbers of free roaming bison left after the slaughter of the great herds. In 1916, Congress created the National Park Service to federally protect and administer <b>Yellowstone</b> and other <b>national</b> parks; Delano had proposed creation of the agency in 1874. Yellowstone today generates around 4 million visitors per year.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Yellowstone</b> Trail, a <b>national</b> highway {{stretching}} from Albany, New York, to Seattle, was located through the Yakima Valley in 1917 and 1918. It crossed the Fallon Bridge between Richland and West Richland and then proceeded directly west to Kiona.|$|R
50|$|The Oregon-Washington Railroad and Navigation Company {{built a new}} {{railroad}} {{across the}} Yakima River from Kiona in 1907. The new community of Benton City sprang up around it. Beginning in 1917, the <b>Yellowstone</b> Trail, a <b>national</b> highway from Massachusetts to Seattle, was routed through Kiona.|$|R
5|$|At least 1,283 geysers have {{erupted in}} <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park, Wyoming, United States, {{and an average}} of 465 geysers are active there in a given year. A geyser's eruptive {{activity}} may change or cease due to ongoing mineral deposition within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby hot springs, earthquake influences, and human intervention.|$|E
5|$|Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort, {{established}} in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department {{was unable to}} effectively manage the park. Administration {{was transferred to the}} War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park headquarters, the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, the U.S. Geological Survey, <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park, and the University of Utah {{created the}} Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO), a {{partnership}} for long-term {{monitoring of the}} geological processes of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field, for disseminating information concerning the potential hazards of this geologically active region.|$|E

Caribou-Targhee <b>National</b> Forest borders the parkway on the west and Bridger-Teton National Forest and the Teton Wilderness forms the eastern border.|$|R
50|$|Banff National Park {{had been}} {{established}} in 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve. Expanded in 1887 as Rocky Mountains Park under the Rocky Mountains Park Act the area became the first national park in Canada, and the second in North America behind <b>Yellowstone.</b> As a <b>national</b> park the controlling authority became the Federal Government of Canada, rather than the province of Alberta.|$|R
5|$|Yellowstone {{ranks among}} the most popular {{national}} parks in the United States. Since the mid-1960s, at least 2 million tourists have visited the park almost every year. Average annual visitation increased to 3.5 million during the ten-year period from 2007 to 2016, with a record of 4,257,177 recreational visitors in 2016. July is the busiest month for <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park. At peak summer levels, 3,700 employees work for <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park concessionaires. Concessionaires manage nine hotels and lodges, with a total of 2,238 hotel rooms and cabins available. They also oversee gas stations, stores and most of the campgrounds. Another 800 employees work either permanently or seasonally for the National Park Service.|$|E
5|$|After {{living in}} Colorado for seven months, Gattis {{then moved to}} Dallas with his brother, where they worked as janitors for Datamatics Global Services. He met a New Age spiritual advisor there, and on her advice, he {{followed}} her to Taos, New Mexico. There, {{he lived in a}} hostel and worked at a ski resort. Three months later, he moved to California to find more spiritual gurus. Gattis also moved to Wyoming, where he worked at <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|Craters of the Moon is {{in south-central}} Idaho, midway between Boise and <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park. The lava field reaches southeastward from the Pioneer Mountains. Combined U.S. Highway 20–26–93 {{cuts through the}} northwestern part of the {{monument}} and provides access to it. However, the rugged landscape of the monument itself remains remote and undeveloped, with only one paved road across the northern end.|$|E
25|$|Black bears do {{compete with}} cougars over carcasses. Like brown bears, they will {{sometimes}} steal kills from cougars. One {{study found that}} both bear species visited 24% of cougar kills in <b>Yellowstone</b> and Glacier <b>National</b> Parks, usurping 10% of carcasses. Another study found that black bears visited 48% of cougar kills in summer in Colorado, and 77% of kills in California. As a result, the cats spend more time killing and less time feeding on each kill.|$|R
50|$|The Lincoln Highway was {{inspired}} by the Good Roads Movement. In turn, the success of the Lincoln Highway and the resulting economic boost to the governments, businesses and citizens along its route inspired the creation of many other named long-distance roads (known as National Auto Trails), such as the <b>Yellowstone</b> Trail, <b>National</b> Old Trails Road, Dixie Highway, Jefferson Highway, Bankhead Highway, Jackson Highway, Meridian Highway and Victory Highway. Many of these named highways were supplanted by the United States Numbered Highways system of 1926. Most of the 1928 Lincoln Highway route became U.S. Route 30 (US 30), with portions becoming US 1 in the East and US 40, US 50 and US 93 in the West. Since 1928, many sections of US 30 have been re-aligned with new bypasses; therefore, today's US 30 aligns with less than 25% of the original 1913-28 Lincoln Highway routes.|$|R
5000|$|Various bills {{intended}} to transfer federal public lands to western states had been proposed after 1932, all failing to garner much attention, let alone action. Among key objections to such transfers were the increasing {{value to the}} federal treasury of mineral lease receipts and complaints that the [...] "crown jewels" [...] of the national lands holdings, the National Parks, could not be managed adequately or fairly by individual states. <b>Yellowstone</b> and Yosemite <b>National</b> Parks {{were considered to be}} national treasures, and few legislators would concur with turning them over to the states.|$|R
5|$|Goat Rocks {{obtained}} {{its name}} from a population of mountain goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer are especially common.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Major William A. Welch ordered 75 elk from <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park; however, {{some had}} died en route. The {{remaining}} elk {{were kept in}} a wired cage between Arden and Southfields. By 1935, some of the animals were still alive. However, by 1942, all of the elk had died. The remaining area {{is now known as}} the Elk's Pen Trailhead, which serves the Appalachian and ArdenSurebridge Trails. The remains of the pen still currently stand.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Grand Teton National Park started {{requiring}} all {{boats to}} display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal {{issued by the}} Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park boat permit. In {{an effort to keep}} the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the Zebra mussel and whirling disease, boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self-certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer.|$|E
50|$|In 1872, the world's first {{national}} park was established at <b>Yellowstone.</b> Another fifty-seven <b>national</b> parks {{and hundreds of}} other federally managed parks and forests have since been formed. Wilderness areas have been established around the country to ensure long-term protection of pristine habitats. Altogether, the U.S. government regulates 1,020,779 square miles (2,643,807 km2), 28.8% of the country's total land area. Protected parks and forestland constitute most of this. As of March 2004, approximately 16% of public land under Bureau of Land Management administration was being leased for commercial oil and natural gas drilling; public land is also leased for mining and cattle ranching.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hotel was}} {{built as a}} [...] "destination resort", {{providing}} {{a high level of}} comfort and luxury standing literally {{on the edge of the}} wilderness, 20 ft from the rim of the canyon. The El Tovar was one of the first such hotels in national parks, part of a trend in which railroads would build large hotels in newly-accessible scenic locations like <b>Yellowstone</b> and Glacier <b>National</b> Parks, stimulating tourist traffic, necessarily railborne, to those destinations. The railroads consciously employed architectural design in keeping with the image they wished to convey, a superficially rustic resort that provided a comfortable retreat.|$|R
5|$|Harding's {{political}} advisers {{had given}} him a physically demanding schedule, even though the president had ordered it cut back. In Kansas City, Harding spoke on transportation issues; in Hutchinson, Kansas, agriculture was the theme. In Denver, he spoke on Prohibition, and continued west making a series of speeches not matched by any president until Franklin Roosevelt. Harding had become a supporter of the World Court, and wanted the U.S. to become a member. In addition to making speeches, he visited <b>Yellowstone</b> and Zion <b>National</b> Parks, and dedicated a monument on the Oregon Trail at a celebration organized by venerable pioneer Ezra Meeker and others.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many species}} of the genus Suillus, S.brevipes is edible, and the {{mushroom}} is considered choice by some. The odor is mild, and the taste mild or slightly acidic. Field guides typically recommended to remove the slimy cap cuticle, and, in older specimens, the tube layer before consumption. The mushrooms are common in the diet of grizzly bears in <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest {{forms the}} eastern {{boundary}} of <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances {{to the park}} are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway {{is the only one}} of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|The Clause {{has led to}} {{very little}} litigation, {{in part because of}} its overlap (as a {{practical}} matter) with the venue provision of Article Three and Rule 18 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Further, {{with the exception of the}} District of Wyoming, which includes the portions of <b>Yellowstone</b> <b>National</b> Park in Idaho and Montana, no federal judicial district includes the territory of two or more states (although the short-lived District of Potomac once did).|$|E
500|$|With {{conflicting}} claims over {{discovery of}} hot springs in Banff, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald decided {{to set aside}} a small reserve of [...] around the hot springs at Cave and Basin as a public park known as the Banff Hot Springs Reserve in 1885. Under the Rocky Mountains Park Act, enacted on 23 June 1887, the park was expanded to [...] and named Rocky Mountains Park. This was Canada's first national park, and the third established in North America, after <b>Yellowstone</b> and Mackinac <b>National</b> Parks. The Canadian Pacific Railway built the Banff Springs Hotel and Lake Louise Chalet to attract tourists and {{increase the number of}} rail passengers.|$|R

The organisation aims to create a network of European wilderness areas where wilderness and high quality tourism facilities are balanced with environmental protection and sustainable local development. It attempts to achieve this through a process of auditing and verification, enabling it to certify parks owned by partners as meeting particular standards, combined with political advocacy on the local and European level.|$|R
