500|$|Hillman {{also had}} a hand in writing the album's opening track, [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a Rock 'n' Roll Star". [...] With its satirical and sarcastic lyrics, the song was an acerbic, but good-natured swipe at the success of {{manufactured}} pop bands like The Monkees. [...] However, Tim Connors has stated that [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] also suggests certain ironies due to pre-fabricated aspects of the Byrds' own origin, including drummer Michael Clarke having been initially recruited for his good looks, rather than for his musical ability. [...] As a result of this, music journalist David Fricke has noted that some fans have mistaken [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] for an autobiographical song. [...] Hillman's driving bassline and McGuinn's chiming twelve-string Rickenbacker guitar riff form the core of the song, with the production being rounded off by the sound of screaming teenage fans, which had been recorded at a Byrds' concert in Bournemouth during the band's 1965 English tour. [...] South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela contributed the trumpet solo featured in the song, which represented the first use of brass on a Byrds' recording. [...] Masekela and the Byrds would later perform [...] "So <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> a Rock 'n' Roll Star" [...] together at the Monterey Pop Festival on June 17, 1967.|$|E
