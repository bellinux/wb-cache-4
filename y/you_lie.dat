Another medley, consisting of [...] "Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)" [...] and [...] "I Need a Doctor", was {{performed a}}t the 2011 Grammy Awards. [...] While the Chicago Sun-Times considered the track an unnecessary sequel, the BBC reviewer James Skinner wrote, Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)' even bests the original, Eminem's verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited {{about him in the}} first place. But it is Rihanna's vocal—at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable—that anchors the song".|$|E

500|$|On November 3, 2010, an {{alternative}} version titled [...] "Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)" [...] leaked onto the Internet. Rihanna {{is the lead}} vocalist and Eminem is a featured guest. The song mainly views matters from Rihanna's perspective {{and is based on}} Grey's demo. Rihanna agreed to record a sequel despite initially thinking [...] "the original couldn't be beaten". She said that the sequel involved less production, with only piano and drums. It is the eleventh and final track on her 2010 studio album Loud. Grey's version appears on her 2012 extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey and her 2013 studio album Don't Look Down as [...] "Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part III)".|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles of The New York Times {{said that}} “Loud works the pop gizmos as neatly as any album this year, {{maintaining}} the Rihanna brand. But the album has a hermetic, cool calculation until {{it gets to}} 'Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II),' her take on the tortured hit she shared with Eminem. 'It’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied,' she sings. A lone piano humanizes her first vocals, and she rides the ascending power ballad to a pained resolve; then Eminem delivers new verses in a spiraling rage. It’s purely theatrical, but it’s also, for a moment, raw. Christopher Richards of The Washington Post said that [...] "With 'Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II),' the maniac-mouthed rapper is limited to just one verse, giving Rihanna the space to take ownership of the proceedings. Will the real Rihanna please stand up? She does -- and she sounds as remote as ever." [...] James Skinner of BBC Online viewed 'Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)' as being even better than the original. He said, [...] "Eminem’s verse exuding the kind of volatile, simmering menace that got everyone so excited {{about him in the}} first place. But it is Rihanna’s vocal – at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable – that anchors the song, and Loud itself, elevating it from a hit-and-miss collection into something oddly arresting." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Jones of USA Today gave a mixed {{review of}} the collaboration, [...] commenting, [...] "Eminem puts in a cameo on 'Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)', which extends, but doesn't really add, to their earlier hit about a {{tortured}} relationship from his Recovery album." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave a negative {{review of the}} song, stating, [...] "She collaborated with Eminem this summer on the controversial '"Love the Way You Lie"', a song and hotly debated video conflating wild passion with crazed assault. She returns to this on [...] "Loud" [...] with [...] "Love the Way <b>You</b> <b>Lie</b> (Part II)", {{an extension of the}} melody and the arson metaphor, in which Eminem reappears with more histrionic rapping about hating her, loving her, hitting her and hugging her. It's an unnecessary sequel that further muddies the issue: Is this a social statement, or merely an artistic expression about some truly troubled and confused people." ...|$|E
