500|$|... "Adore You" [...] is a pop and R ballad, which {{lasts for}} four minutes and 38 seconds. The song {{performs}} in common time, at a tempo of 60 beats per minute. Played {{in the key}} of C major, the chord structure of C—Fmaj7—Am is followed throughout, and Cyrus's vocal range spans from G3 to A4. Its lyrics discuss [...] "power imbalance in love"; in the chorus, she states her affection towards her boyfriend through the lines [...] "When you say <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> / Know I need you more / Boy, I adore you", although Kyle Fowle of Slant Magazine felt that Cyrus' reliance in her partner is admittedly detrimental to her personal well-being as the song continues.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E
500|$|In Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner {{writes that}} Bob {{is built into}} a highbrow snob and {{conservative}} Republican so that the writers can continually use him as a strawman and pincushion. He represents high culture while Krusty represents low culture, and Bart, stuck in between, always wins out. In the book Leaving Springfield, David L. G. Arnold comments that Bart {{is a product of}} a [...] "mass-culture upbringing" [...] and thus is Bob's enemy. Frustrated by his early role as the target of [...] "Krusty's cheap gags", Bob frames Krusty and takes over the show. He changes the content of that show to present readings of classic literature and segments examining the emotional lives of pre-teens. He believes that by exposing the kids to high culture he will improve their lives. Arnold writes that [...] "Bob's own conscience and morality are clearly unaffected by the high culture he represents." [...] He also tries to [...] "manipulate the tastes of the masses" [...] by becoming a criminal mastermind. Arnold believes that this is most apparent in [...] "Sideshow Bob Roberts", wherein he rigs the election to become the mayor of Springfield. When accused of election fraud, he rants, [...] "Your guilty consciences may force you to vote Democratic, but secretly you yearn for a cold-hearted Republican who’ll cut taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king! <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>me,</b> Springfield!" [...] He considers himself a member of the social elite, and happily uses Machiavellian methods to acquire and maintain power.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, McAdams starred {{with her}} The Family Stone co-star Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford in the comedy Morning Glory. She played a {{television}} producer attempting {{to improve the}} poor ratings of a morning television program. The film was billed as a starring vehicle for McAdams. She initially felt she was unsuited to the role saying, [...] "I'm not funny. So I said, 'if <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> to be funny, {{you might want to}} look somewhere else'". The film's director Roger Michell had a number of dinners with McAdams and persuaded her to join the cast. Since working with Keaton, McAdams has described her as a mentor figure. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said McAdams [...] "gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for" [...] while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt she played [...] "as lovable a lead as anyone since Amy Adams in Junebug" [...] in an otherwise [...] "routine" [...] movie. Lou Lumenick of the New York Post was impressed by [...] "her gift for physical comedy", as was Varietys Andrew Barker. While Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt she [...] "plays her role exceptionally well" [...] and is [...] "effortlessly likable", it called on Hollywood to give her parts [...] "worthy" [...] of her talent. [...] "Ms.McAdams has to rely on her dimples to get by. She does, but she could do better." [...] The film was a modest commercial success, grossing $58million worldwide from a production budget of $40million. McAdams later expressed her disappointment that the film failed to find a larger audience.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Day" [...] is a pop song {{featuring}} {{an upbeat}} rhythm and synths. The song has gathered comparisons to the Katy Perry song [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)" [...] (2010) and music by David Guetta for its dance themes. In the introduction Roberts sings [...] "Could it be my lucky day?"; the track continues with [...] "Just light the first spark, {{and watch the}} fireworks explode. Boom, Boom, Baby", {{in what has been}} described by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy as a [...] "60s-swing-meets-East-London vibe". Roberts' voice has been described by Katherine St Asaph of Pop Dust as a [...] "springy" [...] vibrato, with breathy background vocals featuring sounds effect including repeated kissing noises. Roberts sings about falling in love with someone, as she sings: [...] "Aah, say that you love me, say that <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> too... best you ever had. It could be so easy, for you to please me, baby. So how come you tease me?". Roberts discussed the track on her blog, commenting that its lyrical content alludes to a boy that initially does not share the same feelings as his partner, [...] "but in the end you win him over and it's your lucky day. You can take it however you want though, maybe you won on the scratch cards and so you had a lucky day, that kind of thing". Roberts described it as a [...] "romantic reference" [...] with a [...] "down-beat track underneath", and in contrast called the top-line of the track [...] "quite cute and girly". A remix of the song was producer by band White Lies, and debuted on The Guardian. The 90s-themed concept incorporates house music, with [...] "chunky" [...] beats and [...] "twinkly" [...] synths to the original instrumental of the song.|$|E

2500|$|In Week 11, the Lions {{hosted the}} Cleveland Browns in a non-conference shootout. The Browns built a big {{lead in the}} first quarter, scoring first with a 44-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. After a 31-yard Jason Hanson field goal, Cleveland scored 21 points on Brady Quinn touchdowns to Mohamed Massaquoi (59 yards), Chansi Stuckey (40 yards), Joshua Cribbs (four yards). The Lions {{answered}} with three consecutive TD passes from Matthew Stafford to Aaron Brown (26 yards) and Kevin Smith (25 yards) and a 75-yard catch and run TD for Calvin Johnson. The Browns responded with a 29-yard field goal just before halftime. In the 3rd quarter Will Heller of the Lions caught a one-yard TD pass. The Browns received a safety when Stafford was tackled in his own end zone and called for intentional grounding. The Browns retook the lead on a two-yard TD catch by Michael Gaines and a Jamal Lewis two-point conversion. Stafford was intercepted on the next Lions possession, but the Lions stopped the Browns on 4th and 5. Then they drove 88 yards. With 2 seconds left, Stafford raced out of the pocket and threw a pass {{into the end zone}} which was intercepted by Brodney Pool, but the pick was nullified on a Hank Poteat pass interference penalty, giving the Lions one more play with no time left on the clock. [...] Stafford was brutally hit by two Browns defenders on the play, and suffered {{what turned out to be}} a major shoulder separation of his left (non-throwing) arm; he had to come out for the final play and backup Daunte Culpepper went in, but the Browns called time-out; under NFL rules injured players must come out for one play, and the Browns timeout thus made Stafford eligible to return to the field; he told the coaches he wanted to return for the final play (pleading to coaches [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>me</b> to throw the ball, I can throw the ball") and was allowed to go back in. He then threw a touchdown to Brandon Pettigrew, and Jason Hanson tacked on the extra point for the win. Stafford became the youngest QB to throw five touchdown passes in a game since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. He also set a record for passing yards in a game by a rookie with 422. For his performance, Stafford won NFC Offensive Player of the Week and Pepsi Rookie of the Week.|$|E
