500|$|In {{the first}} scene {{featuring}} Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, comedian Steve Love was cast {{as one of the}} Brotherhood members killed by the Hound. Love previously had become known for his impressions of various Game of Thrones characters, uploading the video to YouTube, which ultimately resulted in his appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Following the appearance, Love stated that he had received an email from Benioff offering him a part in the show, saying [...] "I broached the subject by sending them an email back saying 'Listen I don't know what <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> are for me but it would really mean a lot to me if I could have one of those trademark Game of Thrones gruesome death scenes, and they wrote back saying 'Actually Steve, that was exactly what we had in mind for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Multiple {{references}} {{are made to}} the Star Wars saga throughout the episode. Chuck directly compares their attempting to sneak in to Vivian's base to the same method used by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to rescue Princess Leia in the original film, by referring to the bound Casey as [...] "Chewie." [...] During the same scene Casey mutters [...] "I have a bad feeling about this," [...] a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his [...] "Chewie" [...] reference, and by Casey, who says, [...] "This {{is what happens when}} you draw <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> from Star Wars." [...] Chuck and Morgan also make use of [...] "The Imperial March" [...] as a means to prepare Morgan for his mission to pose as a villain while infiltrating a meeting with Vivian.|$|E

[...] First Man and First Woman said nothing. [...] Coyote said, [...] "You believe that I spoiled your living in the lower worlds, but it is not true. Now I will spoil <b>your</b> <b>plans.</b> The path of the sun and the path of the moon will not return to their beginning after 12 months. [...] The twelve months of the sun will be 13 months of the moon. Sometimes frost will come early, and sometimes it will remain late. [...] Sometimes the rains will not come, and you will have to summon the baby of the Big Water Creature to bring water." [...] And he left them.|$|E

2500|$|Starting on February 23, the Confederate forces reached Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13, but due {{to their}} slow advance they failed to capture most of the Union {{supplies}} located at these cities. The slow advance also allowed reinforcements from Colorado {{under the command of}} Colonel John Slough to reach Fort Union. Since he had been commissioned colonel before Paul was commissioned the same rank, Slough claimed seniority and took command of the fort. Canby had already ordered Paul to [...] "not move from Fort Union to meet me until I advise you of the route and point of junction." [...] After learning of the change in command, Canby told Slough to [...] "advise me of <b>your</b> <b>plans</b> and movements, that I may cooperate." [...] He also instructed Slough to [...] "harass the enemy by partisan operations. Obstruct his movements and cut off his supplies." [...] Slough interpreted this as an authorization to advance, which he did with [...] men from the fort's garrison. The Union and Confederate forces met at the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force through the pass, but had to retreat following the destruction of their wagon train, which contained nearly all of their supplies and ammunition. Sibley pulled his army back to Albuquerque to await reinforcements from Texas. Slough, receiving orders from Canby to return immediately to Fort Union, also retreated, fearing a court martial if he disobeyed this order. Once he arrived at the fort, he resigned his commission and returned to Colorado, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Tappan in command of the regiment and Paul in command of the fort.|$|E
