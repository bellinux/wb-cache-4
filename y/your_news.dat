500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's <b>Your</b> <b>News?,</b> which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could only say phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, who does the voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it. The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates, including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears, were inspired by things Parker drew during high school.|$|E
500|$|Early in the case, {{political}} commentator {{and columnist}} Arianna Huffington wrote, [...] "If {{you were to}} get <b>your</b> <b>news</b> only from television, you'd think the top issue facing our country right now is an 18-year-old girl named Natalee who went missing in Aruba. Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, what a relief, now {{we can get back}} to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{different}} video posted to YouTube, Anonymous addresses news organizations covering {{the conflict and}} criticizes media reporting of the incident. In the video, Anonymous criticizes the media specifically for not mentioning objections by the group to certain controversial aspects {{of the history of}} the Church of Scientology, and cited past incidents including the death of Lisa McPherson: [...] "We find it interesting that you did not mention the other objections in <b>your</b> <b>news</b> reporting. The stifling and punishment of dissent within the totalitarian organization of Scientology. The numerous, alleged human rights violations. Such as the treatment and events that led to the deaths of victims of the cult such as Lisa McPherson." [...] Lisa McPherson was a Scientologist who died in 1995 under controversial circumstances. Initially, the Church of Scientology was held responsible and faced felony charges in her death. The charges were later dropped and a civil suit brought by McPherson's family was settled in 2004. This second video was removed on January 25, 2008, YouTube citing a [...] "terms of use violation". Organizers of the February 10, 2008, Project Chanology protests against the Church of Scientology told the St. Petersburg Times the event was timed to coincide with the birthday of Lisa McPherson.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their trip}} to Miami, Sloan and Thompson began {{assembling}} their ideas. They organized a powerpoint project, titled, The Miami Project, {{and began a}} series of presentations in their local offices at the Poynter Institute. Their colleagues were interested yet unenthusiastic about the project. In the spring of 2004, while preparing for an annual Online Leaders seminar at the Institute, they were asked to present it again. This time, they decided to present the story {{from the perspective of the}} future, as if it had already happened. They assembled the first version of the film late one night in Poynter's visual journalism lab, on an iMac G4 running Final Cut Pro. The narrative was met with enthusiasm by the conference participants, and they soon began revising and polishing their presentation, this time using Macromedia Flash. They kept presenting it, introducing the film dramatically â€“ gliding into rooms wearing tin foil hats. They always followed the movie with the question: [...] "If this is what the year 2014 looks like, what are you going to do today to make sure <b>your</b> <b>news</b> organization doesn't get sidelined? How do you make sure you can play in this environment?" ...|$|E
