500|$|Jay-Z was {{initially}} skeptical about signing Rihanna after he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] {{was too big}} for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". The audition resulted in Rihanna signing a six-album record deal with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, {{on the same day}} of the audition, with Jay-Z saying [...] "There's only two ways out. Out the door after <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> this deal. Or through this window ...", meaning {{that he was not going}} to let her leave without signing a record deal.|$|E

500|$|Wolfenstein: The New Order {{makes use}} of an {{original}} score that reflects the alternative universe depicted in the game. [...] "We wanted to identify with different sounds that were kind of iconic, 1960s sounds, and then do our own twist on {{them to make a}} sound authentic enough that it felt realistic," [...] said Hines. The team placed a high importance on the game's music. During the game's development, composer Mick Gordon traveled to Sweden to meet with the team, and he spotted the game over three days, partly collaborating with both Fredrik Thordendal and Richard Devine. Gordon expressed the difference in composing the soundtrack for Wolfenstein: The New Order compared to other games: [...] "Usually <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> onto a project and then you're given a list of 150 battle cues to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Shannon's flashbacks in [...] "Abandoned" [...] {{were used}} to allow the {{audience}} {{to get to a}} [...] "really emotional level with the character, [...] finally understand ... why she was the way she was." [...] Her death was planned before the start of season two, as the producers wanted the survivors in the tail section of the plane and the survivors of the fuselage to be forced to come together under difficult circumstances. Her death was also used to [...] "spin Sayid off in another direction." [...] Damon Lindelof commented [...] "It's sort of understood on Lost that that's what <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> up for. There's going to be constant character turnover, because the stakes on the Island are life-or-death." [...] Lindelof felt an [...] "intense, emotional sense of loss" [...] when watching her death. In her post-death appearance in [...] "Collision," [...] Maggie Grace was credited as [...] "special guest star." [...] She received the same billing when she returned in season three, appearing in Nikki and Paulo's flashbacks. Carlton Cuse noted [...] "it was really fun for us to actually have Boone and Shannon reemerge in the stories." [...] Shannon was originally in [...] "LA X", the season premiere for the sixth and final season, but had to be written out as Grace was unavailable. The producers eventually arranged for Grace to appear in [...] "The End".|$|E
500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Several {{weeks after}} the release of her debut album, Enya secured a {{recording}} contract with Warner Music UK after Rob Dickins, the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to Enya and found himself playing it [...] "every night before I went to bed". He then met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the Irish Recorded Music Association award ceremony in Dublin, and learned Enya was thinking about signing with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her to Warner Music with a deal worth £75,000, granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums. Dickins said: [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> an act to make money, and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music." [...] Enya then left Atlantic and signed with the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle her American distribution.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1987, the 26-year-old Enya {{released}} her self-titled debut solo album Enya on BBC Records in the United Kingdom and by Atlantic Records in the United States. It was originally produced as the soundtrack to the BBC2 documentary series The Celts, with Enya and her recording partners of five years, manager, arranger and producer Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. It was a mild commercial success, peaking at number 69 in the United Kingdom. Soon after its release Rob Dickins, then chairman of Warner Music UK, became {{a fan of}} the album, playing it [...] "every night before I went to bed". Several weeks later, he met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the year's Irish Recorded Music Association Awards in Dublin where Dickens learned Enya was considering to sign to a rival label, prompting him to attract her to Warner. After a period of negotiations, Dickins signed Enya with a deal worth £75,000, granting her wishes to complete musical and artistic freedom, without interference from management or deadlines to have albums finished. Dickins later said, [...] "Sometimes <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> an act to make money, and sometimes <b>you</b> <b>sign</b> an act to make music. This was clearly the latter ... I just wanted to be involved with this music." [...] In the process, Enya departed from Atlantic and signed to the Warner-led Geffen Records to handle distribution in North America.|$|E

[...] Despite his business interests, Smith explained the attraction of returning to baseball:"It's simply that baseball gets in your blood and you can't get it out. Like being a compulsive gambler or something along those lines. [...] You know when you become a manager, that you're going to be fired sooner or later, {{no matter how good}} a job you feel you are doing.
