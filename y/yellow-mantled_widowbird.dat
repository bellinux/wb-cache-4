5000|$|The <b>yellow-mantled</b> <b>widowbird</b> (Euplectes macroura), {{also known}} as the yellow-backed widow, is a species of bird in the family Ploceidae. It is the type species of the Euplectes genus, {{originally}} named from the city of Ouidah in Benin. Nowadays the name whydah (from [...] "Ouidah") is however applied to some species in the Viduidae.|$|E

The {{breeding}} male is distinguished from the <b>yellow-mantled</b> <b>widowbird</b> by its shorter tail, wing color, lack of yellow on its back, and paler bill. Females are pale below.|$|E

In 1829, William John Swainson created Euplectes, {{and moved the}} widowbirds and bishops from Fringilla into this new genus. Traditionally, Euplectes is thought to contain two clades, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} red-collared widowbird is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with southern red bishop, <b>yellow-mantled</b> <b>widowbird,</b> fan-tailed widowbird, and black-winged red bishop.|$|E
