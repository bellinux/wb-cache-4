5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{more distant}} an object is, the younger it appears: its light has taken longer to reach human observers.

25|$|Currently, {{the leading}} {{candidate}} for a theory going beyond the Big Bang is the theory of cosmic inflation. Developed by Alan Guth {{and others in the}} 1980s, inflation postulates a period of extremely rapid accelerated expansion of the universe prior to the expansion described by the standard Big Bang theory. The theory of cosmic inflation preserves the successes of the Big Bang while providing a natural explanation for some of the mysterious features of the universe. The theory has also received striking support from observations of the cosmic microwave background, the radiation that has filled the sky since around 380,000 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang.|$|E
25|$|Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues {{discussing}} {{something called}} the horizon problem. The microwave background radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, with almost no variance. This seemed very paradoxical because, when the radiation was released about 300,000 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. There {{was no time for}} one end of the cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy can not move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated at billion times the speed of light so the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform even though the parts were not still in touch with each other.|$|E
25|$|The {{first phase}} change of {{hydrogen}} {{in the universe}} was recombination, which occurred at a redshift z=1089 (379,000 <b>years</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang), due to the cooling of the universe {{to the point where}} the rate of recombination of electrons and protons to form neutral hydrogen was higher than the reionization rate. The universe was opaque before the recombination, due to the scattering of photons (of all wavelengths) off free electrons (and, to a significantly lesser extent, free protons), but it became increasingly transparent as more electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. While the electrons of neutral hydrogen can absorb photons of some wavelengths by rising to an excited state, a universe full of neutral hydrogen will be relatively opaque only at those absorbed wavelengths, but transparent throughout most of the spectrum. The Dark Ages of the universe start at that point, because there were no light sources other than the gradually redshifting cosmic background radiation.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, UCSD {{considered}} elevating its athletics to NCAA Division I for all sports. They {{were looking}} to join <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> West Conference.

The spectrum observed by the FIRAS instrument places strong limits on events and scenarios occurring later than 1 <b>year</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bang. <b>The</b> observation of intrinsic anisotropy of the microwave background by the DMR instrument provides a measurement of the magnitude of the gravitational potential fluctuations that existed at decoupling. These potential perturbations were either produced in an inflationary epoch, or else they are initial conditions dating from t = 0. The angular power spectrum of dT is compatible with the inflationary scenario. The observed amplitude of dT can be used to restrict theories of the fundamental structure of matter on micro-physical scales and at energies higher than that of the most energetic cosmic rays.
