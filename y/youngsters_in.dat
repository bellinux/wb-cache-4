He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of <b>youngsters</b> <b>in</b> kickabouts.|$|E

25|$|St. Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel {{was opened}} in 1871 in Breckfield Road North, Everton, Liverpool. The chapel took {{its name from}} its {{location}} {{on the corner of}} Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale. St. Domingo related addresses in Everton have their origins in St. Domingo House, a building built in 1758 by West Indies trader and sugar boiler George Campbell who would frequent the Colony of Santo Domingo and later became Mayor of Liverpool (1763). In 1877 Rev. Ben Swift Chambers was appointed Minister of St. Domingo Chapel. He created a cricket team for the <b>youngsters</b> <b>in</b> the area but, as cricket was only played in summer, there was room for another sport during winter. Thus a football club called St. Domingo F.C. was formed in 1878, the club's first match being a 1-0 home victory over Everton Church Club.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, {{following}} the Kargil War, all Indian channel broadcasts were limited or banned in Pakistan and after Pervaiz Musharraf's coup d'état, {{the media was}} privatised.

Seeing this as an opportunity, bands returned on the music scene and started producing videos with a much richer content.

25|$|Neptune Beach's {{two huge}} outdoor pools hosted {{swimming}} races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian Johnny Weissmuller, who later starred {{as the original}} Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne, who started a chain of health clubs. The park closed down in 1939 because of the Great Depression, {{the completion of the}} San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach {{on the way to the}} Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. <b>Youngsters</b> <b>in</b> town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.|$|E

Despite fitting in well at the club, he was unable to settle in Leeds; due to his poor background he was unable to afford trips back to Wales to visit his family and he was also illiterate so could not write home. After a young apprentice, also from Swansea, failed to impress at Leeds, manager Major Frank Buckley asked Charles to accompany him on the trip back to his hometown. However, due to his homesickness, Charles never returned to Yorkshire once he made it back to Swansea. Instead Swansea Town scout Joe Sykes persuaded Charles to join the club's ground staff.|$|E
