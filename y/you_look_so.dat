500|$|The chorus was {{inspired}} by U2's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour. When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name," [...] the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans. Upon seeing this raw release of emotion, Bono shouted, [...] "Oh <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> beautiful tonight"; later, the band integrated the line into the chorus. The fans' passion, along with the resolve of the city following the attack, were the primary inspirations {{for many of the}} song's other lyrics.|$|E
500|$|While sources {{agree the}} name is a {{reference}} to North Texas' athletics teams, the Mean Green, there are conflicting accounts as to how, when, and why Greene received his [...] "Mean Greene" [...] nickname. When he first arrived at North Texas, the university's moniker was the Eagles. In 1966, Greene's first year on the varsity team, the team adopted the [...] "Mean Green" [...] moniker. Two possible origins of the nickname are two separate cheers that supposedly developed independently during North Texas' 1966 game against UTEP. One cheer was by Sidney Sue Graham, wife of the North Texas sports information director. In response to a tackle by Greene, she blurted out, [...] "That’s the way, Mean Greene!" [...] Bill Mercer, former North Texas play-by-play announcer, states Graham's thought behind the nickname was the Mean Green defense. Meanwhile, in the student section, North Texas basketball players Willie Davis and Ira Daniels, unsatisfied with the unenthusiastic crowd, began to sing, [...] "Mean Green, <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> good to me". The rest of the crowd soon followed. [...] "After that we did it every game," [...] Davis said. [...] "A lot of people later on started associating it with Joe because his last name was Greene, but it actually started with that simple chant that Saturday night at Fouts Field. And that's the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Pink {{wanted to}} call her album Heartbreak Is a Motherfucker, but her record label {{declined}} because of a fear that offensive language would affect sales. She also said {{that she did not}} want the album to look like a break-up album; [...] "There is a lot of that , but there is fun happening too and that's why I named it Funhouse in the end." [...] Pink has also stated that she sees life as a carnival: [...] "Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to be fun, but really they are kind of creepy." [...] "and that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>so</b> distorted that you don’t recognize yourself and you ask yourself, ‘How did I get here? How do I get out of here?’ But, you think that {{you want to do it}} again. That is the same as love and life. It's a metaphor for being in love and for life." [...] This also shows in the title track [...] "Funhouse" [...] where she tells that it used to be fun. [...] "It's about when the box you’re in doesn’t fit anymore, burn that fucker down and start a new one." ...|$|E
