40|$|Abstract—A {{modified}} <b>Y-parameters</b> {{approach is}} proposed {{to model the}} behavior of coupled oscillator arrays (COA’s). A coupling network with tunable coupling strength is proposed, which has a near-constant input conductance, to ensure the oscillation condition under different attenuation levels. The parameters of oscillators and the coupling network are derived on the TSMC 0. 18 µm technology, and their Y parameters are extracted around 10 GHz for illustration. After being verified with full-circuit simulations and other behavior models, including the Adler’s equation and the conventional <b>Y-parameters</b> approach, this method is applied to estimate the maximum allowable number of oscillators that can be coupled together. The inter-element phase shift of a COA is controlled by tuning the free-running frequencies of oscillators at both ends.

50|$|A <b>Y-parameter</b> matrix {{describes}} the behaviour of any linear electrical network {{that can be}} regarded as a black box with a number of ports. A port in this context is a pair of electrical terminals carrying equal and opposite currents {{into and out of the}} network, and having a particular voltage between them. The Y-matrix gives no information about the behaviour of the network when the currents at any port are not balanced in this way (should this be possible), nor does it give any information about the voltage between terminals not belonging to the same port. Typically, it is intended that each external connection to the network is between the terminals of just one port, so that these limitations are appropriate.|$|E
50|$|The {{figure to}} the right depicts a circuit that {{contains}} a <b>y-parameter</b> two-port network. Vin is the input of the circuit and V2 is the output. The two-port equations impose a set of linear constraints between its port voltages and currents. The terminal equations impose other constraints. All these constraints are represented in the SFG (Signal Flow Graph) below the circuit. There is only one path from input to output which is shown in a different color and has a (voltage) gain of -RLy21. There are also three loops: -Riny11, -RLy22, Riny21RLy12. Sometimes a loop indicates intentional feedback {{but it can also}} indicate a constraint on the relationship of two variables. For example, the equation that describes a resistor says that the ratio of the voltage across the resistor to the current through the resistor is a constant which is called the resistance. This can be interpreted as the voltage is the input and the current is the output, or the current is the input and the voltage is the output, or merely that the voltage and current have a linear relationship. Virtually all passive two terminal devices in a circuit will show up in the SFG as a loop.|$|E

40|$|A {{matched filter}} {{technique}} {{is applied to}} the Planck all-sky Compton <b>y-parameter</b> map to measure the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect produced by galaxy groups of different halo masses selected from large redshift surveys in the low-z Universe. Reliable halo mass estimates are available for all the groups, which allows us to bin groups of similar halo masses to investigate how the tSZ effect depends on halo mass over a large mass range. Filters are simultaneously matched for all groups to minimize projection effects. We find that the integrated <b>y-parameter</b> and the hot gas content it implies are consistent with the predictions of the universal pressure profile model only for massive groups above 10 ^ 14 M_, but much lower than the model prediction for low-mass groups. The halo mass dependence found is in good agreement with the predictions of a set of simulations that include strong AGN feedback, but simulations including only supernova feedback significantly over predict the hot gas contents in galaxy groups. Our results suggest that hot gas in galaxy groups is either effectively ejected or in phases much below the virial temperatures of the host halos. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|E

In this model, the UPFC control variables do not depend explicitly on UPFC input and output currents and voltages.

40|$|The dipping low-mass X-ray binary 4 U 1915 - 05 was {{observed}} by Suzaku on 2007 November 8 for a net exposure of 39 ksec. It {{was detected by}} the XIS with a 0. 8 - 10 keV signal rate of 9. 84 + 0. 01 cts/s per camera, and HXD-PIN with a 12 - 45 keV signal rate of 0. 29 +/- 0. 01 cts/s. After removing the periodic dips and an X-ray burst, the 0. 8 - 45 keV continuum was successfully described by an optically thick disk emission with an inner-disk temperature 0. 7 keV and a neutron-star blackbody emission with a temperature 1. 3 keV, on condition that the blackbody component, or possibly the disk emission too, is significantly Comptonized. This successful modeling is consistent with 4 U 1915 - 05 being in a high-soft state in this observation, and implies that its broadband spectrum can be interpreted in the same scheme as for many non-dipping Low-mass X-ray binaries in the soft state. Its bolometric luminosity (0. 02 times the Eddington limit) is relatively low for the soft state, but within a tolerance, if considering the distance and inclination uncertainties. As a high-inclination binary, this source exhibited stronger Comptonization effect, with a larger Comptonizing <b>y-parameter,</b> compared to low and medium inclination binaries. This suggests that the Comptonizing coronae of these objects in the soft state is in an oblate (rather than spherical) shape, extending along the accretion disk plane, because the <b>y-parameter</b> would {{not depend on the}} inclination if the corona were spherical.
