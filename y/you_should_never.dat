500|$|During {{the fall}} session {{in which the}} {{offending}} bills were proposed, police raided an Edmonton office of the Social Credit League and confiscated 4,000copies of a pamphlet called [...] "The Bankers' Toadies", which urged its readers as follows: [...] "My child, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>NEVER</b> say hard or unkind things about Bankers' Toadies. God made snakes, slugs, snails and other creepy-crawly, treacherous and poisonous things. NEVER, therefore, abuse them—just exterminate them!" [...] The pamphlet also listed eight alleged toadies, including Conservative leader Duggan, former Attorney-General John Lymburn, and Senator William Antrobus Griesbach. Powell and Social Credit whip Joe Unwin were charged with criminal libel and counsel to murder. Both were convicted of the former charge. Unwin was sentenced to three months hard labour; Powell was sentenced to six months and deported.|$|E
500|$|Quinn's role as head {{cheerleader}} {{is central}} to understanding her character. Agron {{said that she had}} never had any prior cheer experience before the Pilot. [...] "If I had been , I would've ended up on crutches," [...] she told Emmy magazine. In an interview with HitFix she said, [...] "I have new respect for the craft, because I slightly hurt myself during the pilot, coming down from one of the stunts. It's better now. I didn't tear something in my knee, but I strained it. Knees are very sensitive, I've learned. It's crazy, because I've been dancing since I was three on my toes and all these things. And <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> say this, but I've never injured myself ever. I'd seen gnarly injuries with dance and all these things. You shouldn't say that, though, because every day is an opportunity to fall, hurt yourself, so that was my experience." ...|$|E

500|$|Saadiq's songwriting is {{characterized}} by straightforward romanticism, positive exhortations, pining ballads, and message songs. Christgau interpreted Saadiq's persona on the album to be [...] "a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity" [...] of the song titles, but [...] "never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn't get the extreme cuddling he craves." [...] Patrick Varine of the Observer-Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R lyrics: [...] "there are no thinly-veiled food-sex metaphors or pimp fantasies". His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and, on the album's slower songs, expresses tightly coiled emotions. Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences. He described the album as [...] "basically a series of love songs about music, how falling in love can be easy, but staying true to it can be tricky." [...] He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune: [...] "You {{have to watch out}} for those curves. [...] music comes out, and how do you stay true to what you love? I’m not saying everything has to sound like a '60s record to stay true, but <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> take the relationship lightly." ...|$|E
2500|$|At his {{sentencing}} January 14, 1982, {{the trial}} judge remarked, [...] "My considered opinion is that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> be granted parole {{for the remainder of}} your days. It would be foolhardy to let you at large." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson attests {{that his}} success in boxing came from the {{coaching}} he received from Choynski. The aging Choynski saw natural talent and determination in Johnson and taught him the nuances of defense, stating [...] "A man who can move like <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> {{have to take a}} punch".|$|E

2500|$|New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, {{witnessing}} the first New York sports team championship victory as mayor, praised the hometown team's upset victory, saying; [...] "New York {{has come back}} {{many times in the}} past, and Big Blue proved tonight that <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never,</b> ever, count us out." [...] Many New Yorkers polled the Giants' win to be among the most satisfying championship victories in New York sports history. There were also a series of firsts with the championship, not just for the Giants, but also for the city of New York and the New York metropolitan area. Those firsts were: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} only {{eight months after}} Music of the Sun had been released. Rihanna stated regarding the rapid album succession: [...] "We just {{felt like it was}} time. It made no sense waiting...you should never put time on music. <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> say, [...] "Okay, Music of the Sun has to be out at least {{a year and a half}} before we start with--" [...] No. That's what's great about the music business. When you feel it's time, you just go for it. And we felt like it was time to come up with a new album." [...] "SOS" [...] was included on the soundtrack of the film , where Rihanna made a cameo in the film as herself; her debut single, [...] "Pon de Replay", was also included in the soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's Rod Marsh blamed England coach Keith Fletcher for {{the poor}} {{performances}} and for a negative attitude towards the series, criticising the coach's press conference comments in Adelaide. [...] "A team must always, always, play to win {{and even if you}} think that way <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> say it," [...] he told radio listeners. [...] "'The best we can do is an honourable draw' – what a load of codswallop. If anyone is wondering why England have had such a hard time in Australia, there lies the answer", but Fletcher refused to quit, citing a string of injuries and illnesses that had hampered the tour as the main cause of the team's lack of success and defending the inclusion of Gooch and Gatting, noting that [...] "indsight is a brilliant thing, but there was not one person who would have left Graham at home {{at the start of the}} tour." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 May 2006, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood headlined the Big Ask Live, {{a benefit}} concert in aid of Friends of the Earth's {{campaign}} {{to persuade the}} government to enact a new law on climate change. In 2008, Radiohead commissioned a study to reduce the carbon expended on tour; based on the study, they chose to play at venues supported by public transport, made deals with trucking companies to reduce emissions, used new low-energy LED lighting and encouraged festivals to offer reusable plastics. In the same year, Yorke guest-edited a special climate change edition of Observer Magazine and wrote: [...] "Unlike pessimists such as James Lovelock, I don't believe we are all doomed... <b>You</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> give up hope." [...] In 2009, he performed via Skype at the premier of the environmentalist documentary The Age of Stupid. In December that year, he gained access to the COP 15 climate change talks in Copenhagen by posing as a journalist.|$|E
