At this time the island was {{twice as large as}} today. There is strong genetic evidence for these early people having an origin there.

500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible".

500|$|The clip debuted on MTV {{the week}} ending of October 30, 1994. It opens with each girl {{individually}} {{singing and dancing}} {{in front of a}} brightly-colored background while wearing barely-buttoned and wind-blowing silk pajamas, specifically: Watkins in blue with a pink background, Lopes in red with a blue background, Thomas in pink with a red background with other scenes where both of her colors being color corrected and posted to grey due to artistic directorial reasons. A scene exposing the left lower part of Watkins' breasts also received public attention and the group's acknowledgment. Added in between these takes are a few close-up shots of a blue twirling trumpet. The trio and their accompanied female dancers are later seen in black-and-white shots, practicing the choreography and making fun of Lopes for trying to breakdance while walking on her hands. Thomas called the scene the funniest part to shoot and went on to name it a [...] "classic TLC moment." [...] The dance during the song's chorus was described by VH1's writer Seher Sikandar as the [...] "modified butterfly with the swing-scoop arm" [...] while The Telegraphs Bernadette McNulty instructed: [...] "Feet apart, bounce <b>your</b> <b>knees</b> as low as they will go while winding your hips." [...] In another scene, Watkins is seen at a closed bar singing to an old-fashioned microphone and being backed by a trumpeter, also her love interest, played by Omar Lopez. Throughout the clip, Walkins keeps giving the man an incredulous look that suggests he might be cheating. The video ends with the trio dancing with their heads and jokingly arguing at their viewers. It was Thomas' most favorite scene. An alternative cut for the video had also been made. The original version appeared on three of their video albums CrazyVideoCool (1995), [...] (2003) and Artist Collection (2004), with the first release included excerpts of previously-scrapped versions and commentary from TLC.|$|E
500|$|In the United States, shock-rock pioneer Alice Cooper {{achieved}} mainstream {{success with}} the top five album School's Out (1972), which {{was followed by the}} #1 album Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. Also in 1973, blues rockers ZZ Top released their classic album Tres Hombres and Aerosmith produced their eponymous début, as did Southern rockers Lynyrd Skynyrd and proto-punk outfit New York Dolls, demonstrating the diverse directions being pursued in the genre. Montrose, including the instrumental talent of Ronnie Montrose and vocals of Sammy Hagar and arguably the first all American hard rock band to challenge the British dominance of the genre, released their first album in 1973. Former bubblegum-pop family act the Osmonds recorded two hard rock albums in 1972 and had their breakthrough in the UK with the hard-rock hit [...] "Crazy Horses." [...] Kiss built on the theatrics of Alice Cooper and the look of the New York Dolls to produce a unique band persona, achieving their commercial breakthrough with the double live album Alive! in 1975 and helping to take hard rock into the stadium rock era. In the mid-1970s Aerosmith achieved their commercial and artistic breakthrough with Toys in the Attic (1975), which reached number 11 in the American album chart, and Rocks (1976), which peaked at number three. Blue Öyster Cult, formed in the late 60s, picked up on some of the elements introduced by Black Sabbath with their breakthrough live gold album On Your Feet or on <b>Your</b> <b>Knees</b> (1975), followed by their first platinum album, Agents of Fortune (1976), containing the hit single [...] "(Don't Fear) The Reaper", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts. Journey released their eponymous debut in 1975 and the next year Boston released their highly successful début album. In the same year, hard rock bands featuring women saw commercial success as Heart released Dreamboat Annie and the Runaways débuted with their self-titled album. While Heart had a more folk-oriented hard rock sound, the Runaways leaned more towards a mix of punk-influenced music and hard rock. The Amboy Dukes, having emerged from the Detroit garage rock scene and most famous for their Top 20 psychedelic hit [...] "Journey to the Center of the Mind" [...] (1968), were dissolved by their guitarist Ted Nugent, who embarked on a solo career that resulted in four successive multi-platinum albums between Ted Nugent (1975) and his best selling Double Live Gonzo! (1978).|$|E
