500|$|On Bataan, the {{reaction}} to MacArthur's escape was mixed, with many American and Filipino troops feeling bitter and betrayed. When Wainwright broke the news to his generals [...] "they were all at first depressed by the news â€¦ But I soon saw that they understood just as I understood." [...] Some people with family members in the Philippines were dismayed. One wrote to Roosevelt that [...] "Nothing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> would have broken their morale and that of their parents at home so thoroughly". Wainwright held out on Corregidor until 6 May. To Joseph Goebbels, MacArthur was a [...] "fleeing general", while Benito Mussolini labeled him a coward. Marshall decided {{that the best way}} to counter this was to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Navy's best {{test pilot}}, Captain Eric Brown, chief naval test pilot and {{commanding}} officer of the Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Royal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 noted: [...] "This was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It {{was never meant to}} be a dogfighter, {{it was meant to be}} a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds firing time. Now, in two seconds, you can't sight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. If you want to sight and fire, you need to double that time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{there we}} have passed our winter and our spring,' added Venetia, 'almost as delightfully as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> at Athens.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, Dorothy,' Mr. Singleton exclaimed, when {{he heard}} the story, 'it is {{absolutely}} impossible that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> such a thing.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} boy, with a grave meditative look. [...] "I suppose I may say she's my first, for <b>you</b> know <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it without me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Rufford," [...] {{said the}} sister affectionately, [...] "I congratulate you {{with all my}} heart; I do indeed. I am quite sure that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{better if}} you had been a general. I have Cathelineau's {{permission}} to ask you to ride with me, when you are not engaged in scouting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{should have}} thought that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so now; that is, before long. Will Sir Hugh remain here at Clavering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, sir, I cannot see how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> otherwise," [...] said Aurelia, {{who could}} not bear to hear his tone of self-reproach.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} good, Miss Merton; I have often heard of you too, {{and wanted to}} see you as much as <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to see me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sewell laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "for one thing, if you {{had been}} in love with her, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> anything that would have made the fact clearer." ...|$|R
5000|$|The word 'time' {{is often}} used to replace 'while', for example 'I go {{shopping}} in the city, time my husband's at the football' or 'Time you were fooling about, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been <b>doing</b> your homework'.|$|R
6000|$|... "She wished, perhaps, {{to teach}} you to control your emotions," [...] said Mrs. Neuchatel. [...] "You have known her only an hour, and <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more to your own mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce interposed. [...] "What was the use? <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> nothing. We who {{understand}} these matters make allowances for the reporter's trade. He must {{earn a living}} some way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Featherstone simply, [...] "you {{have given}} us great {{pleasure}} and made us realize the bracing life my son is leading. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> us no favor that would equal this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I {{answered}} proudly; [...] "I {{killed them}} in four shots, and the pauw and koran were flying, not sitting, {{which is more}} than <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> although you are taller, Miss Marie." ...|$|E
60|$|You are an angel, dearest Isa, {{with the}} tact {{of a woman}} of the world. This in {{reference}} to the note you sent me, and your answer. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> better--not at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} matter?" [...] she exclaimed with feeling. [...] "I'm very angry with them. I can't {{let you go}} without saying that I know <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> what <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been wickedly accused of." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{thinks that}} you {{shot at a}} man, not at a beast," [...] replied Miriam; [...] "but I know well that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> this, since that would be against {{the rule of the}} Essenes." ...|$|R
6000|$|Thorn, who was {{not usually}} vociferous in expressing his sentiments, {{appeared}} glad of this diversion, and, after {{a glance at the}} plowed land, strove to smile humorously. [...] "Think <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it any better yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{nurse and}} I were {{discussing}} things, you know," [...] I answered, [...] "and she said <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> without me." [...] Somehow, I {{did not mind}} repeating the words now; clearly {{it could have been}} but Mrs. Fursey's fun.|$|E
6000|$|Louisa denied Tom's {{participation}} in the offence; but her mother stopped her with the conclusive answer, 'Louisa, don't tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Neither <b>you</b> nor I <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{better than}} that, {{even if we}} had been strong enough.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have saved}} my life,' said the strange man, still looking hard in Arthur's face, still holding tightly by his hand. 'If {{you had been}} my own brother, <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more for me than that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I can't stand Lane {{off with}} you two {{and the rest}} behind me I shall deserve all I get, and we must hope for the best," [...] I said. [...] "But if <b>you</b> <b>could</b> handle three teams each <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> all this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to thank you," [...] said Margaret. [...] "It is the very kindest thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> by dear Ethel! the {{greatest}} comfort to us. She will be at peace now, when anything hinders her from going to Cocksmoor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was as well so, Oswald, and doubtless {{your mother}} will break it more easily {{to them than}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> Women are better at such things than men, who are given to speak, bluntly and straight, {{what has to be}} told." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, now, that's singular," [...] pursued Berry. [...] "I {{supposed}} <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{it without}} the least trouble. Well, let's try something a little less difficult. Look me in the eye, and regard yourself as too good, for example, for Miss Carver. Ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{least you}} lose no time, friend Peter; unless you {{had called her}} from her bed and made your offer through the door <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it quicker. Well, well, you ever were a man of deeds, not words, and what says my Margaret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "From {{what you}} said just now," [...] he continued, [...] "I learn {{that it has been}} your desire to perfect your {{education}} in a fashion which <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> here. <b>Have</b> you any distinct aims? I mean, have you any definite ideas as to the future?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had {{happened}} {{to have been in}} Mr. John Ashley's predicament," [...] he persisted, [...] "you do not see how <b>you</b> <b>could</b> conveniently <b>have</b> <b>done</b> away with Mr. Aaron Cohen, pocketed his winnings, and then led the police of your country entirely by the nose, by proving an indisputable alibi?" ...|$|R
