In the bulk of the spectrum Random Matrix Theory predicts the probability distributions of level curvatures to be given by Zakrzewski-Delande expressions [F. von Oppen Phys. Rev. Lett. 73 798 (1994) & Phys. Rev. E 51 2647 (1995); Y. V. Fyodorov and H. -J. Sommers Z. Phys. B 99 123 (1995) ]. Motivated by growing interest in statistics of extreme (maximal or minimal) eigenvalues of disordered systems of various nature, it is natural to ask about the associated level curvatures. I show how calculating the distribution for the curvatures of extreme eigenvalues in GUE ensemble can be reduced to studying asymptotic behaviour of orthogonal polynomials appearing in the recent work C.
