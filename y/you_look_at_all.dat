500|$|Welch and Peyer briefed {{the results}} of their reviews before the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services on 12 February 2008. In {{addition}} to Welch and Peyer, Lieutenant General Daniel Darnell, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Air, Space and Information Operations, and Major General Raaberg testified and answered questions from the Senate committee's members. During the hearing, Welch stated that [...] "the military units responsible for handling the bombs are not properly inspected and, as a result, may not be ready to perform their missions." [...] He added, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the areas and all the ways that we have to store and handle these weapons in order to perform the mission, it just requires, we believe, more resources and more attention than they're getting." [...] Welch's report concluded that the combining of DoD nuclear forces with nonnuclear organizations has led to [...] "markedly reduced levels of leadership whose daily focus is the nuclear enterprise and a general devaluation of the nuclear mission and those who perform the mission." [...] Nevertheless, neither Welch's nor Peyer's reports found any failures with the security of United States nuclear weapons.|$|E
500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E
2500|$|Construction on MD 90 {{began in}} 1970 with the {{construction}} of the bridges over the St. Martin River and Assawoman Bay, which were completed in 1970 and 1971, respectively. [...] The state highway was completed and opened between MD 528 and MD 589 in 1972. [...] Construction west to US 113 commenced in 1973 and west to US 50 in 1974. [...] MD 90 was extended west to US 113, which at the time followed today's MD 575, in 1975. [...] The state highway was completed when the highway opened between US 50 and US 113 in 1976. [...] MD 90's present interchange with US 113 was constructed in 1976. [...] However, the interchange remained unused until US 113 was relocated as a four-lane divided highway from Berlin north past MD 90 in 2000. [...] The interchange ramp with MD 575 was closed and removed shortly after the new interchange opened. Mayor Rick Meehan of Ocean City is currently pushing for dualization of the MD 90 bridge, stating that it [...] "is the quicker way in and out of town, especially if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the development that has taken place along the Route 50 corridor." [...] He also stated that dualization is good for the route for evacuation purposes.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2017 {{follow up}} article in slate {{magazine}} on the Feeling the Future Experiment Bem {{is quoted as}} saying.“I’m all for rigor, but I prefer other people do it. I see its importance—it’s fun for some people—but I don’t have the patience for it. If <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> my past experiments, they were always rhetorical devices. I gathered data to show how my point would be made. I used data {{as a point of}} persuasion, and I never really worried about, ‘Will this replicate or will this not?’ ” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Look {{back for}} the last time, Lucilla, at what this woman has said and done. You will find {{that the idea of}} your marrying Nugent is, under one form or another, always present to her mind. Present alike when she forgets herself, and speaks in a rage--or when she reflects, and speaks with a purpose. At one time, she tells you that you would have fallen in love with Nugent, if you had seen him first. At another time, she stands by while Nugent is personating me to you, and never interferes to stop it. On a third occasion, she sees that you are {{offended}} with me; and triumphs so cruelly in seeing it, that she tells me to my face, your prospect would have been a much happier one, if you had been engaged to marry my brother instead of me. She is asked in writing, civilly and kindly asked, to explain what she means by those abominable words? She has had time to reflect since she spoke them; and what does she do? Does she answer me? No! She contemptuously tosses my letter into the fire-place. Add to these plain facts what you yourself have observed. Nugent has all her admiration; Nugent is her favorite: from the first, she has always disliked and wronged me. Add to this, again, that Nugent (as I know for certain) privately confessed to her that he was himself in love with <b>you.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> these circumstances--and what plain conclusion follows? I ask you once more--Is Madame Pratolungo a slandered woman? or am I right in warning you (as you once warned me) to beware of her?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{hospital}} situations, {{cable management}} can {{be critical to}} preventing medical mistakes. Emergency room nurse manager Pat Gabriel said, [...] "My wish is that we could somehow not have spaghetti on the bed.

5000|$|If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of the {{complicated}} ideas {{that they have}} developed in an infinitesimal amount of time, if you compare to any other of the sciences {{how long it takes}} to get one idea after the other, if you consider all the structures and inventions and complicated things, the ids and the egos, the tensions and the forces, and the pushes and the pulls, I tell you they can't all be there. It's too much for one brain or a few brains to have cooked up in such a short time.|$|E
5000|$|Paul {{has talked}} about his fondness for vintage {{equipment}} in several interviews. One of his favorite pieces of vintage equipment is the Akai S900, which he credits for having a unique sound, saying, [...] "Even though it's big and bulky, nothing sounds like that. It's pretty flexible, it's easy to work, and it's easy to truncate your sample and get things tight...When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> this new technology, everything sounds very sterile. Everything is clean and super quiet. It kind of lacks something. When I plug that in, it's like, 'Wow, this is hip hop.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Since self-discipline as {{you might}} be full aware of is key to {{achieving}} any goal and objectives which will lead to reaching a goal, would not it be useful if we could put our finger on exactly where to begin to raise our personal self-discipline. It is not too difficult when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of the wealth of information the great Scottish men, Andrew Carnegie, and his right hand men, Napoleon Hill, left to humanity. The following several paragraphs are an executive summary type of outline about which of the key habits we can use to revamp figuratively speaking one's own personal self-discipline.|$|E
5000|$|ActionTrip said [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> {{the good}} and bad sides of it, Gilbert Goodmate is still a nice {{adventure}} game that should be played. I {{might have been a}} bit harsh towards it in writing this review, but I sure had fun while playing it. Its technical aspects are definitely far from perfect, but its story and all other things most important in real adventure games make it worth a try", and GameSpy wrote [...] "Gilbert Goodmate is not an epic adventure, it's not technically innovative or genre-bending and it's not particularly original. What it is, is a pleasant, whimsical adventure that provides a leisurely stroll down memory lane for people who yearn for the good old days. If you fit that description, Gilbert Goodmate is a no-brainer must-buy".|$|E
5000|$|Whitam's {{early work}} {{focused on the}} {{sociology}} of religion before he moved into researching commonalities in male homosexuality in different cultures. Whitam told Newsweek, [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> societies, homosexuality occurs at the same rates with {{the same kinds of}} behavior. That suggests something biological going on. The biological evidence has been growing for 20 or more years." [...] He also studied trans women, reporting that in many cultures [...] "these persons regard themselves as homosexuals and are regarded by more masculine homosexuals as a natural part of the homosexual world." [...] Whitam's published books included The Protestant Spanish Community in New York in 1960 and Male Homosexuality in Four Societies: Brazil, Guatemala, the Philippines, and the United States, co-authored with Robin Mathy in 1986. Whitam died in Tempe, Arizona.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{his return}} to Bloomfield Road as manager of Crystal Palace in 2013, Ian Holloway remarked: [...] "I haven’t left much of a legacy, that was my biggest worry really.

6000|$|... "Women {{are human}} beings the same as men, and when they make {{themselves}} beasts {{have got to be}} punished. You can't horsewhip a woman; but if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it <b>all</b> round I don't see that she ought to get off so much better than a man. She is a human creature and ought to be made to feel as a man feels." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{mind being}} shot {{any more than}} another man; but you must take the world as you find it. One young woman treated me awfully rough, to tell the truth. And why am I not to treat another just as roughly? If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it <b>all</b> round, you'll see that I have used them just as they have used me." ...|$|R

5000|$|In a rare {{twist of}} fate, {{nearly all of}} the {{original}} actors cast participated in the entire shoot, despite some road blocks along the way.

I guess when <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> the things that could have gone wrong and didn't, I'm a very lucky man," [...] Bridges told Indie Slate. Additionally, Bridges adopted a flexible mentality in regards to continuity. As the actors aged and evolved, the one factor that remained semi-constant was wardrobe. For example, Griffin, who played Filmore, wore the same suite for 10 years. Dramatic hair and weight change was even accounted for in the storyline. [...] The film was shot on 35mm Kodak short ends using Arri cameras and Zeiss Superspeed prime lenses. The short ends were stock test samples from 1989-1999. The production used minimal on-set lighting, mostly opting for available light. The camera dolly used throughout the production of the film was actually a homemade dolly that Bridges converted from a baby stroller.|$|E
