They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if <b>you</b> <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E
