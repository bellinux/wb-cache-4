40|$|The {{aim of this}} phenomenological {{study was}} to {{discover}} if and how art therapists utilise the creative process {{as a means of}} self-care. Art therapists have an intimate understanding of the creative process as a means of healing and transformation. Yet, recognising how art therapists specifically utilize the creative process for themselves has not been researched, and therefore requires inquiry. The creative process as a means of self-care has implications for increasing the sustainability of art therapists. In order to answer the research questions, a brief survey was sent out, via the internet, to art therapists across Canada. The survey consisted of 8 multiple choice questions regarding art therapists' use of creativity and self-care. From the 133 surveys sent out, 25 surveys were received, and used as the initial research data. In-depth interviews with 3 art therapists, who use the creative process as a means of self-care, provided rich detail in understanding the personal ways in which art therapists use creativity. The findings indicate that <b>yes,</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>extent,</b> art therapists do use the creative process as a means of self-care. The findings of this study have provided an art therapy continuum which illustrates the many ways in which creativity is utilized for self-care...|$|E
30|$|Pre- and post- {{questionnaires}}. Two {{questionnaires were}} constructed and validated before being distributed {{among the participants}} by consulting the items with several experts in the field. One questionnaire was administered {{at the beginning and}} the other {{at the end of the}} writing course. These questionnaires were used to evaluate the subjects' attitudes toward peer assessment. They included 9 questions on a 3 -point Likert scale with responses of yes, no, not sure in the pre questionnaire and <b>yes,</b> no, and <b>to</b> <b>some</b> <b>extent</b> in the post questionnaire. The reliability of each questionnaire was calculated and turned to be 0.7 and 0.76 for the pre- and post- questionnaires, respectively.|$|R
