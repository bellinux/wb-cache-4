Krzyzewski met Amaker's mother and said, [...] "Mrs. Amaker, <b>your</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> going to look great in Duke blue." [...] At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the Maryland Terrapins because his sister Tami went to the University of Maryland, College Park and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard John Lucas. [...] He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker's first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Mozart's string quartets are {{considered}} the pinnacle of the classical art. The six string quartets that he dedicated to Haydn, his friend and mentor, inspired the elder composer to say to Mozart's father, [...] "I tell you before God as an honest man that <b>your</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> the greatest composer known to me either in person or by reputation. He has taste, and, what is more, the most profound knowledge of composition." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mozart met Joseph Haydn in Vienna around 1784, {{and the two}} composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they {{sometimes}} played together in an impromptu string quartet. Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn (K.387, K.421, K.428, K.458, K.464, and K.465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's Opus 33 set from 1781. Haydn in 1785 told Mozart's father: [...] "I tell you before God, and as an honest man, <b>your</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> the greatest composer known to me by person and repute, he has taste and what is more the greatest skill in composition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1785 Leopold visited Wolfgang and Constanze in Vienna, at a {{time when}} his son's career success was at its peak. He {{witnessed}} first hand his son's success as a performer, and on February 12 heard Joseph Haydn's widely quoted words of praise, upon hearing the string quartets Wolfgang dedicated to him, [...] "Before God and as an honest man I tell you that <b>your</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> the greatest composer known to me either in person or by name: He has taste, and, furthermore, the most profound knowledge of composition." [...] The visit was the last time that Leopold saw his son, though they continued to correspond, and Wolfgang sometimes sent copies of his piano concertos and string quartets for Leopold and Nannerl to perform with friends.|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, Duty offered Wise some {{cigarettes}} {{in exchange for}} allowing himself to be tied up to make the guards think {{that he had been}} taken hostage, with the goal of having Duty transferred into administrative security. The prosecutor's report stated that after tying Wise's hands and feet behind his back, Duty strangled him to death with a shoelace. Duty then wrote a letter to Wise's mother Mary, in which he stated: [...] "Well {{by the time you get}} this letter you will already know that <b>your</b> <b>son</b> <b>is</b> dead. I know now because I just killed him an hour ago. Gee you'd think I'd be feeling some remorse but I'm not." [...] The letter was intercepted at the prison.|$|E
