[...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit.

500|$|In 2001, Fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th Entertainment with Charles [...] "Chilly" [...] Patton. 1st & 15th is an {{independent}} record label separate from Atlantic Records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates. [...] Although his albums are released by Atlantic since he is under contract with them, most of his works are usually produced by 1st & 15th and its in house producers. Although Fiasco was initially to serve as vice-president, he became CEO after Patton was convicted on drug charges. Fiasco and singer Matthew Santos {{were two of the}} most recognizable signed artists. In November 2009, Fiasco announced he would discontinue the 1st & 15th label: [...] "It was just such a 'this isn't right for you right now. This isn't gonna work for you right now. You need to be focused on you. Do you really want that, do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> the capacity to do it?'"

500|$|Cut {{into the}} western wall of the debating chamber are {{laminated}} glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a human dimension to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create {{the impression that the}} chamber is never unoccupied. Natural light diffuses into the chamber and is provided by [...] "glass fins" [...] which run down from light spaces in the ceiling. Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building. Such is the level of craftsmanship, a result of the union of Miralles' inventive designs, superb detailing by RMJM and excellent craftsmanship in execution, that Jencks was prompted to state that the [...] is [...] "an arts and crafts building, designed with high-tech flair. <b>You</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> {{to go back to the}} Houses of Parliament in London to get interior design of such a high creative level—in fact, it is more creative".|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, or do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only once I was in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dweller on the Threshold" [...] and [...] "Aryan Mist" [...] are {{credited}} {{to the religious}} writings of Alice Bailey. Her book discusses the New Age ideas of [...] "glamours" [...] or [...] "mental illusions", which formed a fog that covers the [...] "spiritual warrior" [...] and the [...] "Aryan race" [...] from the world. When the [...] "dweller on the threshold" [...] was covered with {{the light of the}} soul or [...] "Angel of Presence" [...] illumination came. Some of these ideas were quoted in the two Morrison compositions, both co-written with Hugh Murphy. In 1982 Morrison revealed in an interview: [...] "I've read Glamour four or five times, and I get different things out of it each time. 's saying a lot of things. It's depth reading. You might read it on Wednesday and on Thursday you pick it up again and get an entirely different thing.

2500|$|After scoring both Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, Brian Tyler {{was rumored}} {{for several months}} to be scoring The Avengers sequel , before officially signing on to the film in March 2014. He said that his {{template}} for the film was game changing scores such as those for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark, feeling that [...] "You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score, ultimately receiving co-composer credit. On working with Elfman, Tyler said, [...] "The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, {{and that was something}} we worked really hard on doing." [...] Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly. Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for Age of Ultron [...] "than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> to set everyone up". He gave Hulk's farewell to Black Widow, Quicksilver's sacrifice, and the time spent at Hawkeye's farm as examples of this.|$|E
2500|$|She {{capitalized}} on the attention received from her duet with artist Andy Hui, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>have</b> {{me in your}} heart?" [...] (其實你心裡有沒有我), winning the 1993 Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards with that song. Cheng then went through a transformation, dying her hair orange, changing her style. Her 4th studio album [...] "Sammi's Happy Maze" [...] (鄭秀文的快樂迷宮) was also released, which include the hit single [...] "Chotto Matte" [...] (Chotto 等等). Her new image fitted well with the new single, which was a remake of a Japanese song by Maki Ohguro. The success helped Sammi and boosted her singing career. In 1994 she continued to capitalize on her wild, new image. Her first album of that year was [...] "Big Revenge" [...] (大報復). The album included the hit [...] "Ding Dong" [...] (叮噹), which became one of Sammi's signature songs. But with her new fame also came a lot of backlash from the media. Critics argued that Sammi purposely westernized her Cantonese. Instead of saying [...] "Ding Dong", Sammi pronounced it as [...] "Deen Dong". Despite the criticism, the song {{was one of the}} most popular dance songs of that year. In 1994 the racy and controversial cut of [...] "Ten Commandments" [...] (十誡) was banned from the radio for a few days after its initial airplay of the track including tiny bits of what can be recognized as pornography soundtrack. In 1995 Cheng disappeared from the public eye for nearly half a year. Later that year, it was revealed that Warner Music Group had signed her. She let her hair color return to black and temporarily abandoned the wild image she used to have.|$|E
