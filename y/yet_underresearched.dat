40|$|Self-concept is an {{important}} <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> aspect of the consumer behavior of the tourist/festivalgoer. Self-concept is explored via on-site focus groups at the Woodford Folk Festival in Queensland, Australia. Findings suggest that "festivalgoers" actively disassociate themselves from the "tourist" tag in reaction to its perception as a less authentic participation and potentially negative impact on social self-image. This qualitative study proposes that based on the findings, further research into self-concept and festivals is justified {{in terms of its}} potential to better focus on the provision of marketing messages that more closely align with festivalgoers ideal self-image and ideal social self-image.

30|$|Cross-depiction is the recognition—and synthesis—of objects {{whether they}} are photographed, painted, drawn, etc. It is a {{significant}} <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> problem. Emulating the remarkable human ability to recognise and depict objects in an astonishingly wide variety of depictive forms is likely to advance both the foundations and the applications of computer vision. In this paper we motivate the cross-depiction problem, explain why it is difficult, and discuss some current approaches. Our main conclusions are (i) appearance-based recognition systems tend to be over-fitted to one depiction, (ii) models that explicitly encode spatial relations between parts are more robust, and (iii) recognition and non-photorealistic synthesis are related tasks.|$|E
40|$|Workplace {{bullying}} is {{an occupational}} hazard {{in the healthcare}} industry. Allied health professionals form an important, <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched,</b> part of this industry. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the antecedents and consequences of bullying within the allied health context. Data were collected from 166 allied health professionals working in a large Australian healthcare organisation (response rate = 76 %). Logistic regression and analyses of covariance were conducted. Almost a quarter (24 %) of respondents reported experiences of workplace bullying. In testing the antecedents of bullying, low levels of supervisor support and high negative affectivity were associated with bullying. In terms of consequences, bullying, along with tenure, employment type and age, influenced levels of depression and psychological distress. Findings may assist in informing effective strategies that aim to reduce and target the occurrence of such negative workplace behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Social {{context is}} an {{important}} <b>yet</b> an <b>underresearched</b> area in context-sensitive computing. This paper adopts a framework from social sciences that views social context as a sequence of turns taken between participants. The approach is illustrated and evaluated through three empirical cases. The results show that social context is not a static and passive surrounding of a device, but dynamic and constructed by people. Challenges and restrictions for modeling social context through turntaking are identified...|$|R
40|$|Social {{media are}} revolutionizing {{the way that}} {{destinations}} are being portrayed and perceived, <b>yet</b> remain <b>underresearched</b> in tourism. Netnographic analysis of 7, 187 international comments on a YouTube video depicting an antitourist incident in the Maldives revealed two opposing social representations of the social-mediatized gaze. The first is hegemonic and tolerant, and indicative of resolution-based dialectics. The second is polemical and intolerant, and indicative of conflict-based dialectics, replete with anti-Islamic rhetoric. Social media, because of the interplay of proximity to and distance from the relevant inflammatory visual stimuli, attracts and amplifies the latter social representation and suppresses the former. However, because of viewer attention ephemerality, associated projections {{of power in the}} comments may not have a lasting negative impact on the destination.

40|$|Attention deficit {{hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) in adults is a prevalent, <b>yet</b> under-appreciated, <b>underresearched</b> and poorly understood condition. Given this, {{it is imperative that}} information and awareness regarding this condition are made more widespread, both amongst the general public and amongst healthcare professionals. Further, given our poor understanding of the aetiology of the condition, meaningful translational research that migrates into and better informs clinical practice must be a priority. In this brief review we highlight areas regarding the clinical diagnosis and management of ADHD in adults (guidelines, rating scales, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy) as well as areas of promising translational research (genetics, neuroimaging, sleep and circadian rhythms, animal models of ADHD). We address some of the challenges presented for both clinicians and healthcare providers and research scientists working {{to improve the lives of}} those adults with ADHD...|$|R
40|$|Why do some people, but not others, {{participate}} in environmental activism? This article considers a potentially powerful <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> explanation: variation in moral schemas. Drawing on Durkheim’s theory {{about the role}} of sacredness in moral decision making, the article classifies respondents into three mutually exclusive groups: unenchanted, who do not believe nature is sacred; intrinsic, who believe that nature is sacred in itself; and creational, who believe nature is sacred because it is a divine creation. Group membership predicts environmental activism using the 2000 General Social Survey. Individ-uals holding an intrinsic schema are more likely than other groups to sign an environmental petition and {{participate in}} an environmental group. Individuals holding an intrinsic or creational schema are more likely to donate money to environmental causes, relative to the unenchanted. Findings are robust, con-trolling for religious tradition, education, and various predictors of biographi-cal availability. Both sacredness and its source matter for proenvironmental behavior...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that Parent-Child Interaction therapy (PCIT) works {{to improve the}} child’s behavior by changing the child-parent interaction. PCIT has been effective in treating disruptive behavior in young children. This article describes a pilot study to apply PCIT {{to the treatment of}} separation anxiety disorder (SAD). A multiple-baseline design was used with 3 families with a child between the ages of 4 and 8 who had a principal diagnosis of SAD. Following treatment with PCIT, clinically significant change in separa-tion anxiety was observed on all measures. Disruptive behaviors also decreased following treatment. Treatment gains were main-tained at a 3 -month follow-up interval. These findings suggest that PCIT may be particularly useful for treatment of young children with SAD, the most prevalent <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> anxiety disorder of childhood. The results of this study support research delineating the important contribution of family factors to anxiety in childhood. Several mechanisms are proposed that may account for the dra-matic decrease in separation-anxious behaviors seen in children during PCIT, including increased levels of child control, increased social reinforcement of brave behaviors, improved parent-child attachment, and decreased levels of parent anxiety. Results of this study provide promising initial evidence that PCIT may be efficacious for treating young children with SAD. A randomized clinical trial is warranted to further elucidate the efficacy of PCIT for treatment of SAD in young children. EPARATIO...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} has documented associations between discrimination, anger, and delinquency, but the exact nature of these associations remains unclear. Specifically, do aggressive behaviors emerge over time as a consequence of perceived discrimination and anger? Or do adolescents who engage in aggressive behavior perceive that they are being discriminated against and become angry? We use autor-egressive cross-lagged path analysis on a sample of 692 Indigenous adolescents (mean age = 12 years) from the Northern Midwest and Canada to answer these research questions. Results showed that the direction of effects went only one way; both perceived discrimination and anger were significantly associated with subsequent aggression. Moreover, early discrimination and anger each had indirect effects on aggressive behavior three years later, and anger partially mediated the association between discrimination and aggression. Perceived discrimination is but one of many strains related to unequal social position that these Indigenous youth experience, and it has important implications for the proliferation of disparities in later life. Keywords adolescents, juvenile delinquency, perceived discrimination Both perceived discrimination and aggression rep-resent important <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> problems for Indigenous communities. The scarcity of research is notable considering that discrimination has been identified as a culturally specific risk factor for Indigenous well-being (Whitbeck et al. 2001; Zimmerman et al. 1996). What {{we do know is that}} discrimination is a consistent correlate of several negative outcomes. Experiences with discrimination are positively associated with anger (Mellor et al. 2009), depressive symptoms, and alcohol abuse among Indigenous adults (Whitbeck et al. 2004; Whitbeck, McMorris, et al. 2002). They are also associatedwith increased depressive symptoms, substance use, anger, suicide ideation, and problem behaviors among Indigenou...|$|E

This study takes an exploratory approach to measurement development, by conceptualizing a social capital scale to measure homophily in five different restaurant settings, and all three traditional meal periods. A national sample of 1, 220 restaurant-goers was obtained, and a unidimensional construct reflecting homophily was found overall; for breakfast and lunch periods, and within {{three of the five}} restaurant types. We offer insight into these findings, and discuss the use of the scale in future research...|$|R
40|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} consequences of poor mental health {{in the developing world}} are presumed to be significant, <b>yet</b> remain <b>underresearched.</b> This study uses data from nationally representative surveys in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, and Mexico and from special surveys in India and Tonga to show similar patterns of association between mental health and socioeconomic characteristics. Individuals who are older, female, widowed, and report poor physical health are more likely to report worse mental health. Individuals living with others with poor mental health are also signifi-cantly more likely to report worse mental health themselves. In contrast, there is little observed relation between mental health and consumption poverty or education, two common measures of socioeconomic status. Indeed, the results here suggest instead that economic and multidimensional shocks, such as illness or crisis, can have a greater impact on mental health than poverty. This may have important implications for social protection policy. Also significant, the associations between poor mental health and lower labor force participation (especially for women) and more frequent visits to health centers suggest that poor mental health can have economic conse...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{diffusion}} of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries {{has taken place}} faster than any other infrastructural development. Mobile Midwife, a mobile application implemented in Ghana in 2010, sends timely messages in local languages to registered expectant mothers and new parents. The field of mobile health (mHealth) is severely <b>underresearched,</b> <b>yet</b> {{it can be an}} alternative for improving health systems {{and the ways in which}} health services are delivered. Objective: Our goal was to investigate the role that Mobile Midwife technology has played in the lives of pregnant and nursing mothers in Awutu Senya District, Ghana. Design: A total of three focus group discussions and 19 individual interviews were conducted. Discussions and interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim from the local language to English, and analyzed by means of qualitative content analysis at the manifest and latent levels. Results: The main findings show that while oscillating between modern and traditional practices, women gradually gained trust in Mobile Midwife’s counselling and attempted to balance between myths and reality regarding nutrition in pregnancy. In addition, their decisions to seek essential obstetric care were enhanced by Mobile Midwife’s advice. Women also felt strengthened in their understanding of the importance of seeking professional care during pregnancy and childbirth as well as recognizing signs of ill health in the newborn...|$|R
40|$|Food {{marketing}} {{can be used}} as a {{means to}} combat the current obesity epidemic by increasing the healthiness of a consumer’s diet. The negative and positive influence of marketing practices on food intake has been investigated for advertisement via traditional (media) and modern (online, in-store, events, etc.) channels, branding campaigns, or product placement. Another increasingly applied, <b>yet</b> <b>underresearched</b> marketing tool to communicate with consumers is product packaging. Therefore, this cumulative dissertation empirically investigates consumers’ understanding of healthy nutrition and effects of multiple package design elements on subjective food healthiness perceptions. The first article (Chapter 2) provides an exploration of fundamental lay theories regarding healthy nutrition among German consumers by using Q methodology. Relating to package design effects, Chapter 3 implicitly and explicitly establishes basic and food-related design-healthiness association for color lightness (vs. darkness) and shape roundness (vs. angularity). Chapter 4 examines how the design factor weight—as expressed by light-weighted vs. heavy-weighted colors and typefaces applied on a package design—influences the respective food healthiness perception. It also reveals boundary conditions of the effect for individuals’ health regulatory focus. Following up on this, Chapter 5 investigates the overall shape of a package design, i. e., its slimness (vs. thickness) and how it subsequently shapes food healthiness perceptions depending on participants’ gender and body mass index (BMI). It also introduces the social construct of self-referencing as an explanatory mechanism. The last chapter extends design-related findings by utilizing symbolic meaning in product images on packages that are shown to not only impact a food’s healthiness, but perceptions of its level of processing, quality, and, ultimately, its actual taste. Findings can be used to address the current public health concern by deriving implications for public health officials, marketing managers, and the informed consumer...|$|E
40|$|In January 2015, Li Keqiang visited Chaihuo makerspace in Shenzhen, the Chinese {{city that}} is the world's {{electronics}} manufacturing capital. The visit expressed the significance of China's fledgling but fast-growing maker movement: while its first makerspace was set only up in 2010, in 2016 there are over a hundred, and Keqiang's visit {{is part of a}} bigger governmental push on makerspaces, positioned as sites of creative and technology-led innovation key to the country's economic growth. Amidst growing research into the social, politicoeconomic and cultural significances of makerspaces in the UK and Europe, the specificity of China's maker movement remains <b>underresearched.</b> <b>Yet</b> understanding the on-the-ground lived experience, rather than the promotional rhetoric, of China's maker movement is crucial to its future: while lots of makerspaces are opening, many lack makers, and there are fears that China’s maker movement is an artificially fuelled bubble about to burst. Contemporaneously, the future of other types of making in China, such as its craft traditions, urban manufacturing networks, and shanzhai production, is being threatened by an assemblage of fiscal and state forces. Investigating China's maker movement was the focus of two British-based and British-funded network, research and knowledge exchange projects in which the authors participated during 2015 and 2016 : Living Research: Making in China and China’s Creative Communities: Making Value and the Value(s) of Making. This paper considers their research methodologies and initial findings. Specifically, it focuses on the craft-based participatory methodology developed in China's Creative Communities, as seen in a "Digital Craft" workshop. Informed by social anthropology, its empirical, immersive and inclusive approach gave a voice to makers themselves. While still in a developmental stage, we believe this "craft anthropology" approach has value for future research into the maker movement in China and in other cultures and contexts...|$|R
