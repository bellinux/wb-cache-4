5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The {{exception}} to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature <b>young</b> <b>is</b> born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E
5|$|Mary Alice <b>Young</b> <b>is</b> {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The character {{was created by}} television producer and screenwriter Marc Cherry and is portrayed by Brenda Strong, who also serves as the narrator of the series from beyond the grave; the character's suicide in the pilot episode served as the catalyst of the series. The narration provided by Mary Alice {{is essential to the}} tale of Wisteria Lane, as the series revolves around her sharing the secrets of her friends and neighbors. Her narration technique is akin in style to Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology (1915).|$|E

She loves them all, but Soemadi receives the most of her attention because he receives little from his father, the merchant Soebagio (Ali Joego). As the children grow, they marry and move away, and eventually only Soemadi is left. Although he begins {{a relationship with a}} young woman named Noormala (Soerip), he does not marry her as his income is not enough to support them.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} is, {{by a small}} margin, the largest member of its genus (Thomomys). The fur is a dull brown above and dark, leaden gray beneath. There are often patches of white on the chin, throat and around the anus, and it has blackish ear and nose markings. The {{external}} ear is a thickened rim of tissue. During the summer, the gopher's coat is short and coarse; winter pelage is longer and furrier. The coat of the <b>young</b> <b>is</b> similar to the adult summer coat, but with more sparsely distributed fur; the abdominal skin may be visible.|$|E

5|$|Typically nocturnal (active at night), {{the royal}} {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous. Both sexes can become sexually mature by as early as six months. Births {{have been reported in}} November and December. A single, delicate <b>young</b> <b>is</b> born after an unknown gestational period.|$|E
5|$|Canids {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, having arrived {{independently}} or accompanied human beings over {{extended periods of}} time. Canids vary in size from the 2-m-long (6ft 7 in) gray wolf to the 24-cm-long (9.4in) fennec fox. The body forms of canids are similar, typically having long muzzles, upright ears, teeth adapted for cracking bones and slicing flesh, long legs, and bushy tails. They are mostly social animals, living together in family units or small groups and behaving cooperatively. Typically, only the dominant pair in a group breeds, and a litter of <b>young</b> <b>is</b> reared annually in an underground den. Canids communicate by scent signals and by vocalizations. They are very intelligent. One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today {{remains one of the}} most widely kept domestic animals.|$|E
5|$|Care of <b>young</b> <b>is</b> protracted, {{extending}} {{for as long}} as six months, {{among the}} longest for birds. For example, once common guillemot chicks fledge, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The frigatebirds have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the southern ground hornbill, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.|$|E
50|$|John Preston <b>Young</b> <b>was</b> born on April 18, 1847 in Chulahoma, Mississippi. His father, Reverend A.

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into four to eight pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when <b>young</b> <b>is</b> white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{little is}} known of the biology of M.escalerai. Females begin to form {{reproductive}} colonies in April and May, either small ones or larger aggregations that may also contain males. However, most males remain solitary in this period, although some also form colonies. The single <b>young</b> <b>is</b> born in June or July and becomes independent after some six weeks. Mating usually takes place in fall, but sometimes in winter. The formation of large reproductive colonies in caves, which may consist of several hundreds of individuals, distinguishes M.escalerai from M.nattereri as well as M.sp.A, which roost in smaller groups in tree holes. In Aragón, colonies contain 50 to 880 individuals, and Catalan colonies are known to contain over a hundred bats. Reproductive colonies may be formed {{in a variety of}} structures, including caves, mines, tree holes, and human-made structures such as bridges and houses. However, hibernation colonies need constant temperatures between , and are usually located in caves or basements. M.escalerai is considered a sedentary species, and does not usually migrate over long distances, although it does move between reproduction and hibernation colonies. Rabies has been identified in a Spanish specimen of M.escalerai.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural champions were Sarita and Wilde, who {{defeated}} The Beautiful People (Rayne and Sky) in {{the finals}} of an eight-team tournament to crown the first TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions. At 478 days, Eric Young and ODB hold {{the record for the}} longest reign in the title's history. Awesome Kong's and Hamada's only reign holds the record for the shortest reign in the title's history at 63 days. As of June 27, 2013, the championships are retired due to TNA not having enough female talent for a Tag Team Division. <b>Young</b> <b>is</b> the first and only male wrestler to have held the title. Overall, there have been nine reigns shared between 15 wrestlers and nine teams.|$|E
25|$|Hemimetabolous, or {{incomplete}} metamorphosis. The terrestrial <b>young</b> <b>are</b> called nymphs {{and aquatic}} <b>young</b> <b>are</b> called naiads. Insect <b>young</b> <b>are</b> usually {{similar to the}} adult. Wings appear as buds on the nymphs or early instars.

5|$|The work {{ends with}} the {{following}} words: Fichte and the powerful men who have inherited his ideals, when they see children, think: 'Here is material that I can manipulate'... All this, to any person with natural affection for the <b>young,</b> <b>is</b> horrible; just as we teach children to avoid being destroyed by motor cars if they can, so we should teach them to avoid being destroyed by cruel fanatics... This is the task of a liberal education: to {{give a sense of}} the value of things other than domination, to help create wise citizens of a free community, and through the combination of citizenship with liberty in individual creativeness to enable men to give to human life that splendour which some few have shown that it can achieve (Russell 1938:251).|$|E
5|$|<b>Young</b> <b>is</b> {{the cousin}} of {{producer}} Sir Jinx.

Thereafter, he focused on his social life and entertainment {{for the remainder of}} his high school years. Young fathered a son with Cassandra Joy Greene named Curtis (born December 15, 1981). Curtis was brought up by his mother and first met his father 20 years later, when Curtis became rapper Hood Surgeon.|$|E
5|$|In Major League Baseball, the 300win club is {{the group}} of {{pitchers}} who have won 300 or more games. Twenty-four pitchers have reached this milestone. The New York Gothams/Giants/San Francisco Giants are the only franchise to see four players reach the milestone while on their roster: those players are Tim Keefe, Mickey Welch, Christy Mathewson, and Randy Johnson. Early {{in the history of}} professional baseball, many of the rules favored the pitcher over the batter; the distance pitchers threw to home plate was shorter than today, and pitchers were able to use foreign substances to alter the direction of the ball. The first player to win 300games was Pud Galvin in 1888. Seven pitchers recorded all or the majority of their career wins in the 19thcentury: Galvin, Cy Young, Kid Nichols, Tim Keefe, John Clarkson, Charley Radbourn, and Mickey Welch. Four more pitchers joined the club {{in the first quarter of}} the 20thcentury: Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, Eddie Plank, and Grover Cleveland Alexander. <b>Young</b> <b>is</b> the all-time leader in wins with 511, a mark that is considered unbreakable. If a modern-day pitcher won 20 games per season for 25 seasons, he would still be 11 games short of Young's mark.|$|E

5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger tanks are recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the <b>young</b> <b>is</b> slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E
5|$|Young led his {{league in}} wins five times (1892, 1895, and 19011903), {{finishing}} second twice. His career high was 36 in 1892. He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins, two {{more than the}} runners-up, Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn. Young won two ERA titles during his career, in 1892 (1.93) and in 1901 (1.62), and was three times the runner-up. Young's earned run average was below 2.00 six times, {{but this was not}} uncommon during the dead-ball era. Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons, he did not lead his league until 1902. He had 40 or more complete games nine times. Young also led his league in strikeouts twice (with 140 in 1896, and 158 in 1901), and in shutouts seven times. Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category. Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times. <b>Young</b> <b>is</b> tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher. They each won 192 games while with the franchise.|$|E
