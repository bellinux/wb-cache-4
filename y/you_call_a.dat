500|$|The {{day before}} the All-Star Game, Giants' manager and 2011 NL All-Star Manager, Bruce Bochy, {{announced}} his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up. Explaining his decision, Bochy said about Kemp, [...] "He's a guy with speed, power, a guy that can beat you with a base hit or a long ball. He's what <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> complete player – tremendous defender, but more so in the 3-hole, he can do so many things for you. He's so dangerous." [...] Kemp, with a single and a walk, became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All-Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{title is}} derived from Big Boi's long-time moniker [...] "Sir Lucious Left Foot". In several interviews, he has {{explained}} part {{of it as a}} reference to the Southern slang phrase [...] "gettin’ out on the good foot", while describing the entire moniker as an indication of maturity, noting it as [...] "my real grown-man persona" [...] and [...] "like my Luke-Skywalker-becoming-a-Jedi persona. Like, I'm just really serious about my craft, I've mastered it, and I'm very skilled at it, and I take pride in making this music". He incorporated the nickname [...] "Chico Dusty" [...] to the album's title as a dedication to his late father, Tony Kearse, who gained it while serving as a fighter pilot in the United States Air Force and Marines. The spelling of luscious in the album's title, Big Boi's moniker, is intended to reflect on its distinctive pronunciation [...] "loo-shuss", which according to Big Boi, is not [...] "the girl name; <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> girl luscious, along the lines of voluptuous".|$|E
2500|$|The Divine Comedy song [...] "Sunrise" [...] begins [...] "I {{was born}} in Londonderry / I {{was born in}} Derry City too" [...] and later asks [...] "Who cares what name <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> town? / Who'll care when you're six feet beneath the ground?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Gillespie caused controversy, when {{during a}} break due to a {{technical}} issue, he said, [...] "I'm no comedian but should I tell a joke?", before saying to the room: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> Conservative MP that's been stabbed to death? A beautiful fucking thing".|$|E

2500|$|Also in November 2006, Billboard {{magazine}} was {{curious as to}} why the artist is credited as just his first name, [...] "Yusuf" [...] rather than [...] "Yusuf Islam". His response was [...] "Because 'Islam' doesn't have to be sloganised. The second name is like the official tag, but <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> friend by their first name. It's more intimate, and to me that's the message of this record." [...] As for why the album sleeve says [...] "the artist formerly known as Cat Stevens", he responded, [...] "That's the tag with which most people are familiar; for recognition purposes I'm not averse to that. For a lot of people, it reminds them of something they want to hold on to. That name is part of my history {{and a lot of the}} things I dreamt about as Cat Stevens have come true as Yusuf Islam." ...|$|E

5000|$|Of his {{professional}} career in newspapers, LeDuff states: [...] "I’m not a journalist, I’m a reporter. The {{difference between a}} reporter and a journalist is that a journalist can type without looking. The problem with journalism is its self-importance. Like in the New York Times, there’s style guides; <b>you</b> can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> doctor a physician, <b>you</b> got to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> doctor- too high falutin’. <b>You</b> can’t <b>call</b> <b>an</b> undertaker a mortician- too high falutin’; <b>you</b> got to <b>call</b> him <b>an</b> undertaker. <b>You</b> can’t <b>call</b> <b>a</b> lawyer an attorney, <b>you</b> have to <b>call</b> him <b>a</b> lawyer. But somehow, since we control it, and we’re very self-important people, <b>you</b> can <b>call</b> <b>a</b> reporter a journalist." ...|$|R
2500|$|The indecisive {{outcome of}} the Second Battle of Newbury in October meant {{that by the end}} of 1644 the war still showed no signs of ending. Cromwell's {{experience}} at Newbury, where Manchester had let the King's army slip out of an encircling manoeuvre, led to a serious dispute with Manchester, whom he believed to be less than enthusiastic in his conduct of the war. Manchester later accused Cromwell of recruiting men of [...] "low birth" [...] as officers in the army, to which he replied: [...] "If you choose godly honest men to be captains of horse, honest men will follow them... I would rather have a plain russet-coated captain who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows than that which <b>you</b> <b>call</b> <b>a</b> gentleman and is nothing else". At this time, Cromwell also fell into dispute with Major-General Lawrence Crawford, a Scottish Covenanter Presbyterian attached to Manchester's army, who objected to Cromwell's encouragement of unorthodox Independents and Anabaptists. He was also charged with familism by Scottish Presbyterian Samuel Rutherford in response to his letter to the House of Commons in 1645.|$|E
