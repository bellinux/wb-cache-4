40|$|Abstract There {{is concern}} whether cabbage and {{beetroot}} wastes from the Fresh Produce Market {{are safe for}} feeding animals {{given the fact that}} some will have been discarded at the onset of putrefaction. This study evaluated the effects of sun-drying on microbiological load (E. coli, coliform, <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> and total bacterial count) in waste vegetables from the fresh produce market, since smallholder farmers tend to use the by-products without processing given the opportunity. Cabbage and beetroot wastes were sun dried to 14 % moisture and micro-organisms were enumerated on both wet and dried samples. The results showed that sun drying reduced the level of micro-organisms significantly in both cabbage and beetroot. Although microbial load varied from batch to batch in the wet samples, coliforms were significantly more abundant in wet beetroot than in the dried samples. However, dried beetroot contained significantly more <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds.</b> Wet cabbage contained more coliform and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> compared to sun-dried cabbage. The sun drying process is thus an efficient processing method for resource poor farmers to reduce the microbial load in these animal feed sources and improve their shelf life...|$|E
40|$|In this {{research}} variables which influence microbiological quality in fresh cheese productionwith respect to <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> were analyzed. Since <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> do {{not survive the}} process of pasteurization their isolation in the final product {{is a result of}} their supplemental contamination during fermentation and whey drainage.

The samples included ninetysix plain yoghurt representing local modern manufacturers coded A, B and C beside traditional producers coded T, also forty- eight fruit yoghurt samples from two manufacturers coded AF and BF. All these samples were collected from three towns in Khartoum State (Khartoum, Khartoum North and Omdurman) to assure that all manufacturers were well represented. Chemical measurements included total solids, solids non-fat, fat, protein, ash and pH. The microbiological parameters studied were total bacterial count, total coliform count and the <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> count. Results obtained revealed significant variations (P≤ 0. 001) between samples obtained from different manufacturers in their chemical composition (total solids, solids non-fat, fat, protein, ash and pH. One hundred and thirty eight of collected samples (96. 5 %) were found satisfied the international standard for solids non-fat content, and 73 yoghurt samples (50. 7 %) were found to have a lower fat content than the standard. In the microbiological parameters tested, the total bacterial count and <b>yeast</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> count were not significantly different between different manufacturers. The coliform count of samples varied significantly (P≤ 0. 001) between a manufacturer and another with a noticeable significance higher (P≤ 0. 05) coliform count in samples collected from traditional manufacturers than that collected from modern manufacturers.

40|$|High-pressure {{processing}} (HPP) {{was investigated}} for controlling spoilage and extending the shelf life of fresh lactic curd cheese. Fresh lactic curd cheeses manufactured from pasteurised bovine milk using Lactococcus starters and flavourings were vacuum packed {{and subjected to}} pressures at the levels of 300 and 600 MPa for 5 min, up to a temperature of 22 °C, then stored at 4 °C. The number of spoilage <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> were enumerated immediately after treatment and at time intervals of three, five and eight weeks of storage. The growth of <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> was effectively controlled for up to eight weeks in samples pressurised at 300 and 600 MPa. The firmness and adhesiveness of the samples, analysed with a TA-XT 2 Texture Analyser, gradually increased during storage, but no significant differences (p> 0. 01) in textural properties were detected between pressure-treated and untreated samples. An untrained taste panel (n= 12) also found no significant differences (p> 0. 01) in the sensory characteristics of the pressure-treated and untreated samples in a ranking test. Cheeses pressurised at 600 MPa developed TCA-soluble peptides at a significantly lower rate (p< 0. 01) than the untreated controls during storage up to eight weeks. High-pressure treatment was an effective process to control <b>yeasts</b> <b>and</b> <b>moulds</b> spoilage <b>and</b> extend the shelf-life of fresh lactic curd cheese without adverse effects on the sensory and textural attributes of the products...|$|R
