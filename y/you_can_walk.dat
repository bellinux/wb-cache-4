You don't have to die to prove you're a man". [...] "Human Nature", co-written by Steve Porcaro of the band Toto, is moody and introspective, as conveyed in lyrics such as, [...] "Looking out, across the morning, the City's heart begins to beat, reaching out, I touch her shoulder, I'm dreaming of the street".|$|E

2500|$|Snow shoeing – A snowshoe is {{footwear}} {{for walking}} over the snow. Snowshoes work by distributing {{the weight of}} the person over a larger area so that the person's foot does not sink completely into the snow, a quality called [...] "flotation". It is often said by snowshoers that if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>walk,</b> you can snowshoe. This is true in optimal conditions, but snowshoeing properly requires some slight adjustments to walking. The method of walking is to lift the shoes slightly and slide the inner edges over each other, thus avoiding the unnatural and fatiguing [...] "straddle-gait" [...] that would otherwise be necessary. A snowshoer must be willing to roll his or her feet slightly as well. An exaggerated stride works best when starting out, particularly with larger or traditional shoes.|$|E

2500|$|A {{controversy}} {{emerged on}} May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted {{a clip of}} King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. [...] King, talking to high-school students, had said: [...] "If you can read, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>walk</b> into a job later on. [...] If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that." [...] The comment was described by the blog as [...] "another {{in a long line}} of liberal media members bashing the military," [...] and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. [...] King responded later that day, saying, [...] "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." [...] King again defended his comment in an interview with the Bangor Daily News on May 8, saying, [...] "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. [...] Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds." [...] King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a [...] "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.|$|E
