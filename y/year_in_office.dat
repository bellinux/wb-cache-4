5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E

5|$|During {{his first}} <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> Williams and his {{government}} suffered low approval ratings. However, approval for Williams {{and his government}} dramatically improved in 2005. A poll showed support for the Williams government was at 86 percent after Williams secured a deal with Federal Prime Minister Martin over equalization payments. The CRA poll in March 2006 showed 82 percent satisfaction with his government and 71 percent in William's premiership. Polling conducted throughout 2007, showed that support for Williams and his government remained high. In August 2007, the CRA found that 86 percent {{were satisfied with the}} government's performance; 77 percent supported Williams as premier, and 76 percent endorsed the PC party.|$|E
5|$|His {{expenditures}} {{in trying to}} remold Hawaii's monarchy into the European model added to the public debt, helping to increase the kingdom's expenditures on the monarchy by 50%. Kalākaua decided to have the coronation he had previously been denied due to the political climate when he was elected. On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee added more expense, reported by Harper's Weekly to be $75,000.|$|E
5|$|Morrow urged {{enforcement}} of state laws against carrying concealed weapons and restricted {{activities of the}} Ku Klux Klan. During his first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he granted only 100 pardons. This was a considerable decrease from the number granted by his immediate predecessors. During their first years in office, J. C. W. Beckham granted 350 pardons, James B. McCreary (during his second stint as governor) granted 139, and Augustus O. Stanley granted 257. He was also {{an active member of}} the Commission on Interracial Cooperation, a society for the elimination of racial violence in the South.|$|E

The Seder convened in the Old Family Dining Room and lasted for two hours. During Obama's last <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> in 2016, the Seder was held on April 26, the sixth day of Passover, due to Obama's previously scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on the first and second nights of Passover.|$|E
5|$|On January 1, 1994, Clinton {{signed the}} North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout his first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Clinton {{consistently}} supported {{ratification of the}} treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton {{and most of his}} allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.|$|E
5|$|While at Landsberg, Hitler {{dictated}} most of {{the first}} volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b>|$|E

5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{is said to}} be unmatched in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} a <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution. Labor won back its {{majority}} in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister. He struggled {{with the demands of}} Australia's participation in World War I, and in October 1915 resigned in favour of Billy Hughes. Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, holding that position from 1916 to 1920. After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66. In total, Fisher served as prime minister for just under five years; Bob Hawke is {{the only member of the}} Labor Party to have served for longer.|$|E
5|$|As World War II neared, Minton took a {{cautious}} position on United States involvement. When the Soviet Union invaded Finland, Minton voted against granting a loan to Finland {{to help finance}} its defense efforts. He also opposed selling munitions and weapons to the Allies or the Axis powers. He advocated and supported expanding the American military and believed that American entry into the war was inevitable, but should be delayed as long as possible. He {{voted in favor of}} the Smith Act, which made it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the government, a law specifically targeted at communists and fascists in the United States. In his final <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> there was considerable speculation in the press that Minton would be named to higher office by Roosevelt, including cabinet positions and the Supreme Court, but neither happened.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1st century, a {{distinct}} equestrian group, non-Italian and military in character, became established. This {{was a result}} of the established custom whereby the emperor elevated the primuspilus (chief centurion) of each legion to equestrian rank on completion of his <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> This resulted in some 30 career soldiers, mostly non-Italian and risen from the ranks, joining the aristocracy each year. Far less wealthy than their Italian counterparts, many such equites belonged to families that provided career soldiers for generations. Prominent among them were Romanised Illyrians, the descendants of the Illyrian-speaking tribes that inhabited the Roman provinces of Pannonia (W Hungary/Croatia/Slovenia), Dalmatia (Croatia/Bosnia) and Moesia Superior (Serbia), together with the neighbouring Thracians of Moesia Inferior (N Bulgaria) and Macedonia provinces. From the time of Domitian (ruled 81–96), when over half the Roman army was deployed in the Danubian regions, the Illyrian and Thracian provinces became the most important recruiting ground of the auxilia and later the legions.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{threw himself}} into the role, {{travelling}} {{around the country and}} inspecting local units to gain an overall idea of their efficiency. Even under favourable circumstances, however, he found that only 54% of the volunteers attended parades in 1906; at the annual camps, the proportion was as low as 45%. He pressed for greater use of active day-time tactical training rather than evening indoors drill, which he felt was key for a part-time volunteer force, and for a greater emphasis on the training and standards of officers. By the end of his second <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> he had organised local selection boards for appointing officers, and a central promotion board for senior field officers, as well as mandatory regular fitness and efficiency tests.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came in his first <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office</b> when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named Antonin Scalia to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E

5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met {{regularly}} at the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, immigration and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, Papers from the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office,</b> Clarke {{established}} good {{order in the}} colony. Unlike Osborn, who treated Colenso's presence at the trials in 1888 as an affront, Clarke took up Colenso's cause and recommended to the Colonial Office in London that Dinuzulu and his uncles be allowed to return from exile, having been sufficiently punished for his supposed offences. Clarke, persuaded by Colenso, argued that Dinuzulu would not cause further trouble {{so long as the}} policy of fomenting intertribal strife were discontinued and Dinuzulu be appointed induna. He began the process for the return of Dinuzulu and sought to harness the authority of the Zulu leader to the administration. In January 1895, the exiles received notice of their return to Zululand with an official position for Dinuzulu. Their departure was set for February 1895 but was delayed after Ministers in London recommended that Zululand first be annexed to Natal.|$|E
5|$|Justices are {{appointed}} to {{a term that}} could potentially last for ten years. Once a new justice is chosen, he may serve {{for two years before}} being subjected to a retention election held during the first statewide election following the completion of the justice's second <b>year</b> <b>in</b> <b>office.</b> The justice is listed on the ballot with the option to be retained or to be rejected from the Court. If retained, the justice may serve the remainder of his ten-year term. When a term is completed, the justice must be reappointed with the same process originally used to appoint him to remain on the Court. A majority vote of both houses of the Indiana General Assembly may impeach a justice for misconduct. It is mandatory for a justice to retire at age seventy-five, even if their term is incomplete.|$|E
