5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E

5|$|Tzfat cheese, a {{white cheese}} in brine, similar to feta, was first {{produced}} by the Meiri dairy in Safed in 1837 and is still produced there by descendants of the original cheese makers. The Meiri dairy also became famous for its production of the Balkan-style brinza cheese, which became known as Bulgarian cheese due to its popularity in the early 1950s among Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria. Other dairies now also produce many varieties of these cheeses. Bulgarian yogurt, introduced to Israel by Bulgarian Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, is {{used to make a}} traditional <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> cucumber soup.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{completing}} his studies, Ravalomanana returned to Manjakandriana District, {{where he and}} his family began making and selling homemade yogurts, a common artisanal product in the highlands region. On his bicycle, he collected milk from farmers in neighboring towns, gradually increasing his production and clientele. He opened his first <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> cheese production center in 1977 in Sambaina on land he named Rova-Tiko ("Tiko Palace"), where he would build the first Tiko factory several years later. His wife handled the administrative and accounting side of the business from Ankadivato, where the storage facility for finished products was located. By the end of the 1970s, Ravalomanana's dairy business employed five salaried staff members and was distributing its products in stores across Antananarivo.|$|E
5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's Ice Cream, is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand ice cream, sorbet, sherbet, and frozen <b>yogurt,</b> <b>and</b> other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style ice cream mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged ice cream pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its ice cream products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

25|$|As {{its primary}} {{ingredient}} is rye, kvass {{is a good}} source of vitamin B-1 and B-6, magnesium, phosphorus, amino acids, and pantothenate.

25|$|Traditional or fixed {{transhumance}} {{has occurred}} throughout the inhabited world, particularly Europe and western Asia. It is often important to pastoralist societies, as the dairy products of transhumance flocks and herds (milk, butter, <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> cheese) may form {{much of the}} diet of such populations.

25|$|Packaged and {{processed}} foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, <b>yogurt,</b> <b>and</b> marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so {{may be a}} special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role {{in the production of}} cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.|$|E
25|$|Dadiah or dadih is a {{traditional}} West Sumatran yogurt made from water buffalo milk, fermented in bamboo tubes. Yogurt is popular in Nepal, where it is served as both an appetizer and dessert. Locally called dahi, {{it is a part}} of the Nepali culture, used in local festivals, marriage ceremonies, parties, religious occasions, family gatherings, and so on. The most famous type of Nepalese yogurt is called juju dhau, originating from the city of Bhaktapur. In Tibet, yak milk (technically dri milk, as the word yak refers to the male animal) is made into <b>yogurt</b> (<b>and</b> butter and cheese) and consumed.|$|E

30|$|The {{biopreservation}} {{of foods}} using bacteriocinogenic {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{peptides}} produced from milk proteins have been demonstrated to produce a physiological response in model systems. These peptides may be released from intact proteins in the gastrointestinal tract by proteolytic digestion, but are also present in fermented products such as cheese <b>and</b> <b>yogurt,</b> {{as a result of}} the action of inherent proteases, such as plasmin, and/or bacterial proteases released by the starter culture. This study investigated the presence of peptides, previously reported to have bioactive properties, in commercially available <b>yogurts</b> <b>and</b> cheeses...|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} decade, Unigate focused {{on food and}} distribution, selling off non-core and unprofitable businesses, which raised £700 million. Half of this came through the £332 million sale of its share in Nutricia, the holding company that owned the Cow & Gate brand. The company also bought brands to supplement its new direction, spending £400 million on French firms Prodipal, a maker of <b>yogurts</b> <b>and</b> desserts, and Vedial, a maker of spreads. In September 1996 Unigate paid £77.25 million for the UK and Italian margarine and spreads business of Kraft Foods International, including Vitalite.|$|R
