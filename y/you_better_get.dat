25|$|Calley: <b>You</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{back in that}} chopper {{and mind}} your own business.|$|E
500|$|A fireman named O. H. Bush {{and several}} other men crawled through a broken window of the {{farmhouse}} in search of survivors. When they determined {{that no one was}} in the house, they salvaged what furniture they could before the fire spread into the living room. Bush discovered dynamite in the corner; he picked up an armful of explosives and handed it to one of the men. As Kehoe left his burning farm and house in his Ford truck, he stopped to tell those fighting the fire, [...] "Boys, you're my friends. <b>You</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of here. You better head down to the school", and drove off.|$|E
500|$|Kehoe's {{neighbor}} Sidney J. Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out of here, you better {{go down to the}} school." [...] Three telephone linemen working near Bath testified that Kehoe passed them on the road toward the school, and they saw him arrive there. He swerved his truck and {{stopped in front of the}} building. In the next instant, according to the linemen, the truck blew up, and one of them was struck by shrapnel. [...] Other witnesses testified that Kehoe paused after stopping and called Superintendent Huyck over before blowing up his truck.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come!' cried Tom, 'I {{see that}} <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> off the stile, {{and let me}} pursue my way home. Make room for me, if you please.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'If {{you want}} {{the rest of us}} to help <b>you,</b> you'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> things started yourself,' said old Mr. Skunk, {{carefully}} combing out his big, plumy tail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tuan! Tuan!" [...] he called, eagerly. [...] "The {{boats are}} coming. The man-of- war's boats. <b>You</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> ready. The {{officers}} will come here, I know." ...|$|R
2500|$|Before {{and during}} America's {{involvement}} in World War II, references to {{or about the}} war {{and the members of the}} Axis Powers were commonplace on the show. Just after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Jim Jordan, out of character, soberly ended the Fibber McGee show by inviting the studio audience to sing [...] "America". During the show of December 9, the Mayor is seeking a globe in order to keep up with current events. Molly asks him, [...] "Do you want one with Japan on it?" [...] The mayor says, [...] "Why, of course." [...] "Then <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> one quick," [...] Molly says, receiving thunderous applause from the studio audience.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a point I'm most {{afraid to}} investigate, and it can't be done to-night. In the meanwhile, hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> those wet things off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} prisoner, [...] "I guess it wouldn't be much use. Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> through with it? I don't like a fuss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> their advice. It is {{the best}} thing going!' said Leonard, with a sigh that sounded as if he wished he had taken it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] asked Dick, {{feeling that}} {{something}} was wrong. [...] "If you have had even a touch of a cramp <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> out, Tom." ...|$|R
50|$|I hope <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> soon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only this: It {{strikes me}} that you need looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> back to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, while Corey lingered at the {{entrance}} to the stairway, these two came down the stairs together, and he heard Lapham saying, [...] "Well, then, <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a divorce." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carroll {{spread out}} his hands. [...] "Only this--I {{think you need}} looking after. We can't stay here indefinitely. Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> back to Vancouver before your English friends ruin you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{over to your}} {{corner and}} grind that lot out, Chetwode," [...] he said pleasantly. [...] "How are you getting on with the typing, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One of <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> her pumped out," [...] he said. [...] "You haven't done {{it since}} we started, and you won't find it easy by and by." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{supper and}} turn in, for you'll {{have to begin}} your new life by rising at three o'clock to-morrow morning. Have you got a tent?" ...|$|R
60|$|General McClellan {{should not}} yet be {{disturbed}} with business. I think <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> in concert with General Halleck at once. I write you to-night. I also telegraph and write Halleck.|$|E
6000|$|Seaforth {{understood}} him, {{and smiled}} grimly. [...] "We brought nothing into this world--and we'll {{be very close}} to the next one in a few more minutes," [...] he said. [...] "Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> way on, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> your pistols?" [...] said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree's blood. [...] "It's {{time this}} thing was looked into, you know. I'd like to have you go up now; they're at it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} lieutenant, after {{listening}} awhile. [...] "You young fellows always hear women's voices. If {{you are going}} to dream <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> into your hammock. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{them out}} at the end of it,' said Ralph. 'They can't do better than go back to the country, ma'am; they are in everybody's way here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will pass}} presently, and <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> your supper," [...] he said. [...] "I {{must try to}} eat a morsel, for I {{have a long way}} to ride to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{probably}} deserved it, {{though one}} can't help concluding that she wouldn't feel it much," [...] she said. [...] "That {{is one of}} the advantages of being a practical person; but hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> the drawings out?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To the railroad," [...] Dane said dryly. [...] "After {{that you}} can go just where it pleases you. Now, there's no use, whatever, making a fuss, and every care will be taken of your {{property}} until you can arrange to dispose of it. Hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> ready?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. Barclay, [...] "I don't think it's necessary. It wouldn't be {{the first}} time I'd seen opium and we don't want to leave too plain a trail behind us. As we have spent some time on the island already, hadn't <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> to work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tony made {{a gesture}} of resignation. “Well,” he said “it would take too much trouble to {{convince}} you that <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> somebody else, and, anyway, I can have a cold.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes; I {{think we}} can take it that she’s a danger. I’ll tell my man {{to give you the}} truck you want and <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{finished}} while the weather’s fine.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon you've heard {{a little}} too much, young man," [...] said the Minorcan. [...] "Somebody's been stuffin' <b>you.</b> You'd <b>better</b> <b>get</b> a hook and line, and go out to catch clams." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Supper's served," [...] he said. [...] "It's better hash {{than you}} used to hand out in the woods, and Carrie has fixed some hot biscuit with Magnolia drips {{in the way you}} like. Well, <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> busy, and we'll play we're in camp. I'll locate {{at the bottom of the}} snow bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{his life}} of selfish {{immunity}} from grief, Beaton {{could not understand}} this experience that poignant sorrow brings; {{he said to himself}} that Dryfoos was going the way of angina pectoris; as he began shuffling off the tiger-skin he said: [...] "Had <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> up? Wouldn't you like me to call a doctor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, mister, I reckon <b>you</b> <b>better</b> <b>get</b> {{ready and}} pull out. I'm {{not going to}} have you for a son-in-law, not this season. The man that marries my Fan has got to have sabe enough to round up a flock of goats--and wit enough {{to get up in the}} morning. So you better vamoose to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I haven't any gun," [...] {{answered}} {{the lady of}} the house quickly. [...] "And <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> inside as quickly as you can. The lion may leap up at you." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPT. G. (Anxiously.) Not chilled, pet, are <b>you?</b> <b>Better</b> let me <b>get</b> your cloak.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{anxious about}} that water and <b>you</b> had <b>better</b> <b>get</b> down," [...] he said. [...] "Go {{in by the}} house; there'll {{probably}} be a lazaret below it with {{an opening in the}} deck." ...|$|R
