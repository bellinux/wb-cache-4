500|$|Chapters are {{structured}} according to {{each type of}} recipe, including main course, soup, and breads. 168 recipes from the United States and globally {{are included in the}} book. The author notes that bacon is not as bad nutritionally as had previously been thought. He compares the nutritional characteristics of two slices of cooked bacon to one pork hot dog, noting that the bacon contains approximately [...] "73 calories, 202 milligrams of sodium, 6 grams of fat and 11 milligrams of cholesterol", while the hot dog has [...] "182 calories, 638 milligrams of sodium, 17 grams of fat and 29 milligrams of cholesterol". [...] "If health concerns sometimes make <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> about loving bacon ... relax ...yes, it’s high in sodium and fat, but if eaten in moderation or used as a flavoring agent ... it is a guilt free indulgence," [...] writes Villas. Breakfast dishes include French Cheese and Bacon souffle, and Bacon Scrapple. A recipe for BLT sandwich is included in the section on sandwiches, but the majority of Villas's other sandwich recipes are more extreme, and include ingredients such as Jamaican smoked fish. Dishes that contain vegetables include Lima Bean and Bacon Casserole; and Spanish Chicken, Bacon, Meatball and Chickpea Stew. For dessert, Villas includes six recipes such as bacon-wrapped figs, and Bacon and Peanut Butter Chocolate Truffles, and Portuguese Egg and Bacon Pudding.|$|E

6000|$|The colonel {{looked into}} her face {{with an air of}} well-feigned alarm. [...] "You don't think the sprain has gone to your head, Fanny?" [...] he asked, and walked away, leaving Mr. Arbuton to the ladies. Mrs. Ellison did not care for this or any other gibe, if she but served her own purposes; and now, having made {{everybody}} laugh and given the conversation a lively turn, she was as perfectly content as if she had not been herself an offering to the cause of cheerfulness. She was, indeed, equal to any sacrifice in the enterprise she had undertaken, and would not only have given Kitty all her worldly goods, but would have quite effaced herself to further her own designs upon Mr. Arbuton. She turned again to her guide-book, and left the young people to continue the talk in unbroken gayety. They at once became serious, as most people do after a hearty laugh, which, if you think, seems always to have something strange and sad in it. But besides, Kitty was oppressed by the coldness that seemed perpetually to hover in Mr. Arbuton's atmosphere, while she was interested by his fastidious good looks and his blameless manners and his air of a world different from any she had hitherto known. He was one of those men whose perfection makes <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> of misdemeanor whenever they meet you, and whose greeting turns your honest good-day coarse and common; even Kitty's fearless ignorance and more than Western disregard of dignities were not proof against him. She had found it easy to talk with Mrs. March as she did with her cousin at home: she liked to be frank and gay in her parley, to jest and to laugh and to make harmless fun, and to sentimentalize in a half-earnest way; she liked to be with Mr. Arbuton, but now she did not see how she could take her natural tone with him. She wondered at her daring lightness at the breakfast-table; she waited for him to say something, and he said, with a glance at the gray heaven that always overhangs the Saguenay, that it was beginning to rain, and unfurled the slender silk umbrella which harmonized so perfectly with the London effect of his dress, and held it over her. Mrs. Ellison sat within the shelter of the projecting roof, and diligently perused her book with her eyes, and listened to their talk.|$|E

[...] The album received a review from SputnikMusic that scored the album a {{three and a half}} out of five.

40|$|You {{have bought}} {{a bag of}} candy to keep {{yourself}} entertained while watching movies {{in the comfort of}} your home. Your intention is to keep the candy bag in your cabinet for several weeks, and to only treat yourself with some candy when watching movies. However, you somehow find the bag emptied while watching your first movie. And although eating the delicious candy by the handful was certainly enjoyable, <b>you</b> also <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> for finishing the entire bag at once. This is only one example of many dilemmas we encounter in everyday life. In this thesis, dilemmas are defined as experiences with three main ingredients: (1) mutually exclusive choices, (2) conflicting concerns, and (3) mixed emotions. Figure 1 shows the framework of dilemmas, which illustrates these ingredients related to the conflict between enjoying candy while watching a movie versus eating moderately to maintain good health (see Chapter 5). The articulation of these three ingredients enables us to provide a more elaborate definition of dilemmas: People experience a dilemma when they are faced with two mutually exclusive choices, both of which touch upon their personal concerns, and the simultaneous fulfillment of both choices is challenging, if not impossible, to obtain or achieve. Because of this challenge, people experience both positive and negative emotions toward each alternative. Design Aesthetic...|$|R

40|$|Do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> {{when you}} hear that crunch under your feet when walking an old portage tail or setting up your tent? Have you ever {{wondered}} about the orange and yellow colouring ‘painted ’ on rocks and old buildings? How about those weird grey elephant ears on the side of that cliff? Why do old pine trees grow yellow straggly beards? Lichens are ubiquitous with over 600 ‘species ’ found in Manitoba alone. Crustose forms are flattened against rocks and trees, even becoming part of the substrate. Lobed foliose lichens are very common and look like dead leaves on the ground, or large yellow-green or grey flakes on trees. Fruticose lichens include little pixie cups, blanketing reindeer ‘moss’, or Old Man’s Beards hanging from trees. Lichens come in a multitude of colours and shapes, and can be found anywhere from sea level to mountain peaks and almost from pole to pole. Yet many people never notice these amazing life forms, choosing instead to focus on the larger plants and furry and feathered animals. What are lichens? They are an association of fungi and green or blue-green alga, forming {{what appears to be a}} single plant. The relationship is so close that many people consider them a good example of symbiosis- both the fungi and the algae get something out of the deal. When growing together the fungi obtains photosynthetic products from the algae and the algae get a safe place to live, with a stable source of moisture and protection from the environment. Both organisms can thus live in environments where neither could survive alone...|$|E
40|$|It’s scary {{saying the}} word. ‘Vagina. ’ At first {{it feels like}} you’re {{crashing}} through an invisible wall. ‘Vagina. ’ <b>You</b> <b>feel</b> <b>guilty</b> and wrong, as if someone’s going to strike you down (Ensler, 1998 : xxiii). For my PhD, I am researching social/cultural constructions of the vagina, and whether, and if so how, the vagina is part of women’s identity as women. In this context, the vagina can be a ‘sensitive ’ (see Lee and Renzetti, 1993) issue and, like Ensler (1998), I sometimes have difficulty talking about it. In this article, I explore how a critical examination of reactions to hearing and talking about my research {{can be used to}} enhance my analysis, and consider how these might impact on our ‘obligations ’ as feminist researchers. ON THE DIFFICULTY OF RESEARCHING ‘TROUBLESOME ’ TOPICS Many feminist (and other) researchers have found that researching ‘taboo’, ‘pri-vate ’ or ‘sensitive ’ topics can be problematic. As Lee and Renzetti (1993 : 5) noted, researchers ‘may find themselves stigmatized by colleagues and others for having studied particular topics’. Research on sex is a prime example, and sex-ology has ‘suffer[ed] the slings and arrows of ridicule and delegitimation because of its risqué subject matter ’ (Tiefer, 1995 : 192). But research on any topic con-sidered ‘private ’ could pose difficulties for the researcher. Oakley (1984 : 74), for example, reported that she ‘had to insist on the seriousness of [her] aim {{in the face of a}} lot of patronising jocularity about the academic absurdity of such a topic. The idea of doing a Ph. D. on housework in Britain in 1969 was laughable. ’ Topics such as these disturb the constructed division between ‘public ’ and ‘private’. The label ‘private ’ has often been used to perpetuate oppressions (Beveridge and Mullally, 1995), and feminists have succeeded in making the per-sonal political by bringing so-called private issues into public discourse – house...|$|E
