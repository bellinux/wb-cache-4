"Nixon (1995) HQ 'Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> death, Dick?'": Commercial film by Oliver Stone; outtake of {{contrived}} {{conversation between}} Nixon and Helms (played by Sam Waterston) at CIA's Langley HQ, length 10:44. The screenplay scrambles facts, e.g., it attributes Angleton's orchid growing to Helms, among other things.|$|E
60|$|I {{called in}} Mrs. Evelegh, and {{explained}} what I had done. She was astonished and half incredulous. 'How could <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it?' she cried, admiringly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> your prayers? 'Forgive us our trespasses.' But you, in your pride--you could forgive nothing. And now {{you dare}} to twit {{me with my}} fortune!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how will}} it come when I'm dead? Or {{how will it}} come if things should go {{in such a way}} that I can't stay here any longer? <b>You</b> don't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{afraid we}} must be getting away from Boston by that time. It's very tiresome, {{but there seems to}} be nobody left; and one can't stay quite alone, even if you're sick of moving about. Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> been--we <b>think</b> <b>of</b> going there--to Campobello?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jim, don't act so foolish. A prisoner's GOT to {{have some}} kind of a dumb pet, and if a {{rattlesnake}} hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way <b>you</b> could <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> to save your life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} no great penance,' said Rosa Dartle, 'for your crimes. Do {{you know what you}} have done? Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the home you have laid waste?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What a {{delightful}} {{place to live}} in!" [...] said Charley. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> building a hut in such a spot as this, Jacques, and settling down altogether?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The more I {{think about}} it," [...] said Cicely, [...] "the less I like setters. They are so intimately {{connected}} {{with the death of}} the beautiful. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, it is {{grand and}} beneficent and beautiful. How did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it? You have a {{wonderful}} mind. How {{did you say you}} loaded the machine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're {{lucky to}} be here at all. That bluff of yours was the goods all right. How <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> came to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it all so pat beats me to a frazzle!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have loved}} you," [...] she said, [...] "from {{the moment when}} you came to us as our saviour from death on the summit of the turret; and though as time went on I did not venture to think that you, who had so fair a future before <b>you,</b> would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the girl who with her mother you had so nobly entertained and treated, I should never have loved any other man to the end of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|She leaned {{towards him}} and dropped {{her voice a}} little. [...] "Tell me," [...] she begged, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the years we spent {{together}} in the country? Do you ever regret?" ...|$|E
60|$|TWEENY. Daddy, you're {{of little}} use, but you're a bright, cheerful {{creature}} {{to have about}} the house. (He beams at this commendation.) Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> old times now? We was a bit different.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{on earth}} could <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing such things?" [...] said Euphemia. [...] "That horse might have upset {{the wagon and}} broken all the lightning-rods, besides running over I don't know how many people." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. H. As it's {{the only}} person in he world <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> do <b>think</b> <b>of,</b> and as I know your mind thoroughly, I do. You want to get it all over and--Oh, I can't keep you back! And you're going--think of it, Pip--to throw me over for another woman. And you swore that all other women were--Pip, my Pip! She can't care for you as I do. Believe me, she can't. Is it any one that I know? ...|$|R
60|$|I kept quiet, with my ears cocked, {{about fifteen}} minutes, I reckon. I was {{floating}} along, of course, {{four or five}} miles an hour; but <b>you</b> don't <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that. No, <b>you</b> FEEL like you are laying dead still on the water; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you don't think to yourself how fast YOU'RE going, but you catch your breath and think, my! how that snag's tearing along. If you think it ain't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night, you try it once--you'll see.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{perfectly}} splendid!" [...] cried Peter, as Dear Me {{resumed his}} {{perch on the}} old mullein stalk. [...] "How did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> come to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> such a place? And {{why did you leave}} the shed up at Farmer Brown's where you have build your home for {{the last two or three}} years?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would be}} the good of taking Mary? Who is talking of a child like that? It is {{for the sake of}} charity,--for the dear love of Christ, that I ask you to do it. Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Mary Magdalene?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had an idea}} I'd like Bond Street all {{the better}} when I got back. I never knew that I should be eaten alive by every kind of disgusting animal by night and day. I say, Doctor, do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> a rump steak? ...|$|E
6000|$|FANNY. I didn't say [...] "them." [...] I said [...] "ONE of them." [...] There's Honoria. She's pretty enough, anyhow. So's Alice, Charles Bennet's daughter, and Bertha and Grace--all of them beautiful. And what's {{even better}} still--good. [She says it viciously.] Didn't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> them? ...|$|E
40|$|Are you {{interested}} {{in the pattern of}} your silverware? Such a bald question may lift a score of feminine voices into an afternoon of argument and confidential confessions. Every young bride-elect thrills at the thought of choosing her own silverware. Have <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> stopped to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> all the queer ancestors our spoons and knives must have had before they reached the elegance of modern plate...|$|R
6000|$|She looked up, and he {{saw that}} her lips were quivering a little. [...] "Well, do you know," [...] she said, [...] "oddly enough, I was {{thinking}} of my mother. I can only just recall her, {{a woman with a}} thin, sweet face. I remember one evening she was sitting in front of a house while the sun was setting as it is now, and I was playing by her, when suddenly she called me to her and kissed me, then pointed to the red clouds that were gathered in the sky, and said, 'I wonder if <b>you</b> will <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me, dear, when I have passed through those golden gates?' I did not understand what she meant, but somehow I have remembered the words, and though she died so long ago, I do often <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her;" [...] and two large tears rolled down her face as she spoke.|$|R
500|$|... "Some of {{the waste}} is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no {{economical}} reason why <b>you</b> would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, {{it depends on what}} the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes. Once you put it in there, the salt oozes around it. These are geologically stable for a 50 to 100 million year time scale. The trouble with those type of places for repositories is you don't have access to it anymore. But say for certain types of waste you don't want to have access to it anymore—that's good. It's a very natural containment. ...whereas there would be other waste where you say it has some inherent value, let's keep it around for a hundred years, two hundred years, because there's a high likelihood we'll come back to it and want to recover that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you had better. He's {{very good}} and very cheap too. Those London tradesmen never think they can charge you enough. I find I can wear Sprout's boots the whole winter through and then have them resoled. I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> such things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I have {{no doubt}} that you have fifty good excuses, Cashel. But I will not allow any fighting; and you really must work harder. Do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> how hard I have to work to pay Dr. Moncrief one hundred and twenty pounds a year for you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I am serious, Austen," [...] she said. [...] "I {{sometimes}} feel that, in the future, {{we shall not}} always have many such days as these. It's selfish, but I can't help it. There {{are so many things}} you will have to do without me. Don't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] said Dr. Vimpany, {{after the}} usual {{examination}} and questions, [...] "this {{is better than}} I expected. You {{are now able to}} get up. You can do so by-and-by, after breakfast; you can dress yourself, you want no more help. Nurse," [...] he turned to Fanny, [...] "I think that we have done with you. I am satisfied with the careful watch you have kept over my patient. If <b>ever</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> becoming a nurse by profession, rely on my recommendation. The experiment," [...] he added, thoughtfully, [...] "has fully succeeded. I cannot deny that it has been owing partly to the intelligence and patience with which you have carried out my instructions. But I think that your services may now be relinquished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, my dear sir, {{with regard}} to the Anglo-Bengalee, my information, you see, is limited; very limited. I am the medical officer, in {{consideration}} of a certain monthly payment. The labourer is worthy of his hire; BIS DAT QUI CITO DAT'--('classical scholar, Jobling!' thinks the patient, 'well-read man!')--'and I receive it regularly. Therefore I am bound, so far as my own knowledge goes, to speak well of the establishment.' ('Nothing can be fairer than Jobling's conduct,' thinks the patient, who has just paid Jobling's bill himself.) 'If you put any question to me, my dear friend,' says the doctor, 'touching the responsibility or capital of the company, there I am at fault; for I have no head for figures, and not being a shareholder, am delicate of showing any curiosity whatever on the subject. Delicacy--your amiable lady will agree with me I am sure--should {{be one of the first}} characteristics of a medical man.' ('Nothing can be finer or more gentlemanly than Jobling's feeling,' thinks the patient.) 'Very good, my dear sir, so the matter stands. You don't know Mr Montague? I'm sorry for it. A remarkably handsome man, and quite the gentleman in every respect. Property, I am told, in India. House and everything belonging to him, beautiful. Costly furniture on the most elegant and lavish scale. And pictures, which, even in an anatomical point of view, are perfection. In case <b>you</b> should <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> doing anything with the company, I'll pass you, you may depend upon it. I can conscientiously report you a healthy subject. If I understand any man's constitution, it is yours; and this little indisposition has done him more good, ma'am,' says the doctor, turning to the patient's wife, 'than if he had swallowed the contents of half the nonsensical bottles in my surgery. For they ARE nonsense--to tell the honest truth, one half of them are nonsense--compared with such a constitution as his!' ('Jobling is the most friendly creature I ever met with in my life,' thinks the patient; 'and upon my word and honour, I'll consider of it!') ...|$|R
60|$|The {{first thought}} {{that struck me}} on reading your last was to {{mortgage}} a poem to Murray, but on more consideration, I {{made up my mind}} not to do so; my reputation is very low; he would not have negotiated my bill of intellect, or given me a very small sum. I should have bound myself down for some time. 'Tis best to meet present misfortunes; not for a momentary good to sacrifice great benefits which one's own untrammell'd and free industry may bring one in the end. In all this do never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me as in any way unhappy: I shall not be so. I have a great pleasure in thinking of my responsibility to you, and shall do myself the greatest luxury if I can succeed in any way so as to be of assistance to you. We shall look back upon these times, even before our eyes are at all dim--I am convinced of it. But be careful of those Americans. I could almost advise you to come, whenever you have the sum of £500, to England. Those Americans will, I am afraid, still fleece <b>you.</b> If <b>ever</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> such a thing, you must bear in mind the very different state of society here,--the immense difficulties of the times, the great sum required per annum to maintain yourself in any decency. In fact the whole is with Providence. I know not how to advise you but by advising you to advise with yourself. In your next tell me at large your thoughts about America--what chance there is of succeeding there, for it appears to me you have as yet been somehow deceived. I cannot help thinking Mr. Audubon has deceived you. I shall not like the sight of him. I shall endeavour to avoid seeing him. You see how puzzled I am. I have no meridian to fix you to, being the slave of what is to happen. I think I may bid you finally remain in good hopes, and not tease yourself with my changes and variations of mind. If I say nothing decisive in any one particular part of my letter, you may glean the truth from the whole pretty correctly. You may wonder why I had not put your affairs with Abbey in train on receiving your letter before last, to which there will reach you a short answer dated from Shanklin. I did write and speak to Abbey, but to no purpose. Your last, with the enclosed note, has appealed home to him. He will not see the necessity of a thing till he is hit in the mouth. 'Twill be effectual.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wheel {{does seem}} to be a sort of a companion," [...] she said; [...] "not so good as a horse, but better than nothing. I should think, {{travelling}} all by yourself in this way, you would have quite a friendly feeling for it. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> giving it a name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, Peterkin," [...] said Jack; [...] "I {{appreciate}} what you say, {{and have no}} doubt whatever that your remarks, if made public, would create quite {{a revolution in the}} juvenile world, and convert them speedily into aquatic animals. Did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sending your views on that subject to the Times?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} go to my rest," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "without doing my duty by seeing you and telling you again, {{that it is very}} wicked of you to leave the room {{whenever}} our friend enters it. Linda, do <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the punishment which pride will bring down upon you?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2009, then United States Secretary of Energy Steven Chu stated:"Yucca Mountain as a {{repository}} {{is off the}} table. What we're {{going to be doing}} is saying, let's step back. We realize that we know a lot more today than we did 25 or 30 years ago. The NRC is saying that the dry cask storage at current sites would be safe for many decades, so that gives us time to figure out what we should do for a long-term strategy. We will be assembling a blue-ribbon panel to look at the issue. We're looking at reactors that have a high-energy neutron spectrum that can actually allow you to burn down the long-lived actinide waste. These are fast-neutron reactors. There's others: a resurgence of hybrid solutions of fusion fission where the fusion would impart not only energy, but again creates high-energy neutrons that can burn down the long-lived actinides. ..."Some of the waste is already vitrified. There is, in my mind, no economical reason why <b>you</b> would <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> pulling it back into a potential fuel cycle. So one could well imagine—again, it depends on what the blue-ribbon panel says—one could well imagine that for a certain classification for a certain type of waste, you don't want to have access to it anymore, so that means you could use different sites than Yucca Mountain, such as salt domes.

Yucca was supposed to be everything to everybody, and I think, knowing what we know today, there's {{going to have to be}} several regional areas." ...|$|R
