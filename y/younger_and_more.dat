5|$|Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men {{was large}} and {{unwieldy}} – according to a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was ten miles (16km) long. Manuel marched against Iconium via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma, and Antioch. Just outside {{the entrance to the}} pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.|$|E
5|$|Paul was {{considered}} a potential candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency of the United States since at least January 2013. He delivered the Tea Party response to President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on February 13, 2013, while Marco Rubio gave the official Republican response. This prompted some pundits to call that date {{the start of the}} 2016 Republican primaries. That year, he spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington D.C., where he won the 2016 Presidential straw poll. Paul {{went on to win the}} straw poll for the next two years as well, leading to some considering Paul to be a front runner for the nomination, although CPAC attendees are typically considered <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> libertarian-minded than average Republican voters.|$|E

5|$|While Edward's early reign {{had been}} {{energetic}} and successful, {{his later years}} were marked by inertia, military failure and political strife. The day-to-day affairs of the state had less appeal to Edward than military campaigning, so during the 1360s Edward increasingly relied on {{the help of his}} subordinates, in particular William Wykeham. A relative upstart, Wykeham was made Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1363 and Chancellor in 1367, though due to political difficulties connected with his inexperience, the Parliament forced him to resign the chancellorship in 1371. Compounding Edward's difficulties were the deaths of his most trusted men, some from the 1361–62 recurrence of the plague. William Montague, Earl of Salisbury, Edward's companion in the 1330 coup, died as early as 1344. William de Clinton, who had also been with the king at Nottingham, died in 1354. One of the earls created in 1337, William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, died in 1360, and the next year Henry of Grosmont, perhaps the greatest of Edward's captains, succumbed to what was probably plague. Their deaths left the majority of the magnates <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> naturally aligned to the princes than to the king himself.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, Neighbours and Home and Away have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of Neighbours and Home and Away are predominantly <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.|$|E

25|$|This {{race for}} the {{nomination}} was the most recent occasion that a major party presidential nomination has gone {{all the way to}} the convention. Mondale was later defeated in a landslide by the incumbent Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia. Many felt that Hart and other similar candidates, <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> independent-minded, represented the future of the party. Hart had refused to take money from Political Action Committees (PACs), and as a result he mortgaged his house to self-finance his campaign, and was more than $1 million in debt at the end of the campaign.|$|E
25|$|When Prime Minister Harold Holt {{disappeared}} in December 1967, presumed to have drowned, Hasluck {{was determined that}} the Treasurer, William McMahon, of whom {{he had a very}} low opinion, should not become prime minister. Although he had no great ambitions for himself, Hasluck put his name forward mainly to provide an alternative to McMahon. In the event, McMahon did not stand, as the interim prime minister John McEwen had advised his Country Party would not serve in any government headed by McMahon. The choice was between Hasluck, John Gorton, Billy Snedden and Les Bury, although the latter two were never considered serious contenders. Many Liberal MPs saw Hasluck as too old at 64, too conservative, and insufficiently telegenic to compete with Labor leader Gough Whitlam. Accordingly, they chose the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> aggressive Gorton.|$|E
25|$|In Guernsey, the States of Deliberation {{voted on}} 21 June 1940 to hand {{responsibility}} for running island affairs to a Controlling Committee, under {{the presidency of}} HM Attorney General Ambrose Sherwill. Sherwill was selected rather than the Bailiff, Sir Victor Carey, as he was a <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> robust person. The Committee was given almost all the executive power of the States, and had a quorum of three persons under the president (who could nominate additional members). Membership of the Controlling Committee was initially eight members. Sherwill was imprisoned by the Germans {{as a result of}} his attempts to shelter the British servicemen in the fallout from Operation Ambassador in 1940. He was released but banned from office in January 1941. Jurat John Leale replaced him as president of the Controlling Committee.|$|E

25|$|The {{reshuffle}} {{took place}} {{against a backdrop}} of declining Conservative popularity in Britain. Conservative candidates fared poorly in several by-elections, losing ground to Liberal candidates. Concerned that traditional Conservative voters were expressing their disapproval with the government's economic policies by switching to the Liberals, Harold Macmillan planned to replace his Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, with Reginald Maudling. Lloyd had already clashed with Macmillan over his economic strategies, and Maudling was considered to be more amenable to the economic policies Macmillan wished to implement. The reshuffle was also an attempt to reinvigorate the party, bringing in <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> dynamic figures and replacing some of the older and less capable ministers. After discussions with Conservative Party chairman Iain Macleod and Home Secretary Rab Butler, a reshuffle was planned for Autumn 1962.|$|E
25|$|On 11 March 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev {{was elected}} General Secretary of the CPSU by the Politburo {{after the death}} of Konstantin Chernenko. Gorbachev's primary goal was to revive the Soviet economy; however, he came to believe that fixing the Soviet economy would be nearly {{impossible}} without reforming the political and social structure of the USSR. To begin these reforms he immediately began gathering in Moscow a <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> energetic governing team of Communist Party members. On 4 April 1985 Yeltsin received a call from Gorbachev's leading protege Yegor Ligachev summoning him to Moscow to take up position as Head of the Construction Department of the Party's Central Committee. Less than three months later he was promoted to be Secretary for Construction of the Central Committee, a position within the powerful CPSU Central Committee Secretariat.|$|E
25|$|Conflict {{seems to}} have broken out between the towns of Sybaris and Croton. The forces of Croton were headed by the Pythagorean Milo, {{and it is likely}} that the members of the brotherhood took a {{prominent}} part. After the decisive victory by Croton, a proposal for establishing a more democratic constitution, was unsuccessfully resisted by the Pythagoreans. Their enemies, headed by Cylon and Ninon, the former of whom is said to have been irritated by his exclusion from the brotherhood, roused the populace against them. An attack was made upon them while assembled either in the house of Milo, or in some other meeting-place. The building was set on fire, and many of the assembled members perished; only the <b>younger</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> active escaping. Similar commotions ensued in the other cities of Magna Graecia in which Pythagorean clubs had been formed.|$|E
