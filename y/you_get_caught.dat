The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / And I live one more day and I make it through the rain".

50|$|In {{the state}} of Utah begging or panhandling is not a crime. The first {{amendment}} right protects people to ask for money, help or employment on the streets - this includes panhandling or begging. Following a lawsuit in 2010 three homeless persons were fined for begging and they took the matter to court and won. The court found that fining people for asking for money violated their right to free speech, thus infringing upon the first amendment. In 2010 Salt Lake City agreed not to enforce the state panhandling restriction and therefore law enforcement {{were not allowed to}} ticket homeless people panhandling alongside motorways or begging on the street. However, the first amendment right only protects the panhandler if they are on sidewalks or {{on the side of the}} roadways - if <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> panhandling in the road ways, it's a misdemeanour charge that can cost up to $100 or more depending on how many times <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>caught.</b> This is because it's a safety issue and people are often hit at traffic lights when they turn green.|$|E
