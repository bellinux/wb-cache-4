500|$|The {{continued}} {{influx of}} foreign players at Arsenal has, however, attracted criticism. In a league match against Crystal Palace on 14 February 2005, Arsenal fielded a 16-man squad that featured no British players {{for the first}} time in the club's history. This prompted Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) chief executive Gordon Taylor to express it would begin [...] "a worrying pattern for English football". A year later, manager Alan Pardew commented that Arsenal's Champions League success was [...] "not necessarily a triumph for British football". Wenger saw the issue of nationality as irrelevant and said, [...] "When <b>you</b> <b>represent</b> a club, it's about values and qualities, not about passports". Other pundits including Trevor Brooking, the director of football development at the FA, have defended Wenger. Brooking has stated that a lack of English players in [...] "one of England's most successful clubs" [...] was more of a reflection on England's limited talent pool rather than on Wenger, an opinion shared by youth team coach and ex-Liverpool player Craig Johnston.|$|E

She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word for me with Fincher".
