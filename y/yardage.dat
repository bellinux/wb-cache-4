5|$|Both teams' quarterbacks {{benefited from}} the profusion of passing. Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller {{finished}} the game having completed 18 of his 34 pass attempts for 266 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. He also ran three times for a total gain of one yard. Texas quarterback James Brown completed 14 of his 36 pass attempts for 148 yards, three interceptions, and a touchdown.

5|$|On October 27, 2013, in a 3130 {{win over}} the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson caught 14of16 passes thrown in his direction; he {{finished}} the game with 329 receiving yards and one touchdown. In addition to breaking the Lions' franchise record of 302receiving yards set by Cloyce Box on December 3, 1950, it was the highest receiving <b>yardage</b> ever in a regulation-length game and the second-highest overall single-game <b>yardage</b> in NFL history, behind Flipper Anderson's 336-yard performance in a 1989 overtime win (Anderson accumulated 40of those yards in overtime). In this same game, Calvin also tied Lance Alworth for the most career games with at least 200yards receiving(5).|$|E
2500|$|Nicklaus was {{the first}} {{professional}} player to chart and document <b>yardages</b> on the course on a consistent, planned basis. For most of his career, Nicklaus was not known for his skill on touch shots with the wedges, so he would often play to avoid wedge shots which needed less-than-full swings. Gary Player states that Nicklaus had [...] "the greatest mind the game has ever known".|$|R

5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Florida State {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play {{of the second half}} attempted a lateral pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good the needed yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short <b>yardage</b> on a run up the middle, then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost <b>yardage</b> and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.|$|E
5|$|FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford {{recorded}} a statistically impressive {{year and was}} the top freshman quarterback {{in the nation in}} terms of passing <b>yardage</b> and passing touchdowns. Wide receivers Willie Reid, Greg Carr and Chris Davis were the primary beneficiaries of Weatherford's passing offense during the 2005 season. Carr, a freshman, caught 27passes for 593yards and a conference-leading ninetouchdowns. Davis, a junior, caught more passes and recorded more receiving yards during the 2005season than he had in both his previous seasons combined. Reid, the lone senior starting in the Florida State corps of wide receivers, played in a variety of positions on offense and held the Seminoles' team record for most punt return <b>yardage.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the animal round, a {{broadhead}} round features archers shooting broadhead-tipped arrows through various single-sheet, 2-D cardboard cutouts of animals that are hung between two wooden poles, strung in the air by bendable wire, with a large dirt mound behind it as a backstop. Like the other events in field archery, the archers in the broadhead round go from station to station to shoot from various distances and in unique circumstances; some stations may even employ a moving target. These stations do not list their <b>yardages</b> {{in order to create}} a ‘real field’ feel to the simulation provided by the competition.|$|R

50|$|Winning scores vary {{considerably}} {{from year to}} year because of the different challenges. Tour players may take advantage of the short <b>yardages</b> and having wedge (golf) shots into the greens, {{but at the same time}} they run the risk of finding themselves in the thick trees with no shot or in a water hazard. The record low posted at The Heritage is a score of twenty under par shot by Brian Gay in 2009. Gay secured the victory by a margin of ten shots. Champions of the tournament win a prize of over a million dollars (as of 2009) as well as the traditional tartan plaid jacket.|$|R
5|$|Florida State {{kicked off}} {{following}} the score, and Tech's offense began work from its 18-yard line. Though quarterback Taylor was sacked {{on the first}} play of the drive, the Hokies recovered the lost <b>yardage</b> and gained a first down with the final play of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech held a 35–24 lead.|$|E
5|$|Indianapolis' defense {{ranked second}} in the NFL in fewest passing yards allowed. Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis (who {{recorded}} 9.5 sacks and forced 4 fumbles) were widely considered {{to be among the}} best pass-rushing defensive ends in the NFL. Behind them, linebacker Cato June led the team in tackles (92) and interceptions (3). The Colts' run defense, however, was a major problem, giving up 2,768 yards on the ground, an average of 173 per game and last in the NFL. Another major issue for the Colts was their coverage teams, as they ranked 30th out of 32 teams in average kickoff return <b>yardage</b> allowed and 31st in average punt return <b>yardage</b> allowed.|$|E
5|$|Neither team scored {{again until}} late in third quarter when McCarron Connected with Jones on a 38-yard {{touchdown}} pass that made the final score 35–10.

40|$|India – {{the country}} of rich {{heritage}} and culture is pictured through its traditional textiles which are kept alive through generations by the craftsman and his workmanship. Patola of Patan known as a double ikat silk textile, manifests the richness of heritage craft in dazzling colours and admirable motifs, but is a time consuming yarn resist textile. It cannot be duplicated anymore, since the GI recognition is served for its products under the name Patan Patola. The low cost variants of the celebrated Patan Patola have emerged in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat since last four decades as a single ikat craft. These handloom clusters were generally making weft ikat, {{but some of them}} had expertise in double Ikat too. The product which they were making since years was a Saree; the Indian draped garment for women. In the dynamic world of continuous changes, where the power looms are replacing the traditional handlooms, the craft is struggling to be alive in the world of technology and changing tastes of consumers. A design intervention was planned to adapt the product as per the current market. The present study thus aimed to understand the design practice of these craftsmen and build new layouts for <b>yardages</b> which could be developed into specific styles of garments; catering to the demand of the contemporary markets. Pattern layouts for <b>yardages</b> were engineered using traditional as well as contemporary motifs and colours. The producers of the engineered textiles were craftsmen and master craftsman who were keen to venture into making new product in cotton as well. The constructed garments were showcased at different platforms for feedback. The craftsmen adopted this new concept to bring variety in their produce and thus enhance the market penetration...|$|R

5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success {{than they did}} in the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With a long run of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive <b>yardage</b> on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for <b>yardage.</b> In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E

40|$|Continuously {{being drawn}} to the {{limitless}} variety of textures available in fabrics, especially knits, was a motivating factor and inspiration to begin this study. From the narrowest perspective of the thesis conception a goal {{was to create a}} fabric unique to the marketplace. There were three major qualities, among others, that were sought. It was to possess different layers of texture, display the sensitivity the designer had for the utilized fibers, and potential for mass production after some modifications. Over months of research, which preceded an official beginning to thesis work, there was a continuous flow of tiny samples from the knitting machine. Each piece was then felted through various techniques. This experimental process continued until the time of an instinctive, aesthetic conclusion. A few results from the sample making became the models for the <b>yardages</b> that would later be produced. From this initial research the scope of the thesis naturally evolved. Hopefully, by reading the following pages the enthusiasm and almost addictive challenge felt towards this project will be communicated...|$|R

40|$|The {{region of}} Gujarat {{in the west}} has been an {{important}} textile export zone of India and remains an important source of printed cloth, in terms of both volume and quality. Early evidence of Gujarat’s involvement in international trade of colourful block printed textiles comes from the fragments found at the Fostat excavations in Egypt. These have been dated back to the fifteenth century and have been printed by the resist printing technique. The designs, motifs and colours are typical of the hand block printed textiles characteristic of the region today. Khavda and Dhamadka villages in Kutch were known for printing the exotic rich blue and red cloth known as Ajrakh. These cloths were printed in a complicated sequence that involved both resist and mordant techniques. The deep blue sheen was derived from repeated dipping in indigo followed by vigorous beating and polishing. The most highly prized Ajrakh textiles were bipuri, i. e. the ones printed identically on both sides. Traditionally these were used by men as turbans, lungis (sarongs) and shoulder cloths and also as <b>yardages</b> for women’s skirts and veils. The last fifty years has witnessed a tremendous change in every sphere of life, be it economic, social, technological or aesthetic. More and more, old techniques, design structures and patterns are disappearing or losing integrity as a result of transition into other regional or cultural contexts. Ajrakh, with its rich visual vocabulary {{is in a state of}} transition, as traditional processes, raw materials, designs, product categories and markets are evolving within the worldwide phenomenon called globalization. In spite of the omnipresent changes that have occurred over the last millennium, the printers of Ajrakh in Kutch continue to print some of the same design motifs that have been popular since very earlier times. The origin of Ajrakh can be traced to Sind, Pakistan. Although the name Ajrakh has many legends as to its origin but more popularly the term seems to be derived from Azrak, which means blue in Arabic. The artisans who made these textiles belonged to the Khatri community (both Hindus /Muslims) and have had artisans from the Gajjar community making the blocks in a place called Pethapur, near Ahmadabad. Ajrakh (a term thought to be derived from azraq, the Arabic for blue) has a multitude of uses. Always made in a rectangular format (about 2. 5 x 1. 8 m), Ajrakhs may be used as turbans, shawls, or lungis by men and in certain areas of Kutch, as odhnies by women, not to mention the many household uses to which a large rectangular cloth can be put (Charpai-cover, curtain, floorspread). The designs are restricted to a range of geometrical patterns based on squares, with stars, circles and ellipses arranged symmetrically within them. The traditional colouring of Ajrakh is deep blue and red, with a small amount of white and black. According to popular legend, this textile tradition was started in the family of late Mohammad Siddiki when in the year 1586, Raja Bharmal I, invited his forefathers, to migrate from Sind and settle in Dhamadka, Kachchh. The printers amongst the crafts persons who migrated to Dhamadka from Sind were printing the true Azrak – blue, red and white, used by men of the Maldhari community...|$|R
