Murugadoss claimed that Thuppakki did not have an army backdrop like Gere's film but was set in Mumbai instead, going on to assert that everything in his film was original. He however admitted to have used the poster of An Officer and a Gentleman, and told The Hindu, [...] "Sometimes, <b>you</b> <b>admire</b> something so much that sub-consciously it becomes a part of your work".|$|E

2500|$|The film {{also had}} its share of {{negative}} reviews with most reviewers criticizing the inconsistent tone of the film and the director's indecision to stick to one vision. Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine wrote, [...] "Jon Favreau draws heavily on his film's animated predecessor for plot, characterizations, songs, and set pieces, but doesn't know how to fit these familiar elements into his own coherent vision". Josh Spiegel of Movie Mezzanine also echoed these feelings, saying that the film [...] "stumbles because the people involved aren't willing to fully commit to either making a near-shot-for-shot remake or going in a completely different direction". Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald felt that the movie was soulless, writing that [...] "The better these talking beasts look, the more the film resembles a gorgeous screen saver. <b>You</b> <b>admire</b> The Jungle Book, but you can't lose yourself in it".|$|E
2500|$|She {{also had}} her critics, {{particularly}} in her later years {{among the new}} generation of playwrights who advocated a more naturalistic style of acting. George Bernard Shaw wrote of the [...] "childishly egotistical character of her acting, which is not the art of making you think more highly or feel more deeply but the art of making <b>you</b> <b>admire</b> her, pity her, champion her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow her fortunes breathlessly and applaud her widely when the curtain falls... It is the art of fooling you." [...] Ivan Turgenev wrote: [...] "All she has is a marvelous voice. The rest is cold, false, and affected; the worst kind of repulsive chic Parisienne!" [...] Russian dramatist Anton Chekhov, then a young medical student, was paying for his studies by writing reviews for a Moscow newspaper. He stated that [...] "We are far from admiring the talent of Sarah Bernhardt. She is a woman who is very intelligent and knows how to produce an effect, who has immense taste, who understands the human heart, but she wanted too much to astonish and overwhelm her audience." [...] He wrote that in her roles, [...] "enchantment is smothered in artifice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some celebrities opposed Davis' {{decision}} {{to continue on}} the party while a police investigation was being conducted in Houston's hotel room and her body {{was still in the}} building. Chaka Khan, in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on February 13, 2012, shared that she felt the party should have been canceled, saying: [...] "I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe that she would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would've said 'Stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' [...] I don't know what could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the person whose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected by hers. They were like... I don't understand how that party went on." [...] Sharon Osbourne condemned the Davis party, declaring: [...] "I think it was disgraceful that the party went on. I don't {{want to be in a}} hotel room when there's someone <b>you</b> <b>admire</b> who's tragically lost their life four floors up. I'm not interested in being in that environment and I think when you grieve someone, you do it privately, you do it with people who understand you. I thought it was so wrong." ...|$|E

60|$|That is, {{in matters}} of art and travel, the {{psychology}} of the cad.

If, living in Italy, <b>you</b> <b>admire</b> Italian art while despising Italian religion, you are a tourist, or cad. It does not matter how many years you have lived there. Tourists will often live a long time in hotels without discovering the nationality of the waiters. Englishmen will often live a long time in Italy without discovering the nationality of the Italians. But the test is simple. If <b>you</b> <b>admire</b> what Italians did without admiring Italians&mdash;you are a cheap tripper.|$|E
