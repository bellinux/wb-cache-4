There's {{a lot of guys}} that play fast and a lot of guys that play clean, and the guitar {{has come a long way}} as far as speed and clarity go, but nobody plays with the whole fullness of expression that Django has. I mean, the combination of incredible speed – all the speed <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> want – but also the thing of every note have a specific personality. You don’t hear it. I really haven’t heard it anywhere but with Django.|$|E

500|$|After Mother 3, Shigesato Itoi {{declared}} that he {{was done with the}} series. In response to Nintendo's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel, fans began to develop their own entry, Mother 4, in October 2010. As of September 2016, the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. In a preview of the game, Jason Schreier of Kotaku said Mother 4 looked [...] "stunning", as [...] "everything <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> want out of a new Mother game", from the music to the environment design. The fan-made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice. No future release date has been set. Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game, without need for an emulator. In March 2017, however, the team announced that as a preventative measure from getting taken down, the game would be rebranded, with 'Mother 4' no longer being the title of the game, and all direct references to the Mother series, like Mr. Saturn, removed. The decision came after many recent fan games received a DMCA notice.|$|E

500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Times both {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} five stars. The Times James Bone said that it [...] "boasts the same sly cultural references and flashes of brilliance that have earned the television series a following that ranges from tots to comparative literature PhDs". The Guardians Peter Bradshaw stated that it [...] "gives you everything <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> want" [...] and that he thought, [...] "Eighty-five minutes [...] not long enough to do justice to 17 years of comedy genius". Ed Gonzalez praised the film for its political message, likening the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon at the beginning to President Schwarzenegger's situation later on, as well as the film's visual gags. Randy Shulman praised the cast, and described them as having [...] "elevated their vocal work to a craft that goes way beyond simple line readings", and particularly praised Kavner who he said [...] "gave what must be the most heartfelt performance ever". Roger Ebert gave a positive review, but admitted he was [...] "generally [...] a fan of movies spun off from TV animation". He called it [...] "radical and simple at the same time, subversive and good-hearted, offensive without really meaning to be". Richard Corliss of Time said that the film [...] "doesn't try to be ruder or kinkier, just bigger and better".|$|E
500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer commented, [...] "The series' skillful juggling of different characters' viewpoints puts the audience in a position to sympathize strongly with each one. Director Nobuaki Nakanishi guides the emotional content with a light, gentle touch—wisely forgoing extensive internal monologues, speeches, and emotional outbursts. Instead, he draws you in with soft, effortlessly evocative visuals and a simple, beautifully understated score, relying on subtly shifting facial expressions and meaning-laden actions to communicate the quietly affecting emotional states of his characters." [...] For the second DVD volume, Theron Martin commented, [...] "Every element of the production, from the style of the artistry to the palette of colors used to the soundtrack, contributes wonderfully to {{the look and feel of}} the original story, and the anime script not only exactly duplicates many scenes from the manga but also does everything in its power to stay true to the spirit of the original writing." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Carl Kimlinger wrote [...] "...the writers make an ill-advised attempt to remove the [...] "bitter" [...] from [...] "bittersweet" [...] by tacking on some decidedly unconvincing plot developments ...it isn't as awful as it could have been. The third volume of Kashimashi...creat a deeply satisfying conclusion with all of the vicarious emotional thrills <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> want." ...|$|E

The currency rose the most in more than eight months after army chief Sondhi Boonyarataklin took power without bloodshed and pledged to hold elections in October 2007.

GameSpy criticized the absence of online play, but complimented the game's [...] "great deathmatching action" [...] and the game's high frame rate. They also said the game is [...] "everything <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> want in a sequel."

2500|$|Gallifrey is the {{umbrella}} {{title of a}} series of audio plays by Big Finish Productions, set on Gallifrey during Romana's tenure as President. In , the final chapter of the third series, the Time Lord Irving Braxiatel speaks of [...] "rumours out there in the big wide universe—more than rumours, in fact—that something's coming to Gallifrey, something worse than <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> imagine." [...] Because of these rumours, Braxiatel engineers the removal of the Time Lord biodata archive from Gallifrey, in order that the Time Lords might someday be restored after their planet meets its doom. Former Big Finish producer Gary Russell indicated in a forum posting on Outpost Gallifrey that this was a reference to the television series' Time War.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the editors}} had a {{difficult}} time finding someone to write the series, with Tim Hunter proving a tricky character to get right: although he already appeared in a mini-series, the character's main function had been to bear witness to the past, present and future of magic in the DC universe and so did not offer a writer much detail to work with. [...] Karen Berger eventually settled on writer John Ney Rieber to continue Tim's story, who expanded Tim's character using his own memories of being fourteen, later saying, [...] "I don't believe that my soul is likely to be shuffled off to Purgatory after I die. [...] What would be the point? I've been fourteen already." [...] Rieber utilized his own teenage confusion and delight in writing Tim, while introducing his first girlfriend Molly as a counterpoint: Molly was the opposite of Tim in nearly every way, someone [...] "who'd already figured out the best thing <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> do with your life was live it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by the {{production}} on Wrapped in Red, Clarkson wanted all the tracks on Piece by Piece {{to sound like}} its own soundtrack, while also wanting every song to have potential as a single. Taking inspiration from the soundtracks of the feature films Cruel Intentions (1999) and Love Actually (2003), she remarked: [...] "I love soundtracks and I love how you can tell, 'Oh, this {{should be in a}} soundtrack!' You can picture the movie. I definitely wanted the orchestral elements going on and I definitely wanted the intense factor going on." [...] Clarkson illustrated the album as a concept record telling a single [...] "awesome" [...] story, using different pieces of her character, leading her to name the album Piece by Piece. Citing the aspects of heartbreak and personal struggle as well as peace and empowerment in its lyrical content, she described the record as an album within an uplifting and reflective environment. She recalled: [...] "I'm 32 years old, I have pretty much run the gauntlet of pretty much every emotion <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> go through — especially being 19 [...] and being thrust into the industry, and growing up really quickly." ...|$|E
