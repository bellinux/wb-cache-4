[...] Johnson Jr., {{and a team}} of Johnson Wax {{employees}} {{undertook a}} two-month, [...] expedition to northeast Brazil in 1935 in search of a sustainable source of carnauba wax. On his return, he published a book, dedicating the book to his son: [...] "To Sammy, I hope <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> trip some day. It changed my life. Love, Dad." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "To my mind, there’s {{no moral}} or {{practical}} distinction [...] If cruelty {{is no longer}} declared unlawful, but instead is applied {{as a matter of}} policy, it alters the fundamental relationship of man to government. It destroys the whole notion of individual rights. The Constitution recognizes that man has an inherent right, not bestowed by the state or laws, to personal dignity, including the right to be free of cruelty. It applies to all human beings, not just in America—even those designated as ‘unlawful enemy combatants.’ If <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> exception, the whole Constitution crumbles. It’s a transformative issue...|$|E
2500|$|.....Like Clockwork has {{received}} critical acclaim. According to Metacritic, {{it is their}} most acclaimed album since Songs for the Deaf, with an average score of 82, based on 46 reviews. Giving the album {{four and a half}} stars out of five, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that [...] "'...Like Clockwork' is unusually focused for a Queens of the Stone Age record, containing all of the group's hallmarks— namely volume and crunch, but also a tantalizing sense of danger, finding seduction within the darkness." [...] At Alternative Press, Dan Slessor wrote that [...] "surrendering to its strange charms {{could be one of the}} smartest decisions <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> year." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how can <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it a great movie and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?" [...] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.|$|E
2500|$|I think [...] {{has stated}} that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction, and that's as simple as {{they want to keep}} it. They don't {{want to get into the}} nitty-gritty things such as if you bury a Scud missile to hide it from detection, there is a little thing called corrosion. Where do you hide the fuel, how do <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> stuff up, how do you align it. Because when you {{disassemble}} it, there is a process called re-alignment. There is a factory involved in that. And then you have to test launch it to make sure that the alignment works, and that's detectable, and they haven't done that. There is a lot of common sense things that go into consideration of whether or not Iraq has a operational weapons of mass destruction capability.|$|E
2500|$|On a trip in Jerusalem, Rodriguez-Lopez {{purchased}} an archaic ouija-type talking {{board at}} a curio shop {{as a gift}} for Bixler-Zavala. They would return to their tour bus after shows to play with it during their 2006 tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, as it quickly became the band's post-show ritual. Dubbed [...] "The Soothsayer", the board revealed stories, gave names and made demands, as the band was contacted by three different people who appeared in the form of one, who was then referred to as [...] "Goliath". The more the band interacted with [...] "The Soothsayer", otherworldly coincidences began plaguing the band's experience writing and recording The Bedlam in Goliath: Blake Fleming, their drummer at the time, quit mid-tour and left the band with financial troubles; Bixler-Zavala wound up needing surgery performed on his foot due to the shoes he had been wearing, forcing him to relearn how to walk post-surgery; audio tracks sporadically disappeared from the studio's harddrives; Rodriguez-Lopez's home studio flooded and was subject to multiple power outages; and the album's original engineer went through a nervous breakdown, leaving behind all previous work with no notes as to where anything was. The engineer who quit stated to Rodriguez-Lopez: [...] "I'm not going to help <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>this</b> record. You're trying to do something very bad with this record, you're trying to make me crazy and you're trying to make people crazy." ...|$|E
