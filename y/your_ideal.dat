In early 1904 he moved to Clarens, a small village in the canton of Vaud in western Switzerland where he {{spent the rest of}} his days looking over Lake Geneva and the Alps from his balcony. [...] "He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past", he wrote in his final letter, addressed {{to the people of the}} Transvaal. [...] "Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again." [...] After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him.|$|E

[...] If the script is enclosed inside a <script> element, it won't be shown on the screen. [...] Then suppose that Bob, a member of the dating site, reaches Mallory’s profile, which has her answer to the First Date question. Her script is run automatically by the browser and steals a copy of Bob’s real name and email directly from his own machine.|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, {{you do not}} at best {{know her}} name. And what if I try <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> [...] With something, if not quite so fair, at least more en regle and real? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, I see. You are jealous. No {{man must}} presume {{to think that}} he can paint <b>your</b> <b>ideal.</b> This is serious, my friend! Your great-aunt! 'Der Neffe als Onkel' in a tragic sense--ungeheuer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if," [...] said Beatrice, in a {{very low}} voice, [...] "if I were false to <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> of me--if I were to do {{anything}} that would destroy your faith in me--something weak or wicked--" ...|$|E
5000|$|... “The hippy {{generation}} sold {{itself out}} as soon as money got in the way,” said Mr. LoPorto. “Ben and Jerry didn’t. They were my inspiration for starting my own business, the model of how you can stick to <b>your</b> <b>ideals</b> and still do well financially.” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cherish your visions. Cherish <b>your</b> <b>ideals.</b> Cherish {{the music}} that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all {{delightful}} conditions, all heavenly environment, of these, if you but remain true to them your world will at last be built." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None {{of us ever}} do," [...] said Mrs. Allan with a sigh. [...] "But then, Anne, {{you know}} what Lowell says, 'Not failure but low aim is crime.' We must have ideals and try {{to live up to}} them, even if we never quite succeed. Life would be a sorry {{business}} without them. With them it's grand and great. Hold fast to <b>your</b> <b>ideals,</b> Anne." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See, Belle! Cubans; own {{half the}} island between them. Splendid, aren't they? Look at the {{diamonds}} on her lovely arms, and his ravishing moustache. Isn't he <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> of Prince Djalma, in The Wandering Jew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Verrian's {{eyes were}} suffused {{with pride and}} fondness. [...] "And you can always think, Philip, that this has come to you without the least {{lowering}} of your standard, without forsaking <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am sorry,' said Psmith gravely, 'if my stare {{falls short}} {{in any way}} of <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> of what a stare should be; but I appeal to these gentlemen. Could I have watched the game more quietly?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{person you}} are in love with led you to expect it, Humphrey, and that person is--yourself. You are in love {{temporarily}} with <b>your</b> own <b>ideal</b> of me." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of his interest in phenomenology coincided with the unfolding dissolution of his vows to the priesthood. Hellinger tells how one of the trainers asked the group, [...] "What {{is more important to}} you, <b>your</b> <b>ideals</b> or people? Which would you sacrifice for the other?" [...] This was not merely a philosophical riddle to him. He was acutely sensitive to how the Nazi regime sacrificed human beings in service of ideals. He says, [...] "In a sense, the question changed my life. A fundamental orientation toward people has shaped all my work since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] said Mr. Theophilus, [...] "you {{must either}} be {{a rich man}} in your own right, or <b>your</b> fair <b>ideal</b> must have a {{handsome}} fortune of her own." ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. Shall I {{tell you}} why? <b>Your</b> <b>ideal</b> {{is an old}} woman. I daresay shes got a young face; but shes an old woman. Old, old, old. Squeamish. Cant stand up to things. Cant enjoy things: not real things. Always on the shrink.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} I am not <b>your</b> <b>ideal,</b> Maude.

6000|$|These {{observations}} {{seemed to}} make Madame de Cintre rather grave. At last she said, [...] "Depend upon it, I don't {{come up to the}} mark; your mark is too high. I am not all that you suppose; I am a much smaller affair. She is a magnificent woman, <b>your</b> <b>ideal.</b> Pray, how did she come to such perfection?" ...|$|E

50|$|Lady or Gentleman Circulista, may you {{continue}} riding the exhausted Rocinante of <b>your</b> <b>ideals</b> through the Philippine fields of Montiel; continue on your quest {{even if you}} need to fight like a Hidalgo, not with windmills, but with mills of steel that will leave you bloodied if not dead; because with your courage, tenacity and death, you would have demonstrated: that not by bread alone does man live; but by ideals; even if those ideals are found hidden behind the farcical cart, which sometimes laughs and sometimes cries for the solace and amusement of your public.|$|R
5000|$|Trianon, Trianon, in you we do believe. We {{believe in}} your work, <b>your</b> success, <b>your</b> <b>ideals.</b> We {{believe that to}} every girl who claims you, you are a light that leads the way to friendship, work and healthy fun. We believe in your organization, born in the spirirt of {{independence}} and incorporating the high ideals of democracy, friendship, scholarship, and service. And so to you we come with grateful hearts, thankful for the torch you have given us to bear, for friends to cherish, tasks to do, and traditions to carry on through the years. O, Trianon, in you we do believe. (Trianon Key) ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{laughed in}} spite of myself. 'Now, Mr. Tillington,' I said severely, 'if you're going to pay compliments, I shall have to return. If {{you want to stop}} here with me, you must {{remember}} that I am only Lady Georgina Fawley's temporary lady's-maid. Besides, I didn't mean that. I meant, what is <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> of a man's right relation to his mädchen?' ...|$|E
6000|$|So, drawing {{comfortable}} breath again, You weigh and find, whatever {{more or less}} I {{boast of}} my ideal realized [...] 80 Is nothing in the balance when opposed To <b>your</b> <b>ideal,</b> your grand simple life, Of which you will not realize one jot. I am much, you are nothing; you would be all, I would be merely much: you beat me there.|$|E
60|$|You make <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> clear, a {{scientific}} language you demand, without ambiguity, as precise as mathematical formulae, and with every term in relations of exact logical consistency with every other. It {{will be a}} language with all the inflexions of verbs and nouns regular and all its constructions inevitable, each word clearly distinguishable from every other word in sound as well as spelling.|$|E
3000|$|You {{think about}} them when you come [home]. You don’t have time to process {{anything}} [in the field], because you – you’re so overwhelmed by the situation, {{you do what you}} can in that moment, and you have to move on, because the next day could bring the exact same thing. So you can only process for your own mental health what’s right in front of you. Until you come home, at least…and then you start to kind of – really think about what you did, or what you didn’t do, and – sometimes there’s a big –… discordance of what – <b>your</b> <b>ideals,</b> and what you actually did…they just aren’t meeting up and it’s a huge mental struggle then.

6000|$|... "Yes, I can {{see that}} they are not fit to {{associate}} with them," [...] said the Altrurian, with a gleam of commonsense that surprised me, [...] "and that as long as your present conditions endure they never can be. You must excuse the confusion which the difference between <b>your</b> political <b>ideals</b> and <b>your</b> economic <b>ideals</b> constantly creates in me. I always think of you politically first, and realize you as a perfect democracy; then come these other facts, in which I cannot perceive that you differ from the aristocratic countries of Europe in theory, or practice. It is very puzzling. Am I right in supposing that the effect of your economy is to establish insuperable inequalities among you, and to forbid the hope of the brotherhood which your policy proclaims?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged {{became a}} best-seller for Random House. Its success {{motivated}} them to republish We the Living in 1959. In {{preparation for the}} new edition, Rand made some changes to the text. In her Foreword to the revised edition, Rand declared that [...] "In brief, all the changes are merely editorial line changes." [...] Rand's description notwithstanding, {{some of the changes}} have been taken to have philosophical significance. In the first edition, Kira said to Andrei, [...] "I loathe <b>your</b> <b>ideals.</b> I admire <b>your</b> methods." [...] In the second edition, this became simply [...] "I loathe your ideals." [...] A few pages later, Kira said to Andrei, [...] "What are your masses but mud to be ground underfoot, fuel to be burned for those who deserve it?" [...] Rand's revision deleted this sentence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Beatrice, {{almost in}} a whisper. [...] "Thank you," [...] she repeated, after a moment. She stood up and held out her hand. [...] "I think I must go now. Good-bye, dear laddie. Write to me from Rome. I shall always be glad {{to hear from you}} {{wherever}} you are. And--and--I shall always try to live up to <b>your</b> <b>ideal</b> of me, Stephen." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell, {{tearing the}} note open: [...] "Well, it's no use trying any {{sentiment}} with you, or any generosity either. You're always just the same; a teasing joke is <b>your</b> <b>ideal.</b> You can't imagine a woman's wanting {{to keep up}} a little romance all through; and a character like Mr. Welling's, who's all chivalry and delicacy and deference, is quite beyond you. That's the reason you're always sneering at him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You young fellows," [...] he said, with a {{friendly}} look at George, [...] "are such individualists. You make a business of enjoying yourselves. With your piquet and your racing and your billiards and what not, you'll be used up before you're fifty. You don't let your imaginations work. A green old age {{ought to be}} <b>your</b> <b>ideal,</b> instead of which {{it seems to be}} a green youth. Ha!" [...] Mr. Pendyce looked at his daughters till they said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know we did, passionately--then; but we don't now." [...] She {{laughed a}} little bitterly. [...] "Poor Nat! I am only another trial added to your long list. <b>Your</b> beliefs, <b>your</b> <b>ideals</b> are {{meaningless}} to me--mere narrow-minded dogmas, stifling thought. Nellie was the wife Nature had intended for you, so {{soon as she}} had lost her beauty and with it all her worldly ideas. Fate was maturing her for you, if only we had known. As for me, I ought to have been the wife of an artist, of a poet." [...] Unconsciously a glance from her ever restless eyes flashed across the table to where Horatio Camelford sat, puffing clouds of smoke into the air from a huge black meerschaum pipe. [...] "Bohemia is my country. Its poverty, its struggle would have been a joy to me. Breathing its free air, life would have been worth living." ...|$|R
50|$|As a {{group they}} claim to be apolitical and the lyrics of their songs are {{generally}} quite subcultural in nature - about having fun, being honest and living life accordingly to <b>your</b> <b>ideals</b> - but all members are committed to anti-fascism {{and some of them}} take part in various sports or anarchist initiatives during their free time. They also have a zero tolerance attitude towards racism and recognise the diverse roots of their musical genre. Although Mister X's self-proclaimed apolitical stance initially led to them to being somewhat ostracised on the then highly politicised Belarusian punk scene, it has not stopped them from garnering an international following of fans in the years following the band's creation, despite of difficulties with the country's regime and travelling. One of their gigs in Ryazan was broken up by the Russian law enforcement under false accusation of drug use, which later lead to several cases of police brutality and torture on numerous members of the audience.|$|R
5000|$|According to Jordan, [...] "One {{must be true}} {{to himself}} and his athletes. Establish TRUST in all of your {{dealings}} with others and be consistent in <b>your</b> <b>ideals.</b> But above all, a coach must use his own unique personality for you cannot be what you are not. Coaching is never a one-way street. The coach and the athlete must understand and work harmoniously with one another. The coach’s and the athlete’s objective should be one. If the athlete doesn’t aim high enough, the coach should sell and inspire him on raising his sights. The coach has to motivate the athlete in every possible way. The coach has to create attention, the desire to learn, willingness to practice, and the maximum interest. You {{have to try and}} provide for the fundamental needs of every individual: 1) physical well-being, 2) personal recognition, worth and importance, and 3) security and affection. Where both the coach and athlete possess the correct mental attitude, the range of their combined efforts becomes unlimited.”http://coaching.usolympicteam.com/coaching/kpub.nsf/v/2Dec03 ...|$|R
