2500|$|Quite strong remarks: {{no doubt}} Darwin resented Lyell's {{repeated}} {{suggestion that he}} owed a lot to Lamarck, whom he (Darwin) had always specifically rejected. Darwin's daughter Henrietta (Etty) wrote to her father: [...] "Is it fair that Lyell always calls <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> a modification of Lamarck's?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Take {{the case}} of an Irishman who strikes an Italian [...] working on the railroad. A body of [...] Irish say, We do not like ‘Dagos’ and will not work with them, and they drive them off; they wouldn’t do that if they were Irish. [...] The [...] Irishman goes into a bar room and he sees an Italian there and knocks him down. Would that be a {{violation}} under <b>your</b> <b>theory?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|Florentia. Please {{remember}} <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> {{that our}} life's a scramble, and suffer {{me to go}} and dress for dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> about life, <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> about love, <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> about pleasure. All <b>your</b> <b>theories,</b> in fact, Harry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Gordon, you {{are better}} than <b>your</b> <b>theories.</b> <b>Your</b> passionate heart contradicts your frigid intellect. I repeat it--you are in love." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And supposing the Coroner's jury returns {{a verdict}} of Wilful Murder against Alfred Inglethorp. What becomes of <b>your</b> <b>theories,</b> then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On the whole, I don't think so. In fact, it's {{possible}} {{there was}} some foundation for <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> about the Eskdale road." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what was}} <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> of the situation? That your friend, Mr. Melford, had a {{nightmare}} {{in which he}} was dreaming of burglars?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I believe you're right," [...] {{approved}} the other girl. [...] "That is, <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> is correct, but the wicked sometimes refuse to reform." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Taking it {{for granted}} that <b>your</b> <b>theory's</b> right, {{suspicion}} seems to fall on the men you mentioned," [...] he said. [...] "Whom do you suspect?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{you don't}} mean to say," [...] the Doctor broke in, [...] "that {{you have been}} trying to cram <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> down his throat on a racecourse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now tell me," [...] said Kent, as {{they stood}} beside the billiard table, [...] "what is <b>your</b> own <b>theory,</b> the police theory, of this murder? Give me <b>your</b> first <b>theory</b> first, {{and then go on}} with the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah ha! <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> is very good, sir, {{but your}} {{practice}} is bosh," [...] quoted Dolly, with a gleam {{of the old}} mischief in her face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{a better}} excuse--the means of going. You're quite wrong in <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> that I laugh at you. I don't {{know what has}} put it into your head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is," [...] {{answered}} the rector, {{with an emphasis}} not to be denied. [...] "I wish you would give me <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> about this phenomenon, and speak frankly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{this case}} it {{certainly}} is so," [...] I replied, after a little thought. [...] "The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think me impertinent if I were to put <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> to a more severe test?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Your arguments,' says Andy, 'are past {{criticism}} or comprehension. No, we can't {{walk off}} with the money--as things now stand. I admire your conscious way of doing business, Jeff,' says Andy, 'and I wouldn't propose anything that wasn't square in line with <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> of morality and initiative.|$|R
60|$|Spite of his evil ways, however, he is {{interesting}} and always unexpected. When you {{have watched the}} red squirrel that lives near your camp all summer, and think you know all about him, he does the queerest thing, good or bad, to upset all <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> and even the Indian legends about him.|$|R
6000|$|She got {{the matter}} {{instantly}} straight. [...] "Not a bit. That chatter was mine only--and produced to meet yours. There had so, by <b>your</b> <b>theory,</b> to be a woman----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, indeed, {{changes the}} matter," [...] said the gratified young wife; [...] "and I believe, after all, dear Nanny, that I must become a convert to <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> of dreams." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's so--you've proved <b>your</b> <b>theory,</b> and {{suffering}} humanity owes {{you a great}} debt from henceforth," [...] and they crowded around him, and wrung his hand cordially and thankfully, and praised him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a fair spieler, child. But, by golly, I'd {{like to see}} you try {{to design}} a new manifold, or run a factory and keep a lot of your fellow reds from Czech-slovenski-magyar-godknowswheria on the job! You'd drop <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> so darn quick! I'm not any defender of things as they are. Sure. They're rotten. Only I'm sensible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{know you}} better," [...] I replied [...] "than {{to think that}} you would be happy in such a situation; but the good you would do to others may be an inducement, since the time is {{probably}} arrived when you can put <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> into practice, and you may bring about such reformation and change, as will conduce to that perfect system of government which you delight to portray." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How strange {{of you to}} stay {{apart from}} her like this!" [...] said Sue, her {{trembling}} lip and lumpy throat belying her irony. [...] "You, such a religious man. How will the demi-gods in your Pantheon--I mean those legendary persons you call saints--intercede for you after this? Now if I had done such a thing {{it would have been}} different, and not remarkable, for I at least don't regard marriage as a sacrament. <b>Your</b> <b>theories</b> are not so advanced as your practice!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, what is <b>your</b> <b>theory,</b> Hilda? The real man, as you say, {{no doubt}} {{made a great}} many acquaintances there; this man {{seems to have been}} behind the scenes also." ...|$|E
6000|$|ERNEST. <b>Your</b> <b>theory</b> of {{education}} is delightful. But what influence will your critic, brought up in these exquisite surroundings, possess? Do {{you really think that}} any artist is ever affected by criticism? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same," [...] the Inspector remarked thoughtfully, [...] "some one who {{is still}} at large {{committed}} those murders and stole those jewels. What is <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> about the jewels, Mr. Quest?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{suspicious}} of young Jones from the first," [...] said Arthur; [...] "but I {{have been studying}} this boy's character, and he is positively incapable of the crimes you accuse him of, such as robbery and murder. In other words, whatever Jones may be, he is not Andrews; or, if by chance he proves to be Andrews, then Andrews is innocent of crime. All <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> are based upon a desire to secure rewards, backed by a chain of circumstantial evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would do it!" [...] cried Mrs. Maynard, {{throwing}} her right arm round Grace's neck, while the latter bent over to feel the pulse in her left. [...] "I knew where you had gone as soon as your mother told me you had driven off with Walter Libby. I'm so glad that you've got somebody to consult! <b>Your</b> <b>theories</b> are perfectly right and I'm sure that Dr. Mulbridge will just tell you to keep on as you've been doing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll tell you. I {{was going}} to ask you which of those two girls you had painted it from. The {{topography}} was the topography of Miss Maybough, but the landscape was the landscape of Miss Saunders." [...] He waited, as if for Ludlow to speak; then he went on: [...] "I supposed you had been working from some new theory of yours, and I thought I had said about as much on <b>your</b> <b>theories</b> as you would stand for the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And when {{we travel}} by Electricity if I may venture to develop <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> {{we shall have}} {{leaflets}} instead of booklets, and the Murder and the Wedding will come on the same page." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{to make me}} {{strong in}} spite of myself, I understand. But, {{according}} to <b>your</b> <b>theory,</b> the strong love the weak only. Are you to grow weak, Grizel, as I grow strong?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop, my dear fellow," [...] {{interrupted}} Tom, [...] "don't become energetic! I {{accept your}} answer to the general question; but how many people, think you, can afford to put <b>your</b> <b>theory</b> in practice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you make}} of it all, then, Hawkins?" [...] asked the captain, with a troubled face. [...] "What is <b>your</b> own <b>theory</b> on the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... --You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You {{have brought}} us {{all this way}} to show us a French triangle. Do you believe <b>your</b> own <b>theory?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you'll have a {{clear field}} for {{experiment}} at Smith. You can try all <b>your</b> pet <b>theories</b> on the Tetongs. God be with them!--their case is desperate." [...] He chuckled gracelessly.|$|R
