She stood in the middle of her sisters, planted her feet apart, and belted out solos as well as singing the lead parts with zest and confidence. The kind of singing she did cannot be taught, it can't be studied in books, it can't be written down. Long experience as a singer and wide-open ears were her only teachers, and she learned her lessons well." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jamey Giddens of Pop Confidential praised Lee, saying: [...] "I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe! My Karen from Knots Landing, Michele-To-The-Lee. Oh, {{this is too}} good! I can't {{remember}} a more comforting primetime presence than Lee, as Seaview Circle's courageous heroine Karen Fairgate MacKenzie. For 14 seasons, Lee's Karen was the glue that held Knots together.

5000|$|Whilst a {{research}} sociologist at the University of California late 1960s she published {{a series of}} critiques of the systems approach to social policy [...] She criticised systems analysis for using mathematical formulae and disregarding social factors, especially when analyzing technology and public policy. She reminisced about her work's impact: [...] "Technological advance was evident on every front. The 'dominant paradigm' embraced only the quantitative. What <b>you</b> <b>could</b> not <b>count,</b> did not count. The social and human aspects were systematically avoided {{in the rush to}} be 'scientific.'" ...|$|R

We knew we wanted to see a little more to that story.|$|R
500|$|Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was {{watching}} {{news of the}} attacks {{when she heard the}} plane. [...] "I heard the plane going over and I went out the front door and I saw the plane going down. It was headed toward the school, which panicked me, because all three of my kids were there.

[...] Val McClatchey had been watching footage of the attacks when she heard the plane. She saw it briefly, then heard the impact. The crash knocked out the electricity and phones. McClatchey grabbed her camera and took the only known picture of the smoke cloud from the explosion.

6000|$|Our cart had a hood; {{the roads}} were very bad, and the {{behaviour}} of that hood was stupendous! Its attachment to the cart was, so to speak, partial; therefore it possessed a semi-independent motion which was perplexing. <b>You</b> <b>could</b> not <b>count</b> on its actions. A sudden lurch of the cart to right or left did, of course, carry the hood with it, and, counting on that, you laid your sudden plans to avoid collision; but the elasticity of the hood enabled it {{to give you a}} slap on the face before obeying its proper impulse. So, too, it would come down on your head unexpectedly, or, without the slightest provocation, would hit you on the neck behind. I learned with painful certainty in that cart that I had a [...] "small" [...] to my back! It seemed to me that it grew large before the journey was over.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he turned}} to look for the cows, and found them all lying in the place where he had left them; but when they saw Covan they rose up and walked homewards, taking a {{different}} path to that they had trod in the morning. This time they passed over a plain so bare that a pin could not have lain there unnoticed, yet Covan beheld with surprise a foal and its mother feeding there, both as fat as if they had pastured on the richest grass. Further on they crossed another plain, where the grass was thick and green, but on it were feeding a foal and its mother, so lean that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>counted</b> their ribs. And further again the path led them by the shores of a lake whereon were floating two boats; one full of gay and happy youths, journeying {{to the land of the}} Sun, and another with grim shapes clothed in black, travelling to the land of Night.|$|R
60|$|In {{another moment}} the wild rider came {{bounding}} out from among them, and moving now erect, now on all fours, came sideling up to Martin, flinging {{his arms and}} legs about, wagging his head, grimacing and uttering whinnying and other curious noises. Never had Martin looked upon so strange a man! He was long and lean so that <b>you</b> <b>could</b> have <b>counted</b> his ribs, and he was stark naked, except for the hair of his head and face, which half covered him. His skin was of a yellowish brown colour, and the hair the colour of old dead grass; and it was coarse and tangled, falling over his shoulders and back and covering his forehead like a thatch, his big brown nose standing out beneath it like a beak. The face was covered with the beard which was tangled too, and grew down to his waist, After staring at Martin for some time with his big, yellow, goat-like eyes, he pranced up to him and began to sniff round him, then touched him with his nose on his face, arms, and shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Then the Beggar {{swung his}} staff also, and struck a mighty blow at Robin, which the yeoman turned. Three blows the Beggar struck, yet never one touched {{so much as}} a hair of Robin's head.

6000|$|It {{was only}} for a moment, however, that Joe forgot himself, for speedily {{reviving}} he thrust his drowsy father aside--to Mr Willet's mighty and inexpressible indignation--and darting out, stood ready to help them to alight.

60|$|Before <b>you</b> <b>could</b> <b>count</b> three he {{had pulled}} up more trees than Stan could have cut down in a lifetime, and had {{arranged}} them neatly in rows.

50|$|The {{questionnaire}} {{is designed}} so that each question has a two-part answer.

Starring alongside quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley, placekicker Lou Groza and fellow receiver Mac Speedie, Lavelli {{was an integral part}} of a Browns team that won seven championships during his 11-season career. Lavelli was known for his sure hands and improvisations on the field. He was also renowned for making catches in critical situations, earning the nickname [...] "Mr. Clutch". [...] "Lavelli had one of the strongest pairs of hands I've ever seen," [...] Browns coach Paul Brown once said of him.

6000|$|Friedrich, on {{the farther}} side of Borne, calls halt, till {{the main body}} arrive; rides forward, himself and staff, to the highest of a range or suite of knolls, some furlongs ahead; sees there in full view, far and wide, the Austrians drawn up before him.

And there, I think, the King is mainly to be found, looking now at the Austrians, now at his own people, for some three hours to come. His plan of Battle is soon clear to him: Nypern, with its bogs and scrags, on the Austrian right wing, is tortuous impossible ground, as he well remembers, no good prospect for us there: better ground for us on their left yonder, at Leuthen, even at Sagschutz farther south, whither they are stretching themselves. Attempt their left wing; try our [...] "Oblique Order" [...] upon that, with all the skill that is in us; perhaps we can do it rightly this time, and prosper accordingly! That is Friedrich's plan of action. The four columns once got to Borne shall fall into two; turn to the right, and go southward, ever southward:--they are to become our two Lines of Battle, were they once got to the right point southward.

60|$|The storm let {{go about}} this time with all its might; and it was dreadful the way the thunder boomed and tore, and the {{lightning}} glared out, and the wind sung and screamed in the rigging, and the rain come down.

The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563 mph (906 km/h, 252 m/s, or 489 knots) at a 40-degree nose-down, inverted attitude. The impact left a crater eight to ten feet deep (c. 3 m), and 30 to 50 feet wide (c. 12 m). All 44 people on board died. Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said {{the time of the}} crash was 10:06 or 10:10; an initial analysis of seismographic data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10:06, but the 9/11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted. Other media outlets and the 9/11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10:03, based on when the flight recorders stopped, analysis of radar data, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.Kelly Leverknight, a local resident, was watching news of the attacks when she heard the plane.
