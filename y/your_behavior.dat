500|$|One paper using {{questionnaires}} {{found that}} children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on self-monitoring (regulating <b>your</b> <b>behavior</b> to [...] "look good"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi {{likened the}} {{development}} of Chrono Trigger to [...] "play around with Toriyama's universe," [...] citing the inclusion of humorous sequences in the game {{that would have been}} [...] "impossible with something like Final Fantasy." [...] When Square Co. suggested a non-human player character, developers created Frog by adapting one of Toriyama's sketches. The team created the End of Time to help players with hints, worrying that they might become stuck and need to consult a walkthrough. The game's testers had previously complained that Chrono Trigger was too difficult; as Horii explained, [...] "It's because we know too much. The developers think the game's just right; that they're being too soft. They're thinking from their own experience. The puzzles were the same. Lots of players didn't figure out things we thought they'd get easily." [...] Sakaguchi later cited the unusual desire of beta testers to play the game a second time or [...] "travel through time again" [...] as an affirmation of the New Game + feature: [...] "Wherever we could, we tried to make it so that a slight change in <b>your</b> <b>behavior</b> caused subtle differences in people's reactions, even down to the smallest details... I think the second playthrough will hold a whole new interest." [...] The game's reuse of locations due to time traveling made bug-fixing difficult, as corrections would cause unintended consequences in other eras.|$|E

Therefore, according to the group, you are not that chatty, but you are either doing the proper performance. However the rater will only get the idea that <b>your</b> <b>behavior</b> is not as bad as other, thus, you will be rate higher.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, McGraw {{entered the}} weight loss business, selling shakes, energy bars, and supplements. These {{products}} were promoted {{on his show}} with his sisters Deana and Brenda and nephew Tony among the featured testimonials on the show. [...] These products' labels, which carried the brand name [...] "Shape It Up, Woo, Woo!", stated: [...] "These products contain scientifically researched levels of ingredients {{that can help you}} change <b>your</b> <b>behavior</b> to take control of your weight." [...] This met with swift criticism from various sources, accusing McGraw (a clinical psychologist, and not a physician) of lacking the expertise to recommend weight loss products. Facing a Federal Trade Commission investigation into Shape Up's claims, McGraw pulled his supplements off the market in March 2004, and the FTC dropped its probe. In October 2005, several people who used McGraw's products declared an intent to file a class action lawsuit against him, claiming that although the supplements cost $120 per month they did not stimulate weight loss.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy {{that he be}} given {{a copy of the}} Bible. This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to Christianity and became a born-again Christian. On his father's urging, he also read creationist books from the Institute for Creation Research. In May 1994, Dahmer was baptized by Roy Ratcliff, a minister in the Church Of Christ and a graduate of Oklahoma Christian University, in the prison whirlpool. Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994. Dahmer and Ratcliff regularly discussed the prospect of death, and Dahmer questioned whether he was sinning against God by continuing to live. Referring to his crimes in a 1994 interview with Stone Phillips on Dateline NBC, Dahmer had stated: [...] "If a person doesn't {{think that there is a}} God to be accountable to, then what's the point of trying to modify <b>your</b> <b>behavior</b> to keep it within acceptable ranges? That's how I thought anyway." ...|$|E

Lyrically, it sees Lo confessing her flaws before declaring [...] "On good days, I am charming as fuck!". [...] "The Way That I Am" [...] is a dubstep song filled with [...] "pain and passion" [...] as Lo sings in a soulful rasp and lyrically cries out to her partner to love her as she is; including flaws. [...] "Got Love" [...] is one of the albums [...] "pure" [...] pop moments, and contains an unwaveringly positive attitude. Lyrically, she rejoices exultant feelings of first falling in love as she sings [...] "Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond/Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops", and discusses the theme of immortality [...] "We live like legends now, know that would never die/Oh, we Got Love". Closing out the section is the power pop song [...] "Not on Drugs".

2500|$|Alamo Drafthouse {{is famous}} for {{enforcing}} a strict policy on behavior while in the theater. Children {{under the age of}} two are not allowed except for showings on specific days which are designated [...] "Alamo For All" [...] showings where parents are encouraged to bring young children and rules around talking are relaxed. Unaccompanied minors are not allowed in showings, except for members of the Alamo Drafthouse's Victory Vanguard rewards program, which allows 15-17 year olds to attend showings unattended after their application to the rewards program has been submitted and reviewed. The application involves demonstrating an understanding of the theater's policies around talking, texting, arriving to the theater late, and basic tipping etiquette. The cinema also prohibits talking and texting during the film. Anyone who violates this policy is subject to warning and potential removal from the premises. Alamo made national headlines in 2011 when the rantings of one angry customer who was ejected for texting were included in its [...] "Don't Talk or Text" [...] PSA shown before films. [...] "When we adopted our strict no talking policy back in 1997 we {{knew we were going to}} alienate some of our patrons," [...] Tim League posted on the cinema's website. [...] "That was the plan.
