25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has {{very little to do}} with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E

500|$|Juno actor Jason Bateman {{defended the}} film. [...] "Unfortunately," [...] he said, [...] "we’ve had these {{instances}} where guys kill {{people because of}} what they hear in rock ‘n roll lyrics or some garbage like that. Look, if you’re going to blame a movie or song for <b>your</b> <b>actions,</b> whether they be good or bad, I think you’re looking at the wrong things to influence your life. I think people should look to other areas of their life for lessons and guidance, mainly parents, or teachers, or friends, or whomever. That should probably be where you should point your eyes and ears." ...|$|E
500|$|Palmer {{felt that}} the {{characters}} of Marston and Williamson represented siblings in their former gang, while Dutch {{was more of a}} parental figure. He stated that Williamson is envious of Marston, despite Marston being his [...] "moral anchor". Palmer also felt that, after Marston left the gang, Williamson's life began to [...] "tailspin" [...] uncontrollably. [...] "s John grew into a man who conquered by achieving, Bill fell into a man who achieved simply by conquering," [...] said Palmer. The character of Edgar Ross was partly inspired by lawyer and political activist Charles Joseph Bonaparte, while the in-game Mexican Revolution of Nuevo Paraíso was somewhat based on the Plan de San Diego. When developing other characters, the team was inspired by various historical figures of the 20th century, including Frank James, Pearl Hart and Tom Horn. In terms of the random non-player character (NPC) dialogue, Houser felt that Redemption sits between Bully, in which NPCs remember the protagonist, and Grand Theft Auto, in which NPCs are unaware of the protagonist's identity. [...] "here are countryside environments and people are to some extent bored so they're looking for thing to talk about so <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> get spoken about and people are aware of you more," [...] said Houser.|$|E
500|$|Nebraska {{dominated}} Penn State {{on special}} teams, and ultimately, that advantage {{led to their}} victory. If {{it were not for}} Sam Ficken missing an extra point in the first quarter, Nebraska {{would not have been able}} to settle for a field goal late in the second half to send the game into overtime. In addition to the missed extra point, Penn State allowed a kickoff to be returned for a touchdown for the second straight week, and had a punt blocked. Bill O'Brien commented, [...] "We’ll continue to work hard in special teams. They’re good kids working hard." [...] Offensively, Penn State's was plagued by dropped passes that hindered Christian Hackenberg's overall performance, while the running game, though led by Zach Zwinak who rushed for 149 yards, was one-dimensional, as backup Akeel Lynch could muster only nine yards on five carries. Penn State's defense was [...] "in control for long stretches", but ultimately allowed a third-string quarterback to win the game, and also allowed Ameer Abdullah to rush for 147 yards. Prior to the game, Penn State's seniors were lauded with a video tribute that noted, [...] " [...] led by your commitment, led by your loyalty, by <b>your</b> <b>actions,</b> led by example." [...] This was their third overtime game of the season, but their first overtime loss since 2002.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene of}} Sniper Wolf {{wounding}} Meryl {{to set a}} trap for Snake was included among the top ten cutscenes in the Metal Gear series by Jeremy M. Loss of Joystick Division in 2010 and ranked as the seventh most shocking surprise in video games ("subverting the power fantasy") by George Reith of GamingBolt in 2012. In Trigger Happy, Steven Poole noted how the [...] "brillantly manipulative" [...] Metal Gear Solid can make the player feel guilty, even as [...] "it {{makes no sense to}} wish that you hadn't killed Sniper Wolf — that is, [...] properly to regret <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> — because it is a task that the game demands be fulfilled before you can progress." [...] In 2012, Ryan King of PLAY included the character of Sniper Wolf among the six [...] "things you didn’t want to kill (but you did anyway)" [...] and Ian Dransfield from the same magazine included her among the top [...] "bad guys you wanted to win". In 2015, Aleksander Gilyadov from VentureBeat included Sniper Wolf's death among six most memorable Metal Gear moments opining it [...] "still remains {{as one of the most}} poignant and beautiful scenes in the entire series. It also displays just how multilayered, benign, and well-written Kojima’s characters (both heroes and villains) really are." [...] That same year, Javy Gwaltney from Paste had this scene top his list of the saddest moments in Metal Gear.|$|E
2500|$|The American Statistical Association has {{subsequently}} {{written in}} support of the actions taken by AAPOR, saying: [...] "We are aware that, in taking this action, you have subjected yourselves to some criticism. On behalf of the American Statistical Association, we wish to recognize AAPOR for following procedure and acting professionally on such a difficult and divisive matter. In so doing, you eloquently express by <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> the goals stated in your Code." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kruse's Nassauers, the 1st Nassau Infantry, were {{actually}} on the ridge in Wellington's left center at Waterloo, not at Hougoumont, as is sometimes reported; Wellington apparently was familiar enough with Kruse's actions in the Peninsula to comment to him prior to the battle: [...] "I hope, General, that <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> today are as clever when you are fighting for me {{as they were in}} Spain when you were fighting against me." [...] A small Dutch light infantry battalion was in the woods of Hougoumont throughout the daylong fight there. The 2nd Nassau Infantry, under Prince Bernard of Saxe Weimar, was on the Allied far left at Waterloo.|$|E

2500|$|Later that night, Gan Ning {{went to see}} Sun Quan, who {{was delighted}} and said to him, [...] "Were <b>your</b> <b>actions</b> enough to frighten the old man (Cao Cao)? I had the {{opportunity}} of witnessing your valour." [...] Sun Quan then rewarded Gan Ning with 1,000 rolls of silk and 100 swords. He also remarked, [...] "Mengde (Cao Cao) has Zhang Liao while I've Xingba. I can match him." [...] Cao Cao withdrew his armies from Ruxu after slightly more than a month. Gan Ning was held in even higher regard among Sun Quan's forces {{and the number of}} troops under his command was increased by 2,000.|$|E
2500|$|On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote {{the lyrics to}} Hybrid Theory based on some early material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as [...] "everyday emotions you talk about and think about." [...] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, [...] "It's easy to fall into that thing– 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for <b>your</b> <b>actions.</b> I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down." ...|$|E
2500|$|A tribute {{came from}} Oakland Police Captain Edward Tracey, {{commander}} of the SWAT team that cornered Mixon. [...] "These were my men ... hey died doing what they loved: riding on motorcycles, kicking in doors, serving on SWAT", he said. Capt. Tracey thanked the witnesses who called 911 and attempted to aid Sergeant Dunakin and Officer Hege, [...] "To the citizens who called 911 last Saturday to report our officers down and the brave man ... I hope you hear me, sir ... the brave man who provided CPR to our fallen heroes, we thank you, we thank you {{from the bottom of}} our hearts. <b>Your</b> <b>actions</b> let us know that they, that these officers, did not die in vain. That the people, that they were there to serve, were the ones that helped them in the end." [...] The [...] "brave man" [...] he was thanking was Clarence Ellis, who had used his own coat to tamponade the arterial blood spurting from Sergeant Mark Dunakin's neck.|$|E

6000|$|... "You are right, O'Brien. <b>Your</b> <b>action</b> {{has been}} most honourable and considerate. But you are not to blame in the matter, save that perhaps you showed a little precipitancy in {{choosing}} a life-partner without due care and inquiry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{speak as}} if you were to be allowed to have your own way--as if all society was not arrayed against you. Have you counted the cost of <b>your</b> <b>action?</b> Have you {{considered}} the consequences of this crime?" ...|$|R
