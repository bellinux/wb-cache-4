She said of her audition, [...] "I said, 'So what do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be a female Pembleton?' And they were like, 'Well we don't {{want to say that}} but that's sort of the idea." [...] Thorne said the producers were looking for [...] "a certain type in terms of a strong woman who could keep up with all the men" [...] and that they incorporated elements of Thorne's own personality into the character, such as the strong amount of trust she has in her instincts. Thorne also said she was treated well by the cast, but upon starting, [...] "I was very {{aware of the fact that}} it's predominantly men, and I have no problem saying that as a small, dark woman I was terrified. I thought I was going to be put through the ringer." [...] Gerety, when asked about his experience joining the show, said only, [...] "It's interesting. It's really interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked by a {{reporter}} {{what he thought of}} the nickname, Youkilis quipped, [...] "It's better than being 'the Greek God of Illegitimate Children.'" [...] But according to his dad, [...] "Kevin disliked that Greek God of Walks stuff." [...] Fans actually rooted for Youkilis to take pitches. [...] "It was frustrating to hear fans say, 'Get a walk!'" [...] Youkilis said. [...] "I'll take a walk—a walk's as good as a hit—but don't <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> hit a home run or something?" ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{respective}} releases of [...] "She Wolf" [...] and [...] "Did It Again" [...] {{as the first}} and second singles from She Wolf, Shakira launched [...] "Give It Up to Me" [...] as the third single from the album. The track incorporates synthpop and hip hop influences with [...] "hand claps" [...] and a [...] "pounding bass". It additionally displays sexually-suggestive lyrics, including the lines [...] "put me in a cage and lock me away/and I'll play the games that <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play" [...] and [...] "anything you want you can make it yours".|$|E

500|$|In May 2001, it was {{revealed}} that Harrison had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs, and in July, it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland. While in Switzerland, Starr visited him but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston, where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery, prompting Harrison to quip: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come with you?" [...] In November 2001, he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City, for non-small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain. When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages.|$|E
500|$|In Shiloh, Naylor {{does not}} impart an {{explicit}} meaning of [...] "honesty" [...] to her juvenile readers, journalist Nancy Gilson observed. Instead, she conveys how [...] "confusing and unanswerable" [...] morality is using main character Marty's ethical predicaments and plot twists. To harbor Shiloh from the antagonist Judd and his principled parents, Marty must steal food and tell falsehoods. His dishonest actions {{serve as a}} contrast to his conscientious persona and his benevolent rescuing of the dog. Every night, Marty prays, [...] "Jesus ... which do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do? Be one hundred percent honest and carry that dog back to Judd so {{that one of your}} creatures can be kicked and starved all over again, or keep him here and fatten him up to glorify your creation?" ...|$|E
500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E

500|$|Once again, Patton {{found other}} {{commands}} given priority on gasoline and supplies. To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel {{and in one}} incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump. Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took Trier, Coblenz, Bingen, Worms, Mainz, Kaiserslautern, and Ludwigshafen, killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented {{virtually all of the}} remnants of the German First and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to by-pass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: [...] "Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give it back?" ...|$|E
500|$|A live {{video of}} the band {{performing}} [...] "Mr. Highway's Thinking About the End" [...] was included in an episode of Victory's VicTorV.For subsequent tours in promotion of Homesick, the band had a line-up change adding Four Letter Lie guitarist Kevin Skaff and dropping Tom Denney, the latter of whom wanted to settle down, but was still working with the band behind the scenes. A {{video of the}} band performing [...] "I'm Made of Wax, Larry, What Are You Made Of?", which was filmed on the Warped Tour, {{was added to the}} band's MySpace profile on October 16, 2009. It was included as a DVD trailer on their profile, which people mistook as the song's actual music video. [...] In December, the band released a Christmas song, [...] "Right Where <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Be", on their MySpace account.|$|E
500|$|Frustrated by his {{inability}} to capture his subject, Ingres broke down in tears in his studio, in company. Bertin recalled [...] "consoling him: 'my dear Ingres, don't bother about me; and above all don't torment yourself like that. You want to start my portrait over again? Take your own time for it. You will never tire me, and {{just as long as}} <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come, I am at your orders.'" [...] After agreeing to a breathing spell Ingres finally settled on a design. Early biographers provide differing anecdotes regarding the inspiration for the distinctive seated pose. Henri Delaborde said Ingres observed Bertin in this posture while arguing politics after dinner with his sons. According to Eugène Emmanuel Amaury Duval (he said was related to him by Bertin), Ingres noticed a pose Bertin took while seated outside with Ingres and a third man at a café.|$|E

500|$|A viral {{marketing}} campaign began on February 28, 2012, {{with the release}} of a video featuring a speech by Pearce, in character as Peter Weyland, about his vision for the future. Set in 2023, the TED 2023 video presents a futuristic vision of a TED conference, an annual technology and design event held in Long Beach, California. The segment was conceived and designed by Scott and Lindelof, and directed by Scott's son, Luke. The production was made in collaboration with, and made available through TED because Lindelof wanted to introduce new audiences to the conference itself. Lindelof said that the scene takes place in a futuristic stadium because [...] "a guy like Peter Weyland—whose ego is just massive, and the ideas that he's advancing are nothing short of hubris—that he'd basically say to TED, 'If <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> give a talk, I'm giving it in Wembley Stadium.|$|E
500|$|The demo {{was sent}} to {{producer}} Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff's work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. [...] "I guess {{to see if he}} made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day," [...] remembers Afanasieff. [...] "He said, 'We've got this Mariah Carey album done, but there's a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can {{to put it on the}} album.' I said, 'What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do?' and he said, 'You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?' I couldn't believe the opportunity that it was. I'd never produced anything by myself up until that time." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{the second}} race was over, Burton drove to victory lane {{after winning the}} race. In the next press conference, he said, [...] "It’s great to be in Victory Lane but we’ve got {{to keep it in}} {{perspective}} that this wasn’t the Daytona 500. <b>You</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell you what’s going to happen on Sunday?

We’re going to have six or seven cautions in the last 100 laps, it’s going to be a short race to [...] chequered [...] and that’s what’s going to happen." [...] The second event took one hour, five minutes and 54 seconds to complete and the margin of victory was 0.005 seconds. A crowd of 80,000 people attended the races. The races had a television audience of 3.303 million people.|$|E

500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play what <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, {{partly as a result}} of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos." ...|$|E
500|$|Veteran {{video game}} cover {{illustrator}} Marc Ericksen painted the North American box art, which included Mega Man firing a pistol {{instead of his}} trademark Mega Buster. Ericksen explained, [...] "I didn't know anything about Mega Man, and [...] I said to the art director, 'What is he shooting with?' ... He said, 'Well, he must have a pistol, because I don't see a rifle.' ... I said, 'So, a pistol? Do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a pistol?' And he said, 'Yeah, let's put a pistol in there.' So I did what I was told and I put the pistol in there. Add {{to the fact that}} they only had, like, a day and a half for me to do the painting and what you wound up with was not the greatest result. But certainly a result that was not my fault. I mean, they told me to put the pistol in his hand!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two teams was in the Premier League on Boxing Day, when Arsenal came from behind to beat Chelsea. Arsenal were unbeaten {{domestically}} since December 2001 and on course to complete their first league and cup double in four years. Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger was buoyant his team would complete the task on hand: [...] "We have been facing cup games in the league every week {{for a long time}} and this is just another. Chelsea will be a difficult team to beat if they are at their best on Saturday, but such is the confidence in this squad, we just feel we can win every game." [...] When asked what he made of Sir Alex Ferguson's comments that Manchester United played the best football in England, Wenger retorted: [...] "What do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say? Everybody thinks he has the prettiest wife." [...] The Arsenal manager was undecided whether to drop Richard Wright who started in every round of the FA Cup for David Seaman and to recall Sol Campbell who recovered from a hamstring injury.|$|E

500|$|In 1966, Mina {{started working}} with the Swiss Broadcasting Service and the Orchestra Radiosa in Lugano. She founded the {{independent}} record label [...] in collaboration with her father. The first record issued under the label was Dedicato a mio padre (Dedicated to My Father). Mina's growing interest in Brazilian music resulted in [...] "" [...] ("The Band"), a Chico Buarque song, which reached #3 in Italy. Mina continued to perform on Italian TV, and presented [...] "Zum zum zum" [...] on the spring 1967 variety series Sabato sera, accompanied by the NATO naval band. The series also included [...] "La coppia più bella del mondo" [...] ("The Most Beautiful Couple in the World"), a duet with Adriano Celentano. The title of the song [...] "Sono, come tu mi vuoi" [...] ("I Am, as <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> Be") was taken from Luigi Pirandello's play [...] The lyrics talk about the manic attention of the press on an artist's private life. Another hit from Sabato sera was [...] "L'immensità" [...] ("Immensity"), which was re-scored by Augusto Martelli and released as [...] "La inmensidad" [...] in Spain and Latin American countries.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, {{he was nervous}} and upset {{that he had made}} people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next time you want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well anybody can do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
