5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

25|$|Pains {{occupy a}} {{distinct}} and vital {{place in the}} philosophy of mind for several reasons. One is that pains seem to collapse the appearance/reality distinction. If an object appears to <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> red it might not be so in reality, but if you seem to yourself to be in pain you must be so: there can be no case here of seeming at all. At the same time, one cannot feel another person’s pain, but only infer it from their behavior and their reports of it.|$|E

25|$|Trump and Kiyosaki intersperse {{financial}} {{lessons with}} personal anecdotes from their respective careers. They elaborate on points previously raised in Why We Want <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich, and criticize {{a dearth of}} financial literacy education in the U.S. system. The authors warn of the middle-class squeeze and the harm this will cause to the American middle class. They praise entrepreneurship and advise aspiring business owners to embrace failure and learn from it. Trump and Kiyosaki end the book by extolling the economic benefits of immigration to the United States.|$|E

You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.|$|E
25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why We Want <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E

25|$|Why We Want <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to their}} work {{together}} on the book, Donald Trump had established himself {{in the business of}} real estate development and written The Art of the Deal, and Robert Kiyosaki authored The New York Times best seller Rich Dad Poor Dad. The coauthors became familiar with each other through encounters at the company The Learning Annex. Trump explained his motivation for wanting to work with Kiyosaki, saying he was motivated by their respective success with Trump's book The Art of the Deal and Kiyosaki's book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Trump and Kiyosaki first published Why We Want <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich as a private business venture together, forming a new company as a partnership called Rich Press.|$|E

It is horrible {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them.

25|$|Trip Brennan of The Intercept {{reviewed}} both Why We Want <b>You</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Rich and Midas Touch, and {{was critical}} of both books. Brennan criticized Midas Touch for its support of multi-level marketing, a practice he described as a pyramid scheme in disguise. He wrote negatively of the book's discounting of investment in mutual funds. BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views on the changing American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail. BuzzFeed News was critical Trump had shifted his perspective from the book, where he had previously written U.S. industrial jobs would never return and individuals needed to learn to cope with new skills in the Information Age. Business Insider similarly compared the work with Trump's 2016 campaign message, noting the book ended with a passage embracing immigrants whereas the Trump campaign {{was critical of}} illegal immigration from Mexico.|$|E

Of those, close to seventy percent are reported to remain drug-free, well above the results of traditional recovery methods.|$|E
500|$|According to Steven Curtis Chapman, {{the idea}} for [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] {{came out of a}} song he had written called [...] "Find Me", which did not end up being {{included}} on This Moment. He reflected that he thought [...] "God was just saying 'I really just want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> present in this moment - the good ones, the bad ones - all that'". [...] "Miracle of the Moment" [...] was written and produced by Chapman and Matt Bronlewee. It was mixed by F. Reid Shippen and mastered by Ted Jensen.|$|E

500|$|Belldandy is {{introduced}} to the series when Keiichi Morisato, portrayed as a typical college student with a notable lack of experience with women, accidentally dials the [...] "Goddess Relief Agency" [...] when attempting to order take-away noodles (the reason is simply explained as fate in the manga and anime adaptations). Belldandy appears before Keiichi and offers to grant him a wish. Convinced that the whole incident is a prank played on him by his seniors (Senpais), Keiichi half-jokingly wishes her {{to stay with him}} forever. ("I want a goddess like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> by my side forever"). The wish, of course, is granted—thus providing one of the key premises of the series.|$|E

But now I want <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.|$|E

She was created by Kōsuke Fujishima as one of three Goddesses who come to Earth to reside with Keiichi Morisato, and she serves as his love interest. She is depicted as a beautiful and powerful young woman, with strong nurturing tendencies, a trusting and innocent character, and an extremely kind heart. Belldandy is accidentally summoned from heaven by Keiichi in order to grant him a wish and stays when Keiichi wishes for [...] "a goddess like <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> by my side forever". The stories follow Belldandy as she builds a relationship with Keiichi, using her powers (which include teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and levitation) to help both Keiichi and his friends while keeping her true identity a secret.|$|E

[...] He threatened to expel Taylor, who responded by saying a forced departure would mean the end of US support. However, Khánh later said he was open to the possibility of going abroad and asked Taylor if he thought this {{would be good for the}} country, to which the ambassador replied in the affirmative. Khánh also said he took responsibility for his generals' actions, and expressed regret at what they had done. Khánh then ended the meeting, saying he would think about his future.|$|E

The image of Scully in the boat was meant to symbolize [...] "being tethered to something very tenuously, {{and that there was}} a chance for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cut adrift and slip into the unknown". Skinner facing the Smoking Man placed the character as [...] "both an antagonistic and institutional figure" [...] that tries to be both an FBI agent and an ally of Mulder and Scully—his refusal to allow the Smoking Man to smoke in his office [...] "speaks of [...] alliances and allegiances to Agent Scully and his hatred of this man he cannot vanquish, he cannot get rid of, but he has to tolerate".|$|E
