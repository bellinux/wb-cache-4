500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been sitting back, no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, did <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying {{a different approach to}} getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E

Sun Quan made peace with Cao Pi and planned to send Yu Jin back to Wei, but Yu Fan objected and urged him to execute Yu Jin. Sun Quan did not listen to Yu Fan. On the day of Yu Jin's departure, Sun Quan's subjects, including Yu Fan, came to see him off. Yu Fan told Yu Jin, [...] "Don't <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>think</b> there are no great men in Wu. It is just that my advice wasn't heeded." [...] Despite being humiliated by Yu Fan during his stay in Wu, Yu Jin spoke highly of Yu Fan {{when he returned to}} Wei. Cao Pi even prepared a seat for Yu Fan even though he knew that it would probably remain permanently unoccupied.|$|E
