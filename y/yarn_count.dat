2500|$|Charvet ties, {{ranked as}} the best designer's ties in the USA, are handmade, {{generally}} from a thick multicolor brocade silk, of a high <b>yarn</b> <b>count,</b> often enhanced {{by the addition of}} a hidden color, producing a dense fabric which goes through a proprietary finishing to acquire lustre, fluidity and resilience and achieve the right knot. The company develops its own exclusive patterns and colors. It creates about 8,000 models per year, Jacquard woven on exclusive commission, with silk either alone or mixed with other precious yarns, such as cashmere, [...] camel hair, bamboo yarn or covered with laminated precious metals, such as silver, gold or platinum, with techniques dating back to the 14th century when the popes were based in Avignon, which were also used in the 1920s for vests. Further to a long history of brocade patterns, first used in the 19th century for vests and then for ties, Charvet offers, according to Bernhard Roetzel, the largest range of woven silk neckties in the world. The ties collection, sometime [...] "unmistakably bold" [...] or [...] "witty [...] wicked", often noted for its shimmer and changing colors (Charvet ties' shimmer [...] "has become so synonymous with the company that we call it the Charvet effect", says a retailer.), uses about 5,000 shades in over 100,000 combinations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel mathematical model of bleached cotton plain single jersey knitted fabrics. The mathematical model {{is used to}} deduce the fabric geometrical relationships that can be useful for forecasting {{the properties of the}} fabric before production. A practical verification is carried out at different cotton <b>yarn</b> <b>counts</b> and twist factors. The obtained mathematical and practical results are deeply studied and analyzed. The results showed a good agreement between the proposed mathematical model and the practical one. The finished fabric weight is predicted at different <b>yarn</b> <b>counts</b> and loop lengths, and a forecasting weight chart is deduced. This chart will undoubtedly help the producers to enhance the fabric productions. In addition, an actual yarn diameter in the fabric measuring method is carried out and the fabric thickness is estimated consequently.

50|$|The S numbers {{originated}} in England, where the worsted spinning process was invented and {{arose from the}} worsted <b>yarn</b> <b>count</b> system for stating the fineness of yarn. The worsted count (also known as the Bradford count) {{was the number of}} 560 yard m lengths (hanks) of worsted yarn that 1 lb of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count.|$|E
50|$|The {{worsted count}} {{was only a}} rough {{measurement}} and {{has been replaced by}} more exact methods such as the metric <b>yarn</b> <b>count.</b> However, for fine wool, the memory of the older system survives in the S numbers which have a very rough correspondence to worsted count. In other words, fiber that yielded about 80 worsted hanks is roughly comparable to fiber designated as 80s using the S numbers. The critical difference is that while the worsted number was an indirect measure (and a rough one at that) of yarn thickness, the S number is a direct (and precise) measurement of the thickness of the fiber. The S number of fiber, and hence of yarn, fabric, or garments made of that fiber, is determined using the international standard promulgated by the International Wool Textile Organisation (IWTO).|$|E
50|$|Precursors {{for carbon}} fibers are {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN), rayon and pitch. Carbon fiber filament yarns {{are used in}} several processing techniques: the direct uses are for prepregging, filament winding, pultrusion, weaving, braiding, etc. Carbon fiber yarn is rated by the linear density (weight per unit length, i.e. 1 g/1000 m = 1 tex) or by number of filaments per <b>yarn</b> <b>count,</b> in thousands. For example, 200 tex for 3,000 filaments of carbon fiber is three times as strong as 1,000 carbon filament yarn, but is also three times as heavy. This thread can then be used to weave a carbon fiber filament fabric or cloth. The appearance of this fabric generally depends on the linear density of the yarn and the weave chosen. Some commonly used types of weave are twill, satin and plain. Carbon filament yarns can also be knitted or braided.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical analysis of fiber tension distribution within a ring spun yarn without relaxation. Yarn residual torque is determined {{on the basis}} of the translation of fiber tension at the spinning triangle, as presented in the first part of this series of papers, into the fiber tension within the yarn. The results from numerical simulations indicate that, with fiber buckling, the yarn exhibits a lower average fiber tension and, thus, a much reduced yarn residual torque than that without fiber buckling. Comparison with experiments confirmed that fiber buckling exists in ring yarns while the assumption of no fiber buckling is not realistic. Generally, a low yarn twist results in low average fiber tension in the yarn and, thus, a reduced yarn residual torque. A symmetrical spinning triangle leads to a slightly higher yarn residual torque than a right-angle spinning triangle when the <b>yarn</b> <b>counts</b> and twists are identical and fiber buckling occurs.
