That perception developed after the trip when Gingrich, while being questioned by Lars-Erik Nelson at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, said that he was dissatisfied that Clinton had not invited him to discuss the budget during the flight. He complained that he and Dole were instructed to use the plane's rear exit to deplane, saying the snub was [...] "part of why <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with us sending down a tougher continuing resolution". In response to Gingrich's complaint that they were [...] "forced to use the rear door," [...] NBC news released their videotape footage showing both Gingrich and Dole disembarking at Tel Aviv just behind Clinton via the front stairway.|$|E

5000|$|At the box office, movie patrons {{were given}} the {{disposable}} polarized glasses so {{they could see the}} film, creating the illusion that certain props and elements were coming toward the viewers. In this case, a pole that penetrates a car window; a Frisbee that flies toward the screen; a skeleton reaches out its arms; and a set a French doors that fly at the audience during the climactic scene. Most striking are the film's opening titles, in which the large block letters moved outward, and the “3D” were skewed as they moved outward. The process {{was supposed to be the}} new beginning for the 3D process, but it did not last long. The chief complaint was that the images in Amityville 3-D were blurry and distorted. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert complained on At the Movies, that the images were indistinct, and said “it really looks crummy.” Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel said that [...] "The 3D added nothing to the experience.

5000|$|Abraham {{spoke about}} {{shooting}} {{a scene of}} the episode in August 2012: Sometimes the toughest moments come where you least expect them. In this episode, that moment was Don throwing money in Peggy's face. It was a pivotal story point and didn't seem {{like it would be}} a hard beat to hit. During rehearsal when Jon Hamm threw the money at Lizzie Moss, it beaned her right between the eyes, inadvertently, but it was exactly what the scene required. Of course when we go to shoot the scene after setting the lights, Jon tosses the money at her, but it's just not eliciting the same response. Lizzie tells me it would really help her if Jon just nailed her with the cash again. It's harder than you think to have perfect aim with loose bills in your pocket when your target is [...] away. It took a few more takes than anyone had patience for, but when the cash finally landed where it needed to, it took Lizzie by surprise all over again, and that was the moment <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> seeing onscreen.|$|E

5000|$|Alurista {{has been}} married twice and has four children.

You {{internalize}} things that destroy <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> blaming others for your pain--whatever or whoever those 'others' happen to be--which makes you a resentful person. That resentment turns inward, and <b>you</b> <b>end</b> <b>up</b> eating yourself up."

5000|$|Schumacher {{had three}} team-mates - JJ Lehto, Jos Verstappen and Johnny Herbert - {{during the course}} of the season. All found the B194 {{difficult}} to drive; Verstappen said in 1996 that [...] "I must have a little the same driving style as Johnny because he said basically the same things about that car that I did and seems to have had the same feelings. It was a very difficult car. You could not feel the limit and so you were pushing and pushing and then suddenly it would have oversteer. Normally when you get oversteer you can control it but the Benetton would go very suddenly and so <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> having a spin. I had big problems with that car." [...] Schumacher's unusual driving style, based on his extraordinary feel for a car's performance made development for the B194 extremely limited; this gave him an advantage over his teammates. Whereas Schumacher could drive very poorly set-up cars with relative ease, his teammates needed to set up the car properly (as nearly all drivers do) to be competitive.|$|E

[...] "Welcome to the Pleasuredome" [...] was not given such a release. However, the 7" [...] vinyl single was released in two different mixes, and it was purely random as to which one <b>you</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> with, as both mixes were in identical sleeve designs and carried the same catalogue number. Not only that, but the subtitle used to identify different mixes was identical on both record labels, with only the matrix number on the run out groove giving the game away. The first 7" [...] (matrix 7 A 1 U) carried the normal 7" [...] single mix, which was guitar driven. However, the [...] "secret" [...] alternative mix (matrix 7 A 7 U or 7 A 8 U) was quite different, and featured on the Apple shaped Picture Disc. The subtitle for that disc was 'alternative reel' but on the 7" [...] single the subtitle remained unchanged as 'altered real'. In fact, although appearing to be identical sleeves, the two mixes were actually released in slightly different ones. The standard 7" [...] mix came in a thick paper sleeve, whereas the [...] "secret" [...] one came in a thin paper sleeve.|$|E
