[...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, we get the challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away {{with a level of}} wordplay and pseudo science that CSI or Alias could only have dreamed of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E
