She appeared {{in that role}} at Udine on 24 July 1847, and later as Lucrezia in I due Foscari in the same theatre. Later in 1847 she was singing Odabella in Rovigo, and it was there, {{at the end of}} that year, that Benjamin Lumley heard and ('struck with the splendid voice, the impulsive dramatic temperament, the spirit, and the captivating person') recruited her for the season of 1848 at Her Majesty's Theatre in London, of which he was the impresario. The family objected that she was too young to face the English public, but Lumley was urged to proceed by the tenor Rubini: 'I tell you plainly, and with deep conviction, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> an excellent acquisition. A most beautiful voice – give her good models and a good maestro'. Sophie herself was delighted with the proposals. In the winter of 1847 she made several appearances at La Fenice.|$|E

500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it.

500|$|Expressing honestly, in NVC, {{is likely}} to involve expressing an {{observation}}, feeling, need, and request. An observation may be omitted if {{the context of the}} conversation is clear. A feeling might be omitted if there is sufficient connection already, or the context is one where naming a feeling isn't likely to contribute to connection. It is said that naming a need in addition to a feeling makes it less likely that people will think <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> them responsible for your feeling. Similarly, it is said that making a request in addition to naming a need makes it less likely that people will infer a vague demand that they address your need. The components are thought to work together synergistically. According to NVC trainer Bob Wentworth, [...] "an observation sets the context, feelings support connection and getting out of our heads, needs support connection and identify what is important, and a request clarifies what sort of response you might enjoy. Using these components together minimizes the chances of people getting lost in potentially disconnecting speculation about what you want from them and why." ...|$|E

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex". When the interviewer asked if Mars was concerned with the verses [...] "Got a body full of liquor with a cocaine kicker" [...] due to his 2010 drug bust, he replied [...] "To take that line out would dilute my art", since the recording [...] "needs a sense of danger. When I was a kid, pop could be dangerous but still massive. Michael Jackson would grab his crotch. Prince would rock assless chaps".|$|E

500|$|The Australians {{recovered}} the Ashes from the 1907–08 English team, winning the series four Tests to one. [...] England {{were hit by}} the loss of their captain, Arthur Jones who contracted an illness that threatened to develop into pneumonia, causing him to miss the first three Tests. Hill, batting with team-mate Roger Hartigan playing his first Test match, set a record in the Third Test in Adelaide. [...] Suffering from influenza and unable to field in the English first innings, Hill joined Hartigan at the fall of the seventh wicket. [...] During his innings, Hill vomited beside the pitch and had to quickly leave the field several times. [...] The pair managed to bat on and take the match into a fourth day. [...] Hartigan, whose leave from work had expired, was relieved to receive a telegram from his employer: [...] "Stay as long as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> runs." [...] When Hartigan was dismissed for 116, the pair had together made 243 for the eighth wicket—still an Australian Test record.

2500|$|The {{following}} question was posed to Jeff Hawkins September 2011 {{with regard to}} Cortical learning algorithms: [...] "How {{do you know if}} the changes <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> to the model are good or not?" [...] To which Jeff's response was [...] "There are two categories for the answer: [...] one is to look at neuroscience, and the other is methods for machine intelligence. In the neuroscience realm there are many predictions that we can make, and those can be tested. If our theories explain a vast array of neuroscience observations then it tells us that we’re on the right track. In the machine learning world they don’t care about that, only how well it works on practical problems. In our case that remains to be seen. To the extent you can solve a problem that no one was able to solve before, people will take notice." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's lyrics, {{written by}} both Accardi and Lacey, are more {{abstract}} compared {{to many of}} those featured on previous album, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me. While Accardi had previously had some involvement in writing lyrics, Daisy saw him contribute far more compared to previous albums. Accardi and Lacey both affirmed {{that there had been}} no conscious decision made by the band on Accardi writing more. Lacey worked with Accardi to help refine his lyrics, as well as filling in any blanks. During writing, both Lacey and Accardi had unintentionally begun to reuse certain themes and imagery, such as nature and forests, as well as lyrics relating to an absence of love. Lacey also used his writing as a means of venting anxieties, comparing it to therapy proclaiming [...] "Daisy was just the venting of anxiety, of letting go and doing the right thing for us personally and as a band. It’s a very hard way to do something but it is the best way. There’s a lot of pent up emotion that goes into owning up to who you are, what you are doing and the choices <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> so Daisy was us rejoicing in that".|$|E
2500|$|At that time, the {{imperial}} administration was selecting many officials to fill its posts, {{and there were}} many officials who received positions after lying about their lineages or past experiences. [...] Emperor Taizong issued an edict ordering the officials to admit to their falsehoods, promising to spare them if they did so before a deadline, but stating that they would be executed if their falsehoods were discovered after the deadline. [...] When some officials were indeed discovered after the deadline to have falsified their lineages or past experiences, Emperor Taizong ordered that they be executed, but Dai rejected the order and instead sentenced them to exile. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "I issued an edict that those who did not admit would be executed, but you, lord, sentenced them only to exile. [...] This made my words not stand up to the people. [...] Are you betraying justice, lord?" [...] Dai responded, [...] "If Your Imperial Majesty had killed them on the spot, there would be nothing I could do. [...] Now that you have sent them to the supreme court, I have to follow the law." [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "You, lord, are following the law, but <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>making</b> me lose credibility." [...] Dai responded, [...] "The law is how the empire can keep its credibility. [...] Your Imperial Majesty made your words based on your feelings at that time, and you declared executions based on your anger. [...] By repudiating your action and putting them {{in the hands of the}} law, you are showing that you can hold back your anger and respect the state's credibility. [...] I would feel pity if Your Imperial Majesty followed your anger and not your credibility." [...] Emperor Taizong was pleased and responded, [...] "I now know that if there is a problem with the law, you, Duke, will correct it. [...] I do not worry any more." [...] It was said that Dai often spoke against Emperor Taizong's wishes in this way, and that as a result, people were not falsely convicted or punished while he was serving.|$|E
