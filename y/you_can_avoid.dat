2500|$|The Farm Act of 1951 {{underlined}} {{the idea}} that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> by a generous promotion of agriculture, the overproduction of meat and milk, [...] but proved to be deceptive. The situation, particularly in the dairy industry, coined the debates and actions of the agricultural policy in those years. In the European Community (EC) was the overproduction a big problem.|$|E

5000|$|... "Don't make assumptions. Find {{the courage}} to ask {{questions}} and to express what you really want.

6000|$|... "No {{more than}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> your decimals. Out {{of the full}} heart the mouth speaks, and my heart is very full. What harm do I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, sir, you {{can always}} do. As my uncle, I could scarce resist you. But, short of {{throwing}} me down the stair, I do not see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> giving me {{half an hour of}} your attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{soon find}} out," [...] {{returned}} Sam. [...] "Now, boys," [...] he said, on rejoining {{the others in}} the bush, [...] "see that your revolvers are charged and handy, but don't use them if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Said Foxy: [...] "After a fine speech {{like what}} you 'eard night before last, you ought to take 'old of your drill with re-newed activity. I don't see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> comin' out an' marchin' in the open now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Extraordinary! Most extraordinary! However, {{each house}} has its traditions, with which I would {{not for the}} world interfere. We have a {{prejudice}} in favor of washing.

60|$|If he be of a stout and {{short-winded}} build, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>avoid</b> his advances; but, {{when he is}} of {{the youthful}} and long-legged type, a meeting is inevitable. The interview is, however, extremely brief, most of the conversation being on his part, your remarks being mostly of an exclamatory and mono-syllabic order, {{and as soon as}} <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tear yourself away you do so.|$|R

6000|$|... "My lads," [...] he cried, [...] "remember {{my orders}} about using your weapons {{as little as}} possible. Be careful to throw only the smaller stones. Kill no one if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> it, but give {{as many of them}} the {{toothache}} as you can. We must be friends with these people if we are to live in peace here, and that won't be possible if we kill many of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will wear}} the ring, {{if you wish}} it, Mr. Outram, in memory of our {{adventure}}--that is, until you ask it back again," [...] she said confusedly; then added with a change of tone: [...] "There is one detail of the adventure that I hope you will not allude to more than <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid,</b> for the recollection of it is most painful to me, probably more so even than to you." ...|$|E

"You couldn't {{carry over}} forty or fifty pounds {{and maybe not}} that over the Pass," [...] he said, [...] "and I would rather pay the price and have you reserve your strength. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> each carry a {{knapsack}} filled with food, in case you wander from the trail, although don't let this happen if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> possibly <b>avoid</b> it.

60|$|When <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> notes, however, and {{get their}} {{substance}} into the text, it is highly desirable {{in the case of}} so large an audience, simply because, as so large an audience necessarily reads the story in small portions, it is of the greater importance that they should retain as much of its argument as possible. Whereas the difficulty of getting numbers of people to read notes (which they invariably regard as interruptions of the text, not as strengtheners or elucidators of it) is wonderful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pay your {{fine and}} come out of jail at once. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> our constable by {{remaining}} with the company the greater portion of the time; but it is necessary you should learn who the visitor is. Can't you walk around that way now and then? I don't fancy Bob will {{stay in the house}} all the time. This work can be done better now by you than any one I could send, since the presence of a stranger in the little village would attract attention." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must remember," [...] he said quietly, [...] "that {{after all}} Isaac is, in a measure, outside your life. No one can {{influence}} him for either good or evil. He {{is not like}} other men. He must go his own way, and I, too, am afraid {{that it may be}} a troublous one. He chose it for himself and neither you nor I can help.

5000|$|... "These are {{personal}} {{songs from}} people you'd rather not be. Sympathise at your peril. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> try to <b>avoid</b> the messages.

6000|$|I should answer such a man--My good friend, {{you come}} to church to hear about God as well as about what you call your soul. And any sound {{knowledge}} which <b>you</b> <b>can</b> learn about God, must be--believe me--of use to your immortal soul. For if you have wrong notions concerning God: how <b>can</b> <b>you</b> <b>avoid</b> having wrong notions concerning your soul, which lives and moves and has its being in God? ...|$|R
60|$|Yet {{here is a}} {{consideration}} pointing rather the other way. If you think, as you must think, that you yourself can be lost to God and damned, then I cannot see how <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> thinking that other people can be damned. But {{that is not to}} believe that there are people damned at the outset by their moral and intellectual insufficiency; that is not to make out that there is a class of essential and incurable spiritual defectives. The religious life preceded clear religious understanding and extends far beyond its range.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now {{you must}} be gone," [...] advised A-Kor. [...] "At any minute a guard may come and {{discover}} you here. Go directly to the Avenue of Gates, which circles the city just within the outer wall. There you will find many places devoted to the lodging of strangers. You will know them by the thoat's head carved above the doors. Say that you are here from Manataj to witness the games. Take the name of U-Kal--it will arouse no suspicion, nor will you if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>avoid</b> conversation. Early in the morning seek the keeper of The Towers of Jetan. May the strength and fortune of all your ancestors be with you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you leave}} it to {{a court of law}} to clear the matter up," [...] said he, [...] "of course <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>avoid</b> publicity. On the other hand, if you {{convince}} the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers. Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case would then never go into court at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked to}} write a piece for the Ecological Society of America's series, What Do Ecologists Do?, after {{receiving}} the award, Slobodkin wrote, [...] "My own advice on career development {{is that there are}} three career paths open and it is wise to excel at one of them: the first is to become an expert on some group of organisms that excites you…. Second, you could become very good at the most popular current techniques at the highest technical level <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine. In contrast, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> take the third, and most dangerous, path. <b>You</b> <b>can</b> strenuously <b>avoid</b> doing what everyone else is doing and search for new ideas and new tests for old ideas." [...] Larry Slobodkin followed, with intensity, that third and most perilous path.|$|R
50|$|On each {{floor of}} the building, the player must put out the flames and reach the panel that opens the doors to get back out. While doing so, there is a meter at the top showing {{how many people are}} on that floor. The longer it takes a player to open the doors and get out, the more the meter decreases. The object is to work as fast as <b>you</b> <b>can</b> while <b>avoiding</b> and putting out flames to open the doors and escape with the most people {{remaining}} on the meter. The game can be played by one or two players.|$|R
