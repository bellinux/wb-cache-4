5|$|I {{think when}} you name a record, {{you have to choose}} {{something}} which you feel reflects the record or that collection of songs. <b>You</b> <b>also</b> want to choose something that reflects not just the mood of the record, but the mood of the people who made it... the mood of those people when they recorded it, and there were quite a few things that sort of came up as ideas, but Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action seemed to sum it up best. It's probably the most positive record we've made, and the band have been, yeah, the most optimistic we've been since before we had any encounter with the music industry... probably because we've been sort of keeping a low profile for a while and not talking about ourselves too much.|$|E
25|$|I {{have removed}} Aspar and Ardaburius from this world, {{so that no}} one who might oppose me would survive. But <b>you</b> <b>also</b> must kill your {{son-in-law}} Ricimer, lest there be anyone who might betray you. Moreover, I also have sent the patrician Olybrius to you; I wish you to kill him, so that you might reign, ruling rather than serving others.|$|E
25|$|I Need <b>You</b> <b>also</b> {{peaked at}} number five on the year-end charts in Finnish Albums Chart, and {{thirteen}} on the Billboard Top Country Albums. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA {{as well the}} IFPI Denmark, the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the British Phonographic Industry and was certified Platinum by both Music Canada and the IFPI Finland.|$|E

25|$|In July 2013, Velocity {{introduced}} the Global Wallet function, {{which was the}} first prepaid traveller card in Australia. The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). <b>You</b> <b>also</b> earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. <b>You</b> <b>also</b> see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How wonderful that that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E
25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} hand you get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions <b>You</b> <b>also</b> race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E
6000|$|Gascoyne blew a long whistle. [...] "Beshrew me!" [...] quoth he, [...] "but methinks old Bruin is on thy {{side of the}} quarrel, Myles. An that be so, I am with <b>thee</b> <b>also,</b> {{and others}} that I can name as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ma foi! camarade, to {{the devil}} with the other six! That is enough {{for me and for}} <b>thee</b> <b>also.</b> I can see that they are very wise and {{discreet}} folk at Beaulieu. Ah! mon ange, what have you in the pipkin?" ...|$|R

500|$|According to General Sumihisa Ikeda and Admiral Zenshir≈ç Hoshina, Privy Council President Hiranuma {{then turned}} to the Emperor and asked him: [...] "Your majesty, <b>you</b> <b>also</b> bear {{responsibility}} (sekinin) for this defeat. What apology {{are you going to make}} to the heroic spirits of the imperial founder of your house and your other imperial ancestors?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{follow-up}} album, 1981's For Those About to Rock We Salute <b>You,</b> <b>also</b> sold {{well and}} was positively received by critics. The album featured {{two of the}} band's most popular singles: [...] "Let's Get It Up" [...] and the title track, [...] "For Those About to Rock", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, Flick of the Switch, {{in an effort to}} recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.|$|E
500|$|Dworkin [...] "was demonised {{not only}} by pornographers but by many liberals, whom she held in almost equal contempt", and [...] "while she was irritated by liberal feminists such as Naomi Wolf, she {{accepted}} that her views were not palatable to everyone. 'I have a really strong belief that any movement needs both radicals and liberals,' she explained. 'You always need women who can walk into the room in the right way, talk in the right tone of voice, {{who have access to}} power. But <b>you</b> <b>also</b> need a bottom line.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Gudruda spoke: [...] "Strange tales {{are told}} of thee and Eric, Groa's daughter! I {{have done with}} Eric, but I have done with <b>thee</b> <b>also.</b> Thou hast thrust thyself here against my will and, if I may, I would see thy face no more." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>You</b> can <b>also</b> {{interact}} with citizens {{by talking to}} them. <b>You</b> can <b>also</b> customize your character in many different items you can build that has the option to change your character. Unlike other games in The Sims franchise, your Sim does not have needs or wants.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} has also received some negative reception. In 2003, Nick Catucci of The Village Voice called her [...] "a woman carrying more emotional baggage than Witherspoon's Elle Woods has pink Gucci suitcases" [...] and stated, [...] "And Max's love interest? A contract killer who survived being {{shot in the}} head, and who <b>you</b> <b>also</b> play: Mona Sax. Who wrote this crap, Ed Wood?" [...] Tyler Wilde of GamesRadar ranked a cheat to undress Mona nude for her gameplay sections in Max Payne 2 as the fourth-rudest cheat in video games.|$|E
500|$|Duncan himself {{commented on}} his [...] "boring" [...] image, stating: [...] "If you show excitement, then <b>you</b> <b>also</b> may show {{disappointment}} or frustration. If your opponent picks {{up on this}} frustration, you are at a disadvantage." [...] Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented {{on his ability to}} relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents. Duncan has also stated that he especially likes his bank shot, saying: [...] "It is just easy for me. It just feels good." [...] Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has been described as [...] "the greatest love story in sports".|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} soundtrack for Watchmen, {{director}} Zack Snyder {{decided to go}} with covers instead of original songs, saying [...] "If you go with the original song, you just get the moment. But if you go with covers <b>you</b> <b>also</b> {{get all of the}} baggage you bring to it, [...] I like the baggage. It kind of resonates and rings across time, it's not just of the moment." [...] The soundtrack was produced by composer Tyler Bates and musical producer Marius de Vries. While Bates' job was initially only writing a musical score and helping the song transitions, the composer ended working closely with de Vries as [...] "the songs and the score just began bleeding into one another" [...] - the only track in which de Vries worked alone was the remix of [...] "Army of Me".|$|E
6000|$|... "It was no dream, Eric, {{and ever}} I doubt me of Swanhild, for I think she loves <b>thee</b> <b>also,</b> {{and she is}} fair and my enemy," [...] says Gudruda, laying her snow-cold lips on his lips. [...] "Oh, Eric, awake! awake! See, the snow is done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy memory {{shall be}} preserved," [...] he said, [...] "while {{fidelity}} and affection have honour upon earth! But that I trust I shall find {{the means of}} saving Rowena, and thee, Athelstane, and <b>thee,</b> <b>also,</b> my poor Wamba, thou shouldst not overbear me in this matter." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Michael Schumacher revealed that he took a cautious approach when the track became slippery due to rain in the second stint. He also added his team made adjustments during the first stop which helped to contribute to his quick pace. H√§kkinen congratulated Michael Schumacher on clinching the Drivers' Championship and said that although he felt naturally disappointed, he admitted that [...] "to be a good winner, sometimes <b>you</b> <b>also</b> {{have to be a}} good loser". He also confirmed that Ferrari's strategy lost him the chance of victory and acknowledged that Schumacher was at an advantage after his second pit stop. Coulthard described his race as [...] "quiet" [...] {{because of the lack of}} action he encountered. He also admitted that he struggled to handle the car in the wet conditions.|$|E
500|$|Kingdom Hearts {{features}} {{a mixture of}} familiar Disney, Pixar and Square Enix characters, {{as well as several}} new characters designed and created by Nomura. In addition to original locations, the Kingdom Hearts series features many worlds from Disney films. [...] Sora must visit these worlds and interact with various Disney characters to protect them from enemies. Often, his actions in these worlds closely follow the storylines of their respective Disney films. The main characters try not to interfere with the affairs of other worlds, as it could negatively affect the universe's order. Moogles, small creatures from the Final Fantasy series, are another common element in the games. They provide the player with a synthesis shop in order to create and purchase items used in the game. The main cast from The World Ends with <b>You</b> <b>also</b> makes an appearance in the series in Dream Drop Distance, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts III will feature characters from Pixar's Toy Story series.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Broderick {{provided}} the speaking voice of Adult Simba. [...] The first actor {{to be assigned}} to The Lion King, Broderick learned of the role {{while he was on}} vacation in Ireland, where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba. At the time, Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). [...] The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role; according to producer Don Hahn, Broderick's voice resembled [...] "the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable, but <b>you</b> <b>also</b> felt that he could come back in a very heroic way." [...] Jonathan Taylor Thomas, who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time, was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba. [...] His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn.|$|E

6000|$|... "I hear thee, Ayesha," [...] {{answered}} Leo, [...] "but, of a truth--I am no coward--but I doubt {{me of that}} raging flame. How know I that it {{will not}} utterly destroy me, so that I lose myself and lose <b>thee</b> <b>also?</b> Nevertheless will I do it," [...] he added.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Crosby {{insisted upon}} the {{inclusion}} of the contentious track [...] "Mind Gardens", which was disliked by the other band members and derided by McGuinn as having no [...] "rhythm, meter, or rhyme". [...] In conversation with Byrds biographer Johnny Rogan in 1980, Crosby defended the song by stating [...] "it was unusual and not everybody could understand it because they'd never heard anything like it before. At that time everything was supposed to have rhyme and have rhythm. And it neither rhymed nor had rhythm, so it was outside of their experience. It was just a little story and what it said was true ... if you build walls around your mind to keep out the abuse and harshness of life and the pain, then <b>you</b> <b>also</b> shut out the joy and the love." [...] Although [...] "Mind Gardens" [...] is often dismissed by critics and fans for being self-indulgent, Rogan has noted that its raga rock ambiance, symbolic lyrics and attractive backwards guitar effects capture the Byrds at their most creatively ambitious.|$|E
500|$|On January 22, 2014, and {{initially}} reported by media outlets the day before, Dunderdale {{announced that she}} would be resigning as Premier on January 24, 2014. In her speech Dunderdale stated [...] "Just as you know when it's time to step up, <b>you</b> <b>also</b> know when it is time to step back, and that time for me is now." [...] The announcement followed the defection of PC MHA Paul Lane to the Liberal Party, and months of poor performance in opinion polls. Dunderdale's Finance Minister Tom Marshall was sworn in [...] as premier and became the interim party leader on January 24. [...] Marshall will hold the post until the PC Party selects a permanent leader. On February 28, 2014, Dunderdale sent out a news releasing announcing she was resigning as the MHA for Virginia Water {{by the end of the}} day, ending a ten and a half year career in provincial politics. She subsequently returned to community work gaining employment with Gathering Place as their volunteer coordinator.|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. spent $100million {{marketing}} the film. Although Inception {{was not part}} of an existing franchise, Sue Kroll, president of Warner's worldwide marketing, said the company believed it could gain awareness due to the strength of [...] "Christopher Nolan as a brand". Kroll declared that [...] "We don't have the brand equity that usually drives a big summer opening, but we have a great cast and a fresh idea from a filmmaker with a track record of making incredible movies. If you can't make those elements work, it's a sad day." [...] The studio also tried to maintain a campaign of secrecy‚Äîas reported by the Senior VP of Interactive Marketing, Michael Tritter, [...] "You have this movie which {{is going to have a}} pretty big built in fanbase... but <b>you</b> <b>also</b> have a movie that you are trying to keep very secret. Chris [...] really likes people to see his movies in a theater and not see it all beforehand so everything that you do to market that‚Äîat least early on‚Äîis with an eye to feeding the interest to fans." ...|$|E
