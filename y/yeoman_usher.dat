5|$|The {{office of}} Register {{has been held}} by the Dean of Windsor since 1558. The Garter Principal King of Arms is ex officio the senior officer of the College of Arms (the heraldic {{authority}} of England), and is usually appointed from among the other officers of arms at the College. As the title suggests, Garter Principal King of Arms has specific duties as the Order's officer of arms, attending to the companions' crests and banners of arms, which are exhibited in the chapel. The Secretary, who acts as deputy to Garter in the ceremonial aspects of the Order, has since 1952 also been selected from the other officers of the College of Arms. The office of Usher is held by the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, {{who is also the}} Serjeant-at-Arms of the United Kingdom House of Lords (although his functions are more often performed there by his deputy, the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher).</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{equivalent}} {{officer for}} the House of Lords is the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod; there was formerly a separate Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords, but the two appointments were merged in 1971 (since when the mace has routinely been carried by Black Rod's deputy, the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher).</b>|$|E

50|$|Black Rod is {{in theory}} {{responsible}} for carrying the Mace {{into and out}} of the chamber for the Speaker of the House of Lords (formerly the Lord Chancellor, now the Lord Speaker), though this role is delegated to the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher</b> and Deputy Serjeant-at-Arms, or on judicial occasions, to the Lord Speaker's deputy, the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. The mace was introduced in 1876.|$|E
50|$|Black Rod is {{formally}} {{appointed by}} the Crown based on a recruitment search performed by the Clerk of the Parliaments, to whom he reports. Prior to 2002 the office rotated among retired senior officers from the Royal Navy, the British Army and the Royal Air Force. It is now advertised openly. Black Rod is {{an officer of the}} English Order of the Garter, and is usually appointed Knight Bachelor if not already knighted. His deputy is the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher</b> of the Black Rod.|$|E

50|$|The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is also {{an officer}} of the House; he takes his title from the symbol of his office, a black rod. Black Rod (as the Gentleman Usher is {{normally}} known) is responsible for ceremonial arrangements, {{is in charge of the}} House's doorkeepers, and may (upon the order of the House) take action to end disorder or disturbance in the Chamber. Black Rod also holds the office of Serjeant-at-Arms of the House of Lords, and in this capacity attends upon the Lord Speaker. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod's duties may be delegated to the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher</b> of the Black Rod or to the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms.|$|E

50|$|He is responsible, as the {{representative}} of the Administration and Works Committee, for maintaining the buildings and services of the Palace of Westminster. Previous responsibilities for security have been passed to the Parliamentary Security Director. Black Rod's official duties also include responsibility as the usher and doorkeeper at meetings of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; the personal attendant of the Sovereign in the Lords; as secretary to the Lord Great Chamberlain and as the Serjeant-at-Arms and Keeper of the Doors of the House, in charge of the admission of strangers to the House of Lords. Either Black Rod or his deputy, the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher,</b> is required to be present when the House of Lords, the upper house of Parliament, is in session, and plays a role in the introduction of all new Lords Temporal in the House (but not of bishops as new Lords Spiritual). Black Rod also arrests any Lord guilty of breach of privilege or other Parliamentary offence, such as contempt or disorder, or the disturbance of the House's proceedings. His equivalent in the House of Commons is the Serjeant at Arms.|$|E
5000|$|There are 10 large silver-gilt maces of the sergeants-at-arms kept {{as part of}} the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House at the Tower of London. Two {{date from}} the reign of Charles II, two from the reign of James II, three from William III and Mary II's reign, and one from Queen Anne's reign (the royal cypher of George I has been added to the latter). All these are of a type almost universally adopted, with slight variations, at the Restoration. Each mace weighs an average of 10 kg. In the Houses of Parliament, two {{ceremonial}} maces represent the monarch's authority. The monarch {{is referred to as the}} [...] "third part of Parliament" [...] and signs into law the Bills which are voted on and passed in Parliament. Parliament cannot lawfully meet without the Mace, representing the monarch's authority, being present in the chambers. The maces are carried into, and out of, the two chambers in procession at the beginning and end of each day. The House of Lords has two maces, one of which is carried by the <b>Yeoman</b> <b>Usher</b> of the Black Rod and placed behind the Lord Speaker on the Woolsack when the House is sitting. In the House of Commons, a mace, carried by the Serjeant-at-Arms, is placed on brackets at the end of the Table of the House in front of the Speaker. When the Commons sits as a Committee of the Whole House, or when Finance Bills are discussed, the Mace sits under the table. Two maces from the Jewel House are carried in the royal procession at State Openings of Parliament and at coronations.|$|E
