However, some listeners have claimed that the album was recorded by the trio of Smith, Youngs and Neilson, with Youngs' voice being identified on some tracks.|$|E

I guess it is like climbing the highest peak on your first climb - where do <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> there, where is the next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to guide them through that sort of stuff.|$|E
25|$|He {{compiled}} an eight-volume Geographia covering {{what was}} known about the earth. The {{first part of the}} Geographia is a discussion of the data and of the methods he used. As with the model of the solar system in the Almagest, Ptolemy put all this information into a grand scheme. He assigned coordinates to all the places and geographic features he knew, in a grid that spanned the globe (although most of this has been lost). Latitude was measured from the equator, as it is today, but Ptolemy preferred to express it as the length of the longest day rather than degrees of arc (the length of the midsummer day increases from 12h to 24h as <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> the equator to the polar circle). He put the meridian of 0 longitude at the most western land he knew, the Canary Islands.|$|E

500|$|Several {{reviews of}} 2011's A Dance with Dragons noted {{the return to}} the {{narrative}} of Jon, Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, the three popular characters whom fans had missed most from the previous volume, A Feast for Crows. These [...] "favorites" [...] had last been featured 11 years before in Martin's A Storm of Swords. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon's leadership of the Night's Watch is complicated by several unprecedented challenges, including a wildling alliance, the demands of would-be-king Stannis Baratheon and the conflicting factions developing within the Watch itself. The New York Times notes that [...] "Jon’s leadership is the best hope of Westeros, so naturally he’s in imminent danger throughout A Dance With Dragons." [...] James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Jon's final chapter in A Dance with Dragons [...] "a harsh chapter in terms of fan expectations. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> this total high of Jon giving this rousing speech about going after the evil Ramsay Bolton, to this utter low of his men turning against him." [...] Jon's presence in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter is uncertain.|$|E
500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. <b>You</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth the buzz of a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|E

2500|$|The T0 axiom {{is special}} {{in that it}} can be not only added to a {{property}} (so that completely regular plus T0 is Tychonoff) but also subtracted from a property (so that Hausdorff minus T0 is R1), in a fairly precise sense; see Kolmogorov quotient for more information. When applied to the separation axioms, this leads to the relationships in the table to the left below. In this table, <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> the right side to the left side by adding the requirement of T0, and <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> the left side to the right side by removing that requirement, using the Kolmogorov quotient operation.
