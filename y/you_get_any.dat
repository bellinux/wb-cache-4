500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at it now and recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E
500|$|Momolo Mortara {{followed}} the Italian Army into Rome hoping to finally reclaim his son. According to some accounts, he {{was preceded by}} his son Riccardo, Edgardo's elder brother, who had entered the kingdom's service as an infantry officer. Riccardo Mortara fought his way to San Pietro in Vincoli and found his brother's convent room. Edgardo covered his eyes, raised his {{hand in front of}} him and shouted: [...] "Get back, Satan!" [...] When Riccardo said that he was his brother, Edgardo replied: [...] "Before <b>you</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> closer to me, take off that assassin's uniform." [...] Whatever the truth, what is certain is that Edgardo reacted to the capture of Rome with intense panic. He later wrote: [...] "After the Piedmontese troops entered Rome... they used their force to seize the neophyte Coen from the Collegio degli Scolopi, [...] turned toward San Pietro in Vincoli to try to kidnap me as well." [...] The Roman chief of police asked Edgardo to return to his family to appease public opinion, but he refused. He subsequently met the Italian commander, General Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora, who told him that as he was 19 years old he could do as he wished. Edgardo was smuggled out of Rome by train along with a priest on 22 October 1870, late at night and in lay clothes. He made his way north and escaped to Austria.|$|E
