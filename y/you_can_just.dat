In a video posted by Revolt, Combs urged viewers to see 12 Years a Slave by stating: [...] "This movie is very painful but very honest, {{and is a}} part of the healing process.

500|$|Reflecting on Australia's {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, {{and the spread of}} communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. [...] "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, [...] "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict [...] "unless you are prepared to win", because it was [...] "not something that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> put one foot in and feel the temperature".|$|E

[...] Jack also explained that they aspired to invoke an innocent childishness without any intention of irony or humor.

And the director, Guggenheim, wanted to have – sort of give people a little break {{every once in a while}} and say, okay, you don't have to absorb this information, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> sort of – and it was more the personal side of Al Gore's life or how it connected to the theme of the film. And that's when there's music." ...|$|E

Hopsin {{clarified}} his statements {{in an interview}} with HipHopDX saying he had no ill feelings towards Kendrick Lamar, and that he dissed West because he disliked his new music. [...] "Tears to Snow" [...] is an emotional song about him and his ex-girlfriend having relationship issues and breaking up. In the song he explains how she would assume he would cheat on her. The second verse is also partly about how Hopsin's former colleagues have changed and turned against him.

500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you.

Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{took place}} at the following studios in California: Brillian Studios and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco; Coda Studios and Grass Roots Studios in Oakland; Encore Studios, Image Recording, and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles; and Pookie Labs and Woodshed Studios in Sacramento. Tony! Toni! Toné! used vintage recording equipment and, for certain tracks, a 40-piece orchestra. Some tracks featured guest musicians, including rapper and producer DJ Quik, percussionist SheilaE., and the Tower of Power horn section. Saadiq worked with DJ Quik on the song [...] "Let's Get Down" [...] and said the collaboration proved very [...] "natural" [...] because of the producer's affinity for funk music. Tony! Toni! Toné! intended recording the album with an emphasis on musicianship rather than production flair. Wiggins felt that the absence of their once prominent synthesizers made the resulting music sound more distinctive. [...] "On a lot of the songs, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> imagine a five-piece band performing", he later told USA Today.|$|E
500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those things really distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V.

[...] He ultimately gave the episode a C-. TV Squad writer Joel Keller wrote that while [...] "the episode did have its funny moments", [...] "overall, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> feel that the show has changed in a very fundamental way". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix criticized the writers for still not finding Deangelo's character out commenting that [...] "the fact that the writers so clearly {{had no idea what to}} do with Ferrell doesn't fill me with confidence for whatever guest stars turn up in the final episodes – nor do I feel especially great right now about the idea of an outside character coming in as the permanent new regional manager." ...|$|E

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> play." ...|$|E
500|$|Malicious rumours {{concerning}} Wenger's {{private life}} surfaced during November 1996, {{to the extent}} the City of London reported that his exit from Arsenal was imminent. Having returned {{from a trip to}} Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: [...] "If something comes out that is wrong, I will attack. It is a serious matter if <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> create things that are not right." [...] Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference – the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the more}} {{prominent}} aspects of Nikita's character development {{since the beginning of}} the series is her relationship with Michael, and has been dubbed by fans as [...] "Mikita". Unlike other works on film and television, Silverstein did not play the traditional [...] "Will They/Won't They?" [...] game between the two characters. Co-star Shane West stated [...] "It's not hard to bring Michael and Nikita together," [...] but it is [...] "really hard to keep them apart...We're barely into the season yet, so why not keep teasing?" [...] When the first season started airing, West also expected that their romance would come, citing Michael and Nikita's past relationship while she was working with Division. Now that the two are together by the end of the first season, in the second season Silverstein wanted something to happen to get in their way, saying that no new tension would make the relationship boring, adding [...] "I don't think <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> have them happy and in love, kicking ass together forever." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} films were highly praised {{due to their}} [...] tone. However, when {{director}} Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt [...] "Singer's sensitivity to [...] made the first two X-Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups." [...] James Berardinelli felt, [...] "X-Men: The Last Stand isn't as taut or satisfying as X-Men 2, but it's better constructed and better paced than the original X-Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, {{there seems to be}} a single vision." [...] David Denby of The New Yorker praised [...] "the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work", but called Ratner's film [...] "a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes." [...] Singer's third film in the series, X-Men: Days of Future Past was also highly praised. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that [...] "Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down".|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot {{involved}} {{the death of}} former boss Ed Truck, a character who had been played by Ken Howard in the second-season episode [...] "The Carpet". As part of the episode took place outdoors, the cast had to wear coats despite the hot summer weather. Actress Kate Flannery commented in a weekly blog she wrote for TV Guide that [...] "we suffered while shooting the outdoor scenes... We had to act like it was cold when it was warm. For hours and hours. You would never know it by looking at us. Isn't that crazy?" [...] Flannery also wrote, [...] "I love this episode because it's dark, for a comedy. This time The Office tackles gutsy subject matter." [...] In her memoir Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?, Mindy Kaling wrote that the episode resulted in the worst disagreement she ever had during her years on the show, where she and Greg Daniels, normally a [...] "very nice" [...] person, disagreed on a story point {{to the extent that}} Daniels told her that if [...] "you [...] going to resist what I'm doing here, <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> go home." [...] Kaling briefly left the set before returning, with no further problems or repercussions noted.|$|E
500|$|In March 2016, Marvel {{revealed}} which characters {{will appear}} on the opposing factions. They also revealed two spin-off series: Civil War II: Spider-Man from writer Christos Gage and artist Travel Foreman, and [...] Civil War II: X-Men from writer Cullen Bunn and artist Andrea Broccardo. Bunn explained, [...] "This tale is set into motion by the same catalyst that sets 'Civil War II' into motion. A new power emerges among the Inhumans. This power, in Magneto's eyes, could be very dangerous to the mutant population, so—in typical Master of Magnetism fashion—he decides to take it for himself. As you can imagine, something like that could very easily start a war between the Inhumans and the mutants. Storm sees this and decides to stand in Magneto's way." [...] In Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man, Spider-Man helps a precognitive Inhuman use his powers responsibly. [...] "Over the course of the miniseries, the Inhuman will make a prediction that, while not of the world-or universe-ending variety, could well mean the end of one character's world. It's really dealing with classic Spider-Man themes: power and responsibility; facing a situation where even if you win, you can also lose -- or <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> lose," [...] Gage elborated.|$|E
