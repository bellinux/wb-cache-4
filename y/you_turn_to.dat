2500|$|Prayer 17, Avodah. asks God {{to restore}} the Temple services, build a Third Temple, and restore {{sacrificial}} worship. The concluding meditation ends with an additional prayer {{for the restoration of}} Temple worship. Both prayers have been modified within the siddur of Conservative Judaism, so that although they still ask for the restoration of the Temple, they remove the explicit plea for the resumption of sacrifices. (Some Conservative congregations remove the concluding silent prayer for the Temple entirely.) The Reform siddur also modifies this prayer, eliminating all reference to the Temple service and replacing the request for the restoration of the Temple with [...] "God who is near to all who call upon <b>you,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> your servants and be gracious to us; pour your spirit upon us." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his work}} in the FSB Litvinenko {{discovered}} numerous connections between top brass of Russian law enforcement agencies and Russian mafia groups, such as Solntsevo gang. He wrote a memorandum about that to Boris Yeltsin. Berezovsky arranged a meeting for him with FSB director Mikhail Barsukov and Deputy Director of Internal affairs Ovchinnikov to discuss the corruption problems; however, this had no effect. Litvinenko gradually realized that the entire system was corrupted from the top to the bottom. He explained: [...] "If your partner bilked you, or a creditor did not pay, or a supplier did not deliver - where did <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> complain? ...When force became a commodity, there was always demand for it. [...] "Roofs" [...] appeared, people who sheltered and protected your business. First it was provided by the mob, then by police, and soon even our own guys realized what was what, and then the rivalry began among gangsters, cops, and the Agency for market share. As the police and the FSB became more competitive, they squeezed the gangs out of the market. But in many cases competition gave way to cooperation, and the services became gangsters themselves." [...] According to US diplomats, Litvinenko coined the phrase Mafia state.|$|E
