500|$|Other critics voiced more {{negative}} {{opinions of the}} track. Richard S. He of The Guardian heard [...] "zero pitch correction on her vocal", and criticized this decision by adding that [...] "Gaga wants <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the blue notes, the cracks in her voice. Unfortunately the cracks are all you hear." [...] Spin referred to the single as a [...] "swing and a miss". USA Today likened the track to Gaga's past work and said, [...] "While not perfect, it's buoyant and fun enough, we suppose. Just not groundbreaking." [...] Pitchforks Jillian Mapes felt that [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] did {{not live up to}} its significant anticipation, criticizing the song's production and Gaga's vocal performance. While ranking Lady Gaga's lead singles from worst to best, Billboard listed [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] as second-worst, ahead of only [...] "Applause" [...] (2013). Rolling Stone ranked it number 28 on their Best Songs of 2016 list, stating, [...] "Gaga fuses her neo-folkie Lilith-hippie mode with her disco roots in this Mark Ronson-produced dance-floor confession." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey then {{opted to}} record a new album, that would be {{released}} {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album. She explained how plans for a ballad to be released were put on hold, because a new song she had written [...] "needed to be heard". On June 9, 2009, she wrote on her official Twitter account: [...] "Seriously, {{this is one of my}} favorite songs ever. I love the whole album. I'm completely immersed in it. I can't wait for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> it", and announced its title as [...] "Obsessed". Later that week, The-Dream, who co-wrote the song with Carey, claimed that the song was definitely aimed at someone in particular, and that it would upset them greatly. The song was transmitted digitally to radio stations on June 16, 2009 for immediate airplay and made its debut on Chicago radio station B96 at 2:00 pm. An official remix of the song, featuring rapper Gucci Mane, premiered on the same day.|$|E

2500|$|As {{established}} and successful songwriters Flanders and Swann {{were invited to}} lecture on their craft at Dartington International Summer School [...] in 1956. Flanders found that his spoken introductions were as well received by the audience as the songs themselves. He and Swann decided to give a show along similar lines in London. They took the New Lindsey Theatre for a limited three-week run; the New Lindsey, holding about 150 people, was situated outside the London West End theatre district. The show opened on 31 December 1956. The press notices were good, the box-office did excellent business, and the pair were offered a West End transfer. Swann recalled in 1977, [...] "We turned it down unanimously. It seemed to spell the end of Michael's radio career (he had by that time done at least a thousand broadcasts) {{and the end of}} Swann as composer." [...] After each had spent two or three sleepless nights worrying, they reconsidered; the show transferred to the Fortune Theatre in Covent Garden on 24 January 1957, where, according to The Times, [...] "it took the audience by storm". The critic J. C. Trewin wrote, [...] "I feel that even [...] Gilbert might have applauded the intricate neatness of their numbers. … I urge <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Mr Flanders as he explains the precise derivation of 'Greensleeves'." [...] The show ran for 808 performances at the Fortune, until 2 May 1959.|$|E
2500|$|Love? {{follows the}} {{footsteps}} of her least commercially successful album, Brave (2007), which just missed the top ten of the US Billboard 200, at position 12. Its beginnings date from late 2007 and early 2008, during Lopez's pregnancy with twins Emme and Max. While pregnant, and while at home after pregnancy, Lopez {{had been working on}} new music for future projects. In February 2009, a new song from those recording sessions titled [...] "Hooked on You" [...] leaked online. Lopez would address the leak on her official website in May 2009, where she said [...] "I'm always excited about my music and this [...] is one of a few tracks I'm currently working on. I'm flattered by everyone's interest in the track and really excited for <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the real thing..." [...] Songwriter Wynter Gordon also addressed another leak from the album, a song that Gordon wrote called [...] "What Is Love". In a personal blog through her official MySpace page, Gordon expressed her discontent that an unfinished, unmastered version of [...] "What Is Love" [...] had been leaked through the Internet. [...] "I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart. If the world was gonna hear it, I wanted them to hear it right... It's as good as gone to me now... The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie... sad." [...] Gordon did note that she was dissatisfied with the circumstances but was in [...] "no way dissing Lopez." [...] The following month Lopez told MTV's Larry Carol that she was keen to finish the album and several singles, with a potential release date for the end of 2009.|$|E
